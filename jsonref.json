They have tremendous loyalty to both parents and learn early on to navigate between the two camps.They hate to hear their parents slagging off each other and generally decide that total discretion is the wisest modus vivendi – rarely telling one parent anything about their time with the other.I remember freaking out when I learnt, through a third party, that my son Sam, then six years old, had slept in his father’s Majorcan bar during his stay with him. But Sam never mentioned it to me, nor seemed particularly put out when I raised the topic.Children are very accepting of each parent’s character and, as they grow up, instinctively understand their respective strengths and weaknesses.There have been countless times when, annoyed as I may have been with my ex, I have known that he would have a better take than me on one of our child’s worries. At moments like this, shared responsibility is a relief.Divorced parenting is never easy but the best thing you can do for your kids is to try to ensure they have an equally strong relationship with both parents. This is far more likely to be achieved if their custody isn’t entrusted to only one – and they aren’t fought over like a property portfolio.Christmas cookies make me crumbleThe Christmas Lakeland catalogue arrived this week, triggering my first bout of seasonal low self-esteem.The pages are filled with products for the kind of festive home that I have never achieved.Are there really people who whip up gingerbread Christmas trees and Nutcracker soldier cookies?

As a country we need to be thinking big and flaunting every asset we have. Pomp and pageantry is one of our star turns, and nobody ever turns down an invitation to Buckingham Palace, nor I bet, would they to Britannia 2.Industrialists love a yacht, and a floating Royal conference room advertising the attractions of doing business with Britain would easily repay the £60 million a new vessel would apparently cost. Especially if it were William, Harry and their attractive families on deck – rather than Air Miles Andy.Oh brother, that was a £200m mistakeIt’s often said that you only need one good idea to make your fortune. The trick is to recognise it.Many years back my younger brother was working as art director on what was then Harpers \u0026amp Queen magazine when the junior beauty editor approached him to ask for his advice.She said she felt stuck in her job and was thinking of leaving to start up a mail-order company selling white sheets and pillow cases.His reply? ‘That’s the nuttiest idea I’ve ever heard.

But they are having to do it without Posh Spice, who has refused to join in. And no wonder. For Victoria Beckham those takings are chicken feed, and why would she want to revisit the past? There comes a point where a Wannabe becomes a Hasbeen.When I interviewed Victoria in 2008 for her first Vogue cover story, she was performing in the last Spice Girls tour.She invited me and my family to come to the show and welcomed us into her dressing room where, as David fixated on his phone, she was done up in full Posh regalia – squeezed into a shiny bronze catsuit, caked in fake tan with a stiff helmet of hair gel and tottering around in platform shoes that make her normal stilettos look like comfy slippers. Ten years later her world has moved on and she is now a sophisticated fashion designer whose every public appearance is an advert for her business.Any hint of a latex catsuit could kill that hard-won brand image stone dead.

Personally, I’m all for women being able to wear as little or as much as they are comfortable in and have no problem mixing a sequined thong with feminism.But where I do get confused is how the girls expect men to react to them in these overtly sexual costumes. Modern-day feminism is all about escaping from the tyranny and subjugation of the ‘male gaze’, so this seems a funny way to go about it."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/24/13/4F5AAA6500000578-6094149-Joel_Urhie_was_found_dead_inside_the_burnt_out_shell_of_his_fami-a-66_1535112527750.jpg","title":"France calls Europe Empire rival China US","story":"    Economics and Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire (right with EU President Jean-Claude Juncker) said the EU must project its power around the globe to promote peace and protect the environmentAsked why he used the controversial word empire, Mr Le Maire clarified: \u0027Do not get me wrong, I\u0027m talking about a peaceful empire that\u0027s a constitutional state.

Mr Clark survived but Father Mullan died from \u0027multiple lacerations to the chest and abdomen\u0027\u0027. Another man died of a heart attack following an alleged violent confrontation with the troops in the west Belfast estate.The shootings took place as the Army moved in to republican strongholds to arrest IRA suspects in the wake of the introduction by the Stormont administration of the controversial policy of internment without trial.

Bottom row: Joan Connolly, John McKerr, Noel Philips, John Laverty and Joseph MurphyMr Doran told Coroner Mrs Justice Keegan that the deaths followed a period of civil unrest across Belfast and Northern Ireland following the introduction of internment in the early hours of August 9, 1971 which was codenamed Operation Demetrius.The inquest heard that the then Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, Brian Faulkner, met with the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Ted Heath and a number of his ministers, on August 5, 1971 to inform him that he was introducing internment under the Special Powers Act of 1922.During the meeting, Mr Heath is said to have told Mr Faulkner that he would provide the appropriate \u0027military support\u0027 for Operation Demetrius which was to arrest paramilitary suspects and detain them without trial.\u0027The operation commenced at 4 am on August 9, 1971 and involved large numbers of British soldiers going directly to the homes of those targeted and to carry out arrests,\u0027 said Mr Doran.Those arrested were subsequently taken to a holding centre in Girdrwood Barracks across the city in North Belfast.          The inquests were ordered after the original ones were deemed inadequate. Pictured: Father Mullan in an undated photo The QC said that following the large scale arrests, there was \u0027widespread civil disorder and rioting across Belfast and Northern Ireland\u0027\u0027.Mr Doran said the court will examine a period of time in Belfast when there were approximately 12 explosions, 59 shootings, 17 deaths, 25 injuries, 13 rioting incidents, 18 arson attacks and numerous reports of civil disorder.\u0027When examining the deaths through a forensic lens we ought not to lose sight of the context of when these deaths occurred,\u0027 he said.\u0027That is not to say however that the context provide shield or buffer against scrutiny.\u0027The families of the ten victims who were killed in 1971 gathered outside Laganside Court in Belfast ahead of the inquests.Family members held pictures of the victims and banners calling for justice.Political representatives from Sinn Fein, the SDLP, People Before Profit and Alliance also attended.John Teggart, whose father Daniel was one of those killed, said before court: \u0027It\u0027s mixed emotions going into court today but the determination of the families to get to the truth has brought us to here.\u0027Solicitor Padraig O\u0027Muirigh, who represents some of the families, added: \u0027Today, 47 years after these families lost their loved ones, 46 years after the original inquest, seven years after the direction for a new inquest, we are finally here.\u0027It\u0027s a tribute to the adversity and resilience of these brave families, so I want to commend them through all the difficult days.\u0027Hopefully this is a new start of a process to find out what happened to their loved ones.          The shootings happened after the Army moved into Republican areas to arrest IRA suspects, sparking rioting. Father Hugh Mullan, a Catholic priest, was among those killed.

On Monday, Moon tweeted that one of the dogs, named Gomi, gave birth to six healthy puppies last Friday.\u0027Six dogs were added to a gift of two dogs.

They plan to jointly verify the results in December.The September deal also contained an agreement to create buffer zones along their land and sea boundaries and a no-fly zone above the border, which took effect on November 1.The Koreas and the U.S.-led U.N. Command recently finished removing firearms and troops from a jointly controlled area at the border village of Panmunjom and eventually plan to allow tourists to freely move around there.The two countries have also been clearing mines from front-line areas and plan to start in April their first-ever joint search for remains of soldiers killed during the Korean War.While their militaries move ahead with tension-reducing steps, President Moon is otherwise running out of goodwill gestures toward North Korea, which is under heavy U.S.-led sanctions over its nuclear weapons program. Unless the sanctions are lifted, it would be impossible for Moon to push ahead with his more ambitious plans for engagement, such as reconnecting railways and roads across the border and normalizing operations at a jointly-run factory park.After a provocative series of nuclear and missile tests North Korea entered talks with the United States and South Korea this year.The north has since taken measures such as dismantling its nuclear test site and parts of its rocket-engine testing facility.Now, Pyongyang insists that sanctions should be removed before there is any further progress in negotiations. Washington, however, says they will remain until the North takes more concrete steps toward the irreversible and verifiable removal of its nuclear weapons. Analysts say the discord may have caused the last-minute cancellation of a meeting between U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and his North Korean counterpart, Kim Yong Chol, that had been scheduled for this past Thursday.  The two were due to discuss denuclearization issues and had planned to set up a second summit between Kim Jong Un and President Donald Trump.

There will also be printed flyers and posters, video, and in some rooms thumping electro hip-hop.“We are really aiming to bring to life the cultural energy and edginess of 1980s New York City,” said the show’s curator, Darren Pih.Haring was born in rural Pennsylvania in 1958 and moved to New York aged 20, becoming part of the street art scene. He was friends with figures such as Andy Warhol, Jean-Michel Basquiat, Madonna and Grace Jones.He is best known for the recognisable visual motifs he created – crawling babies, barking dogs and flying saucers – as well as his political activism.Haring contributed to nuclear disarmament campaigns, designed anti-apartheid posters, and created the famous Crack Is Wack mural in Harlem. As a gay man, his work as an Aids activist and educator is seen as one of his lasting legacies and the Liverpool show will highlight his activism through pieces including his 1989 poster Ignorance  Fear.Haring’s career was brief. He died from Aids-related complications on 16 February 1990. |The Keith Haring Foundation has been working closely with Tate Liverpool on the 2019 show.Helen Legg, the director of Tate Liverpool, said the city and the artist had much in common. “They’re both politically engaged with a history of activism, a strong sense of social justice and a love of music and fashion.“Tate Liverpool is proud to be bringing this major exhibition and reassessment of Keith Haring to the city.”She said Haring’s activism and political engagement made the timing of the UK show particularly relevant. “Life and art really do walk a tightrope in Keith Haring’s work. He wanted to collapse distinctions between high and low and for his work to reach a really wide audience beyond the gallery.”Pih said the exhibition would give a more “nuanced and complex” picture of Haring than is sometimes presented. Haring was both accessible and sophisticated, he said. “His popular reach doesn’t undermine his position as one of the most significant cultural figures and artists of the late 20th century.”• Keith Haring is at Tate Liverpool from 14 June to 10 November 2019.

As the musician revealed last week, he went instead to Cambridge University, where his proposal was taken up. This was simply a mistake by Oxford, I am sure, and not necessarily evidence of malice an error of this sort might be OK, generally, if it was unique. But it isn’t. In my experiences as a student, and now a student union leader on access, it has become clear to me that Oxford has a widespread problem with recognising talent if it doesn’t come in lily-white packaging.The problems start long before students even get to the university. It is no secret that, at Oxford, applicants from ethnic minorities are less likely to get a place than white applicants. The university has lots of excuses for this: black and minority-ethnic students apply to more competitive courses (true) or inequalities in the British education system start much earlier (also true).I don’t for a second think this is because the Oxford admissions system is filled with racists. Its outreach and widening participation teams work incredibly hard with hundreds of student volunteers. But I think the admissions data does clearly show that this university is poor at recognising academic potential, especially from Asian students, even when it is staring them in the face in the form of great A-level grades.A recent internal report from the university counts up the number of applicants in the past few years whom Oxford rejected and who went on to exceed the minimum A-level offer by more than two grades. This number was in the hundreds, and a disproportionate number weren’t white.Once an ethnic-minority student like me is on a course, and setting aside for a minute the everyday racism they might experience, the university does not get any better at recognising their achievements. Oxford, like a lot of universities around the UK, has a huge degree-awarding gap between white students and those from ethnic minorities. After Stormzy’s scholarship for black British students was announced at Cambridge in August, it would have been smart for Oxford to have tried to copy it anyway. It’s true that some efforts were made – the humanities ision is planning scholarships for ethnic-minority postgraduates. But it is a sign of complacency that funding something big for this group of students was not a major project at the university in the summer. Oxford alumni often go on to make a lot of money in many different areas, and Stormzy is not the only rich person of colour who might have been willing to help out.Receiving money for scholarships would hardly break new ground at Oxford. This is a university where some scholarships are open to only those who have attended certain prestigious private schools, funded by wealthy (often white) donors. Let’s not kid ourselves that the university would miss out so easily on donations from people in fields it recognises more readily than it does grime music.Ultimately, this issue isn’t about Stormzy and his two proposed scholarships. It’s about recognising the talent of all prospective and current students, whatever their colour or background.• Lucas Bertholdi-Saad is the Oxford University Student Union vice-president for access and academic affairs"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90489958075f289adc841cbd028eb6b9bf6c33c2/2_0_3031_1819/master/3031.jpg?width=940\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=ae8177ab86f1be5dfbd2c76d9cb13a8c 1880w","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of snug","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘snug’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘snug’ (please note that these are no longer published online).

Do you make something you’d like to make more of? Here’s how to turn what you love into what you doIt’s the old cliche: if you do what you love, you never work a day. But for the people who’ve turned a hobby into their livelihood, it’s not an aphorism – it’s a way of life.It definitely still sounds like a cliche. Who are these blessed people?There are, believe it or not, masses of them. Look at the handmade, the homemade or the made-to-measure and you’re seeing the work of people who have turned a beloved pastime into a profitable business. Trust us, now you know, you’ll start seeing them everywhere.An artisanal epidemic? ChillingAnd they’re multiplying: a 2017 poll of more than 4,000 people for  Money by Start Up Loans and YouGov showed that almost a third of those surveyed have considered turning their hobby into a business. ‘Considered’ to committed is quite a leap. Who’s actually made it?Meet Catherine Ross – solicitor turned full-time candlemaker and founder of the award-winning nancy\u0026ampnell – and Sanjay Aggarwal – recruitment agent turned co-founder of Spice Kitchen, makers of (also award-winning) artisanal spices and teas.Ross’s business came out of her hunt for a lifestyle change. Leaving her job as a solicitor, she spent her days making candles as presents for friends as she tried out various new careers. None of them stuck, but her candles got better and better – and the friends who received them became more and more enthusiastic. Eventually, one friend nudged her towards a eureka moment: “These are lovely,” she said, “Why don’t you sell them? Why don’t you try?” Growing her hobby from here, via a local shop, to her own successful online store, Ross hasn’t looked back: “The delight for me has been that I don’t get that Sunday night feeling any more,” she says. Meanwhile, Aggarwal was looking for a way to help his recently retired mother overcome boredom. She’d been cooking all her life, drawing on her Indian upbringing to create authentic, hand-blended spices at home – something that Aggarwal noticed was in short supply in the UK. He also saw that nobody was selling the beautiful, traditional Indian spice boxes she used. “I thought it might be a nice idea if my mum was able to sell a tin but with her homemade blends inside – it would be a perfect starter kit,” he says. He posted one on ebay. “We sold that one and then another one and another and I guess the rest is history,” he says.But how did they know it would work?They didn’t, not at first. Aggarwal and his mother started slowly, one spice box at a time. Ross, too, took a small batch of candles to her village store as a test case, to see how they’d sell over the festive season. “If you can’t sell at Christmas then you’ll never sell,” she said at the time. When these did well, she invested her time in creating a brand identity and a website – building what would become a loyal online following.Equally, Aggarwal only quit his full-time job in recruitment when he took the spice boxes to his first trade show. “The response was very good, and I thought: ‘You know what, this has got legs,’” he says. Spice Kitchen now has 200 stockists and has sold tens of thousands of spice kits.OK, I’m interested. And kind of crafty. How do I start?Slowly. Both Ross and Aggarwal started by testing the waters with a small sample group and minimum expense they moved forward after positive feedback and, ultimately, sales. You’ve got nothing to lose (and everything to gain) by easing into it.Dave Stallon, commercial director of the Federation of Small Businesses, adds that it’s all about planning and preparation. He recommends you start by looking at the market, getting a sense of the competition (or, if you’re lucky like Aggarwal, any glaring gaps in your field) and current trends – then you can start making financial projections and thinking about potential spikes and dips your business might see.The planning should start at home. “Think about the best space to work in, where you won’t be distracted and can fully focus,” says Stallon. “Having the right equipment is also vital.” If you’re upscaling from a hobby, this may be your biggest initial expense – make sure you’ve planned for it.And once I’ve made some stuff? What do I do with it?Learn the art of marketing. At the same time as Aggarwal was building his business on ebay, he was establishing a loyal following on social media. For both platforms, he got professional photographs taken, which helped associate the brand with quality. He uses social media to full effect to promote his products – notably Instagram’s option to pin a link to pictures, driving to an online store.“Social media is a very, very important part of our business, we make tangible sales from that,” he says. “What’s also key is having a professional listing design and a professional store design on your ebay profile.” Ross, too, put time and money into the nancy\u0026ampnell website – making sure it was as appealing and easy to use as possible. Without this, she says, her customer base wouldn’t have grown the way it did.Fancy photos. Got it. I think I’m ready to join the home-making mob, any last pieces of advice? “You can’t do everything,” says Aggarwal, who emphasises the importance of hiring some help as soon as you can. As a business scales up, he advises, reinvest what you earn back into it, whether that’s taking on extra help or enlisting professional services such as branding.Finally, accept that mistakes and expenses are part and parcel of building a successful business. “You start testing things and you think: ‘I can’t believe I’ve spent that much money,’” says Ross. “You realise: ‘I’ve really got to pare that down, or do that differently,’ so to me there’s no wrong in that – it’s just part of the process.”Ultimately, she says, “I enjoy doing it and that makes a big difference. If that’s the most stress I’ll ever face, I’ll take it.”Millions of people are using ebay to start a side hustle, make more of a hobby or carve out a new career.

Not much larger than the lower deck of a bus, it has eight Formica tables, each one home to a springy napkin holder, a big jug of water and two smaller jugs, one of spearmint-green yoghurt sauce, the other dark, sweet tamarind. I’m not sure if it’s the done thing, but I swirl the two into a spiral dip for samosas and pakoras – clusters of vegetables dipped in chickpea flour batter and fried. The menu is a mix of Italian and English: riso (rice), biryani, veg curry, non-veg curry and pollo con curry di spezie indiane, all served on stainless-steel trays. Always busy, but somehow never feeling busy, Janta, like the market nearby, is multicultural: Rangpuri, Italian, English, Bengali and Mandarin all swirl into the 9X Music hits pulsing from the TV.A piece of India and Bangladesh in central Rome, I love Janta. For its decor – on the one hand pure function, on the other as ornate as the wooden ider half-hiding the kitchen and the child-sized Ganesh by the till for its warm, spiced air and for the friendly, efficient waiter from Dakar. Mostly, I love it because mounds of basmati rice, spiced vegetables, strident lime pickle and cool yoghurt sauce are just what I want to eat when I come out of the market with bundles of coriander, a kilo of semolina and a hand-shaped ginger root.Back in Testaccio, the three young men who work in the frutta e verdura shop under our flat are also from Bangladesh, as is the sous chef at a favourite trattoria and the five men who sell garlic at the market. This column isn’t the place to discuss the complexities of immigration and migrants – of which I am one, if a privileged one – but I do know that these men work hard for very little, and that they’re a vital part of the city and the life of Testaccio. As I pick a cauliflower, one of the young men tells me his home village is the greenest place imaginable – and to use both turmeric and cumin when I cook it.Having set myself on an Italian food path, I rarely cook Indian (that is, Bengali, Gujarati, Kashmiri …) food at home, but that is changing. This week’s dish of cauliflower, cumin and ginger is adapted from Madhur Jaffrey’s instructive and comforting An Invitation to Indian Cooking – ideal for beginners such as myself.Serves 41 piece fresh ginger (about 2in x by 1in), peeled1 medium cauliflower8 tbsp vegetable or olive oil1 small onion, peeled and sliced½ tsp chilli powder (or cayenne)1 tsp turmeric1 green chilli, thinly sliced (discard the seeds if you prefer less heat)1 tsp cumin1 tsp garam masala1 tbsp lemon juiceSaltTo serveBasmati rice and either dal or cucumber raita, or bothBlend the ginger with four tablespoons of water until you have a rough paste.

Add the cauliflower, sprinkle over the cumin, garam masala, lemon and a pinch of salt, and stir again. Pour over 100ml warm water and let everything bubble for a couple of minutes.Cover the pan, turn the heat to low and leave to simmer gently so the cauliflower cooks in its own steam for 20-30 minutes, stirring every 10 minutes or so, until tender and all the liquid has been absorbed (but not so much that it’s dry).Serve with basmati rice, cucumber raita andor braised lentils or dal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0fddb8922c896553084d00eac92fa47b6c617bff/0_183_8688_5213/master/8688.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=691fe373804c7bf7bba17061c2bbc43c","title":"vietnamese chicken and lemongrass curry recipe thomasina miers","story":"Make a tub of this fragrant Vietnamese curry paste and whip it up again and again into a mouthwatering midweek dinnerThere is something therapeutic about making a quick curry paste at home.

When wages are factored in the bill for this will run to close to half a billion – as much as United are in debt via their owners, the Glazers. Here is what is required to end United’s stagnation as the one-step forward, one-step back proposition they have become.David de Gea is again proving a supreme No 1, possibly the only player Pep Guardiola would have in his Manchester City XI. Until the Spaniard signs a new contract United will be twitchy. There is a 12-month extension United can trigger to keep him until 2020 but to do so would show desperation and to lose him completely would signal an undeniable deterioration in the club’s status. Sergio Romero and Lee Grant are adequate back-ups.Ins None (but tie up De Gea)United conceded 27 Premier League goals last season, the second lowest, yet have already allowed 21 this campaign, and there is deadwood in every position. At right-back Antonio Valencia and Ashley Young – each 33 – are auxiliary operators and each should leave, along with Matteo Darmian. Once 19-year-old Diogo Dalot is fit he should be given a chance to establish himself and Mourinho should buy a fresh recruit of the ilk of Juventus’s João Cancelo. At left-back Luke Shaw has improved but was caught out for City’s opening goal and needs competition: Juve’s Alex Sandro would be ideal. Of the centre-backs the defensively suspect Chris Smalling, Marcos Rojo and Phil Jones should be sold, and two new ones bought to compete with Victor Lindelöf and Eric Bailly. Why Mourinho did not move for Virgil van Dijk when Liverpool took him from Southampton is a mystery.Ins A right and left-back, two centre-backsPaul Pogba was missed against City but Fred must be alarmed to hear Mourinho bemoan how this meant Marouane Fellaini, preferred to the Brazilian, would have been better utilised as an impact substitute. This places Fred behind the Belgian despite being last summer’s flagship £50m signing. Nemanja Matic should become a squad option only, and the average Ander Herrera and Scott McTominay sold. More artistry is required to complement Pogba’s verve: Juve’s Miralem Pjanic is of the requisite quality.Mourinho’s need here is two-fold: a game-breaker with serious pace such as Manchester City’s Leroy Sané and a finisher who can bag 18 league strikes as Raheem Sterling did last season for City and still be second-highest contributor – as he was to 21-goal Sergio Agüero.Sterling’s tally was two more than Romelu Lukaku, United’s highest scorer, and with Gabriel Jesus registering 13 and Sané 10 the champions had four players better than United’s second best – Anthony Martial with nine. Alexis Sánchez was meant to be the answer but has scored once in nine league appearances this season and is thought to want to leave. Factor in him being a free transfer who earns at least £350,000 a week and United should offload him in January. Marcus Rashford again failed at centre-forward against City and appears lost so at 21 would benefit from a loan. Juan Mata and Jesse Lingard are merely squad players.Ins An elite-level finisher and a game-changerWhen City beat Fulham 2-0 in the Carabao Cup Guardiola made 10 changes to field a “second XI” that featured Brazil’s No 9, Jesus, Vincent Kompany, the captain, England’s World Cup player Fabian Delph, Sané, Danilo and Kevin De Bruyne, who when fit again may put Bernardo Silva back on the bench. Mourinho can only dream of these riches: his outfield replacements for the derby were Jones, Darmian, Fred, Sánchez and Lukaku – the latter still recovering from injury.At the heart of United’s crisis is Mourinho. What is the point of attempting to revive the side via a macro-investment move that may take up to the next four transfer windows if Woodward and board are unsure regarding their manager? In the summer Mourinho was refused funds to move for Leicester City’s Harry Maguire or Bayern Munich’s Jérôme Boateng because Woodward et al deemed both no better than Mourinho’s centre-back quintet. Never has the back-or-sack truism been more pertinent than now. Considering the uneven resources he has Mourinho still finished second last year and is able to engineer eye-catching one-off results, as the Juve win illustrates. In this glass half-full scenario Woodward and company may take the view that Mourinho is in a third year of a rebuild and to discard him would put United even further back and maybe consign the 20-times champions to a generation in the non-title-winning wilderness."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4fedab8cb6e678ec31ed7525056b4031259d29cf/0_502_3670_2201/master/3670.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a2d21550af9c25ab1c8007526e3b0894","title":"samir nasri joins west ham united","story":"The former Arsenal and Manchester City midfielder Samir Nasri looks set for a return to the Premier League once his doping ban comes to an end.Nasri, who played under the West Ham manager Manuel Pellegrini at City, is due to have a medical before signing a short-term contract at the London Stadium.

He made eight appearances for Antalyaspor in Turkey between signing in August 2017 and leaving in January this year.Meanwhile, West Ham have reinstated their academy coach Mark Phillips after investigating his involvement in a march organised by the Democratic Football Lads Alliance (DFLA).The club suspended Phillips last month after he attended a DFLA march through central London and later defended the group – which has been accused of Islamophobia and racism – in a series of posts on Twitter.“West Ham United can confirm that following suspension and subsequent investigation, academy coach Mark Phillips has been reinstated to his role in accordance with employment law, and has been reminded of his responsibilities,” a club statement said.West Ham launched an investigation due to concerns Phillips’ posts may have broken club regulations but it found there were not sufficient grounds for dismissing Phillips for breaching the club’s social media policy and bringing the club into disrepute. Phillips, who coaches West Ham Under-18s, has been given a final warning over his conduct.A statement from Kick It Out said: “We are aware that West Ham United have carried out an investigation into Mark Phillips’ attendance at the DFLA march last month, and note their decision to reinstate him. In the interests of transparency, we hope a clear explanation of their decision will be made public.“As ever, we are ready and available to offer support to the club around any investigation into potential discrimination – as well as advise on the best way forward when a club representative attends an event which is potentially isive for the local community.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/30988a80a06ce49f0f7fac0edd895f9a0014b425/0_0_3500_2182/master/3500.jpg?width=1010\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=da0e27ffb7ec48cae6d8ad5aa6c63c87 1010w","title":"fa cup second round draw live","story":"Guiseley were rewarded for their 4-3 win over Cambridge with a home tie against Joey Barton’s League One side, while Wrexham will host Newport County in a Welsh derbyNational League North side Guiseley, who knocked Cambridge United out in a first-round thriller, will host Joey Barton’s Fleetwood Town in the second round after the draw was made on Monday.Other standout ties will see National League leaders Wrexham face Newport County in an all-Welsh affair, Solihull Moors host 1953 Cup winners Blackpool and Woking travel to Swindon Town, who are managerless after the departure of Phil Brown.Hampton \u0026amp Richmond Borough, who hosted the draw before their first-round tie with Oldham, will face fellow non-league side Maidstone if they get through.

Is it OK to leave?First, I’ll answer as a friend: money is not the only reason you work. Hopefully, you chose your current role for all sorts of factors: job satisfaction, location, career advancement, perks, to learn, to teach, to meet good people. Whatever the reason, it’s worth thinking about your personal criteria and measuring the two roles against that list, not just the money.It happens all too often that people use that golden salary figure as the be-all and end-all decider, when more intangible traits such as feeling valued have a longer-lasting effect on your happiness at work.Now I’ll answer as a boss: do you know how difficult and costly it is to recruit? The advertising costs, time spent sorting through CVs, the interviews, hiring, dealing with recruiters who send you endless texts and emails? Even when we find a new hire who fits the bill, the first few months, during which they are settling in and not operating at maximum efficiency, can be costly, too. Talent acquisition is my number one challenge, and it feels as if it will be an eternal problem. If you feel that your current job isn’t right for you, then do the honourable thing by bowing out and letting your manager start the whole process again with someone who is genuinely committed. When you were hired, the company decided to make an investment in you. Your colleagues make an investment in you, too – in getting to know and support you.It’s always OK to leave, if that’s how you feel. But a word of advice?

A lawyer explains women’s rightsA woman on Netmums recently waded into a question many bra-wearing women have pondered: why am I wearing this?In a post titled “Can I get in trouble for not wearing a bra at work?”, a contributor wrote that she finds bras uncomfortable. “I am not doing this for attention,” she wrote. “It’s 2018 – I shouldn’t have to wear something because it will make people feel less uncomfortable, stop men looking or just because it’s the norm.”But what are women’s rights in this area? Can you really get sacked for not wearing a bra? According to Hayley Johnson, a senior associate in employment law for Slater and Gordon: “If someone was dismissed for not wearing a bra at work, that could be discriminatory under current law,” she says.Some very conscientious Netmums users replied to the original post saying they were worried about the lasting effect on dress code policies if women could go braless willy-nilly. One suggested that people would go to work in the nude. But Johnson says any case would be treated with common sense: “If a woman came in wearing no bra and a see-through blouse, that could be a problem,” she says.While nipples shouldn’t be nefarious, employers can be. After Nicola Thorp, a receptionist at PricewaterhouseCoopers, lost a landmark case against the company – which sent her home for not wearing heels – the government issued guidance about dress codes. But Johnson argues that it’s not worth the paper it’s written on: “They said you should avoid distinguishing between what men and women can wear, rather than that you shouldn’t do it.”Still, Johnson says she could take on the Netmums user’s case and win if the woman’s employee did make her wear a bra. “The basic rule is that if you’re requiring women to dress in a way that’s more onerous than if she were a man, it’s discrimination,” she says.“If a man turned up without underwear and let you know he wasn’t wearing it, would he be sent home? I don’t think he would.”Johnson points out that the TV presenter Richard Madeley has joked about not wearing pants to work: “It would be incredibly rare for a man to be sent home or disciplined for that. As a society, we need to wrap our heads around the fact that we shouldn’t place more onerous dress requirements on women, but that we still do.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29154973f074960f0af69cc6dd7f29cd56de0967/0_50_2016_1210/master/2016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=09e9e989b476cafc49db8d6d0e45625a","title":"guardian passes 1m mark in reader donations katharine viner","story":"Business model showing way for journalism to ‘regain its relevance’, says editor-in-chiefMore than a million people worldwide have contributed to the  in the last three years, with 500,000 paying to support the publication on an ongoing basis, according to  News and Media’s editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner.She said the business model was showing a new way for journalism to “regain its relevance, meaning and trusted place in society”.Viner told the Society of Editors’ annual conference in Salford that many contributors donated specifically because they wanted the  to stay free and outside a paywall, so “progressive journalism can have the widest possible impact”.“Many readers didn’t understand the challenging commercial reality facing all news organisations, but once we told them more, they expressed real interest in wanting to support the ,” she said. “This was helped by the fact that any money made by the  has to be spent on journalism, because of our ownership structure with no shareholders or owner.“This entirely new revenue stream of monthly and one-off contributions is now a crucial part of our plan to get the  to break even by next April.

How can she pull it off in a house of ided loyalties?As the endlessly delayed Brexit crunch time finally draws near, many politicians’ thoughts are turning to numbers and how they relate to the success or otherwise of Theresa May’s proposal for departure.Some of the calculations are relatively straightforward: for example, May knows she has to persuade the overwhelming majority of her 28 ministers who are in the cabinet or attend it to back the deal. It is in the Commons where things become more tricky.She needs the support of 320 MPs to be guaranteed a win. While the Commons has 650 MPs, 11 do not take part in voting – the Speaker, John Bercow and his three deputies and the seven Sinn Féin MPs. That leaves 639, meaning 320 will get her over the line.With 318 MPs – in effect 316 as Bercow and one of his deputies are Conservatives – the Tories ended up just short of a majority after the 2017 election. They have since been propped up in government by the DUP’s 10 seats.That is about as simple as it gets, however. It remains extremely uncertain whether May can get a deal through the Commons, with a series of factors at play.In brief: almost certainly not. While the bulk of her MPs would get in line and vote for a deal, she seems set to face dissent from two separate wings of the party.Hard Brexiters in the Conservatives, notably in the European Research Group, have pledged to oppose a plan they argue would put the UK at the mercy of Brussels. How many of these would vote against the plan is extremely hard to gauge.Even Steve Baker, the ERG vice-chair and former Brexit minister, who left government in protest at May’s plans, predicted in September that around 80 Tories would rebel, before downgrading this the following month to “at least 40”.On the other side of the ide, a smaller but still significant number of remain-minded Tory MPs such as Dominic Grieve and Anna Soubry also dislike May’s plans, and reject what they say is a false choice of this or no deal.They were buoyed on Friday when Jo Johnson resigned as rail minister and called for a second referendum, saying May had offered MPs the options of “vassalage and chaos”.In theory, it seems inevitable Labour will oppose May’s deal. The party has set six tests for a Brexit plan, saying it will oppose any proposal which does not meet these.One of the tests is that a deal should bring the “exact same benefits” as currently exist under customs union and single market membership, which – despite being based on a pledge from the former Brexit secretary David Davis – is clearly impossible.May’s lieutenants are hoping that if it came to a moment where voting down a deal would spark a near-certain no-deal Brexit or some other confusion, some Labour MPs, especially those in strongly pro-leave seats, might abstain or even back the deal.There is also a handful of strongly pro-Brexit Labour MPs, such as Kate Hoey, who could be expected to defy the party whip.The DUP’s support is still in the balance. While the party supports Brexit, it has also pledged to oppose any deal that treats Northern Ireland differently, for example a backstop relating just to the Irish border.A backstop is required to ensure there is no hard border in Ireland if a comprehensive free trade deal cannot be signed before the end of 2020. Theresa May has proposed to the EU that the whole of the UK would remain in the customs union after Brexit, but Brussels has said it needs more time to evaluate the proposal. As a result, the EU insists on having its own backstop - the backstop to the backstop - which would mean Northern Ireland would remain in the single market and customs union in the absence of a free trade deal, prompting fierce objections from Conservative hard Brexiters and the DUP, which props up her government. That prompted May to propose a country-wide alternative in which the whole of the UK would remain in parts of the customs union after Brexit. “The EU still requires a ‘backstop to the backstop’ – effectively an insurance policy for the insurance policy. And they want this to be the Northern Ireland-only solution that they had previously proposed,” May told MPs. Raising the stakes, the prime minister said the EU’s insistence amounted to a threat to the constitution of the UK: “We have been clear that we cannot agree to anything that threatens the integrity of our United Kingdom,” she added.Otherwise, the rest of the MPs – 35 SNP, 12 Lib Dem, four Plaid Cymru and one Green – can be assumed to oppose May’s plans.It’s currently almost impossible to say. What seems clear is that May faces an uphill battle."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bcc6fb9856176f0668cc0a5782d047a3965abe9f/0_170_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1c1b36bec1372a8e94c70ed386cc250e","title":"brexit stopped labour keir starmer corbyn","story":"Shadow Brexit secretary to use ancient parliamentary procedure to demand release of papersLabour will launch an attempt to force ministers to publish the government’s legal advice on Theresa May’s Irish backstop plan before any Brexit deal is put before parliament.The shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, will on Tuesday use the humble address – an ancient procedure used by the party last year to force the release of Brexit impact assessments – to demand the government produce the backstop papers for scrutiny.He said the party would be using its opposition day debate to stage a vote on the motion as it would be untenable to keep MPs “in the dark” on the legal advice before asking them to vote on the prime minister’s Brexit plan.The environment secretary, Michael Gove, has led cabinet calls for ministers to receive detailed information about the full legal advice given to May on her backstop plan for avoiding a hard border. Hard Brexit Tory MPs, as well as the DUP and the Liberal Democrats, have called for parliament to be given a full version.However, government sources had doubts over whether the legal advice actually existed in written form, suggesting that the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, would only update his draft once the deal was ready to be presented to cabinet, possibly later this week depending on negotiations in Brussels.It has raised the prospect of ministers telling MPs they have nothing to produce, although Labour sources claimed its motion would be worded in such a way that the government would have to comply with the demand, even if at a later date.Labour insiders predicted that the humble address would increase the pressure on the prime minister, almost certainly deepening schisms over Brexit in her own party as well.Starmer said: “It’s simply untenable for the government to put forward any Brexit deal to parliament without providing the legal advice on what’s been agreed. At this critical stage, MPs can’t be kept in the dark nor can we risk parliament being bounced into a decision without having all of the facts available. Ministers should accept this motion and allow MPs to have an informed debate about the UK’s future relationship with the EU after Brexit.”He said the UK’s departure from the EU could still be halted, contradicting his party’s leader, Jeremy Corbyn, who angered Labour MPs and supporters last week when he said Brexit could not be stopped.“Brexit can be stopped, but the real question is what are the decisions we are going to face over the next few weeks and months,” Starmer said. He later added: “I’m not going to pretend there aren’t different views in the Labour party. That wouldn’t be real. But that’s why we worked so hard to say what is the common ground, what is it that we, as the Labour party, can all agree on for the way forward.”Corbyn ruled out backing a second referendum when asked on Saturday whether he agreed with the former Conservative minister Jo Johnson, who quit over Brexit last week, demanding a fresh vote. In an interview with Der Spiegel, Corbyn had already ruled out backing the idea: “Not really, no. The referendum took place.”Labour has reached an uneasy internal truce on Brexit after members who supported remain left open the possibility of backing a second referendum if it could not force a general election.However, Corbyn and his senior shadow ministers have long held more Eurosceptic views, with deep concerns over state aid rules among other issues, while two-thirds of Labour MPs represent seats that backed leave at the referendum.Starmer said given the scale of the crisis, and the likelihood of delays scuppering the chances of another emergency EU summit, all options should be kept open. He dismissed the idea of Labour helping May get a deal through parliament.“The national interest is getting the right deal,” he told Sky News. “One has to ask the question: is the prime minister genuinely negotiating in the national interest, or is she negotiating what she thinks she can get past her cabinet? And I think everybody knows the answer to that question.”The shadow Brexit secretary said even if MPs were presented with an official option of accepting May’s plan or leaving without a deal, parliament would have some leeway: “If there was a motion that 400-plus MPs supported, saying we do not countenance no deal, and a minority countenanced no deal, the PM would then have to go forward in the teeth of parliament.”He described the possible sequence of events. “We’ll look at the deal and vote it down if it doesn’t meet our tests,” Starmer said. “If that happens, we will call for a general election. If that doesn’t happen, then all options must remain on the table. That includes the option of a public vote.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc1e39a51a434e55373cdabc10ccc3016f792f53/0_74_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9814a2ead8dff3701c73e7f8959ef260","title":"where do theresa mays ministers stand on brexit","story":"From loyalists to Brexit ultras, the cabinet can be grouped into at least six key factionsAs Theresa May’s cabinet prepares to meet on Tuesday to try to overcome the remaining political obstacles to striking a deal with Brussels, we take a look at the different factions.This group, led by the de facto deputy prime minister, David Lidington, will back May to the hilt. Lidington, a solid remainer before the referendum, is mistrusted by some leavers but has played a key role in developing the PM’s plan, selling it to the EU and seeking to heal isions in the Tory party. The Northern Ireland secretary, Karen Bradley, who voted remain in 2016, is a former trusted May lieutenant from her days at the Home Office. The Welsh secretary, Alun Cairns, would also go to the wall for May. The Tory party chair, Brandon Lewis, is another of May’s Home Office allies and despite campaigning for remain says he would now vote leave, describing himself as “first and foremost a democrat”. He acts as a crucial buffer between the pro-Brexit party grassroots and the prime minister.Downing Street is concerned that these MPs’ ideological commitment to leaving the EU will eventually outweigh their desire to stay in the cabinet. They have all let it be known that they are unhappy and considering their next moves. The international development secretary, Penny Mordaunt, a prominent member of the Vote Leave campaign, has refused to explicitly back May’s Brexit proposals and suggested her support could be conditional on the final deal. The work and pensions secretary, Esther McVey, last week repeatedly declined to say she supported plans for a soft withdrawal – though she did say she backed the PM. The Commons leader, Andrea Leadsom, a prominent Brexiter, has laid into May’s exit mechanism proposal, predicting it would be thrown out by parliament, yet is so far “sticking in government”, preferring the influence of being on the inside. The trade secretary, Liam Fox, is a long-term Eurosceptic, but is also close to the prime minister, so has been less vocal in cabinet than many expected. If any of them decide to quit, May will be in dangerous territory.This small but powerful group see their role as injecting some economic reality into the cabinet’s Brexit debate. For his troubles, the chancellor, Philip Hammond, has become the minister leavers love to hate. His downbeat forecasts and no-deal warnings have been labelled Project Fear #2, but he can dare to say what May – for political reasons – cannot. The business secretary, Greg Clark, a loyal lieutenant to his fellow remainer in No 11, may be averse to grandstanding but has quietly spelled out to colleagues how much business would suffer if the PM pursued a different route. The Scottish secretary, David Mundell, is loyal to the prime minister and, like the majority of his countrymen, supported remain, but has his own red lines on fishing rights and Northern Irish-only arrangements. Along with the Scottish Tory leader, Ruth Davidson, a fellow instinctive remainer, he is fearful these would fuel calls for Scottish independence.A trio of ministers who all backed – and believed in – remaining in the EU but now recognise the political reality of the referendum result and the fragile situation the Tory party – and the prime minister – find themselves in. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, who was close to George Osborne, has survived – even thrived – under May. In part, perhaps, because he has played a relatively straight bat on Brexit. The justice secretary, David Gauke, is another former Treasury minister who backs a soft Brexit and wants the UK to maximise access to EU markets afterwards. But he has – publicly at least – taken a practical approach. The education secretary, Damian Hinds, declared himself “very disappointed” by the referendum result but then moved on in his own undramatic way. He defended the prime minister over Brexit on television last weekend. Loyal, even if they privately regret leaving the EU.May relies on this quartet of ideological Brexiters to help persuade Tory Eurosceptics that her final deal delivers on promises made in the referendum. She also needs them to assuage her more unpredictable Brexiter cabinet ministers and, if and when a final deal is delivered, help sell it to a ided Tory party. The environment secretary, Michael Gove, one of main architects of the leave campaign, presents himself as the reassuring face of what Brexit will look like. The transport secretary, Chris Grayling, is regularly wheeled out to the media by No 10 to try to reassure the country that a deal will be reached, while the legal case for Brexit put forward by the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, has taken on a new weight in light of cabinet splits. The Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab, will play the biggest part of all: if he backs a final deal then many Tory Eurosceptics are likely to follow suit. He was a pragmatic Brexiter when he was brought into the cabinet, but there have been rumours (fiercely denied) swirling over the last few days that he is on the brink of resigning.This group all have their eyes on the biggest prize of all – being on the right side of the Brexit debate when May does eventually step down. The foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, was a leading remainer who now says he has changed his mind and would vote leave if he had his time again, blaming the European commission’s “arrogant” behaviour for changing his mind. The home secretary, Sajid Javid, was a natural Eurosceptic who backed remain at the behest of David Cameron but after the vote appeared to regret his decision, which lost him the trust of many Tory Brexiters. He has been treading a careful line between scepticism and loyalty ever since. The defence secretary, Gavin Williamson, previously a low-key remainer, has grown keener on Brexit as the months have gone on, although he has recently kept his counsel. The Treasury chief secretary, Liz Truss, awkwardly for her boss, the chancellor, has had a damascene conversion and is now a fully signed-up leaver. It will not have passed any of them by that the next leader of the Tory party will have to unify MPs as well as win the support of the predominantly Brexiter membership."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0765991531911cadae64013906bfe5bd42b6c6b6/0_57_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ddef319c842c080d6f432889db6b774b","title":"brexit may cabinet labour starmer contradicts corbyn and says brexit can be stopped politics live","story":"Rolling coverage of the day’s political developments as they happenIntelligence-led stop and search does work, it is an important tool in the police arsenal.

I don’t have to agree with Sir Roger to acknowledge this nor do I have to agree with his views on a number of different issues but we live in a free society were people can hold different opinions.That’s all from me for today.Comments will close around 6pm. Thanks for contributions posted already.Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Conservative Brexiter and chair of the European Research Group, which represents Tory MPs pushing for a harder Brexit, has told the Sydney Morning Herald that the UK could end up with a Tory leadership contest, or a no deal Brexit, by accident. There were two risks in British politics at the moment, he said.One is the risk of an accidental leadership election and the other is an accidental departure from the European Union without any agreement having been made. There’s no great campaign but it could just happen without anybody really planning ... and that could happen at any point, it’s not under anybody’s specific control.The European Union has been urged to remain “steadfast” over its guarantees to Northern Ireland by pro-Remain parties. As the Press Association reports, senior figures from Sinn Fein, the SDLP, Alliance and the Greens said Brussels must remain firm in demanding a permanent “backstop” arrangement which would keep Northern Ireland aligned with the EU.At a cross-party press conference in London, Sinn Fein vice president Michelle O’Neill said: The backstop needs to be permanent, the backstop is the only guarantee we have in this debacle, the only insurance policy we have throughout all of the Brexit mess.Our message is very firm: there can be no backtracking from that position on the backstop that Theresa May and her government signed up to in December last year.According to the BBC’s Nick Eardley, more than 20 Tory MPs have already signed an amendment to the finance bill saying the reduction in the maximum stake for fixed odds betting terminals (FOBT) from £100 to £2 should come into effect in April next year, not October as planned.With a rebellion on that scale brewing, it is highly likely that the government is going to have to end up backing down on this issue.In a related development, Tom Watson, the shadow culture secretary and deputy Labour leader, says a written answer he has had from Jeremy Wright, the culture secretary, shows that Wright met Philip Davies, the pro-gambling Tory MP, shortly before the decision to delay the reduction of the maximum stake was announced in the budget. (The new limit had been expected to come into force in April 2019, not October as announced in the government, although ministers reject claims the measure has been delayed, saying at one point April 2020 was the planned introduction date.)As the  reported earlier this month, Tracey Crouch resigned as sports minister because she was furious about Wright siding with Davies on this policy and not her.Here is Downing Street on the FT story claiming that Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, has told EU foreign ministers a deal is almost ready. (See 2.32pm and 3.27pm.)Labour has announced that it is going to use its opposition day debate tomorrow to stage a vote on a motion that would oblige the government to publish its Brexit legal advice. This is the “humble address” procedure, that was used successfully by Labour to get the government’s Brexit impact assessment.The motion will say:That an humble address be presented to Her Majesty, that she will be graciously pleased to give directions that the following papers be laid before parliament: any legal advice in full including that provided by the attorney general on the proposed withdrawal agreement on the terms of the UK’s departure from the European Union including the Northern Irish backstop and framework for a future relationship between the UK and the European Union.Commenting on the move, Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, said:It’s simply untenable for the government to put forward any Brexit deal to parliament without providing the legal advice on what’s been agreed.At this critical stage, MPs can’t be kept in the dark nor can we risk parliament being bounced into a decision without having all of the facts available.Ministers should accept this motion and allow MPs to have an informed debate about the UK’s future relationship with the EU after Brexit.This is from the BBC’s Adam Fleming on the FT’s Barnier story. (See 2.32pm.)Gordon Brown’s office has sent out an abridged text of the speech he gave to the Institute for Government on Brexit but - as is usual with Brown - it doesn’t really do justice to the one he delivered. He was talking off the cuff, only loosely quoting from the text released in advance, and the full speech was much longer, much more nuanced, much more interesting (and a bit funnier) than the beefed-up press release sent out by his office.Another feature of Brown speeches is that sometimes they are almost too complicated for their own good. Although Brown was calling for a second referendum, he didn’t deliver a straightforward ‘we must remain’ message and he was at pains to stress the importance of listening to both sides of the remainleave argument. He also implied that the second referendum he sees as inevitable might end up not being a remainleave one, but a rejoinstay out version.Here are the main points.We have to deal with the very real concerns raised in the referendum and since by the British people and not yet answered. We cannot reunite a ided country without talking to the country, getting outside the Westminster bubble, entering a dialogue with the regions and nations and engaging the people in an open, outward looking conversation about our future in a more systematic and constructive way than is happening right now. I propose a new kind of royal commission - not the usual royal commission of the great and good to ‘take minutes and spend years’ but what I call a royal commission of the people, a platform that is designed to enable, encourage engage and empower voices and concerns over the way ahead.It would enable us to hear views and opinions in all regions and nations and in all sectors and involving all stakeholders in industry.It would encourage a national conversation by organising deliberative hearings around the country that listen to the concerns of the public about the causes and consequences of Brexit and their aspirations for the future andIt would engage us in a dialogue about the difficult issues from migration to sovereignty and our longterm economic future, empowering all voices to be heard. Brown cited the citizens’ assembly in Ireland that helped to draft a new abortion law, subsequently approved in a referendum, as an example of what he had in mind.But he did not say how long this would take, implying that either article 50 would have to be suspended to allow this to happen, or that the people’s royal commission could draw up plans for rejoining the EU after March.I have always said that I think there will be a second referendum. I believe that in the end the situation will have been seen to have changed since 2016 and that the people should in the end have the final say. But I also believe that we have got to find a far better way of listening and hearing the voices of people.If we were able to do what other countries in Europe seem quite happy to do within freedom of movement, you could be still part of the single market and you could register jobs when they become vacant at local job centres - the Swiss require jobs in high unemployment areas to be registered at job centres, so in effect local people have have the first option of getting those jobs. When someone comes to the country in Germany, they are required to register as being there. When someone doesn’t get a job after nine months in Belgium, you are required to leave. When someone is in France and they are subject to the laws in France, you cannot be paid lower wages simply because the wages in the country you are coming from are lower. You’ve got to be paid French wages. Now, all these things could change the attitude that people have in this country to what they believe was a situation that was not properly controlled. But the government has not put these forward, and they could still do so.Normally in a negotiation you set your longterm objectives and work out how to achieve them. But whatever the deal is and with or without a deal, the longterm questions about Britain’s future will remain unanswered and unresolved. Even with a deal our end-point - Canada or Norway - is unresolved. Our longterm relationship to the customs union is unresolved, our longterm relationship to the single market is unresolved and the scope to sign trade deals is unresolved. We will have, at best, a short-term fix in the absence of an agreed end point - a short-term fix because the Cabinet cannot agree on an end point. Indeed the selling point of the short term fix to the hard Brexiteers will be that a hard Brexit is still possible as the end game. At this point, as Brown delivered his speech, he quoted from the words Churchill used to criticise the Chamberlain government over appeasement in 1937. Churchill said the government was “decided only to be undecided, resolved to be irresolute, adamant for drift, solid for fluidity, all powerful to be impotent.” The same applied to Theresa May’s government, Brown said.What’s more, the failure to agree and the prolonged uncertainty that arises, means ignoring the real longterm challenges - the four major threats for the future - longterm investment plans by companies put at risk the union put at risk British global influence in danger of reaching its lowest-ever ebb and Britain’s social cohesion in jeopardy because of our failure to face up to the issues raised in the Brexit vote.There is a further worry: If the next two years of negotiation involve a process as inward looking, isive and partisan - as dominated and driven by internal Conservative politics as the past two years, we will become an even more ided country - more ided than in the 70’s during the three-day week, than in the 80’s during the miners’ strike and than in the early 90s because of poll tax.Indeed we have to look back to the angry debates on the corn laws in the 1840s and on Ireland in the 1880s - but these were before the advent of a full democracy. If the government did not change course, both sides would feel betrayed, he said:I fear a sense of betrayal will increasingly take root on all sides. Millions of young people who want to remain, feeling betrayed that their future is being mortgaged by an older generation.Remain voters feeling betrayed because the European referendum was won, in their view, on the basis of dishonest propaganda and in the view of the Electoral Commission by corrupt electoral practises.Leave voters feeling that pledges made at the referendum are not being delivered for example the promises of being better off, of more money for the NHS, of absolute freedom for the fishing industry and of how easy a clean break would be.I don’t see why the Scottish parliament shouldn’t be able to sign a treaty with the European matter on a devolved matter, not on non-devolved matters but on devolved matters. I don’t see why even if we’re outside the European Union that would be prevented. If you go back to Shakespeare’s John of Gaunt, the soliloquy about “this sceptred isle” and the “moat defensive” free from foreign powers powers, he also says in that poem “renowned for deeds in countries far from home”, “dear for our reputation throughout the world” - these two views were even in that poem, written by Shakespeare.According to the Financial Times (paywall), Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, told EU foreign ministers this morning that the main elements of an exit treaty deal are ready to present to the UK cabinet tomorrow. The FT says: “Barnier told ministers from the EU’s remaining 27 member states that ‘the parameters of a possible agreement are very largely defined’ but still require political endorsement.”The EU’s support for Ireland’s position in Brexit negotiations over the border with Northern Ireland is “stronger than ever”, the deputy prime minister Simon Coveney said after a bilateral with the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier. He said:The support and solidarity of Michel Barnier and his negotiating team is stronger than it has ever been.Clearly this is a very important week for Brexit negotiations. The two negotiating teams have really intensified their engagement and the support and solidarity is very very strong.The issues aren’t new. There is still clearly work to do between the two negotiating teams I we need to give them time and space to finish that job and the sooner that can be done the better for everybody.Earlier on Monday Coveney tweeted that he was still hopeful of a deal this week despite the continuing challenges Theresa May is facing. Q: What did you make of Jeremy Corbyn’s comment about it not being possible to stop Brexit?Brown says Corbyn would be the first to say that the Labour conference decision is one he must honour. He says, when he was in government, Corbyn used to remind him that he was bound by conference decisionsQ: Wouldn’t a royal commission take years?Brown says, if the UK does leave the EU, there will be “a strong chance of coming back”.The door must be kept open to that, he says.He says, if he were in government, he would be working on this. An issue to be considered would be the terms on which the UK could rejoin.He says Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel do not want the UK to leave.I will post a full summary soon.Q: You sound as if you think we will leave the EU, but remain in a Norway-style relationship with the EU.Brown says he is not here to make predictions.The point he is making is that, if the UK does leave next year, the key issues will not be resolved, he says.He says, if there is a meaningful vote in the Commons, all options should be open. That should include renegotiating the deal and extending article 50.And if the UK does leave, there must be the option of returning, he says.Q: During the referendum people understood the sovereignty issue.Brown says his argument is that there is new evidence about how the European court of justice decides matters. He says the Lisbon treaty forces it to take national identity into account.He says he does not accept the idea that being in the EU takes all sovereignty away from the British.Q: Can you say more about your royal commission idea?Brown says he is not proposing a conventional royal commission.In Ireland there were deliberative assemblies before the change to abortion law, designed to achieve consensus on proposed changes to the law. Iceland used a similar procedure after the banking crash, he says.He says when he was prime minister the government explored these ideas.These techniques are worth looking at, he says.He says, given that fewer people read newspapers - something he welcomes, he suggests, referring to the Sun - he says the government must find new ways of listening to the public.Q: What do you mean by the idea that Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland could bypass Whitehall and have their own relationship with the EU?Browns says there is no doubt that Scotland, in particular, wants it own relationship with the EU.The government talks a lot about “our precious union”.But it is less willing to honour devolution than in the past, he says.He says he does not see why Scotland should not be able to sign treaties with the EU.Brown says he thinks a second Scottish independence referendum is “unlikely at the moment”.Q: If there was a second referendum, and remain won narrowly, what would happen then?Brown says there is no public support for any of the options available at the moment.People are looking for something else, he says.He says he will not predict when a referendum will be, he says.But there should be an open debate on these issues, he says.And he says, under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, elections do not happen easier. Governing parties are more likely to change their leader than call an election, he says.Brown says there is a view, going back to Dunkirk, that Britain is at its best when it is alone. The film Dunkirk promoted this, he says. In the film, the French never got a look in.He says there is an alternative view, which he shares, that Britain is at its best when it is working with other countries.But that patriotic internationalism never got a look in during the referendum, he says.Brown says there was no campaigning during the EU referendum in the industrial towns. People there feel they have not been listened to, he says. He says politicians need to communicate with them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/645d9cecf23bc49f7db5501019ba26865db3645c/0_345_6641_3987/master/6641.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fd59d995a11dda3710ebcf797a22862a","title":"are you affected by alopecia areata share your experiences","story":"A new  photography project aims to empower those living with the condition. If you’re affected by Alopecia Areata, we’d like to hear from you Alopecia Areata is understood to be an autoimmune disorder that typically starts as one or more small, smooth bald patches on the scalp. The hair loss can remain as patchy hair loss or can continue until all hair on the scalp is lost (Alopecia Totalis or AT) or complete loss of hair from the body (Alopecia Universalis or AU). The immune system, the body’s natural defence which normally protects from viruses and bacteria, mistakenly attacks the hair follicles, leading to hair loss.To raise awareness about the condition,  photographer Graeme Robertson would like to find people in the UK who are affected by Alopecia Areata to take part in a new  photography project, supported by the leading hair loss charity, Alopecia UK.Graeme himself is affected by this form of alopecia and wants to give a platform to other people who have the condition. He aims to show the impact of alopecia on daily life by photographing people and asking them to share their stories. Graeme has had to come to terms with his own experience, which has resulted in total hair loss, and he wants the project to empower others.He said: “I feel nervous and excited about the project as it means so much to me and I’m totally committed to producing an amazing project with beautiful, powerful photography. If it helps one person then it will all be worth it.”Graeme has been a photographer for more than 20 years, you can see some of his work here.If you have been affected by alopecia areata and would like to take part or find out more about the project, please share your details in the form below.

If he is auditioning as a role model for teenage rebels, this wild one may as well be fitted for his “What’ve you got?” leathers now.Yet for all the uproar and condemnation of his altercation with Esteban Ocon at the Brazilian Grand Prix, the incident, a moment of public emotion increasingly rare in F1, should be the least of his regrets after Sunday’s race.After Ocon had hit Verstappen, costing him the lead and an almost certain win, the 21-year-old Dutch driver had warned: “I hope I can’t find him in the paddock now because then he’s …”, the final part of which was censored by F1. He caught up with Ocon in the weigh-in room and proceeded to shove him while adding some words that were sadly inaudible.The FIA punished him with two days of public service, which in the past has entailed educational duties with junior formula, although they may consider Verstappen is not best-placed to impart advice to impressionable youngsters. In reality, the incident was more handbags than some reactions have suggested.Certainly it was far from some of F1’s previous flashpoints. Ayrton Senna punching Eddie Irvine after he unlapped himself in Japan in 1993 Nigel Mansell picking Senna up and pushing him against a wall at Spa in 1987 and famously Nelson Piquet launching himself at Eliseo Salazar after they had clashed when the Brazilian was lapping him at Hockenheim in 1982. There are more but all are dramatic and almost theatrical rather than harmful.Indeed, many will empathise with Verstappen showing a similar fierce emotional drive. Even the FIA in its admonishment acknowledged it was “sympathetic to Verstappen’s passion”.Verstappen and Ocon have history, having been vying with one another since karting in 2010 and there appears to be no love lost between them since. This is baggage that cannot be ignored and expecting drivers to tune it out would make rivalries far less engrossing. The Red Bull team principal, Christian Horner, naturally defended his driver but made a valid point in doing so.“We don’t condone violence but you have to understand emotions – you’ve had a victory taken away from you and they are running high,” he said. “Of course, there is a human reaction in these competitive animals. Emotions occasionally boil over.”Verstappen is a role model but he is human too and, because he has been in F1 for four years, it is easy to forget how young he is. He apologised to Ocon and the stewards, and F1 is in no danger of disappearing into a moral vacuum because of the incident.What he may consider is that had he shown better judgment the collision might have been avoided altogether. Ocon was ultimately at fault, as the stewards found but the FIA race director, Charlie Whiting, noted Ocon was entitled to unlap himself before adding: “He decided to fight for it, which was wholly unacceptable.”Yet given the circumstances Verstappen must shoulder some blame. The Force India driver was on fresher rubber. He had been a quarter of a second faster over the previous two laps and in an entirely different race to Verstappen, who was untroubled at the front. He would have lost some time letting Ocon through but nothing that would have threatened his lead. Instead he chose to contest the pass into turn one rather than letting it go. This left him side by side with Ocon through two, where they collided.Ocon was at fault but as Lewis Hamilton repeatedly noted, in those situations you just don’t get close and leave as much room is as necessary. The Mercedes team principal, Toto Wolff, said: “In Max we can see a future champion. Unbelievable talent and speed. Once the raw edges are off he will be a world champion. In a few years he will look at the footage of the race and have his own opinion of whether that was the right behaviour but you cannot accelerate these things, it is a learning process.”It not inconceivable that part of what was fuelling Verstappen’s anger was that he realised he was at fault for not winning. He will learn and will get better, control and composure will come but it is on track where he really needs to display it. In the meantime, expunging all his vim and vigour would make for a poorer spectacle all round."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c394870a98eb20569a60c66ca13053f90e784d3/0_191_4920_2953/master/4920.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0a73bcab95342626ab2ec3a2ff4ba893","title":"england v bangladesh womens world twenty20 live","story":"3rd over: Bangladesh 3-2 (Joty 0, Ayasha 2) A terrible start here by Bangladesh, especially as the sluggish outfield will make scoring difficult.

And that marks a blue-print for the rest of the over, balls swinging gently away. The only runs come from a wide down the legside. Heavy going for Bangladesh. Play about to begin as we listen to the national anthems. I’m rather keen on Bangladesh’s, chilled and jangly though a bit long..... the ground is looking a picture by the way. And here come the bumptious drums of our very own GSTQ. Nat Sciver to bowl the first over. England desperate to win here, with games against South Africa and West Indies coming next. Here are the remaining Group A games:Interesting that England have gone in with so many spinners when Knight doesn’t expect the pitch to spin much. Ebony Rainford-Brent’s (metaphorical) key revealed a firm pitch. Sky’s dress code for the tournament meanwhile has all gone a bit pink princess: purple tops and cream bottoms for women, pink tie, blush shirt, cream slacks for men. Rather dapper actually.AND WE HAVE THE TOSS: England win and will have a bowl. Salma Khatun, the Bangladesh captain, confirms that they would have had a bowl too. They go into the game with the same side that bowled very well against West Indies. A delayed start here at St Lucia - will keep you posted as soon as we know more. The television pictures are showing the groundstaff raking sawdust over damp patches, in the same way you might cover over embarrassing patches in a pet shop. Ah - news: the toss will be at 745 GMT, with the proposed start time 8.15. And best of all, the sun is shining!Here’s Raf speaking to Sophia Dunkley back in the summer. Still no official conformation that the match is on but England have capped three players: 23-year-old left-arm spinner Linsey Smith, 20-year old all-rounder Sophia Dunkley and 21 year old slow left-armer Kirstie Gordon. Ah, an update from Adam Collins at the ground - things are looking up. The authorities have had the good wheeze of bringing in the boundaries to the minimum allowed - 55 metres - and therefore be rid of the excess moisture on the outfield. Genius!Good Evening! We’re back in St Lucia, where England are due to take on Bangladesh – if only the weather would pull up its socks and play fair. Things, as I write, are still soggy with possibility. The sopping outfield at the Darren Sammy National Cricket Stadium has been mopped and squeezed and generally tended to by the ground staff – it will be a late call to see if it is fit for purpose. After England’s washout against Sri Lanka here on Saturday, they are desperate to get started in the competition. Despite the absence of Katherine Blunt and Sarah Taylor, they start as strong favourites against Bangladesh, who they have beaten in both their previous internationals. Bangladesh are rated ninth in the world – though they did give West Indies a scare on Friday night, before collapsing to the lowest score in the tournament’s history – 46 all out.After the ICC decided that the logistics of moving the rest of the Group A games from St Lucia to Antigua were insurmountable, as well as questionable because of the weather forecast for Antigua, the rain will play a strong hand in the group. If it were to ruin all the games in Gros Islet, the two highest seeded teams, England and West Indies, would go through to the semi-finals.

But the American was forced to defend diligently for a third straight draw after 49 moves and four and a quarter hours (move-by-move recap). The position looked equal and drawish from around move 20, but the dogged Carlsen refused to let up and in fact it may have been the Norwegian champion who let the challenger off the hook somewhat with his 39th move (39. ... Nc5) before the action petered out to a peaceful finish. A short match, relatively speaking, and the players will no doubt be grateful for the extra preparation time ahead of Tuesday’s Game 4. Carlsen, 27, has been ranked No 1 for eight straight years and was considered the world’s best player even before he defeated Viswanathan Anand for the title in 2013. Caruana, 26, is ranked No 2, having earned his place the table by winning the candidates tournament in March. No American-born player has won or even competed for the world title since Bobby Fischer in 1972.\u0026nbspIt marks the first title match between the world\u0027s top two players since 1990, when Garry Kasparov and Anatoly Karpov faced off for a fifth and final time.\u0026nbspThe match will consist of 12 classical games with each player awarded one point for a win and a half-point for a draw. Whoever reaches six and a half points first will be declared the champion.The time control for each game is 100 minutes for the first 40 moves, 50 minutes for the next 20 moves and then 15 minutes for the rest of the game plus an additional 30 seconds per move starting from move 1. Players cannot agree to a draw before Black\u0027s 30th move.\u0026nbspIf the match is tied after 12 games, tie-breaks will be played on the final day in the following order:\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp• Best of four rapid games with 25 minutes for each player with an increment of 10 seconds after each move.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp• If still tied, they will play up to five mini-matches of two blitz games (five minutes for each player with a three-second increment).\u0026nbsp• If all five mini-matches are drawn, one sudden-death \u0027Armegeddon\u0027 match will be played where White receives five minutes and Black receives four minutes.

In the case of a draw, Black will be declared the winner.Thu 8 Nov – Opening ceremony Fri 9 Nov – Game 1\u0026nbspSat 10 Nov – Game 2 Sun 11 Nov – Rest day Mon 12 Nov – Game 3 Tue 13 Nov – Game 4 Wed 14 Nov – Rest day Thu 15 Nov – Game 5 Fri 16 Nov – Game 6 Sat 17 Nov – Rest day Sun 18 Nov – Game 7 Mon 19 Nov –\u0026nbspGame 8 Tue 20 Nov –\u0026nbspRest day Wed 21 Nov – Game 9 Thu 22 Nov –\u0026nbspGame 10 Fri 23 Nov –\u0026nbspRest day Sat 24 Nov – Game 11 Sun 25 Nov – Rest day Mon 26 Nov – Game 12 Tue 27 Nov – Rest day Wed 28 Nov – Tie-break gamesAwards and closingThe games commence each day at 3pm in London.That’s all for now. Thanks for following along with us and be sure to check back tomorrow for our live commentary of Game 4.“I thought it was uncomfortable from the opening and I may have mixed up something,” Carlsen says, per Tarjei Svensen. “Then I got an advantage in the endgame, I don’t think I had any chances, but I would have liked to do something more.“From the start, I thought it was a bit uncomfortable. I just tried to limit his advantage as much as possible. When we reached the endgame, I thought I had equalized. When we reached the endgame, I didn’t really play for a win. ... It was only when I had forced his pawn on a black square and established it there, I thought I would be able to press him.”He’s asked about being uncomfortable in the opening: “I miscalculated the position. I thought what I entered was very close to equalizing. Then I realized I was clearly worse.”He adds: “My results are OK, but I can still improve.”A few last moves (47. f5 gxf5 48. Nxc4 Kxc4 49. exf5) and it’s official: Game 3 is a draw after four and a quarter hours. Caruana and Carlsen are tied 1½-1½ after three games with a slight advantage to the champion, who has five games with white remaining compared to four for the challenger.Quick rush of moves: 42. ... b4 43. cxb4 Bxb4 44. Ne3 Kc5 45. f4 exf4 46. gxf4 Ba5. A draw seems inevitable here.Carlsen comes up with 41. ... Kc6, and Caruana responds with 42. Nf1. Carlsen ponders. And ponders. He’s been considering his position for 10 minutes and counting. Grandmaster Susan Polgar expects we’ll be here for a while.Another flurry of moves (37. ... fxe4 38. dxe4 c4 39. Nd2 Nc5 40. Bxc5 Bxc5 41. Ke2) and we’ve hit the time control. Each player has been given another 50 minutes and both have stepped away from the board for a break from the tension. Here’s what the board looks like.Caruana goes with 37. Kd1 and he’s left with just under five minutes to make his next three moves before the time control gives him another 50 minutes. Carlsen has plenty of time to ponder his next move.The position still looks drawish after another series of moves (33. c3 c5 34. Be3 Ke7 35. Kd1 Kd7 36. Kc2 f5), but Carlsen seems to have taken the initiative while Caruana is left to defend. The world champion is known for grinding and pressing long after other grandmasters might have offered a draw out of courtesy. Can he make something from nothing here as he’s done so many times before?Caruana takes a little more than seven minutes before going with 32. Bd2, eschewing the sacrifice on e5. Carlsen answers with 32. ... Bd6. Here’s what the board looks like.An interesting sequence of moves from Carlsen (30. h4 Ne6 31. Nb3 h5) to squeeze the challenger and set up for an endgame. Time is not nearly the factor it was in the first two games, but worth mentioning Caruana has 17 minutes (and counting) to make his next nine moves before more time is added.Caruana plays it safe with 29. Nd2, instead of targeting a win from an equal position. While it appeared to be a position with little chance of losing, the American doesn’t want to risk it. Carlsen comes back with 29. ... Ng5. Says Susan Polgar: “While most grandmasters would take a draw here, look at what Carlsen is doing. He is slowly provoking Caruana. He has no problem doing little poking for hours and hours. The problem is many will fall asleep mentally and lose to him. It is like some sort of hypnotism.”Meanwhile, the Norwegian telecast has apparently spent the past hour deconstructing Carlsen’s 18th move, where he appeared to touch a piece without moving it and saying the customary “J’adoube”. On they go: 27. Bc3 Ne6 28. g3 Bf8. Remember: Players cannot agree to a draw before Black’s 30th move.Caruana takes about eight minutes to play 23. Qb2, then Carlsen quickly initiates the queen exchange (23. ... Qxb2 24. Bxb2). A quick flurry of moves follows (f6 25. Kf1 Kf7 26. Ke2 Nc5) and we do appear headed in the direction of a peaceful result. Caruana goes with 22. Bc3, opening a possible exchange of queens if Carlsen wants to force it. Instead he goes with 22. ... Qa2. Here’s a look at the board. Seems like Caruana has no alternative than 23. Qb2, but he’s got more than 38 minutes (and counting).Carlsen responds with 21. ... Qa7 and he appears to be clear of danger with the rooks off the board and an equal position. But an easy draw from here is not the consensus, Hungarian-born grandmaster Dénes Boros says.Both rooks are exchanged in a flurry (19. Rxa8 Rxa8 20. Ra1 Rxa1+ 21. Bxa1). This appears to be an admission of inaccuracy by Caruana and a peaceful result appears afoot. The computer is calling it dead even at the moment.Caruana answers with 18. Bc3, and the computers call it an equal position. Looks like Fabi lost time with his previous move (17. Qb4), which has revealed itself as a bit of an inaccuracy. Carlsen has a bevy of playable options here, but he goes with 18. ... b5 and it looks like we’re headed for a draw.Caruana spents a pair of moves developing his queen (16. Qb1 Nd7 17. Qb4 Rfe8). He’s back on the clock again with about 53min left, roughly 20 minutes behind Carlsen (1hr 13min 16sec).As mentioned these games are being aired in prime time on national television in Carlsen’s native country. You can have a look at the telecast on Norway’s VGTV here.Another pawn exchange (14. bxa5 Rxa5). Then Caruana forces the issue to Carlsen’s rook with (15. Bd2), sending Carlsen into tactical retreat (15. ... Raa8). The American is playing on the front foot today, with confidence and initiative. And the Norwegian supercomputer Sesse is giving him a marked advantage.Susan Polgar offers a harsher assessment: “This is basically survival mode. Carlsen hopes to trade a lot of pieces off to hold the endgame.”Caruana thrusts his knight into the fray with 10. Nbd2 after pondering the board for about a quarter hour. But Carlsen wastes no time coming in hot with 10. ... Bg4. Caruana doing far better with time today than in Friday’s Game 1. Here’s a look at the board.Caruana has been on the clock for about 10 minutes or so. Fide master Mike Klein, speaking on one of the commentary feeds, says that Carlsen spent yesterday’s rest day taking in the Chelsea v Everton match at Stamford Bridge.Caruana is having a think after a quick series of moves: 7. Re1 e5 8. a3 Nf6. He takes his time before going with a queenside expansion (9. b4), and Carlsen castles in response (9. ... O-O).Carlsen’s response (6. ... Qc7) is a hell of an early psychological salvo. Russian grandmaster Peter Svidler notes that it’s never been played before in this line. Adds Susan Polgar: “Immediately, it is putting doubt in his opponent’s head. Carlsen wants to show that he expected 6. 0-0 and is fully prepared for it. So Caruana now must think how to avoid possible home prep. A complete mind game!”Another surprise. Carlsen is playing the Rossolimo Variation of the Sicilian, same as Friday’s opening game (1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 g6).Here we go! The third game is under way and so far it’s a repeat of Game 1: another Sicilian (1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6).Cheaters never prosper! According to Norwegian journalist Tarjei Svensen, officials are scanning the playing hall for electronic devices ahead of today’s match.Hello and welcome to Game 3 of the World Chess Championship. We’re back in action today after the first rest day following a pair of draws in Friday’s Game 1 and Saturday’s Game 2 that were notable for Black having the upper hand in both.Carlsen, 27, has been ranked No 1 for eight straight years and was considered the world’s best player even before he defeated Viswanathan Anand for the title in 2013. Caruana, 26, is ranked No 2, having earned his place the table by winning the candidates tournament in March. It marks the first title match between the world’s top two players since 1990, when Garry Kasparov and Anatoly Karpov faced off for a fifth and final time.We’re a little over a half hour from today’s first move, so not much longer now. In the meantime here’s my interview with Caruana ahead of this month’s showdown.Bryan will be here shortly. In the meantime here’s our Tim Lewis’s take on the match so far."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dca97971a19b1fb0774c77697dac93454283895e/0_65_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b9e4c6ef49cc88a0d6b58b0b818721dd","title":"novak djokovic v john isner atp world tour finals 2018 live","story":"First set: Isner 2-2 Djokovic* Isner is yet to win a point on the Djokovic serve. He comes close to getting what turned out to be the final one of this game, but after a long rally he hits a backhand down the line, with Djokovic nowhere near, but it lands six inches wide.First set: Isner* 2-1 Djokovic At 30-0 Isner hits an excellent drop half-volley Djokovic does fantastically to chase it down and chip it over the net, but the American can then lift it into an empty court for an easy winner. Somehow though he nets it, and an easy service game gets a whole lot harder. Djokovic wins the next point on a second serve, and the one after that as well. Another break point, but Isner saves this one with a brilliant forehand, blasted right into the corner. Djokovic gets it back, but only just, and Isner puts away the smash. Against Isner you need to take your chances, and that’s the only one he gets. Still, two break points already on the Isner serve.First set: Isner 1-1 Djokovic* Djokovic sails through his opening service game, winning it to love, the highlight being a fantastic kick second serve, which rears up into Isner, totally befuddles him, and can’t be returned.First set: Isner* 1-0 Djokovic A fine return, which wins the opening point for Djokovic, is followed by two service winners and a double fault. At 30-30 Djokovic gets the ball back into play again and Isner nets a forehand. It’s a break point, and Djokovic should really have taken it – instead, with his opponent at the net and poorly positioned, he sends a backhand into the top of the net. Against Isner you need to take your chances, and that’s the only one he gets.Celebritywatch: Cristiano Ronaldo is in the house!Isner wins the toss and chooses to serve. Action imminent.And out come the players!And so does Novak Djokovic:Obviously very pleased with the way I played int he second half of the season and hopefully I’ll be able to play my best tennis tonight and in this tournament. He’s probably the best server, if not the best then one of the best. He used it as a great weapon, backs it up with a big forehand. This is incredibly exciting for me. I’m going to go out there and try to have fun. First and foremost I have to play extremely well. I need to do what I do well, and at a very high level. If I can do that, I feel that I can give myself a chance.At this tournament the umpires are introduced by name, while the advertising hoardings ask the crowd to “please welcome your ATP chair umpire”. This is a bit strange. Anyway, it has just happened. Now for the players!And Sock and Bryan, the No5 seeds, have won in straight sets against the No3 seeds and last year’s runners-up!The doubles match that precedes this one is teetering towards a potential conclusion: Mike Bryan and Jack Sock are a set up against Lukasz Kubot and Marcelo Melo, and the second set has gone to a tie-break.It is five years since John Isner last beat Novak Djokovic, in which time the Serb has reeled off five successive victories against him, the last three without dropping a set (though they haven’t played since 2015). Only the last of their 10 career meetings has not featured at least one tie break, and both are surfing into this competition on a wave of wonderful serving.So we’ll hope to see plenty of loose and free tennis, and ideally no more than one tie break, as the tournament favourite starts his campaign tonight.

Grainy light seeps through three small windows. An orange screen above the women is filled with a stream of projected words, which the women recite. The phrasing is fractured, overlapping and untethered. Glimmers of meaning occasionally wriggle free, but meaning isn’t really the point. Vessel is a chance for the audience to step away from reality and get lost, perhaps escape, together.This is Sue MacLaine’s follow-up piece to Can I Start Again Please, which explored the limits of language, particularly when talking about abuse. Vessel focuses on the power that language exerts, and the choices we might make to undermine that power. It’s based on the medieval practice of anchoritism, in which women chose to live locked away in religious seclusion. Vessel shuts us away in a similar sort of space the result is a show that feels more like meditation than theatre.Gender dynamics, politics, corruption, greed and countless other contemporary concerns are all obliquely addressed. But MacLaine’s script is so wilfully obscure that this becomes a physical experience rather than an intellectual one. We watch the words on Giles Thacker’s projections gather and drop down to the bottom of the screen, and it feels like a release. We watch the calm and focused actors, and listen in particular to Angela Clerkin’s lucid delivery and Owen Crouch’s oozing sound design, and the brain begins to slow and the body relax.Gradually we start to listen for the feeling that words create, rather than their meaning. Political strongholds are discussed and words such as “surplus”, “deficit” and “commodity” sound hollowed out and cold. Greed is touched on and language stretches out compassion is explored and the words feel warm and tangible.It’s a strange but quietly revealing piece, and also pretty hard work. Vessel is beautifully conceived and tough to watch. It requires an unusual double state: hyperawareness coupled with total relaxation. It won’t be for everyone, but I enjoyed the experience of (sort of) letting go."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/33950542cae620182cac455384e0acbf97140907/0_154_3141_1884/master/3141.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=12357db9b6535e28a06c2eb006fc5073","title":"alarm over talks to implant uk employees with microchips","story":"Trades Union Congress concerned over tech being used to control and micromanageBritain’s biggest employer organisation and main trade union body have sounded the alarm over the prospect of British companies implanting staff with microchips to improve security.UK firm BioTeq, which offers the implants to businesses and iniduals, has already fitted 150 implants in the UK.The tiny chips, implanted in the flesh between the thumb and forefinger, are similar to those for pets. They enable people to open their front door, access their office or start their car with a wave of their hand, and can also store medical data.Another company, Biohax of Sweden, also provides human chip implants the size of a grain of rice. It told the Sunday  (£) that it is in discussions with several British legal and financial firms about fitting their employees with microchips, including one major company with hundreds of thousands of employees.The CBI, which represents 190,000 UK businesses, voiced concerns about the prospect.A CBI spokesperson said: “While technology is changing the way we work, this makes for distinctly uncomfortable reading. Firms should be concentrating on rather more immediate priorities and focusing on engaging their employees.”The TUC is worried that staff could be coerced into being microchipped. Its general secretary Frances O’Grady said: “We know workers are already concerned that some employers are using tech to control and micromanage, whittling away their staff’s right to privacy.“Microchipping would give bosses even more power and control over their workers. There are obvious risks involved, and employers must not brush them aside, or pressure staff into being chipped.”Steven Northam, the founder and owner of Hampshire-based BioTeq, told the  that most of its 150 implants have been for iniduals, while some financial and engineering firms have also had the chips implanted in their staff.BioTeq has also implanted them in employees of a bank testing the technology, and has shipped them to Spain, France, Germany, Japan and China.They cost between £70 and £260 per person. Northam himself and all the directors at BioTeq and one of his other companies, IncuHive, have been microchipped.Last year Wisconsin-based Three Square Market partnered with Biohax and became the first company in the US to microchip its employees, on a voluntary basis.KPMG, one of the big four accountancy firms, said it was not planning to microchip its employees and “would under no circumstances consider doing so”.Fellow accounting firms EY and PwC also said they would not consider microchipping their employees. Deloitte declined to comment.Biohax has plans to open an office in London, according to its website. It claims 4,000 people have been microchipped, mostly in Sweden. It is working with the state-owned Swedish rail firm Statens Järnvägar, to allow its passengers to travel via chip implants rather than train tickets. Biohax did not respond to requests for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09c8dea1402c519d94b837bdd72f40efef10a4f4/0_243_6570_3942/master/6570.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d26b4bcd1b30b4eda18a130cefe6ab3b","title":"i was preety much mute at school the bake offs kim joy","story":"Her animal biscuits and warm personality delighted audiences. She talks about social anxiety, her work in mental healthcare and the surprising therapy of bakingKim-Joy’s house lies down a wiggly lane between Leeds and York, “a mystical place off the radar,” she says. Right now, it is full Bake Off, her table taken up by the giant “goodbye” cake contestants are given when they leave (she came joint second, of course), her shelves laden with different flours, in chic, labelled glazed pottery. The kitchen gives out on to huge fields at the back, a completely undreamed of scene of peace, with the world’s two free-rangiest chickens. “I think my neighbour might have a horse,” Kim-Joy says, dreamily. “How can you think someone might have a horse?” I ask. She gives me a smile as warm and perceptibly calm as the one that had such a soothing effect on the Bake Off tent, uncurdling every dicey batter.I’m not saying Rahul shouldn’t have won Bake Off he has distinctive qualities of his own. But Kim-Joy is such an unusual person for the public eye, so self-effacing, so restrained and undramatic, give or take the eyeliner, that she could have had a prize in her own category: Balm to the Nation’s Psyche.“People who are bakers always tend to be nice people, just because they want to give to other people,” she says, and it’s true – you don’t see many people making cakes for themselves, except in romcoms. “How can you bake and not be nice?” she adds.That is perhaps what drives Bake Off, the delightful contradictions of making competitors out of people who, by their nature, collaborate yet this isn’t the first niche competitive scenario to change Kim-Joy’s life. She is also into board games, and recently came second in a Splendor tournament. The board-games world “is quite male dominated,” she says, “so if you look really girly, people think you don’t know what you’re doing.” This is how she met Nabil, her partner, the inspiration behind the bee-decorated doughnuts she made on the show. He owns four board-game shops in the centre of Leeds, and she met him at a board-game club night, because, yes, those really exist.They played board games for a year and a half before anything happened – “Azul, that’s quite a good strategic game” – and he got to know of her fondness for baking, and “mentioned to me casually one day: ‘It’d be really nice if you made something for me.’ And I was all casual, too, and said: ‘I’ll do that sometime.’ And I came in the next day with my bread. It was a brioche, a couronne, filled with sun-dried tomatoes and basil. I was sharing it round everybody and he didn’t think they were appreciating it enough. And he said: ‘I want all this for me.’” It’s like a love story co-written by Jilly Cooper and Delia Smith.Her home’s other recurring theme, besides the baking, is the Japanese animation, My Neighbour Totoro, with illustrations of the giant grey-furred woodland sprite everywhere. They also remind her of Nabil. “I thought he reminded you of a bee?” I say. “He reminds me of a lot of cute things,” she says.Kim-Joy became known on the show for her intense commitment to cuteness: anything that could be an animal would be she could see the rabbit potential in every shape. She won star baker in vegan week with a lavender and lemon cake decorated with foxes, alongside some squirrel tartlets. Then there was her galaxy-themed chocolate ball that melted to reveal a gang of space turtles carrying tiny umbrellas. Her famous bunny madeleines in the semi-final were so dinky, it felt like vandalism to watch one disappear into Paul Hollywood. But the genius of the casting is that, from the first episode, it always looked as if there was something real underneath, that it was a kind of cartoon generosity, not tweeness, driving it.Her other star baker week was the spice round. Ginger biscuits are a risky game: make them once and everyone calls you a genius make them twice, and everyone says you’re playing it safe. She makes them a third time, for me, in animal shapes (of course), and it all happens so smoothly that, from where I am standing, it just goes from a clean kitchen back to a clean kitchen that smells of baking ginger, without any mess in between. To watch her decorate is mesmerising, tiny piping bags of royal icing lined up like fat little fondant mice, delicacy and perfectionism shot through with zen-like chill.Before Bake Off, Kim-Joy was a psychological wellbeing practitioner, having done a master’s in psychology. “The technical job role was to help people with low to moderate anxiety and depression,” she says. She is always careful not to come across as critical, and never more so than when she talks about her work. “I love the NHS. I really want to work in the NHS, but I’m at a point where the clinical side of mental health isn’t for me. You do a questionnaire with each person when they come in. So they tell you how many times that week they’ve felt low, which is a really weird question. It’s not real. Professionals need it for their data, to see who’s recovering. A lot of people just make up their answers, because they want to sound like they’re feeling better.”She is at a crossroads, wanting to carry on working in mental health, but “there’s a big emphasis on diagnosis, and I know there’s a place for diagnosis, but a lot of the time, people don’t fit into those boxes. And it’s helpful, so that people can get the right treatment, but not if the diagnoses don’t fit. I’d love to combine baking with mental health. Art therapy is a thing, isn’t it? Why not baking therapy?”She has done very little work with children, so it was a Bake Off revelation to discover that “quite a few children seem to like me. I’ve had so many drawings from children. I didn’t really see that coming.” I suggest it is because she is quite high-energy without getting in your grill, which children like but adults can’t often manage. “I think I’m quite low-energy, generally. I just like to chill and be at home and bake. It’s just because you’re here, I’ve put some energy on.”The animals she has made – well, a cat, some stars, I think it’s a bell and her signature turtle – are out of the oven, but need time to cool before icing. She was born 27 years ago to an English father and Malaysian mother in Belgium, but that’s not the source of her patisserie skill: she moved back to the outskirts of London aged nine, none of her family bakes, and she didn’t really take it up until she went to university. “All I remember of baking as a kid was having to make mince pies, which I really hated. So it’s not really a fun baking story.” She started in earnest, she says simply, because: “If you make something, it makes people like you. It’s just about making people happy, I guess. I got into the decorative side of it later.“I didn’t really speak when I was at school, I was pretty much mute. I would talk at home, and sometimes I whispered to people, but I was very careful about who could hear me talk I didn’t want people to know that I could. I would say it was severe social anxiety. There’s selective mutism as well, but a lot of that is in really young children, and this was at secondary school. So I don’t know if I fit the criteria. But I don’t really believe in criteria anyway. I was always trying to break out of my shell because I knew that wasn’t really me. But who was?”That carried on at university, where she chose a course almost at random, and went off, hoping to throw herself into socialising. “I thought: ‘I’m just going to start being me.’ But when I got there, I really didn’t know how to talk to people, I’d not interacted that much. I would just say really weird things. I started making friends by baking. And I’ve got a lot more normal as time’s gone on.” In her descriptions of the whole TV experience, there is a residue of this social anxiety – worrying that the other contestants would hate her, being astonished when they turned out to be really warm – but what her backstory illuminates is the intense sympathy she gives off, in person and on screen. People always say, on the internet, be kind, you never know what other people are going through but it’s not often you meet someone who seems quite so alive to what other people might be going through.The impact of her new stardom is subtle. Unlike some contestants, she hasn’t had photographers on her doorstep, possibly because it is quite hard to find, although she is recognised a lot – indeed, even if you had only seen the show once, you couldn’t mistake her for anyone else, so she has to look “put together” when she goes out, although I think her pure sunshine wardrobe predates her time on telly. Her extended family in Malaysia are incredibly excited. “My aunt Sandra keeps screenshotting the Daily Mail, and I really don’t want to know about the Daily Mail.” The show has evolved pastoral care: “Someone rings you every few days just to have a chat. And I think that carries on for quite a while. She called us throughout the whole show, and still calls now. I’ve not needed any support. But sometimes you can’t really tell with people, they surprise you.”But Bake Off has left its mark. “I feel like I want to make the most of the opportunities, I don’t want to just sit back and chill the whole time. To have people like you for who you are is quite affirming, especially when you always worry about people not liking you.”When you watch someone excelling at something – anything – while being so modest about it, they’re hard not to like. “I am modest,” she says, “but I think Rahul is more modest. If it came across the other way, it’s because I always expected things to go badly in the tent, not to be as good as it was at home, so if something went wrong in the tent, I didn’t really talk about it. Whereas Rahul expected everything to be perfect, because that’s how it was at home.”She has just finished icing one star, having wiped off a previous attempt that already looked more or less perfect. “Can I have a break for a bit?” “Sure, a break from baking, or a break from me?” “From baking,” she says, and it was the wrong question and a diplomatically wrong answer, but it is fine, because I was leaving in a bit anyway, and I cannot help being high-energy and in your grill.She gives me the turtle to take home. On the train – because I want to show it to people and also eat it – I lay it on my skirt to take a photo, and realise she has iced it exactly to match. It could be a coincidence, except my skirt is mad: lime green, black, white, coral. Hers is a delicate, unassuming kind of empathy you don’t meet it every day.Prep 15 minCook 10-12 min (Plus decorating time – depends on how many biscuits you are decorating)Makes About 12 medium-sized biscuitsFor the biscuits150g salted butter (or use unsalted and add salt to taste)100g dark muscovado sugar25g liquid molasses2 tbsp beaten egg1 tbsp ground ginger¾ tbsp ground cinnamon¼ tsp ground cloves225g plain flour, plus extra to dust and roll outFor the royal icing450g icing sugar2 medium egg whites (or you can use 70g pasteurised egg whites if you are concerned about using raw egg whites)Plus extra icing sugar andor egg white to adjust – the consistency you are aiming for is one that returns to a smooth surface about 15 seconds after running a knife through it.Food dyesPreheat oven to 180Cfan 160Cgas mark 4.Add the butter, sugar and molasses to a stand mixer bowl.

At a cost of more than $2,000, he also commissioned commemorative coins emblazoned with his name to hand out to visitors and staff. He replaced the doors in his office to the tune of more than $130,000, and installed a hunting-themed arcade game in the department’s cafeteria.Yet to some longtime civil servants working at interior headquarters, this flashy behavior was merely a distraction from graver concerns.“There was a lot of eye-rolling and embarrassment about the flag and the horse and all of the ridiculousness,” said a former senior employee who left last year and requested anonymity for fear of retaliation. For some, the dominant emotional tenor at the time was “fear and anxiety” as Zinke and his team ushered in “dramatic change” at the interior department.“All the new administration was interested in was their checklist for dismantling regulations and weakening environmental and land use protections,” said the former staffer. “Instead of asking why a senator or lobbyist or CEO was asking for a special favor and whether or not it was allowed under the law, this administration wanted to know why the special favor wasn’t already done and which deep state employee was standing in the way.”Despite his public persona as a folksy Montanan with a Boy Scout’s penchant for pennants and horses, Zinke has taken shrewd and aggressive steps to transform from the inside a department whose 70,000 employees manage the country’s treasured national parks and its endangered species, in addition to overseeing vast energy and mineral deposits on at least 500m acres of public land.Most importantly, Zinke rapidly installed a slew of conservative operatives and industry sympathizers in key positions throughout the agency. Because these senior advisers, counselors and other appointees are rarely subject to Senate approval, few people know their names. They nevertheless wield immense power and are responsible for much of the day-to-day work at the interior department.Hundreds of pages of correspondence and calendars reviewed by the  and Pacific Standard show how Zinke and his top aides have favored corporate and conservative calls to prioritize resource extraction at the expense of conservation, while consistently delivering on industry desires – despite sometimes running afoul of conflict of interest rules.The interior department responded to only one of multiple inquiries made to it, saying through a spokesperson that “the Department has addressed these questions to you and other reporters on multiple occasions. Our position remains unchanged.”Zinke is now facing a swirl of misconduct allegations, and Trump has said he would make a decision on his future at the department as soon as this week. But whatever Zinke’s fate, he has stocked the department with a slate of committed conservative appointees who will continue to remake the agency in the image of the Trump administration.“They are undermining the department’s mission at every turn,” said one current high-level civil servant, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation. “I have been here a pretty long time and seen different administrations from both sides of the aisle,” the civil servant added, “but this is the worst I have ever seen.”During his presidential campaign, Donald Trump made no secret of his ambition to exploit the American landscape. “A Trump administration will develop an American first energy plan,” he said in a 2016 speech before the North Dakota Petroleum Council. “American energy dominance will be declared a strategic, economic and foreign policy goal of the United States.”The US controls enormous publicly owned energy resources, from the underwater oil wells of the Gulf of Mexico to the gas fields of North Dakota and the uranium deposits of Arizona. The interior department is the agency that decides who can drill and mine these riches.Zinke has styled himself, at least superficially, after Theodore Roosevelt, the progressive-era president who helped create America’s modern conservation system. But Zinke has veered sharply from Roosevelt’s legacy.Where Roosevelt created the nation’s first national monuments, Zinke drastically reduced the size of Bears Ears national monument and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monument in Utah last year in what amounted to the largest rollback of protected public lands in American history.More broadly, over the last fiscal year, the department has sought to lease a stunning 12.8m acres of publicly-owned oil and gas parcels to private companies.And while Roosevelt railed against powerful special interests, Zinke has a cozy relationship with industry groups. The monument reductions occurred after Zinke was pressured by conservative groups such as the Koch brothers-affiliated Americans for Prosperity and energy companies such as the uranium firm Energy Fuels Inc. In fact, during Zinke’s first 18 months in office he met repeatedly with oil and gas industry organizations that have collectively given him more than $110,000 in political contributions over the course of his career, according to a report from the Western Values Project.Zinke’s top deputies also have a close relationship with extractive industries. During their first year and a half on the job, just seven of Zinke’s high-level political appointees collectively participated in at least 280 meetings, calls or gatherings with fossil fuel corporations, mining companies or related advocacy groups, according to calendars obtained via public records requests and analyzed by the  and Pacific Standard. Meetings with conservative ideological organizations, agricultural and timber groups, and corporate lobbying and law firms also appeared regularly on the officials’ calendars.These extractive interests had more than twice as much access as conservation NGOs, which obtained at least 115 meetings and calls with the seven officials within the same timeframe.At a private energy summit that took place in Washington DC last December, a Zinke appointee named Timothy Williams articulated the department’s pro-industry agenda, according to documentation of his remarks reported here for the first time.Williams dismissively characterized the approach taken by the administration of Barack Obama: “Anything you want to do on public land, they want to see what the carbon footprint is and what the social cost is.” Under Zinke, “we’re not looking at this”, he said. The new administration was instead focused on “economic impacts”. It was bent on changing “the mindset of the bureaucrats”.From the very beginning, however, Zinke’s interior appointees appear to have violated Trump’s own ethics directives intended to “drain the swamp”.According to rules put in place by the Trump administration, officials are supposed to be prohibited for a period of two years from the date of their appointment from having meetings with former employers, with few exceptions, and interior department guidelines recommend that officials take steps to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest when performing their official duties.Williams, for instance, previously worked for Americans for Prosperity (AFP), a Koch brothers-funded organization committed to combating government regulations of all kinds, including environmental protections. But soon after joining the department as the deputy director of the office of intergovernmental and external affairs, his office contacted AFP to hold a meeting, according to records obtained by the investigative group Documented. “Happy to meet to discuss partnering on shared priorities,” Chrissy Harbin, then the AFP vice-president, replied in an email.In another case, the political appointee Douglas Domenech met twice in April 2017 with representatives of his former employer, the Texas Public Policy Foundation (TPPF), another Koch-linked conservative foundation. According to his work calendar, the subject of the meeting was a pair of active lawsuits the organization had filed against agencies within the interior department concerning endangered species and property rights – the meetings appear to be a glaring conflict of interest. Little more than six months after its meetings with Domenech, TPPF had what it described as a “major win” when it settled one of those lawsuits.There are “express prohibitions” on such meetings in the White House’s own ethics pledge, said Virginia Canter, the chief ethics counsel at the non-partisan Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics. “These high-level officials are supposed to be setting the tone for the entire department and this shows a complete disregard for the ethics rules put in place by the administration.” and Pacific Standard have uncovered several instances in which interior department leadership has coordinated closely with industry-aligned groups on crucial legal and regulatory decisions, with profound consequences for efforts to combat climate change, wildlife management and other matters.Zinke’s department plays a major role in the regulation of methane which, for the first 20 years after it is introduced into the atmosphere, is over 80 times more effective at trapping heat than carbon dioxide. The interior department under Barack Obama moved to clamp down on a principal source of domestic methane pollution – the wasteful leaking, venting and flaring of methane by oil and gas companies. In late 2016, just before Obama left office, the interior department finalized a new federal regulation that required oil and gas drillers operating on public land to take stringent steps to detect and capture methane waste.Influential oil and gas industry trade groups like the Independent Petroleum Association of America (IPAA) were opposed to the measure, and sued in late 2016 to block what it considered a “regulatory onslaught on American producers”. During the first months of the Trump administration, Republicans led an industry-backed effort to repeal the methane rule using the Congressional Review Act, a law that enables Congress and the president to roll back recently issued regulations.The repeal effort soon ran into trouble, however, when Senate Democrats and a handful of Republicans, including Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, publicly came out against it in the spring of 2017.Emails reveal how the interior department and oil industry coordinated a response. “Really?” wrote interior official Micah Chambers, in a frustrated March 2017 note to Ryan Ullman, the IPAA’s director of government relations, upon learning of Graham’s opposition.“I’m disappointed to put it very politely,” Ullman responded. Ullman asked whether the department would wheel out Zinke to make the case for getting rid of the regulation.Graham did not change his mind about the methane rule and the Senate ultimately voted against repealing the regulation. Zinke’s department soon took matters into its own hands. The department tried twice in 2017 to block methane regulation by itself, but both times it was stymied by legal challenges from environmentalist groups and state governments.A political appointee named Katharine MacGregor helped lead the department’s handling of the issue. Her calendar shows several meetings with fossil-fuel industry groups in the summer and fall of 2017, including one about methane just a few hours before an internal interior department meeting on the same subject.In September this year, MacGregor announced that the department had decided to rewrite the rule entirely, rather than merely block it. The revision effectively rolled it back.Chase Huntley, the energy and climate program director at The Wilderness Society, said his organization held several meetings with top interior officials, and it became apparent to him that their minds were already made up: the gutting of the methane rule was a preordained outcome.“It seems clear that the methane rule rollback, while arbitrary, was a foregone conclusion from day one of this administration,” he said. It was rooted “in a philosophical and policy allegiance to the industry’s best interests”.Extractive industries also seem to have had a hand in the department’s implementation of the Endangered Species Act, which is regarded as one of the strongest environmental laws in the world but is the bane of some industry groups because it limits development in sensitive habitat.The interior department energy counselor, Vincent DeVito, for instance, appears to have helped delay Endangered Species Act protections last year for an imperiled freshwater mussel species in Texas at the behest of oil and gas interests. In mid 2017, the government relations director for the Independent Petroleum Association of America wrote in an email to DeVito: “We really hope that you can intervene before this species gets listed next month.”When the species’ listing was delayed, the  and Pacific Standard have learned from records, the IPAA sent DeVito an email with the words: “THANK YOU!” DeVito has since left the department to work for an oil and gas company.The department has taken a controversial stance, too, on sage grouse, a chicken-size bird that dwells among the sprawling sagebrush plains of the American west. Even the slightest disturbance can drive the animal from its breeding and nesting grounds, and populations have plummeted in recent decades as oil and gas drilling, mining and other development has fractured its habitat.In 2015, the Obama administration unveiled protection plans for the species, including a proposal to prohibit new mining on 10m acres of federal land in the hope of avoiding disturbance. But after Trump’s election, the mining industry suddenly found itself with committed sympathizers within the interior development.A striking email chain reviewed by the  and Pacific Standard reveals that a mining industry advocate helped edit the wording of legislative language intended to block funding for these sage grouse conservation efforts.In one message from spring 2017, a Republican staffer with the Congressional Western Caucus named Jeff Small described producing the proposed text “after much discussion” with Laura Skaer, the executive director of the influential American Exploration and Mining Association (AEMA). He sent an email to top officials at the interior department to run the legislative language past them too.Kathleen Benedetto, a senior adviser at the department, replied: “It will need to be modified.” That very day, a modified version of the language was suggested to a house committee by the Republican congressman Paul Gosar. (A spokesperson for Gosar said that “it is common for us to solicit feedback from outside experts and impacted stakeholders”.)The Republican-led Congress ultimately failed to block funding for the proposed mining prohibition, however, and Zinke’s department once again took matters into its own hands. In June 2017, Zinke established a broad internal review of the Obama-era sage grouse conservation plans, naming Benedetto, previously the co-founder of the Women’s Mining Coalition, as “co-lead” of the effort.Over the course of the next four months, Benedetto’s calendar shows she had at least 16 meetings or calls with mining groups. In October 2017, the Bureau of Land Management, which Benedetto helps oversee, announced that the 10m acres would no longer be out of bounds for mining.The AEMA celebrated the victory, saying the interior department “has done the right thing by ending this epic federal land grab”.Since taking office, Zinke and his department have been subject to no fewer than 15 federal investigations. The interior department’s office of inspector general is investigating his involvement in a Montana land deal with the chairman of the oil services company Halliburton. It is also looking into his role in blocking the development of a proposed casino involving two Native American tribes in Connecticut. In late October, the Washington Post reported that the inspector general’s office referred one of its inquiries to the justice department for further investigation, though it did not specify which one.The secretary’s pro-fossil-fuel agenda, his team’s conflict of interests problems, and his own personal conduct are likely to draw intense scrutiny from Democrats once they take control of the House in January 2019. Already, congressman Raúl Grijalva of Arizona, who will probably take the reins as the chair of the House natural resources committee next year, has vowed to call Zinke before the committee in order to interrogate him about his “failures and scandals”. Whether Zinke sticks around at the department is an open question, though many press reports indicate that he is preparing to step down from office.His political appointees, nevertheless, will probably remain. But they too acknowledge that they have a short timeframe in which to finish their work of fulfilling Trump’s energy dominance agenda.At the private Washington DC energy summit back in December, Timothy Williams admitted as much to his audience of conservative operatives and fossil-fuel advocates.“Obviously we are not going as fast as everybody wants, but at some point there will be an administration in here, an administration that is not friendly to your values, to you guys,” he said.“So bear with us,” he added later. “You guys should know that if you have any questions or any problems you feel free to contact me. That is my job. To work with industry.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/25e33f8b62b763be0cfde8ea5fd2020f2e9ed346/249_196_2011_1206/master/2011.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=75d3be71c47522240d7ab1626192ca1d","title":"are you mme macron woman asks merkel at armistice event","story":"Unnamed woman, 100, gets photo with French president – but not his wife – in CompiègneAt 100 years old, the Frenchwoman in her white knitted hat and scarf could perhaps be forgiven for what was, after all, an undiplomatic mistake.As she waited in the persistent drizzle at the Armistice centenary commemoration at Compiègne, the woman shook hands with the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and then turned to the German chancellor, Angela Merkel.Clutching Merkel’s hand in a purple woollen glove, she asked: “Are you Madame Macron?”For a fraction of a second, Merkel looked non-plussed, before she quickly smiled and replied in German: “I am the German chancellor,” which was translated to the woman.When the woman asked Merkel a second time if she was Mrs Macron, Merkel leaned in and said into her ear in French: “Je suis chancelière allemand,” while Macron looked on bemused.It was a touching moment to conclude a moving ceremony in which the French and German leaders clasped hands to seal their countries’ reconciliation. For the unnamed woman in the front row, who was among 1,000 members of the public invited to attend, it was a moment of pure emotion.“Monsieur Macron! It’s not possible. A little old woman like me shaking hands with the president of the republic. It’s fantastic. Fantastic,” she said. “Now don’t make me cry.” Informed that the woman would be celebrating her 101st birthday on Monday, Macron insisted she pose for a photograph with him and Merkel either side. He then pecked her on each cheek.“It’s fantastic. Thank you, thank you a million times. I’ll be here again next year,” the woman said.“So will we … thank you for your energy.

You will have to ask the experts at the Ministry of Defence. But you know there is a tendency nowadays to accuse Russia of all sins, mortal or otherwise,” he said. “As a rule, these accusations are baseless.”Interference in satellite signals across the Arctic regions of Norway and Finland was first noticed during Nato’s two-week Trident Juncture military exercises, which ran from 25 October to 7 November.The satellite disruption led to Finnish and Norwegian civil airspace operators issuing official warnings to pilots that navigation signals in north-east Lapland were unstable.A pilot with the regional Norwegian airline Widerøe reported a loss of GPS signals during a flight near Kirkenes, close to Norway’s border with Russia, at the start of November.“There are no security risks, we have good routines and this is not the first time we have experienced loss of signals,” a Widerøe spokeswoman told the Barents Observer website.In September 2017, Norwegian authorities reported jammed GPS signals affecting civil flights in the north of the country during Russia’s large Zapad military exercise.Finnish parliamentarians lined up on Friday to call for a robust response to the signal jamming, with the defence committee chair, Ilkka Kanerva telling Yle that the effect on civil aviation could have been “catastrophic”.During the Trident Juncture military exercises, which were the largest since the end of the cold war, Russia made clear its displeasure at what it saw as an anti-Russian show of force on its doorstep, warning that Nato’s gesture would not go unanswered. It subsequently announced plans to test missiles in the same area during the Nato manoeuvres.Finland is not a member of the Nato military alliance but took part in the Norway exercises under the status of “enhanced opportunities partner”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d787a29b0423d3720b98a23b04fd0965bd7285a/0_306_3058_1834/master/3058.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f6ab39043cbf645b04bb90bcd250bacd","title":"armistice day is marked around the world in pictures","story":"100 years since end of first world war marked by silence"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3695515.1542053378!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"fewer additional women may be involved in cervicalcheck controversy than thought","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDr Gabriel Scally, who carried out the scoping inquiry into the controversy, has issued a clarification. Photograph: Dara Mac Dónaill Fewer additional women may be caught up in the CervicalCheck controversy than was previously thought after the HSE clarified the criteria it used for determining whether women were affected.Some 221 women who contracted cervical cancer subsequently had their smear reviewed, and these reviews produced a different result. This was the main criterion used by the HSE to assess the number of women affected.This number is expected to rise as more women’s slides are reviewed and the outcome is compared to the original result. However, the number of additional cases may be less than previously thought after it emerged that the HSE did not apply a time cut-off to exclude some cases from the group.Dr Gabriel Scally, the doctor who carried out the scoping inquiry into the controversy, has issued a “clarification” in which he accepts he was mistaken in his report in believing the HSE applied a cut-off.It had been believed CervicalCheck applied an 18-month cut-off to decide whether women should be included in the “221 group”. So if more than 18 months had passed between a smear test and a woman’s cancer diagnosis, she was included in the group as the management of her case may have been affected.In his report published in October, Dr Scally described the 18-month cut-off as “undoubtedly flawed” and said it was “hard to see the logic for this”. He repeated his criticism at the Oireachtas health committee where he said it varied from the practice in other countries.“It was basically stating that if the missing of the abnormality occurred 12 months before she was diagnosed with cancer, it would not have made any difference to the final outcome, whereas if it had occurred 20 months before it, it would have,” Dr Karin Denton, a UK scientist who worked with Dr Scally on the scoping inquiry, told the committee.Dr Scally has written to the chair of the committee, Dr Michael Harty, and issued a clarification on his website. He said it was “unfortunate” the 18-month figure was relied upon for his report, but it is “welcome news that the situation has been clarified and that our concerns about the adoption of an unsustainable cut-off point were not, in fact, based on the true situation”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3695531.1542054218!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"cork city council to extend free parking in bid to boost trade","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tCork City Council has acted in response to claims that an afternoon ban on private cars is affecting city centre businesses. File photograph: Google Street ViewCork City Council has agreed to extend free parking incentive in its two publicly owned car parks to encourage more people into the city centre amid claims that an afternoon ban on private cars is affecting city centre businesses.Fianna Fáil Cllr Tim Brosnan had called for an immediate suspension of the 3-6pm ban on private cars on the city’s main thoroughfare Patrick Street from now until after mid January amid claims from several city centre traders that the car ban was having a disastrous effect on business.But the overwhelming majority of traders were in favour of the ban on private cars after hearing that the move which was aimed at giving priority to bus movements across the city centre had resulted in improved bus travel times and increased usage of public transport.Moreover, they backed a proposal from Cork City chief executive Ann Doherty drawn up in conjunction with the Core group which represents retail and hospitality interests, Bus Éireann, An Garda Síochána and Cork City Council, to extend free parking measures to attract more people into the city by night.“Late evening shopping is an important part of the offering in a modern city and serves not only to better meet the needs of more shoppers but also improve animation and broaden the attractiveness of the city centre to the benefit of all businesses,” she said. It was with this in mind that she was proposing the provision of free parking from 5pm to 9.30pm on Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights at the council owned Paul Street and North Main Street car parks which together have more than 1,100 parking space and councillors agreed to the proposal.Cork City Council director of services roads and transportation Gerry O’Beirne prepared a report in which he detailed figures from Bus Éireann. These showed a 14 per cent year on year increase in numbers using the company’s services in the city since the introduction of the private car ban on August 9th.According to Mr O’Beirne, Bus Éireann estimates that it had carried 311,000 more passengers on its services in the 12-week period from August 9th to October 31st, compared to the same period in 2017 when private cars were allowed on Patrick Street with journey times on city centre routes improving.Cllr Brosnan had called for a suspension of the private car ban, saying that the feedback he was getting from some traders was that “everything is not rosy in the garden”. And he would like some hard data on footfall to allow councillors evaluate the merit of the Patrick Street car ban.He said there was ambiguity about its impact with some traders suggesting it was having a detrimental impact. And there was clear confusion about its enforcement in that some days it was being enforced and other days it was not and in those circumstances it should be suspended until after Christmas.However, virtually every other councillor who spoke urged support for the Patrick Street private car ban with Cllr Ted Tynan of the Workers Party suggesting Cork follow the example of Dunkirk in France which had seen footfall increase hugely after it introduced free bus services for all accessing the city centre.Cllr Chris O’Leary of Sinn Féin who chaired the Core group said that taking cars out of the city centre was the way forward and he criticised some traders who seemed to be seeking to get the city council to indemnify them against any loss in business due to the private car ban.Cllr Des Cahill of Fine Gael pointed out several surveys had found that more than 60 per cent of traffic going through Cork city centre was not stopping there but simply using it as an access route. So it made sense to introduce an afternoon private car ban to give priority to public transport into and form the city centre.Cllr Tom O’Driscoll of Fianna Fáil said he believed that the reported drop in trade by some businesses was more complex than just the private car ban on Patrick Street. And he pointed to the fact that increasingly people and especially young people are opting to shop online."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3695395.1542045404!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"uncertainty for family living in republic but working in the north","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLife in the Border village of Muff, Co Donegal is becoming increasingly uncertain in the face of BrexitFor Ruairí O’Kane, moving from Derry City in Northern Ireland to the Border village of Muff, Co Donegal, gave him and his wife Alicia “the best of both worlds”.“You come out on to the main street and turn left, and you can head to Inishowen and the beaches and the pubs, or turn right and you’re into Derry and you have the nice city lifestyle. It was just the ideal place to live.“Now you’re thinking about what the post-Brexit scenario will be,” says O’Kane.When he moved 10 years ago, the Border simply was not a consideration.“At the time the houses were much bigger than you could get in Derry for the same value, and there was a better exchange rate, and the whole way of living felt somehow quieter here.“OK, you’ve got your euro wallet and your sterling one but there’s not much of a ide between the two, and that’s why a lot of people moved here in the first place.”O’Kane, who works in PR in Belfast, crosses the Border each day to go to work his wife does the same.As well as financial concerns – the family has two salaries in sterling and a mortgage in euro – O’Kane is worried about potential restrictions on travel.“I’m someone who remembers what the checkpoints were like. Today I could easily cross the Border four, six times a day and do that freely.“Now I’m thinking, even just to visit the shop or go to a relative’s house, there might be a whole hassle to get into Derry.”Now father to a five-month-old son, Lúcás – born in Derry’s Altnagelvin hospital – O’Kane also has questions over continued access to healthcare and education.“I’ve always worked in the UK my whole life and I’m entitled to healthcare in the North, but now you’re thinking, will that still be available if you do need to get to the doctor’s?“Altnagelvin is the main hospital in the northwest, how easy will it be to go there if you’ve a Donegal address? It’s a whole unknown, nobody quite knows how these things will work out because we never had to think about it before.“The Border never existed, well it did physically for a time but it wasn’t there in people’s minds.”O’Kane has another question mark over his pension.“I’m wondering am I still entitled to my state pension – which is a UK state pension – and wondering what will I get, and will I get something that was as good as what I was once promised?“It’s the uncertainty not just for your state pension but also for your private one as well, because they prefer you to have a UK address, so how that might work or sort itself out when you’re in Donegal is a worry.”Like many who moved from Northern Ireland, O’Kane has considered moving back across the Border.“It’s certainly a thought but there are other practical considerations, such as if we were to sell the house would we get what we paid for it, so we probably couldn’t afford to move back into Derry.“Obviously with the wee one we’re thinking about schools and all the rest for him as well.“I know other people are selling up and moving across and it’s a shame because these little Border places were just the ideal place to live and raise a family.“We feel frustrated, but we also feel let down because people in the North voted to stay in Europe, and if anyone knows the benefit of being part of Europe it’s us.“You feel this is something that has happened to you against your will – all because certain groups of people in England don’t like living next door to people from foreign countries – and we’re the ones bearing the brunt of it.”"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000140439032_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"parliament accused conflict interest rejects nda debate","story":"John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, refused to allow Maria Miller to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerfulHouse of CommonsMaria Miller, the Tory MP, last night accused Parliament of a conflict of interest over Britain\u0027s MeToo scandal after it emerged she had been blocked from questioning the Government over it.The Daily  can reveal John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, yesterday refused to allow Ms Miller, who chairs the women \u0026amp equalities Commons select committee, to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerful, including the Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green.Helen Jones, chairman of the petitions select committee, also rejected calls to allow a parliamentary debate on non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) after two separate petitions demanding a change to the law between them secured 250,000 signatures. It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

playacting hampered official fifa study concussion","story":"Nordin Amrabat was one player who suffered concussion during the World Cup Footballers\u0027 feigning injury hampered an official FIFA study into concussion during last summer\u0027s World Cup, a new report has found.Researchers who reviewed every head injury incident during games in Russia found new concussion protocols were ineffective in almost two thirds of matches at the tournament.New rules allowed referees to stop a game for three minutes while players with signs of concussion received treatment from a physiotherapist. They also allowed a second medic to view replays and assist with decision making.But the study pointed out that gamesmanship was a limitation to the work. The study, published in the journal Jama Neurology, said video observation was insufficient to diagnose a concussion as some players may have been feigning injury.Overall, the rate of teams failing to follow guidelines after head clashes was marginally higher than the previous World Cup in 2014, when concussion was a major controversy.In the 2014 final, Germany midfielder Christoph Kramer collapsed 14 minutes after being involved in a collision, saying afterwards: “I don’t know anything from the first half.”The furore prompted Fifa to change its head-injury protocols in time for this summer’s tournament, but ignored calls for rugby-style concussion time-outs.Germany\u0026#39s Christoph Kramer leaves the pitch after being injured during their 2014 World Cup final against Argentina The report, by the New York Hospital for Special Surgery, found that in 20 per cent of potential concussion incidents in Russia, players were only assessed by a teammate or not looked at at all.When evaluation did occur, the average length of on-field assessment was less than one minute and not standardised. It appears that Fifa\u0027s concussion policy changes did not lead to enhanced concussion management on the field, and its absence has thus rendered these policy changes ineffective.He added: Furthermore, health care personnel cannot reliably distinguish a concussion from gamesmanship without evaluating the player. Thus, all players should be evaluated when exhibiting signs of concussion.One a player has been looked at by physios, they can only continue with their permission.Four trained reviewers identified head collisions through review of video footage of all 64 games of the tournament for the study.A total of 95 players suffered 115 head clashes across 111 incidents during the tournament. Some 90 players showed two or more signs of concussion, but only 33 of those were evaluated by a physiotherapist, the research found.Of the rest, 39 were evaluated by the referee and 18 were checked over by another player or not at all.Symptoms outlined by Fifa included disorientation, clutching of the head, a loss of balance and more than five seconds on the ground after contact.Others include a blank or vacant look, visible facial injury, loss of consciousness or unresponsiveness, motor incoordination and impact seizure.Dr Premkumar said: Concussion assessment and management in international football continues to have significant room for improvement.Please review our commenting policyComment: The UK should offer safe haven to Asia Bibi, and persecuted Christians like herSchools should not attempt to diagnose children with mental health disorders,  Government adviser saysPolice investigating sexual misconduct claims against Alex Salmond \u0026#39probing alleged incident at Edinburgh Airport\u0026#39University lecturer confronted with empty hall after none of her 400 students turns upHillary Clinton will run for the White House in 2020, ex-adviser predictsStop brushing your pets\u0026#39 teeth with toothpaste, RSPCA tells dog ownersSocial media algorithms aimed at addicts to be targeted in government crackdown, says digital ministerKremlin-backed candidate elected leader of breakaway Donetsk republic \u0026#39Please don\u0026#39t let me die like this\u0026#39: Survivors of California fires tell of horror blazes that left 31 deadHorst Seehofer stands down as head of Angela Merkel\u0026#39s Bavarian sister party after heavy election lossesNational Trust tells properties to stick with \u0026#39Anno Domini\u0026#39 after historic site opts for \u0026#39mindless\u0026#39 modern versionHow liberal prostitution laws have made Switzerland a hub for sex traffickingTalking Strictly podcast: Danny John-Jules, Kate Silverton and Ashley Roberts discuss the joy and strain of StrictlyChina shows off stealth fighter as it unveils new laser weapon that can shoot down missiles and spy planesHunt urges Saudi Arabia to \u0026#39seize the moment\u0026#39 and end Yemen war\u0026#39Controversial ideas\u0026#39 journal where academics can publish under pseudonyms for fear of backlashDowning Street says reports of a Brexit deal should be \u0026#39taken with a bucket of salt\u0026#39\u0026#39British tip-off\u0026#39 led to arrest of retired Austrian colonel suspected of spying for RussiaComment: Gordon Brown thinks a second referendum on Brexit is a good idea.

That decision is final,” he told a press conference in Saxony. “My office as interior minister is completely unaffected by this. I will continue to serve.”Mr Seehofer has been under pressure to resign as party leader since the CSU suffered heavy losses in regional elections in Bavaria last month.Whether he can stay on as interior minister will depend on whether his party backs him to remain in the role or decides his time in frontline politics is over.By standing down as leader but attempting to stay on in government he is emulating Mrs Merkel, who announced last month she would step down as leader of her Christian Democrat party (CDU) but wants to serve out her final term as chancellor. Long known for his personal rivalry with Mrs Merkel, Mr Seehofer brought her coalition government to the brink of collapse in a power struggle over migrant policy earlier this year.Angela Merkel and Horst Seehofer look at their watches after they and other members of the government posed for a group photo during two-day retreat at the government guest house Meseberg castle in April His threat to pull the CSU out of the coalition unless Mrs Merkel agreed to his demand to turn back migrants at the German border was widely seen as an attempt to head off the challenge from the nationalist Alternative for Germany party (AfD) in Bavarian regional elections.But it backfired spectacularly. The CSU lost votes to the pro-migrant Greens as well as the AfD, and voters said they were unhappy with the turmoil in Berlin.Mr Seehofer appears to have finished Mrs Merkel’s political career at the cost of his own. According to German press reports, he agreed to step down as CSU leader at a tense party meeting on Sunday night.Senior party figures were said to be ready to tell Mr Seehofer he had to go if he did not agree. “They had the daggers in their robes, but they didn’t have to pull them out,” Bild newspaper commented.But Mr Seehofer yesterday (MON) denied reports he had also agreed to stand down as interior minister.Opposition parties on Monday called for him to resign from the government. “Every day Horst Seehofer remains interior minister is a day too long,” Katrin Göring-Eckardt of the Green Party said.Mrs Merkel and her main coalition partner, the Social Democrats (SPD), may well agree, after months of bitter disputes with Mr Seehofer.But while ministerial appointments are theoretically in Mrs Merkel’s gift, she cannot afford to anger a coalition partner by rejecting its nominee for a post.It remains to be seen whether the CSU will be prepared to continue to back Mr Seehofer as interior minister.The party will choose a new leader early next year. The main candidates are expected to be Markus Söder, the regional prime minister of Bavaria, and Manfred Weber, who is leading the conservative European People’s Party (EPP) faction in next year’s European parliament elections and could become the next president of the European Commission.Please review our commenting policyComment: The UK should offer safe haven to Asia Bibi, and persecuted Christians like herSchools should not attempt to diagnose children with mental health disorders,  Government adviser saysPolice investigating sexual misconduct claims against Alex Salmond \u0026#39probing alleged incident at Edinburgh Airport\u0026#39University lecturer confronted with empty hall after none of her 400 students turns upHillary Clinton will run for the White House in 2020, ex-adviser predictsStop brushing your pets\u0026#39 teeth with toothpaste, RSPCA tells dog ownersSocial media algorithms aimed at addicts to be targeted in government crackdown, says digital ministerKremlin-backed candidate elected leader of breakaway Donetsk republic \u0026#39Please don\u0026#39t let me die like this\u0026#39: Survivors of California fires tell of horror blazes that left 31 deadFootballers\u0026#39 playacting hampered official FIFA study into concussion during World Cup, report saysNational Trust tells properties to stick with \u0026#39Anno Domini\u0026#39 after historic site opts for \u0026#39mindless\u0026#39 modern versionHow liberal prostitution laws have made Switzerland a hub for sex traffickingTalking Strictly podcast: Danny John-Jules, Kate Silverton and Ashley Roberts discuss the joy and strain of StrictlyChina shows off stealth fighter as it unveils new laser weapon that can shoot down missiles and spy planesHunt urges Saudi Arabia to \u0026#39seize the moment\u0026#39 and end Yemen war\u0026#39Controversial ideas\u0026#39 journal where academics can publish under pseudonyms for fear of backlashDowning Street says reports of a Brexit deal should be \u0026#39taken with a bucket of salt\u0026#39\u0026#39British tip-off\u0026#39 led to arrest of retired Austrian colonel suspected of spying for RussiaComment: Gordon Brown thinks a second referendum on Brexit is a good idea.

SportSocial media algorithms which bombard addicts with ads and videos will be targeted in a government crackdown, the digital minister has said.Margot James, who is one of the ministers drawing new regulations for tech companies, singled out features that target users with more and more extreme content as the “nub of many of our problems with social media”.Appearing in front of the House of Lords Communications Committee yesterday, she said she was making such algorithms a focus of the government’s forthcoming white paper on social media regulation.Her comments came after she was asked by the children’s rights campaigner, Baroness Kidron, about social media companies using features that “create compulsion”.Ms James said: “I think you touch on something that is really at the nub of many of our problems with social media platforms really.Ms James appearing in front of the House of Lords Communications Committee today“If you are keying in weight loss or something into YouTube, or another platform, you then get bombarded with great volumes of the same material.“Of course if someone is vulnerable, has any mental health problems or any addition, that can make the situation very much worse.She added: “These algorithms need far greater transparency and companies need to be held more to account for their deployment”.The Department of Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS), is

By mid-December, one bitcoin was worth close to $20,000 (£15,000), but that was the high water mark before the tide turned.A year later, bitcoin is trading at around a third of its peak value but some cryptocurrency analysts believe the market might be on the verge of mirroring the gains it experienced in late 2017. The only caveat is that it might not be bitcoin that leads the charge this time.Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne, who was behind the online retail giant becoming\u0026nbspone of the first places to accept bitcoin back in 2014, said\u0026nbspthat he still expects\u0026nbspthe mass adoption of cryptocurrency, without specifying\u0026nbspwhich one.Speaking to bitcoin enthusiast Naomi Brockwell on her YouTube channel, Mr Byrne said he remained highly sceptical of the traditional financial system. When asked if he saw bitcoin becoming a worldwide currency, he pointed to countries like Venezuela that have experienced significant financial turmoil in recent years.When people start getting into it is when their own financial systems collapse, he said.

So at this stage, it’s difficult to predict exactly what will happen.Looking longer term, Mr Ostler said bitcoin is expected to experience steady growth over the next year, with the panel of experts predicting an average\u0026nbspvalue of $16,732 by the end of 2019. “With bitcoin being very stable and within a range between $6,800 and $6,100, it is hard to suggest anything will change until it breaks this range, said cryptocurrency trader Craig Cobb, who forms part of the panel.leveled out in recent months (CoinMarketCap)But if it\u0027s not bitcoin, a\u0026nbsphint at what this next break-out cryptocurrency might be was given earlier this week by Blockchain, the world\u0027s most popular bitcoin wallet.

Celebrating Macron’s pro-Europeanism, Germany’s Handelsblatt\u0026nbspnewspaper wrote:\u0026nbsp“There is renewed hope for the European project.”\u0026nbspThe Economist’s cover showed Macron walking on water.Macron stirred anticipation that he would revive the moribund French economy and, from that position of domestic strength, he would bring new vigour to European integration.Instead, just 18 months later, his approval rating has fallen below 30 per cent. Polls are beginning to reflect those low personal approval ratings. Even as Macron is making grand plans to lead a new political force into the European parliament next year, his Achilles heel at home continues to undermine him.Why Italy could be facing a disastrous new recessionIn May, the Macron-led La République En Marche! (LREM)Mouvement Democrate\u0026nbsp(MoDem), with an expected vote share of 27 per cent, was 10 points ahead of the far-right Rassemblement National (RN) now, the LREMMoDem predicted vote share at 19 per cent is behind RN’s 21 per cent.Although still lauded abroad, Macron’s domestic fortunes have slid because he has followed dubious “trickle-down” policies, which have repeatedly failed to rekindle optimism among citizens who face economic hardship and uncertainty. Hence, somewhat opportunistically, Macron has sought to appease anxious domestic constituencies with narrow nationalistic polices.These have also put paid to any likelihood of promoting a pro-European agenda. Macron would do well to heed the lessons from Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi’s descent into the political abyss.Renzi was also 39 years old when he became prime minister. German chancellor Angela Merkel applauded him as a “matador”. He played to that hype, dressing as a cool rebel in jeans and trademark leather jacket.He bragged that a dynamic Italy would act as “one of Europe’s leaders”.\u0026nbsp saw Renzi as the man who would “save Europe’s soul”. But Renzi also adopted failed domestic policy approaches and undermined the coalitions needed to advance his agenda.Common to both of them, and ultimately the source of their undoing, Macron and, even more so, Renzi were dealt difficult hands. They inherited poorly performing economies that bred widespread social and political discontent.French per capita incomes have remained flat since the onset of the global financial crisis in 2007 the unemployment rate is just under 9 per cent and youth unemployment is endemic.For most French citizens, the education system does little to help them climb the economic ladder. In all these respects, the Italian problems run much deeper. There is little evidence that Macron’s policies will promote growth. He uses a worn mantra to make a bold claim for his tax breaks for wealthy French citizens: “If you want to share the cake, the first condition is to have a cake.”Whether tax cuts spur growth is unclear, but they always increase the sense of unfairness. Macron’s labour market “reforms”,\u0026nbspwhich make it easier to fire workers, add precarious jobs with short contracts, ranging from a few months to a few hours. Businesses lose the incentive to invest in their employees, and productivity growth declines. The sense of social injustice and economic vulnerability deepens. And now, his proposed environmentally friendly diesel tax has raised a new storm.The conservative opposition leader, Laurent Wauquiez was quick to tap into domestic angst: “You have to be completely out of touch with reality not to understand that taxing fuel is taxing those French who work.”\u0026nbspNationwide blockades planned for Saturday\u0026nbspare supported by 78 per cent of French citizens. Stuck with the “president of the rich” label,\u0026nbspMacron’s base of supporters has narrowed to successful educated professionals working and living in metropolitan cities.Brexit is a done deal – but the wounds that led to it have not healedDespite his youth, he struggles to attract French youth. The Macron government’s efforts to inject greater equity into the educational system is the best hope for growth and greater equality. Revamping the educational system is a generational task, however. The task is made harder by the political inability to cut back entrenched entitlements and reallocate government expenditure to education.Hence, the prospect that Macron would be a European saviour was always far-fetched. Despite his much-hyped speeches, Macron has approached European integration with an eye to political gains at home.That has predictably deepened European isions. He has alienated eastern European governments by trying to restrict “posted workers”, typically employees of eastern European service providers. Although the numbers of such workers is trivially small, Macron has made the claim that their somewhat smaller pay package constituted “social dumping”,\u0026nbspand therefore hurt French workers.On the bitterly isive issue of migration, French police board trains arriving from Italy to search for and remove migrants, depositing them back at the Italian border.Search of arriving trains also undermines the Schengen system of passport-free travel across Europe. Macron’s recent sermon against an “ultra-liberal” Europe is another effort to regain domestic political support. His throwaway, “we need a Europe that protects”, either is just a slogan or requires fundamentally rethinking Europe’s open borders.Making matters worse, by cynically hectoring Italian leaders for failing to fulfil their humanitarian responsibilities to migrants and by accusing eastern European leaders of promoting their national self-interest, Macron has worsened the hugely difficult problem of sharing migrants among European nations. With diminished domestic stature and few European allies, Macron’s much-touted initiative to strengthen the eurozone’s defences during financial crises has predictably run aground.Although German chancellor Angela Merkel has agreed, in principle, to cooperate with Macron, resurgent German nationalism and opposition from within her conservative caucus severely limit what she can do. Other fiscally hawkish “northern” eurozone countries, notably the Netherlands, and Eastern European nations have opposed any initiative that would require them to finance other European governments. Renzi’s European agenda was limited but legitimate: he wanted to soften the fiscal rules that require austerity during economic recessions and, hence, make recessions worse. However, the hallowed rules remained firmly lodged on their pedestal.Creating a coalition to change Europe is nearly impossible. However, as in Macron’s case, Renzi’s real failure was at home, where he too followed the traditional European recipe of “labour reforms”.\u0026nbspHe lost domestic support rapidly, especially among young Italians. Suffering high rates of unemployment from Italy’s brutal economic downturn, few Italians believed that the increasing number of highly insecure new jobs would be stepping-stones to stable incomes. Renzi’s end came quickly.In a December 2016 referendum to endorse his proposed constitutional reforms, Italian citizens humiliated Renzi, leading to his resignation. Around 80 per cent of those between the ages of eighteen and twenty-four voted against him.Macron enjoys important institutional advantages relative to Renzi. As president with a five-year term and a solid parliamentary backing, he remains in charge. But the very brashness that led to his dazzling ascent is causing even his most fervent admirers to part ways with him. Most recently, interior minister Gerard Collomb, France’s “top cop”, resigned after a public spat with Macron. The departing Collomb castigated Macron for “hubris” and “lack of humility.”On economic policy, Macron’s well-wishers Jean Pisani-Ferry and Philippe Martin have warned that he needs to deal more directly with inequality and the widespread sense of lack of fairness. Macron needs to change both style and policy priorities. Otherwise\u0026nbspFrance’s delicate social fabric will fray further, and in the manner of many predecessors since the illustrious Charles de Gaulle, Macron could abruptly lose all political effectiveness.Ominously, Macron’s predecessor, Francois Hollande, was humiliated in the European parliamentary elections in 2014, a setback from which he never recovered. The looming European parliamentary elections in May 2019 – on which Macron has set such great store – could prove his undoing.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Shoppers are increasingly staying home and ordering online“Help,” cried the retail industry.No wonder. Ten years ago this month Woolworths went pop. Dark clouds seem to have been bubbling and spitting over the high street ever since. That was underlined by a report by PricewaterhouseCoopers, the professional services firm, showing that a net 1,123 stores vanished from Britain’s top 500 high streets in the first six months of this year.\u0026nbspThe numbers probably won’t surprise anyone given the high-pocalypse we’ve witnessed among some of retail’s biggest names this year, including the likes of Toys ‘R’Us, Maplin, Poundworld and House of Fraser.\u0026nbspBritish high street is losing 14 shops a day, new research showsTowns with ‘unhealthy’ high streets have lower life expectancyWhy the death of the high street is good for men – and bad for womenHowever, closures have actually been outstripping new openings since 2010, and the gap is widening.Of course, the British Retail Consortium steamed in with a call for the government to take urgent action on business rates, beyond the tinkering contained in the chancellor’s recent budget.\u0026nbspThe levy is linked to property values and so hits bricks and mortar operators a lot harder than online outfits, which run their operations from out of town in places where you can buy land for a handful of coppers and a Mars bar.\u0026nbspIt has become the industry’s bête noire, and the trade body wouldn’t be doing its job if it didn’t make a fuss about it.

The number is set to increase to 30 per cent by 2021. That says it all.So does this mean the high street is in terminal decline? Are the debates over its future worthless?\u0026nbspNot necessarily. Hooker made note of the fact that all the reliable surveys show that there is still a demand for bricks and mortar shops.\u0026nbspConsumers\u0026nbspjust use them less than they used to, and they want them to operate differently, alongside and as a complement\u0026nbspto their online excursions.\u0026nbspThat means the future will have to be made up of smaller premises that operate as mini showrooms, alongside “experience”\u0026nbspretailers such as vape shops and ice cream parlours, which have been doing well.

They are also finding it harder to retain the staff they have\u0026nbsp(34 per cent reported difficulties in this area, up from 27 per cent six months ago).\u0026nbspThe cause of these problems isn’t hard to ine. The number of non UK-born workers coming in fell by 58,000 in the 12 months to June 2018. Despite Theresa May’s empty sloganeering about the creation of a Global Britain, the foul smell of her hostile environment migration policy persists. The lion’s share of the decline was made up of non EU-born workers, the number of which coming into the UK fell by 40,000 during the period in question.\u0026nbspMinister u-turns after claims firms to check EU citizens’ statusHome Office ‘risking repeat of Windrush scandal for EU citizens’Government report could end low skilled migration if accepted Hear, hear, a legion of lumpen trolls rumble. Cuz that means higher wages and more opportunities for the natives!Erm, not quite. Let’s look at some more of those inconvenient things called facts that are the stock in trade of the CIPD’s output.\u0026nbspThe report does point to stronger wage growth for some staff, and for new hires. But it is limited and the overall outlook for wage growth remains unchanged for the majority of UK’s workforce. The median (most common) basic pay rise expectation in the 12 months to September 2019 remains stuck at about\u0026nbsp2 per cent, unchanged when compared to three months ago, and below the rate of inflation.Part of the explanation for this may lie in the weak productivity growth that continues to dog the UK. May’s government has been making a lot of noise about addressing it\u0026nbspbut to little apparent effect. \u0026nbspThe survey data also suggests, however, that Brexit is acting as a brake on basic pay growth for a small but growing proportion of employers. They’re choosing to batten down the hatches and hoard their money as opposed to investing it in their staff, or in anything else for that matter. Given the chaos that will result from the no-deal outcome that appears ever more likely, who could blame them?The upshot of all this is that the benefits claimed by advocates of reducing migration – more jobs, higher wages – are not being realised by British workers.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Coca-Cola has paid £3.9bn for Costa Coffee.

As the survey makes clear, they are suffering from rapidly escalating workloads as businesses, faced with the requirement to keep customers happy and their operations moving, respond to the labour market squeeze by adding to the\u0026nbsppressure lumped upon their existing staff.\u0026nbspLong term wages will go up and it’ll all sort itself out, you’ll see, is what the Brexiteers would have you believe despite not having anything resembling evidence to back up their claims.

For example, one school had five separate isolation rooms, each permanently staffed at an annual cost of more than £170,000.Another requires children to spend nine hours in isolation –\u0026nbspthe school day plus an hour’s detention.One child claimed he had spent three months on his own in a classroom last year where his work was rarely marked and he was often without a teacher.However his school said\u0026nbsphe was “regularly disruptive” and it disputed\u0026nbspthe length of time he spent there. The school also\u0026nbspsaid the room was not specifically used for isolation.Paul Dix, a behaviour consultant in schools across England told BBC News: “That is not education, it is a custodial sentence.”He added that he has seen 50 children at one time in isolation in one school – and he had heard of pupils being placed into isolation for not bringing in a pen or for not wearing the right shoes.\u0026nbspMr Dix recognises that disruptive pupils may need to be removed from classrooms – but he believes they should be returned after a short period and their behaviour should be discussed with a teacher.“Sticking children in isolation is desperation,” he said. “Where’s the regulation around it, where’s the reporting, where is the accountability?”The Children’s Commissioner for England, Anne Longfield, has also warned that school isolation can be “distressing and degrading” and she has said that it is “a gateway to excluding and off-rolling”.But Tom Bennett, the independent adviser on behaviour to the Department for Education (DfE), argues that\u0026nbsp isolation can be effective in tackling disruption in classrooms.He told BBC News: “When you’re a lone adult with a class of 25 pupils, it only takes two people to really persistently wilfully misbehave for that lesson to be completely detonated.“It can be a way of preventing fixed-term exclusions by keeping them in the school and being looked after by the school because a lot of the kids we teach are at risk of joining gangs or they might be at risk of going home to abuse so for a lot of children you don’t want to be sending them home.”Government guidance says schools are free to decide how long pupils should be kept in isolation but time should be spent “as constructively as possible”.The DfE says children should be in isolation no longer than is necessary and that the health, safety and welfare of pupils must always be put first.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Berlin Mayor Michael Mueller (centre) welcomes Madrid Mayor Manuela Carmena (left) and London Mayor Sadiq Khan at City Hall in Berlin.

It\u0027s very much a continuation of the styling OnePlus used on the OnePlus 6 earlier in the year. That was the first to break with the metal-back styling of phones since the OnePlus 3 and opt for a glass enclosure front and rear.\u0026nbspThis looks as smart and stylish as the last model – which is very stylish, by the way –\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspalthough it\u0027s a little thicker from front to back (8.2mm instead of the OnePlus 6\u0027s 7.8mm), it feels very comfortable in the hand, not least because it\u0027s narrower than the last model.Still, it squeezes in a bigger 6.4-inch display\u0026nbspbecause the screen proportions are different: This is a 19.5:9 ratio screen. There\u0027s a notch at the top, but it\u0027s pretty minimal, like a drop of water when it\u0027s just about to gain enough critical mass to drip from the bathroom tap, no bigger than that. It looks cute.This teardrop notch is one obvious change. The second comes when you flip the phone over. Unlike on the OnePlus 6, there\u0027s no fingerprint sensor just below the dual cameras.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 42Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.5G wireless internet is expected to launch in 2019, with the potential to reach speeds of 50mbsUber has halted testing of driverless vehicles after a woman was killed by one of their cars in Tempe, Arizona.

Pick up the phone and the fingerprint icon lights up on the dark screen. Touch it, and it responds with a neat animation, like a fizzing electrical sphere, and unlocks to the home screen. It feels like the future.Huawei has a similar technology, though a less glitzy special effect, on the Huawei Mate 20. Huawei\u0027s feels just that bit quicker, but this is far from slow. It\u0027s not as fast as a conventional fingerprint sensor, but at least there\u0027s the cute animation to entertain you –\u0026nbspand it\u0027s still only a fraction of a second.Also, it sits in just the perfect place, right at the bottom of the display, in the middle, while the Mate 20 Pro sensor is quite a bit higher.That other Chinese brand, Xiaomi, also has an in-screen fingerprint sensor on its new Mi 8 Pro handset, though that requires a little more pressure.Top tip: when you\u0027re enrolling your fingerprint, think about what angle you\u0027ll actually be unlocking it from. My vertical thumb print wasn\u0027t very effective. I registered it again coming at it from the angle that it turns out I would actually pick the phone up by and it worked like a dream.OnePlus has beaten smartphone heavyweights Apple and Samsung to introduce an in-screen fingerprint sensor (OnePlus)Overall, the fingerprint unlock is pretty reliable, though it doesn\u0027t work as consistently as, say, Face ID on the iPhone XS. But it does the job more than nine times out of ten, so enough to keep you coming back to it rather than turning to the other ways to unlock the phone, such as facial recognition (consistent but not as much fun) or tapping in a PIN code.When it unlocks, you get to see the display in all its glory. It covers 86 per cent of the front of the phone. You can even obscure the notch if you want, or at least set it so the display colours itself black on either side of it, so it blends in. But with such a pretty notch, why would you hide it? Well, only because it gives the screen a little more symmetry, near-matching bezels at top and bottom, it suddenly looks like.The 6.41-inch display on this phone is bright and colourful, looking eye-searingly vivid in some wallpapers (which I love the look of, by the way). The wallpapers even bear the OnePlus slogan of Never Settle, a reminder of the plucky Chinese brand\u0027s positive attitude.It\u0027s a pin-sharp OLED screen, with 401 pixels per inch, that\u0027s the same as the iPhone 8 Plus and rather more than the iPhone XR. And it has OnePlus specialities like reading mode which turns the screen monochrome as though it were a Kindle.\u0026nbspIt completely dominates the front of the phone and you\u0027ll be glad to know it\u0027s robust –\u0026nbspit\u0027s made of Gorilla Glass 6.OnePlus mobile phones are seen on display during a press briefing in Mumbai, India, July 31, 2018 (REUTERSFrancis Mascarenhas)As far as the rear of the phone is concerned, there are two finishes to choose from, Midnight Black (it means matte black) and Mirror Black (it means, oh, you can work it out). Both are attractive.One of the most interesting things about the design is what\u0027s not there:\u0026nbspThe headphone jack. OnePlus is hardly alone in dropping this connection but nonetheless it\u0027s something that many fans have not been happy about, not least because the company championed the headphone jack one the OnePlus 6. Mind you, it means the phone has a bigger battery than last time, which on balance, is a decent trade-off.OnePlus hasn\u0027t introduced waterproofing here, either, something which is a real boon in technology generally. So, don\u0027t drop it in the bath. And, be warned, this phone can feel slippy in the hand.Something else that\u0027s absent is wireless charging. Now, scores of phones have had this capability and until recently it\u0027s gone largely unused. But the truth is that wireless charging pads are an unsung hero of the tech world, providing a genuine improvement in convenience that, once used, is hard to give up on.Wireless charging is especially good at disguising limited battery life because the simplicity of putting it on a pad feels much less of a commitment than digging out the right cable and plugging it in.So, although the company hasn\u0027t ruled wireless charging out for future phones, it\u0027s a shame it\u0027s not here now. Especially as the rear of the phone is glass, not metal.\u0026nbspStill, OnePlus prides itself on charging the battery fast, and that\u0027s definitely the case with the OnePlus 6T, which quickly goes from empty to enough to get through a day in around half an hour. That\u0027s part of the argument against wireless charging, of course, that it\u0027s not as fast.Battery life is strong with a full charge leaving you with a third of a battery by the end of the day, often more. As mentioned, this battery is bigger than on the OnePlus 6.Performance is good, too, thanks to the fast Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 chip and plenty of RAM to keep everything speeding along. It has the latest version of Android on board, Android Pie 9.0. OnePlus uses its own Oxygen OS set-up which is accessible and attractive.The camera is a crucial element on every smartphone now and I found the OnePlus 6T camera to be a moderate improvement on the last model. The hardware is the same, but algorithms and software have been enhanced to better photograph faces, text, food and night scenes, OnePlus says.The front camera is high-resolution, 16MP, and has similarly had a software uptick to make selfies sharper.The rear camera hardware is good - a pair of sensors with 16MP and 20MP resolution respectively - but sometimes I found the images were low on detail in places. Low light was less of a problem than on many phones but I didn\u0027t feel the camera quite on the level of the best in the market, such as the Huawei Mate 20 Pro and iPhone XS. Then again, those phones cost a lot more.Which is a part of the story for OnePlus. Although the latest phone is not as super-cheap as its handsets were when it first arrived on the scene, the price ticket here, £499, is impressive. Especially since the storage on board is 128GB, where many rivals have 64GB as standard, still.Camera apart, there\u0027s not much you miss out on with this phone (well, wireless charging and a headphone jack but they aren\u0027t dealbreakers) and there are some elements, such as the in-screen fingerprint sensor, which hardly any other phones can match. Add to that the strong performance, great battery life and fast recharge, and the OnePlus 6T is a deeply appealing choice.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It’s a wartime story in which, for a change, the men are relegated to supporting roles. It follows in a tradition of French rural family sagas like Jean De Florette or Manon Des Sources. The landscapes and the changing seasons play as much of a part in the story as the main characters.Dark River offers little such consolation. It has some lyrical and delicate moments but the mood is generally overwhelmingly bleak and lugubrious. Incest and abuse don’t leave much space for any comic interludes. This is a powerful film with a grinding intensity about it. Light relief it isn’t but Dark River still has quite an impact.Late on in Argentinean director Lucrecia Martel’s startling, highly original new feature, Zama, a character who has just had both his arms cut off, is advised to “shove your stumps in the sand … if you don’t bleed out, you’ll survive.” It’s a grisly, darkly humorous moment in a film that continually surprises us with both its brutality and its lyricism.The most dispiriting aspect of this otherwise enrapturing Oscar-nominated animated feature is that its storyline still seems so current. The film depicts an Afghan society in which women don’t have a face. It is set during the Taliban rule, which lasted from the mid-1990s until late 2001, but this doesn’t feel like a period piece. Seventeen years after the Taliban were ousted from power in Afghanistan following the US invasion, the plight of women in the country appears hardly to have improved. Spike Lee’s work sometimes risks sensory overload. He fires off so many different ideas and storytelling styles that audiences can become bamboozled by his scattergun approach. BlacKkKlansman is one of his very best films because the digressions are as entertaining as ever but don’t get in the way of the main story.Much of the pleasure in Aardman films has always lain in their gently ironic, Alan Bennett-like humour. They take very exotic characters and subject matter but then deal with them in a matter-of-fact fashion. They make a virtue out of their own relative modesty. Early Man isn’t the flashiest animated feature that you’ll see this year but it is certainly the most likeable. 717 Isle of DogsLike all of Wes Anderson’s work, Isle Of Dogs is very stylised, very offbeat and characterised by its extremely dry and often ironic humour. This Japanese-set stop-motion fable is also gorgeous to look at – packed full of intricate visual detail. It deals with some weighty themes (ethnic cleansing, fascism and corruption) but does so in an idiosyncratic fashion.817 Three Billboards Outside of Ebbing, MissouriWriter-director Martin McDonagh has a host of award-winning plays behind him but his movies haven’t always lived up to his stage work. This one certainly does. It shares some of the dark and nihilistic humour found in McDonagh’s previous film, Seven Psychopaths.In an era of wearisome poltergeist movies, haunted house stories and torture porn, A Quiet Place is a refreshingly pared-down and very original affair. Director John Krasinski relies on editing, sound effects and off-screen action to crank up the tension. We do see the creatures from time to time, sometimes even in extreme closeup. They are very grotesque, bigger versions of the polyp-like succubus which exploded out of John Hurt’s stomach in Alien. However, the most terrifying moments here come when the humans are waiting for them to appear, desperately hoping that they won’t. Lady Bird is one of the best American coming-of-age films since Barry Levinson’s Diner. Written and directed by Greta Gerwig, it offers an utterly winning mix of humour, poignancy and sharp-eyed social observation. Gerwig approaches her subject matter with the same tenderness and affectionate irony with which the adolescent Lady Bird regards Sacramento. Gerwig also shows Lady Bird’s heroism as the young heroine strives against the odds to become the very best version of herself she can be.If Phantom Thread is indeed Daniel Day-Lewis’s final film as an actor, he is going out on a wondrously bizarre note. This must be the oddest film in his career, one in which he gives a typically commanding but very idiosyncratic performance. Almost everything here is jarring – but generally in a very positive way. It is not so long ago that Paul Schrader seemed to be giving up on cinema. The American writer-director (whose credits include Taxi Driver, American Gigolo and Affliction) had taken to making movies like the sour Hollywood satire The Canyons with Lindsay Lohan and the cartoonishly violent Dog Eat Dog, shot cheaply, aimed at a VOD audience. The former had a montage of closed-down movie theatres. In interviews, Schrader struck a gloomy note about the future of the industry. This is why First Reformed is so refreshing. This is not just Schrader’s best film in a very long while. It is also a re-affirmation of the director’s belief in the medium.Oscar Wilde goes to ruin in Rupert Everett’s debut feature as director. Everett also wrote and stars in the film, giving a grandstanding performance as the Irish writer at the end of his life, after his release from prison, where he has been doing hard labour for “gross indecency”. This is a moving and surprising biopic that squeezes out every last drop of pathos from its subject matter. Black Panther is not only one of the most entertaining recent superhero films but has an intelligence and a political dimension that such inchoate offerings as Suicide Squad and Justice League completely lacked. It is an action movie which touches on Pan-Africanism and which owes as much to Malcolm X as it does to Batman or Captain America. Sicilian Ghost Story is a genre-bending affair that combines elements of teen romance, gothic psycho-drama and political thriller. It is loosely based on a true story of a boy called Giuseppe Di Matteo whose father, an ex-member of the Sicilian Mafia, turned “grass” against his erstwhile associates. The Mafia responded by kidnapping Giuseppe and keeping him in captivity for nearly 800 days. First Man is all about understated heroism. It’s affecting precisely because Armstrong (played with quiet intensity by Ryan Gosling) doesn’t feel the continual need to boast about his mission. The film is a tearjerker but a very subtle one. Dogman is one of the best Italian films of recent times, a modern day neo realist fable that bears comparison with the great work of Fellini, Rossellini, De Sica et al. Its main character, the dog groomer Marcello (Marcello Fonte), is a wonderful creation: loveable, vulnerable, seedy and comic all at the same time. From its slow-burning beginning, s develops into an epic melodrama. It’s a wartime story in which, for a change, the men are relegated to supporting roles. It follows in a tradition of French rural family sagas like Jean De Florette or Manon Des Sources. The landscapes and the changing seasons play as much of a part in the story as the main characters.Dark River offers little such consolation.

Early Man isn’t the flashiest animated feature that you’ll see this year but it is certainly the most likeable. 717 Isle of DogsLike all of Wes Anderson’s work, Isle Of Dogs is very stylised, very offbeat and characterised by its extremely dry and often ironic humour. This Japanese-set stop-motion fable is also gorgeous to look at – packed full of intricate visual detail. It deals with some weighty themes (ethnic cleansing, fascism and corruption) but does so in an idiosyncratic fashion.817 Three Billboards Outside of Ebbing, MissouriWriter-director Martin McDonagh has a host of award-winning plays behind him but his movies haven’t always lived up to his stage work. This one certainly does. It shares some of the dark and nihilistic humour found in McDonagh’s previous film, Seven Psychopaths.In an era of wearisome poltergeist movies, haunted house stories and torture porn, A Quiet Place is a refreshingly pared-down and very original affair. Director John Krasinski relies on editing, sound effects and off-screen action to crank up the tension. We do see the creatures from time to time, sometimes even in extreme closeup. They are very grotesque, bigger versions of the polyp-like succubus which exploded out of John Hurt’s stomach in Alien. However, the most terrifying moments here come when the humans are waiting for them to appear, desperately hoping that they won’t. Lady Bird is one of the best American coming-of-age films since Barry Levinson’s Diner. Written and directed by Greta Gerwig, it offers an utterly winning mix of humour, poignancy and sharp-eyed social observation. Gerwig approaches her subject matter with the same tenderness and affectionate irony with which the adolescent Lady Bird regards Sacramento. Gerwig also shows Lady Bird’s heroism as the young heroine strives against the odds to become the very best version of herself she can be.If Phantom Thread is indeed Daniel Day-Lewis’s final film as an actor, he is going out on a wondrously bizarre note. This must be the oddest film in his career, one in which he gives a typically commanding but very idiosyncratic performance. Almost everything here is jarring – but generally in a very positive way. It is not so long ago that Paul Schrader seemed to be giving up on cinema. The American writer-director (whose credits include Taxi Driver, American Gigolo and Affliction) had taken to making movies like the sour Hollywood satire The Canyons with Lindsay Lohan and the cartoonishly violent Dog Eat Dog, shot cheaply, aimed at a VOD audience. The former had a montage of closed-down movie theatres. In interviews, Schrader struck a gloomy note about the future of the industry. This is why First Reformed is so refreshing. This is not just Schrader’s best film in a very long while. It is also a re-affirmation of the director’s belief in the medium.Oscar Wilde goes to ruin in Rupert Everett’s debut feature as director. Everett also wrote and stars in the film, giving a grandstanding performance as the Irish writer at the end of his life, after his release from prison, where he has been doing hard labour for “gross indecency”. This is a moving and surprising biopic that squeezes out every last drop of pathos from its subject matter. Black Panther is not only one of the most entertaining recent superhero films but has an intelligence and a political dimension that such inchoate offerings as Suicide Squad and Justice League completely lacked. It is an action movie which touches on Pan-Africanism and which owes as much to Malcolm X as it does to Batman or Captain America. Sicilian Ghost Story is a genre-bending affair that combines elements of teen romance, gothic psycho-drama and political thriller. It is loosely based on a true story of a boy called Giuseppe Di Matteo whose father, an ex-member of the Sicilian Mafia, turned “grass” against his erstwhile associates. The Mafia responded by kidnapping Giuseppe and keeping him in captivity for nearly 800 days. First Man is all about understated heroism. It’s affecting precisely because Armstrong (played with quiet intensity by Ryan Gosling) doesn’t feel the continual need to boast about his mission. The film is a tearjerker but a very subtle one. Dogman is one of the best Italian films of recent times, a modern day neo realist fable that bears comparison with the great work of Fellini, Rossellini, De Sica et al. Its main character, the dog groomer Marcello (Marcello Fonte), is a wonderful creation: loveable, vulnerable, seedy and comic all at the same time. The Secret Life of Pets\u0026nbspdirector Yarrow Cheney directed the film, alongside frequent Kevin Smith collaborator Scott Mosier, with Michael LeSieur on writing duty.Follow\u0026nbspIndependent Culture\u0026nbspon Facebook for all the latest on Film, TV, Music, and moreShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Lacking basic IT skills has meant Anthony has missed appointments, which resulted in sanctions and fines with money being deducted from his universal credit payment.\u0026nbspThe claimant, who has had to rely on food banks\u0026nbspand, owing\u0026nbsparound £4,000 in rent,\u0026nbsphas now been told he will be evicted, told Panorama: “I’ve looked for somewhere to live and I’ve found a bridge. The only thing I’m not playing ball with is I can’t use a computer. I’m left behind.”Flintshire council’s head of housing, Neal Cockerton, said: “We had a rent arrears position last year of £1.6m, it’s now four hundred and fifty thousand pounds worse than it was then, and a large proportion of that is solely attributable to Universal Credit.”\u0026nbspIntroduced in 2013 to bring “fairness and simplicity” to Britain’s social security system, universal credit rolls six major working-age benefits, including job seeker’s allowance, tax credit and – crucially – housing benefit, into one payment.Housing benefit used to be paid directly to the council and most other landlords. But now it’s part of universal credit, it’s paid straight to the claimant in one monthly sum, including the amount for rent.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspIn 2011, Professor Paul Hickman, of Sheffield Hallam University, carried out a study into what the effect of paying rent direct to\u0026nbsptenants as opposed to councils would have, and found that only eight\u0026nbspper cent of tenants managed to pay their rent in full.But despite him presenting these findings to the government, the roll-out continued.\u0026nbspProfessor Hickman told Panorama: “Were we ignored? Some of what we said was listened to but I think they were so committed to the course of rolling out universal credit, whatever we found they were going to continue to plough ahead.”Richard Watts of the Local Government Association (LGA), raised concerns that the issues over increased rent arrears for those moving onto universal credit would mean councils can build less new homes.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Berlin Mayor Michael Mueller (centre) welcomes Madrid Mayor Manuela Carmena (left) and London Mayor Sadiq Khan at City Hall in Berlin.

There is simply no excuse – either for Labour as a whole, or for inidual Labour MPs – not to oppose this agenda and give the people a final say.”Created with Sketch.Brexit march for a final say – in pictures Show all 65Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Red smoke from a canister hangs in the air as around 100,000 demonstrators march through London during a People\u0027s Vote anti-brexit demonstration savings banners and placardsMayor of London Sadiq Khan takes part in the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.MP Chuka Umunna (left) and MP Vince Cable (right) as MP Anna Soubry (centre) addresses Anti-Brexit campaigners at a rally after the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.

That remains the position.There will be a second Brexit referendum, Gordon Brown saysBrexit a \u0027complete shambles\u0027 says boss of German industrial giantSpanish prime minister Sanchez calls for second Brexit referendumBrexit \u0027can be stopped\u0027, Labour\u0027s Keir Starmer saysMeanwhile Michel Barnier, the EU\u0027s chief Brexit negotiator,\u0026nbsptold European leaders that\u0026nbspat a meeting of the general affairs council that key issues remained unresolved.As they gathered for the update, several EU member states claimed that any\u0026nbspBrexit deal hinged\u0026nbspon agreement of the cabinet, rather than difficulties with Brussels.Ireland\u0027s deputy prime minister Simon Coveney said it was a very important week for Brexit negotiations, adding that\u0026nbspthere was still clearly work to do to reach an agreement.His French counterpart Nathalie Loiseau said: The ball is in the British court. It is a question of a British political decision.Ms May is facing opposition from all sides over her\u0026nbspcall for a backstop measure that would keep all of the UK within a customs union,\u0026nbsprather than the Northern Ireland-only provision proposed by the EU.International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt, who has failed to offer\u0026nbsppublic support to Ms May\u0027s blueprint, suggested the Cabinet would act as a check on the prime minister.The Brexiteer told Sky News: The important thing is that there are two checks on this deal - there is Cabinet and there is Parliament.Cabinet\u0027s job is to put something to parliament that is going to deliver on the referendum result.However the PM\u0027s spokesman said the cabinet had supported Ms May so far and was expected to continue to do so.Ex-transport minister Jo Johnson revealed that he chose to dramatically resign from the government last week over\u0026nbspreports Ms May\u0026nbspwas planning a publicity campaign showing a binary choice between a no-deal exit and Ms May\u0027s deal -\u0026nbspwhich he said amounted to a calculated deceit.I challenge the government to come clean on the cost of Brexit, he told the Evening Standard.The reason they can\u0027t look us in the eye, it\u0027s because they know this will leave us worse-off and with less control.

It is a question of a British political decision.”\u0026nbspBrexit timetable in turmoil as May scraps meeting to approve dealDowning Street last week said the cabinet needed more time to come to an agreement despite a long meeting last week. But an emergency session called for today to discuss the deal has been cancelled, suggesting a common UK government position is still some way off.Asked about whether a deal would be struck, Ms Loiseau added: “I have no crystal ball unfortunately. We are determined, we are committed to find a good deal. We know that it is better than a no-deal.”Speaking on his way into the same meeting Germany’s EU affairs minister\u0026nbspMichael Roth warned that “the clock is ticking”.\u0026nbsp“The room for manoeuvre is very much limited and our British friends know exactly where our discussions are,” he said.The ball is in the British court. It is a question of a British political decisionAustrian EU affairs minister\u0026nbspGernot Blumel told waiting press there was “a certain dynamic in the negotiations, but it is too early to say how we are going to proceed on that”.\u0026nbspAustria holds the EU council’s rotating presidency and has been coordinating meetings between member states and the Europe Commission.\u0026nbspThough member states are regularly updated on progress, they are not present at the coal-face of talks with Britain and rely on the commission for information.Member states were updated by commission chief negotiator Michel Barnier\u0026nbspin Monday’s meeting about the current state of talks, with the prognosis understood to be that there has been no breakthrough.\u0026nbspSpanish prime minister Sanchez calls for second Brexit referendumBrexit ‘can be stopped’, Labour’s Keir Starmer saysThornberry says Labour could still back Final Say Brexit referendumPreparations made for hospital food shortages if no-deal BrexitIn a statement the council presidency said: “The commission’s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel\u0026nbspBarnier, informed the\u0026nbspEU27\u0026nbspministers of the situation following negotiations with the UK over the last few weeks.\u0026nbsp“Michel\u0026nbspBarnier\u0026nbspexplained that intense negotiating efforts continue, but an agreement has not been reached yet. Some key issues remain under discussion, in particular a solution to avoid a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland.”Both sides want a deal in November, with the original October deadline having slipped. The EU has repeatedly said December will be too late to ratify the deal before the UK is set to drop out of the bloc on 29\u0026nbspMarch 2019.\u0026nbspDisagreements in negotiations are centred on the issue of Northern Ireland, and how to prevent a hard border from appearing with the Republic of Ireland after Brexit. Though officials are in a communications “tunnel” and reliable information is hard to come by, the EU appears to have agreed to British demands to keep the whole UK inside a temporary customs union to help prevent a hard border.\u0026nbspLoiseau, France’s EU affairs minister, on the doorstep of the meeting (EbS)This UK demand was borne of an unwillingness to see just Northern Ireland kept inside the trade agreement, an approach the Northern Irish unionists who prop up Theresa May’s government have rejected outright as a breach of sovereignty.But Brexiteers in the British cabinet are worried that such a “temporary” customs union might become permanent if no other solution to the border is found.\u0026nbspThe UK has therefore also asked for some kind of review mechanism or time-limit to assuage the Tory ministers – a demand that is proving difficult to square with the EU’s insistence that the backstop must prevent a hard border in Northern Ireland whatever the circumstances. The UK government also signed up to this commitment in writing in December and March.Created with Sketch.Brexit threatens life on the Irish border: in pictures Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.John Murphy flies the European flag outside his home near the border village of Forkhill, Co ArmaghAn abandoned shop is seen in Mullan, Co Monaghan.

These, too, are controversial in the Cabinet, because some right-wing MPs see Brexit as an opportunity to strip out regulations.\u0026nbspIt is unclear whether the proposed UK-wide backstop would even placate Northern Irish unionists, as it would be unlikely to eliminate all regulatory checks across the Irish sea, notable on animal products. The DUP has said they would not accept such checks and vote against any deal that included them.Even if a deal is struck between negotiators it could be voted down by MPs, with the House of Commons maths currently the matter of intense speculation in both Westminster and Brussels.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

How could it be implemented? And what would the impact be on the economy?\u0026nbspBen Chu\u0026nbspexplainsClick to followIndy PoliticsFrench lessons? France has a 35-hour working week, implemented in 2000Labour, under Jeremy Corbyn, has been making encouraging noises about the idea of a four-day working week for some months now.\u0026nbspAnd this week things seemed to move on a bit further for the opposition party as it was reported that the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has spoken to the cross-bench peer Lord Skidelsky about the possibility of an inquiry into the topic.\u0026nbspBut what’s the argument for such a reform? How could it be implemented? And what would the impact be on the economy?Why would we want to move to a four-day week?Many advocates cite greater work-life balance. Working one fewer day a week would free workers up to look after children, elderly parents or simply to have more leisure time.But Mr McDonnell has talked about the move in terms of productivity – or a worker’s output per hour.He argues that British workers work the longest hours in Europe and yet are among the least productive.Give workers four-day week and more pay, unions sayThe four-day week could transform our lives and our economy Schools consider four-day week in cost cutting driveThat’s\u0026nbspborne out by the data we have.The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development\u0026nbspestimates that UK workers put in an average of 1,681 hours a year in 2017. That compared\u0026nbspwith 1,514 in France and 1,356 in Germany.\u0026nbspYet the Office for National Statistics calculates that GDP per worker in the UK is lower than both those countries.Labour’s lesson seems to be that one way to boosting our weak national productivity is actually to give people less time in the workplace to encourage them to work more efficiently while they are there.\u0026nbspWhile this might sound fanciful it’s not totally outlandish. One recent study from New Zealand showed that when workers moved to a four-day week at one firm their per-hour productivity did indeed rise.The argument is that a better work-life balance makes people more motivated, perhaps by reducing productivity-sapping illness and stress.How could it be implemented?This is a key question. For whatever the theoretical merits of a four-day week for productivity, ordering the entire economy to shift immediately to such a radically different working time structure would clearly be massively disruptive.Angela Merkel’s economic success may be more about luck than strategyEmployers would have to reconfigure shift patterns dramatically, in some cases having to hire many more workers. Think in particular of public services like schools and the health services. Think of the retail and transport sectors.\u0026nbspAlso, around 15 per cent of the UK workforce is now self-employed. It’s hard to see how the state could practically compel those 5\u0026nbspmillion self-employed workers to limit their working week to four days.One policy possibility\u0026nbspa Labour inquiry might consider is whether\u0026nbspto offer tax breaks or other kinds of support to firms that offer four-day working to employees, hoping that this could\u0026nbspencourage the practice to spread.What would be the impact on the economy?That would depend to a large degree on those productivity effects.\u0026nbspThe size of the economy is the value of the output of goods and services produced over a certain period. Working fewer hours would, as a first order effect, seem likely to reduce the volume of those goods and services, thus contracting the economy.\u0026nbspBut if we could produce more of that output in a given period that negative impact would be mitigated, perhaps even wiped out altogether.And\u0026nbspeconomies are dynamic too.\u0026nbspIf we could increase our productivity\u0026nbspgrowth rate\u0026nbspthrough a shorter working week the economy could, theoretically, be larger over the long run.\u0026nbspCritics argue that the productivity impacts are unproven, and that France, with its 35-hour week, has higher unemployment and a more rigid labour market than the UK, something that seems to be particularly unfair on young people.Yet it’s also worth noting that in the late 1900s UK workers put in on average more than 2500 hours a year, almost 50 per cent more than today. But our economy is far larger than it was then due to productivity growth.\u0026nbspThe big-picture historical lesson is that it’s certainly not impossible for average living standards to rise even as average hours worked falls.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It uses the Snapdragon 845 processor and runs on a customised version of Google\u0027s Android operating system.All are features found on rival high-end phones that can cost more than £700, but Xiaomi is to sell the Mi 8 Pro starting at £499, as part of a strategy it calls honest pricing.Xiaomi opens Mi Stores in UK and USWang Xiang, the firm\u0027s senior vice president, said: Today we witness a new chapter in Xiaomi\u0027s global expansion journey, underpinned by our global ambitions.We are thrilled to make great strides by announcing our arrival in the UK.By bringing a range of our amazing products at honest pricing we want to offer more choices and let everyone in the UK enjoy a connected simple life through our innovative technology.The company will face stiff competition to establish itself in a crowded market, with three new iPhones, two Google Pixel 3 handsets and devices from Samsung, Sony and fellow Chinese firms Huawei and OnePlus being released in recent months.As well as the Pro, Xiaomi will also launch its budget Redmi 6A device for £99, which it claims has a battery that can last for up to 19 days.The Chinese firm is also bringing a range of its other gadgets to the UK, including its Band 3 wearable fitness tracker and an electric scooter.These products will go on sale in a physical Xiaomi Mi store, which will open at the Westfield shopping centre in Shepherd\u0027s Bush, London, on November 18.Mobiles expert Ru Bhikha said the firm\u0027s arrival in the UK should be taken seriously.Since releasing its first smartphone in August 2011, Xiaomi has rapidly gained a strong foothold in the market - so much so that it\u0027s already the fourth largest handset manufacturer in the world, he said.Xiaomi\u0027s highly anticipated arrival in the UK therefore threatens to put a big cat amongst the pigeons - by combining top tier design and performance with relatively modest pricing, it poses a real threat to the market.Looking at Xiaomi\u0027s success so far, it\u0027s hard to see how its winning combination of high-end smartphones with lower-than-expected prices won\u0027t drive similar results over here.Thursday\u0027s launch marks the arrival of a significant new kid on the block, and there is no doubt that in finally coming to the UK, Xiaomi means business.Additional reporting by agenciesShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Ivory BAN will not be enough to STOP elephant extinction                Nature Crisis: Planet loses 60 percent of its wildlife in 50 yearsOne of the best areas to witness Darwin\u0026rsquos evolutionary theories in situ are the arid woodlands of Mozambique\u0026rsquos Gorongosa National Park which has witnessed some of the worst onslaughts against elephants in living memory.During the 1980s civil war that crippled the East African country, up to 90 per cent of the park\u0026rsquos elephant population were slaughtered with the ivory being sold to fund weapons while their meat went to feeding fighters.According to a new report from National Geographic, about a third of the female elephants born after the war ended in 1992 have never developed tusks. This compares to the usual figures of between two to four percent tusklessness in African elephants.Proud African elephant with huge tusks (Image: Getty )Elephant behaviourist and National Geographic Explorer Joyce Poole tells the magazine how her research shows that 200 adult females \u0026ndash around 51 percent of the animals that the survived the war and are 25 years or older \u0026ndash\u0026nbspdo not have tusks, while 32 percent born since the war are tuskless.The elephant expert told the National Geographic:\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoOnce there\u0026rsquos been heavy poaching pressure on a population, then the poachers start to focus on the older females as well, but, over time, with the older age population, you start to get this really higher proportion of tuskless females.The sight of elephants without their iconic adornments is not confined to Mozambique. It is a phenomenon witnessed in other parts of Africa scarred by ivory poaching. At the Addo Elephant National Park in South Africa up to 98 percent of the 140 female elephants were missing their tusks by the early 2000s.

The study is also important for other species as elephants play a role in affecting habitats by bringing down trees and creating water holes.\u0026ldquoAny or all of these changes in behaviour could result in changes to the distribution of elephants across the landscape, and it\u0026rsquos those broad-scale changes that are most likely to have consequences for the rest of the ecosystem, Long tells National Geographic. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp            "},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/78/183x122/1043999_1.jpg","title":"khashoggi latest saudi arabia yemen jeremy hunt","story":"He also urged the Kingdom\u0027s authorities to cooperate with investigations into the murder of critical Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

A forensic archaeologist is guiding cops during the search.It follows information that Cannan may have buried -year-old Suzy there after abducting and murdering her.Cold case review detectives now suspect that after murdering Suzy, Cannan may have driven to what was then his mother’s home.Its reported that they fear he put Suzy’s body in an inspection pit in the garage he used for working on cars, before filling it with concrete.Excavation work was focusing on an old corrugated iron garage in the back garden of the semi- detached property.A forensic tent was also placed over an area of concrete patio.The corrugated iron structure was dismantled by Met Police specialist search cops to enable excavation work to start.Ground-penetrating radar was used to scan the area and a tent was erected where the garage stood.However tragically the search yielded no evidence at the property leaving her brother upset that her body remains undiscovered.The Suzy Lamplugh Trust is established by the estate agent’s parents, Paul and Diana Lamplugh.The Trust played a key role in the passing of the Protection from Harassment Act, which clamped down on crimes involving stalking.Speaking on the th anniversary of his daughters tragic disappearance, Suzy’s then -year-old dad Paul Lamplugh spoke out about Suzy. He said: I dont have very much hope that I will find out what happened.I miss Suzy more now...

But it will be flawed –– and Mrs May should say so.I admit this sounds odd: Why would a Prime Minister admit that a deal they have negotiated isn’t great ButMrs May tries to say that this agreement is perfect, and that there is no risk of any part of the UK getting stuck in the backstop — which would leave it in an EU customs union but with no say over the trade deals the EU is doing — then she will easily be disproved.Mrs May should take a leaf out of the book of Attorney General Geoffrey Cox, who as a hugely successful trial lawyer knows a fair bit about persuading people of his case.He told Cabinet on Tuesday that when it came to quitting the backstop “a unilateral right would give the UK greater scope to establish its case, as the other side would have to prove the contrary”.But he went on to acknowledge that negotiating a unilateral right to get out of the backstop was highly unlikely in the time available and a mutual review mechanism could be made to work.Cox’s essential argument is about managing risk. Every option on Brexit now carries with it risk.The challenge is to work out how to best manage these risks. The risk with accepting a legally binding backstop in the withdrawal agreement is that the UK ends up being unable to get out of it cleanly.It would be direthe UK ended up leaving the EU in a way that tied it to the EU for ever.But set against this must be the risk of no deal, and the disruption that would cause. To make matters worse, the Government has done absurdly little to mitigate no deal.The reason that even Cabinet ministers who loathe where the negotiations are heading do not want to go for no deal is they know how unprepared the country is for it.At the same time, there is a risk thatthere is no deal, Parliament would either insist on a second referendum — that would harden isions and toxy our politics — or cancel the process altogether, creating a dangerous democratic deficit.Frankly, the argument that Mrs May’s withdrawal agreement is less bad than the alternatives will be pretty much the only thing going for it.It will be hard for her to make this argument as so many of the deal’s problems are self-inflicted.She triggered Article  without knowing what the UK wanted she has wasted much of the past  months in a negotiation with her own Cabinet the failure to plan properly for no deal has weakened the Government’s negotiating position.Even the Parliamentary arithmetic has been made worse by Mrs May. If she hadn’t called that election, there would be a Tory majority and she wouldn’t be so reliant on the DUP.But it is the argument that her deal is less bad than the alternatives that is keeping the Cabinet on board and it is her best — and, possibly, only — way of getting the House of Commons to vote for such a flawed agreement.THE bad news for Theresa May is that it doesn’t get any easier once she’s got a deal with Brussels.For she will still have to get this withdrawal agreement through the House of Commons.With the DUP unhappy and  Tory Brexit ultras expected to vote against the deal, as well as Jo Johnson and other Tories who want another referendum, it will be extremely tough to get it over the line.“I can’t quite see where the majority comes from,” admits one Cabinet minister.But there is growing talk that the way to get the deal through might be to bring it back a second time, with the markets – which expect a deal – freaking out.As this Secretary of State says: “Do you get it through the first time  Maybe not.He did little to hide his irritation at being moved from his job as universities minister because of his opposition to Mrs May’s plan to tinker with tuition fees.But his resignation is a blow to the PM – and not just because of his attack on her for “a failure of British statecraft not seen since the Suez crisis”.His departure will put more pressure on those ministerial colleagues who privately share his view that a second referendum is needed, to go.With both Johnsons voting against the withdrawal agreement, it will become even harder to get it through the Commons.SO will any of the Cabinet resign over Theresa May’s Brexit plan  At the moment, ministers believe not.One of those who spoke against the May approach at Cabinet tells me the mood of the meeting was “resigned rather than resigning”.Another predicts critics of what Mrs May is doing “will make their point, then retreat”.This is not to say people are happy. Penny Mordaunt, the International Development Secretary, warned that voters wanted a “definitive end point to Brexit” andthey didn’t get it, that risked “feeding a narrative of betrayal, fuelling Ukip”.In private, ministers rail against Mrs May and the way she is handling the negotiations. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has been heard to complain that the UK is making it far too obvious it is in a desperate hurry to get a deal.It is certainly true that by advertising its need for a quick agreement, the UK is almost inviting the EU to ask for more.Tellingly, there is renewed – and increasing – talk among ministers of having a new leader in place to do the next set of negotiations.There is little love for the backstop. And interestingly, Chancellor Philip Hammond argued in Cabinet this week it would be better to extend the transition than trigger the backstop.He argued that the backstop could do damage to supply chains and said “it could be better to extend the implementation period than have a bad backstop”.A problem with extending the implementation period is that it would mean free movement would continue – and the UK would still be sending huge amounts of money to Brussels every year.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And what a mother.They say no one is irreplaceable but I think she is — which must be such a lot of pressure for him. In short, he has spent his entire le waiting for his mum to die before he can start his dream job.And in the meantime his le, in some ways, is on hold. He was not allowed to marry the woman he loved and was instead forced into a loveless marriage.And every time he so much as expresses an opinion about anything, he is denounced as being “meddling”.So it’s no wonder that in Prince, Son And Heir, the BBC documentary this week marking his th birthday, Charles was quick to quell concerns that he would be a “meddling” or activist king, saying: “I’m not that stupid.”Declaring the role of sovereign and heir to be dferent, he said he is aware of the constraints he will encounter as king, and says his behaviour will change.I can see why he is saying that, given the amount of criticism that has come his way over the years. But when you think that he was campaigning about issues such as the environment and single-use plastic long before anyone  got on the bandwagon, it might be better to see him as a trailblazer than a meddler.I admire that he has a voice.And when he is king I think he should use it — not be silenced by the pressure of the role.He has a very broad range of knowledge and he is absolutely passionate. We live in a society where everyone has their say — so why shouldn’t he In fact, I thinkhe visited Europe he might help with Brexit.There is no doubt the Queen is a hard act to follow — when the time comes, that is. Now Charles is  he is the longest serving heir to the throne in history. And he may have years to go, as the Queen looks and sounds fantastic .But we should stop maligning Charles and start supporting him.He is a good man and there is no doubt he is dedicated to the job. He is mature enough to know how to do the job well and he certainly knows what is expected of him.He has brought up two fantastic sons that any parent would be proud of.And he really is passionate about changing the world for the better.It has been more than  years since he set up his Prince’s Trust charity.Last year alone it helped nearly , young people get into education, training and jobs. It is simply fantastic.He is deeply committed to his fantastic we, who is very down-to-earth and great fun .He is also passionate about promoting women’s issues, so whatever you think of him you must give him credit for that.I believe very strongly in the monarchy. I would do anything the Queen asked me to do.The Royal Family are a great thing for our country and something to be very proud of.In a world of increasing uncertainty, they are this country’s rock and foundation. We should all get behind Charles and celebrate him as our future king.Apart from anything , we need all the stability we can get. ANYONE living in London will be unsurprised to hear that there are now a record number of people sleeping rough there.Figures show there were , rough sleepers in the capital between July and September – the first time the total has exceeded , in a three-month period.It’s awful and it’s shocking to see people sitting in the cold begging for money.And it’s hard to know how to help. Of course, the temptation is to give money but obviously that’s just a short-term fix.Night shelters are a good short-term solution. Buthomeless people don’t get involved with a network that can really help them, it’s unlikely their circumstances will ever change.My husband Paul volunteers with the fantastic charity West London Mission . It offers homeless people a hot shower, new clothes, a meal and a decent night’s sleep.But it also offers access to project workers who will help people change their circumstances.Its aim is to empower and help homeless people become part of a community, because that’s the start of them getting off the streets, into accommodation, then into work.There are so many reasons that people become homeless. Some have lost their job and can’t afford rent, or they’ve fallen out with family and turn to drink and drugs.They might have mental or physical health problems, a history of abuse or a dficult childhood moving between foster homes.But where there is le, there is hope. Paul has been working with one guy who was homeless and hopelessly addicted to drugs.But, over time, he has got clean, found a place to live and, last week, got a job at a restaurant, which is what he was doing before he got involved in drugs.He’s got his le back, basically. It does happen.Soyou are worried about homelessness, think about donating to an organisation such as WLM. Better yet, volunteer your time and skills.Even just helping someone to fill out a form, which can be incredibly dficult for some people, can make a huge dference and is so rewarding.TODAY is Remembrance Day and I wear my poppy with pride. This year I will particularly recognise all the true heroes from World War One. I thank them for their service, and remember we are always in their debt.It is so important we never forget the sacrice they made and the bravery they showed.I doubt there will ever be another generation like them. AS a rule, I like to live and let live. But I really had to roll my eyes at the story of -year-old Dutch pensioner Emile Ratelband, “who identies as a -year-old” and is fighting to legally change his age by  years so he can get more work and attract more women on Tinder.Emile, above, was born on March , , but says he feels at least  years younger and wants to change his birth date to March , .His argument is thattransgender people are allowed to change sex, he should be allowed to change his date of birth because doctors said he has the body of a -year-old.So does that meanI feel like a supermodel inside, I can I get my job title legally amended Or maybe at  I could identy as  so I can have access to my pension SO the six men arrested for burning an effigy of Grenfell Tower are in hiding and relying on friends and relatives to bring in food and drink. Still, they are yet to speak out – or apologise.What beggars belief is not just that these sick men thought that no one would notice nor care when this footage emerged on social media – but really that they are unhinged enough to do it in the first place.I’m pretty sure about one thing, though. No matter what consequences they will face for their actions from the law, they will never, ever live this down in the eyes of the world – and nor should they.I’m talking about Michael Douglas, . When he was awarded with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for more than  years in the entertainment industry, he gave his father, Kirk, a kiss on the lips to celebrate.In my experience there comes an age when your kids don’t want to kiss you – particularly on the lips and particularly your dad.It’s part and parcel of growing up that your kids don’t even want you to breathe, let alone kiss them.In fact, everything you do embarrasses them. But, given that Kirk Douglas is , maybe it’s just a reminder that things come full circle.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Power will make a dference: technological power, economic, financial, monetary, cultural power will be crucial.Trump has blasted Macrons idea for the European Union to build an army to protect itself from the US as insulting.The US President tweeted: President Macron of France has just suggested that Europe build its own military in order to protect itself from the US, China and Russia.Very insulting, but perhaps Europe should first pay its fair share of NATO, which the US subsidises greatly!It comes three days after the French President said the US is as big a threat to the EU as Russia and China and called for a “true European army” to defend the bloc.In an extraordinary attack on the US president, Macron lumped Washington together with Moscow and Beijing as Europe’s biggest foes.The arch euro federalist insisted only a fully fledged EU defence force can protect the continent against the trio’s aggression.He said: “We have to protect ourselves with respect to China, Russia and even the United States of America.“We will not protect the Europeans unless we decide to have a true European army.”The French president lashed Mr Trump for deciding to pull the US out of a nuclear treaty with Russia that was signed during the Cold War.He raged: “When I see President Trump announcing that he’s quitting a major disarmament treaty which was formed after the s euro-missile crisis that hit Europe, who is the main victim  Europe and its security.”Mr Macron made the comments in a radio interview from the town of Verdun - the site of a major WW battle - as he tours the Western Front ahead of Remembrance Day.They were welcomed by the EU Commission, which said it has already put the wheels in motion for the eventual creation of a euro army.A spokesman beamed: “If there is a Commission that has put forward the need for a meaningful defence identity for the EU, it’s this Commission.“President Macron has been consistently putting forward this narrative for a stronger Europe that empowers and protects.“This is totally totally compatible with our work and all contributions from our EU leaders, and especially from President Macron, are very much welcome.”But the remarks were savaged by former British Army commanders, who said the revelations showed why the UK must pull out of the EU’s defence plans.Major General Julian Thompson, who led British forces in the Falklands, told The Sun: “The EU Commission now openly admits it has created the preamble to an EU army.The UK is in that preamble and risks being kept in it.“Ministers must withdraw or risk losing forever whole chunks of the UK’s democratic control over defence.”Colonel Richard Kemp, a commander of UK troops in Afghanistan, added: “This is precisely what eurosceptics have been warning about.“It is time for ministers now to take notice and rein in what they have agreed since the referendum.They have been led astray in the most crucial area of sovereignty.”And Tory MEP Geoffrey Van Orden, a former British Army Brigadier, raged: “Instead of th century dreams of French-led European grandeur, President Macron should be helping build Western solidarity.“That means helping and not obstructing a strong partnership with Britain and strengthening the NATO alliance.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000448913180.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"horrific moment ferris wheel gondolas tip upside down hurling families from their seats and leaving people clinging on for their lives","story":"The big wheel was spinning at the Sekaten Night Market in Yogyakarta, Indonesia, on Sunday evening when one of the carriages overturned.Frantic ride operators clambered across the moving wheel in a desperate big to reach the stricken families before the ferris wheel was eventually brought to a stop.Footage from shocked bystanders shows one young lad holding a red balloon and his mother sitting on the upturned roof of the gondola as workers carry them down to safety.Yogyakarta Police Senior Commander Yulianto said he attended the scene and that nobody was injured after the ferris wheel malThere was a major disruption on the ferris wheel but there were no casualties, there were no injuries,” he said.One visitor to the fairground said he heard screams then turned around to see the ferris wheel in reverse.The witness who shot the video, Nurdin, , told local media that everybody panicked after the ferris wheel went haywire.This reversal happened twice.

I sense, like the recently axed Big Brother and The X Factor, it’s been living off its reputation for a couple of years.Enjoyable as it’s been, the basic issue with this run has been the lack of a central figure in the mould of Syed Ahmed, Katie Hopkins or the late, great Stuart Baggs to take the series by the scruff of the neck.Some have shown vague promise but the closest thing it’s had to an alpha bell-end is Captain Pangea himself, Kurran Pooni, who was marked out less by his all-round uselessness than by the wrist he broke arm-wrestling back at the house, and his insistence he was “ per cent stepping up as project manager” just before he  per cent stepped down.There was no dodging the bullet, though, last week, when Lord Sugar demanded he PM a marketing campaign “for a noo airline” with accompanying adverts “and a noo unorm as well”.Kurran wasn’t underselling the sense of destiny he felt at this responsibility. “Everything in my le has led to this moment,” he claimed, presumably ’cos he hadn’t done anything  up until that moment.The great thing about this task, though — like all the best Apprentice episodes — was that the laughs were shared round equally.So while advert director Kurran was recreating the Club Tropicana video on Southend seafront, Camilla and Jackie were designing a stewardess’s unorm for the party-themed Jet Pop that wouldn’t see the light of day eveneasyJet suddenly opened a brothel chain in Amsterdam.A horrible thought occurred, though, as she was market-researching at Heathrow.She’s not going to wear that thing pitching to  industry experts at BA HQ, is she  She bloody is, you know.She gave it the full doors-to-manual flirtation as well. So everyone’s mind was already in the gutter before Jackie finished the audience off with the news: “It’s very easy to wipe down, as well.”In the normal course of events, reducing Claude Littner to a helpless giggling wreck would be enough to lose any task.The other team, though, Typhoon, had contrived to come up with something almost as bad, Manage Air, a business-targeted operation whose corporate logo looked like a satanic pentangle and theme tune was AC DC’s Highway To Hell.There was a genuine sense of tension in the boardroom then, which would’ve been ruinedSugar had played it all for laughs.He didn’t, though. He let the contestants hang themselves with their own words before firing Kurran, who could leave with a sense of “job done”.He’s created a bit of Apprentice folklore, after all, and hopefully reminded everyone this show is far from dead.Naturally, in the final taxi scene, he also remained convinced of his genius, boldly declaring: “My advert was gold.”The first and possibly last time in his le where he’s not just  per cent wrong, he’s  per cent right as well.Glorious television.Dianne: “Stephen Fry.”The Time It Takes, Joe Lycett: “Sesame Street’s Big Bird lives in what street ”Oliver: “I don’t know.”Joe Lycett: “A bird in the hand is worth two in the what ”Jon: “Foot.”And Bradley Walsh: “Which former EastEnders star presents the Sky One series Extreme World ”Zoe: “Barbara Windsor.”CELEBRITY Hunted contestant and former Commando Johnny Mercer MP has faced a stark choice this past month.The eternal humiliation of being beaten by Chris and Kem, off Love Island, on the Channel  hide ’n’ seek game.Or two weeks in a confined space with a clearly smitten Kay Burley.Heroically, he chose the latter, enduring her attention and pet namewith the same sort of grit that probably saw him through three tours of Afghanistan.Then, last week, he sneaked off for an unscheduled visit to his we, Felicity, and Burley completely lost her s***.Lost it so badly, in fact, that she threw herself at the mercy of a passing bread truck driver, which led to the best update of the series: “Kay Burley is currently in a -ton lorry, on the M, between junction  and .”She was quickly grassed up, of course, then apprehended at the Warburton’s depot, without the need for a vet or a tranquilliser dart.But while it’s a poorer show without the old mad-whack, there’s still plenty of mileage left in this gripping series.AJ Pritchard is cornered in Shropshire, Olympic silver medallist Louis Smith has just been found hiding in his mate’s Jacuzzi showroomand Baldrick-brained duo Chris  Kemhave somehow given everyone the slip.But as for Johnny Mercer  He’s probably smuggling himself back to the Mouth of Hell fort, in southern Helmand, just for the relative peace and quiet. Paul Merson: “For me it’s six and a half of one and a dozen of the other.”Graeme Souness: “The only one with potential is Martial and Pogba.”Dion Dublin: “Liverpool are in second and a half gear.”And Charlie Nicholas: “Pogba’s either brilliant or a showpony. He played OK last week.”THIS week’s Doctor Who episode introduced us to the Demons Of The Punjab, who turned out to be nothing of the sort.They were just morbid sods who mope around the universe “honouring those who die alone”, like soldiers, holy men and Brendan O’Carroll on For Facts Sakes.No actual science-fiction storyline to speak of then.But that’s not really the point of this viewer-shedding series, which has already got on its high horse about sexism, Donald Trump, American segregationist racism, men giving birth and gun control.Kind of inevitable, then, that the BBC would eventually pour a bucket of its self-loathing sick all over the British Empire, via the partition of India in , with an episode that was every bit as historically powerful as Carry On Up The Khyber.The key dference, of course, was that Bungdit Din and his Burpers weren’t actually being used as a means of brainwashing children.Because If you were expecting Doctor Who to present the flip side of Britain’s relatively benign rule in India , then you’ll also be waiting for the episode where Jodie Whittaker lands in a Soviet gulag and starts teaching children about the brutal idiocy of Marxism.The BBC just doesn’t do anything other than its own left-of-centre view, these days – or irony by the sounds of things.As it’s just been revealed there’ll be no festive episode of Doctor Whobecause it’s “run out” of storylines.Run out  RUN OUT How the hell can a series run out of ideas when it hasn’t had any yet This Morning, Thursday: “Coming up, at quarter to , the rise of the penis filler, Doctor Ranj is here to answer your questions.”The show’s other penis filler, Martin Lewis, will answer them on Monday.IT seems almost wrong to single out just one programme from Sunday’s beautul Armistice Day coverage, but the year’s most meaningful TV awards should probably all go to BBC’s They Shall Not Grow Old, made by Peter Jackson, whose astonishing film gave a voice, laughter, tears and colour to some of the extraordinary men who survived the - trenches.Those of us who watched it, on Sunday, are unlikely ever to forget the experience. Those of you who didn’t, must catch up with it on the BBC iPlayer.Be sure, though, to watch it right through to the credits’ last chorus of Mademoiselle From Armentières, where it names the veterans who have all long since passed but whose memories and souls have never seemed more alive and unforgettable.“It’s quite hard to put your finger on it.”I’ll bet.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The move triggered the resignation of Sports Minister Tracey Crouch - and the Government faces a backbench rebellion tomorrow when MPs vote on a bid to force ministers bring it in from April.

More than  MPs from both sides of the Commons have signed amendments that,passed, would effectively force the Government to speed-up the cut.

Sir Roger has also claimed in a public speech in  that there is no such crime as date rape. In the same speech he described sexual harassment as merely sexual advances made by the unattractive’. Shadow communities secretary Andrew Gwynne, who secured an urgent Commons question on the appointment, branded some of Sir Rogers views racist and asked ministers to justy his selection for the role. But Communities Secretary James Brokenshire defended Sir Rogers appointment, insisting he was uniquely qualied for the role, because he is considered an expert on aesthetics. He defended the writers offensive comments, saying: We live in a free society were people can hold dferent opinions. Mr Gwynne later branded Mr Brokenshires defence of Sir Rogers appointment disgraceful, branding the writers views bigoted and nasty. He said Sir Rogers views made him not fit to be a Government advisor. In a  article for The , Sir Roger wrote: Every now and then, however, we wake up to the fact that, although homosexuality has been normalised, it is not normal. Mr Gwynne said: When was the Secretary of State made aware of Sir Rogers comments that homosexuality is not normal and comparing homosexuality to incest  When was he aware that Sir Roger had complained that gay men had an obsession with the young  Will he now apologise to the LGBTQ+ community for appointing a man that holds these views  When was he made aware of Sir Rogers links to far-right organisations and his propagation of their anti-Semitic conspiracy  Is this acceptable in the Secretary of States eyes , he said.  Mr Brokenshire responded, saying that Sir Roger was uniquely qualied for the role, adding: It saddens me that someone who has done so much to champion freedom of speech, freedom of expressions, freedom of thought should be subject to the kind of misinformed, ill-judged and very personal attacks of the kind that we have seen over the last few days. He added: As a public intellectual, a renowned author of over  books, countless articles and public lectures he has engaged in a iety of topics often expressing, yes, strong and controversial views. Most of what is reported is highly selective, taken completely out of context and distorted to paint an inaccurate picture, I dont have to agree with Sir Roger to acknowledge this nor do I have to agree with his views on a number of dferent issues but we live in a free society were people can hold dferent opinions. Conservative MP Richard Baconlater labelled Mr Gwynnes remarks as crass and oafish, adding they could be refuted quite easily by reading Sir Rogers works.Conservative former minister Sir Edward Leigh also accused Labour of student union smear tactics to deliberately attack a distinguished philosopher.Ed Vaizey, another Tory former minister, said: As far as Sir Rogers character is concerned, and his views, it is impeccable, hes just got a slightly dodgy neo-Georgian pastiche thing going on. Labours Chi Onwurahearlier said she disagreed profoundly with many of Sir Rogers views, adding they seemed to be designed to bring the bigotry of the th century into the st.

Theresa Mays four-dimensional chess was meant to turn to checkmate at a summit with  EU leaders in October. But talks are stuck. Shes insisted she is % of the way there, but with every day the chance of a No Deal Brexit grows greater. Evenshe gets it past her Cabinet and the EU, MPs of all stripes are threatening to vote against the deal when it finally comes to Parliament. So what is stopping a deal from happening  Who wants what, and why are they so opposed to each other  Its all about the Northern Ireland border, and a backstopto stop customs checks starting back up along it. Heres a guide that you dont need a political PhD to understand.  How will Brexit affect the Nothern Ireland border  Everyone disagrees over how to solve a double-locked puzzle - the Northern Ireland border. Lock number one: At the moment, goods and people can move freely with no fences, guards or checks between Northern Irelandand the Republic of Ireland . This must not change, because it will break up the peace process that was hard-won in .  Lock number two: At the moment, goods and people can move freely with no fences, guards or checks between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. This must not change, because it will break up the union of the United Kingdom.  So Theresa May somehow has to rip the UK away from EU rules - yet not have any checks on either of these borders. How can you have dferent rules in dferent territories with no checks between any of them them  What the EU wants - the Brexit backstop  The EU dreamed up a backstop - backup plan - that would prevent those locks breaking until there is a proper trade deal. Under the EUs plan, Northern Ireland would use many of the same customs rules as the EU to prevent a hard border - checks - with the Republic. But this would then force us to check goods travelling between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, such as live animals and animal products.Theresa May warned it would draw a border down the Irish Sea and break up the Union. And that enraged an until now little-known party called the DUP... What the DUP want  The Democratic Unionist Party , a Northern Irish political party, are utterly opposed to anything that draws a line between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. That definitely includes customs checks. The DUP are very influential, because last year Theresa May handed over pound.bn to Northern Ireland in exchange for their  MPs voting with her government. DUP officials say No Deal Brexit looks inevitable after their leader, Arlene Foster, visited Brussels and couldnt find a breakthrough.The DUP have threatened to vote the deal down. AndTHAT happens, it will pile enormous pressure on a little someone called Theresa May... What Theresa May wants - her own Brexit backstop  Theresa May has drawn up a dferent backstop to try and please both the EU, and the DUP. Under her plan, the WHOLE of the UK would stay in EU customs rules for a temporary period while a full trade deal is worked out. This would prevent border checks on all sides. But in , it will stop the UK signing trade deals around the world until the backstop lts.This will keep the UK locked into the EUs orbit - with no say over its rules. Mrs May first wanted to set an end date on the backstop - but the EU said that wasnt acceptable. Then she wanted a mechanism letting the UK quit no matter what - but EU sources rejected that too. There are other problems here too. The EU say Theresa Mays backstop cant be done in time. So they want a backstop to the backstop... which, again, will draw a border down the Irish Sea. Exactly the problem were trying to stop. To make matters worse, Theresa May is also looking into the idea of extending the Brexit transition period, which ends on  December . And as you might expect, this has all infuriated Tory MPs... What Tory MPs want   or more Tory MPs are in three groups. A small crop of hard Remainers a big bunch wholl be loyal to Theresa May and up to  Hard Brexiteers. Its this last group, led by Jacob Rees-Mogg and Boris Johnson, who make the noise, stir up headlines and fuel talk of toppling Mrs May with a leadership bid. These Tories are sick of the fudge and compromise. They want Hard Brexit, a sharp break from Brussels, no extensions to the transition, and a Canada Plus deal which would be like the EUs agreement with Canada , but better. Tory Brexiteers have threatened to vote down the Brexit dealtheres no mechanism to quit the backstop. Tory Remainers are also threatening to vote down the deal, saying it will be worse than staying in. Jo Johnson, Boris pro-EU brother, quit as a minister in protest. But critics accuse Tory Brexiteers of skating over crucial practical details, sweeping away protections against chlorinated chicken and dumping workers rights. Critics who include the Labour Party... What Labour want  Labour arent in office but they have one big power - deciding whether to vote for any Brexit deal when itcomes to Parliament. And theyll probably vote against it. The party has set six tests that the final Brexit deal must passbefore Labour will vote in favour. Pretty much everyone knows we cant have a Brexit with number two, the exact same benefits as we do now.And not all Labour MPs will agree with what the party decides. Some, like Caroline Flint, have suggested they will back Theresa Mays plan because the alternative is leaving with no deal at all. To complicate things further, an argument has broken out about exactly how meaningful the vote in Parliament will be. MPs fear theyll be given just a rubber-stamp that has no power to send Theresa May back to the negotiating table.Does it ensure a strong and collaborative future relationship with the EU  Does it deliver the “exact same benefits” as we currently have as members of the Single Market and Customs Union  Does it ensure the fair management of migration in the interests of the economy and communities  Does it defend rights and protections and prevent a race to the bottom  Does it protect national security and our capacity to tackle cross-border crime  Does it deliver for all regions and nations of the UK What is Chequers and how does it fit in   The UKs Brexit plan was originally based on a deal Theresa May drew up at Chequers, her country retreat, in July .Things have moved on a lot since then, but when you see Chequers raised, this is what it means. At the time it was seen as a major sht to soft Brexit - prompting hard-Leaver Cabinet ministers David Davis and Boris Johnson to resign. The Facilitated Customs Arrangement would keep the UK closely aligned with the EU in a new free trade area for goods. Under this plan, the UK would share a common rulebook with Brussels for goods, including agricultural and food products. Britain would also collect some, but not all, customs tarfs on the EUs behalf. It was a bid to solve the Irish border in the long term. But it was rejected by Labour, Tory MPs, some Cabinet ministers, and the EU, who said it will not work. That is why UK officials have been drawing up new plans to solve the Irish border question. And Theresa May has gradually phased out using the word Chequers in public where she can help it. Where do we go from here  November : The UK was hoping for a final Brexit summit to seal not just a deal, but a political declaration on future trade. However, this looked off the cards as talks stalled over the Northern Irish border. - December : The next scheduled European Council summit. This is the last chance saloon to get a deal. Already its much later than was ideal. Otherwise there wont be time to sign it off before Brexit Day. After a deal is reached: MPs hold a vote on any deal in Parliament. This is danger moment two for Theresa May, who will likely face a Tory leadership challengeshe loses the vote. She claims the UK will leave with No Deal anywayshe loses. But Labour say she should be forced back to the negotiating table call a general election or even trigger a second EU referendum.  March : Brexit Day. If theres a deal, this will be a total anticlimax because a transition will be in place. If theres No Deal, planes could be grounded, ports jammed up and customs checks thrown into chaos at pm.  December : If theres a deal, this is when the transition period - which continues pretty much all the EU rules we have now - is supposed to end. But talk has been floated of extending this by a few months. After December : If theres still no deal, under current plans a backstop would kick in. This could keep the UK tied to EU customs rules, until a proper agreement is reached, in exchange for keeping the Northern Ireland border open.

Sexual harassment allegations against the ex-Lib Dem peer were aired in full for the first time today after a standards investigation lasting almost a year. The ex-Lib Dem QC, a racial and sexual equality campaigner, categorically denies all allegations of inappropriate behaviour and calls the claims a pack of lies. The report details in full the womans claims, including that she cowered in a bedroom with a chair propped behind the door for fear he would try to enter her room in the night. Here is a brief summary of the events as described in the womans witness statement to the inquiry.  One woman made a complaint against Lord Lester about a series of alleged incidents more than a decade ago. The woman, who is now middle-aged, knew Lord Lester professionally. She has been kept anonymous. She made her complaint in November , at the height of the MeToo movement. She said she did not complain sooner because she feared she would not be believed, and it would distract from her work. He missed the gearstick and groped my thigh  The woman claims she attended a meeting in the House of Lords and missed her train home. Lord Lester suggested that I stay at his home in London, she said in her witness statement. I initially said no as I did not wish to impose on his hospitality, but he insisted and said he would call his we. The woman went on: In the car on the way to his house, he kept repeatedly missing the gearstick with his hand and instead very firmly placed his hand on my right thigh. The first time it happened I thought it must’ve been an accident, but when it continued I realised it was not. I removed his hand and asked him to stop. He just smiled. I felt incredibly uncomfortable knowing that I was on the way to staying at his house. He continued to grope my thigh for theof the journey, despite my protests. He said he would not be far from me Once she reached Lord Lesters home, the woman claimed, she chatted to his we Lady Lester and they enjoyed a cup of tea. Lord Lester then said he would show me to my bedroom for the night, she said in her witness statement. Once we had reached where I would be sleeping, he said it was not far from his bedroom, which he insisted on pointing out to me, saying he would not be far from me. This made me feel very uncomfortable. I scarcely slept all night, sleeping fully clothed  The woman wrote: I went into my bedroom and immediately placed the chair under the door I felt afraid, recalling what had happened in the car. I immediately called T, who had been a friend for many years. I was in the bedroom at this time and I told her what had happened and I felt trapped in his house. She advised me that I put the chair under the handle of the door, which I had placed as I feared Lord Lester might come into my room in the night and she suggested I leave first thing in the morning. I scarcely slept all night, sleeping fully clothed. I removed the chair in the early hours of the morning as I knew his we will be coming to bring me a cup of tea. This she did, and I then got ready and came down to leave for home.  He pursued me around the kitchen and I pleaded with him to stop The woman said the next morning, when she went downstairs, Lady Lester had left. She claimed in her witness statement: At some point, I went over to place the crockery in the sink. It was then that he came up behind me and put his arms around my waist. I pushed him away. Again, he placed his arms around me and further up my body. I had to force myself away. He pursued me around the kitchen and I pleaded with him to stop. Once he stopped, I told him that I wished to leave. I wanted to call a cab, but he insisted that he went with me. I allowed him to, as I just wanted to get out of the house. He told me he loved me and could not help himself  The woman continued: Once we got to the train station, he told me that he had strong feelings for me. I responded by saying I did not feel the same way. I said that he should know better as he had a we. He told me personal matters about his le which I would not have expected to have been told in the circumstances of a professional relationship. I made it very clear that I did not feel the same way and did not want to be involved with him in any way other than professionally. He persisted and told me that he loved me and said he could not help himself. I was relieved to get my train home, feeling uncomfortable and violated by this behaviour. He told me there were things he could buy Some time later, the woman said, she met Lord Lester at the House of Lords and he joined her outside for some fresh air. We sat down. He then proceeded to tell me that he had strong feelings for me, she said. He questioned whether I was concerned that he would not be able to have sex and told me that there were things he could buy for this. I was shocked and did not respond. He went on to make other inappropriate sexual comments. I stood up and went to walk back inside. If you sleep with me I will make you a Baroness within a year  The womans witness statement continued: As we were approaching the House of Lords building, he pointed to it and said do you see that building, to which I replied yes. He told me that it was the most powerful of decision-making. He said,  you sleep with me I will make you a Baroness within a year. He even spelt it out putting my surname in, and asked me how that sounded. I responded immediately without hesitation by saying thatI were ever to become a member of the House of Lords, it had to be purely on merit. He warned me there would be repercussions The woman claimed in her witness statement: Once we had reached a private space and were not in full view of anyone he asked me againI would sleep with him and suggested that I took some time to think about it. Again, I said no. He said thatI did not, he would see to it that I never had a seat in the House of Lords and warned me that there would be other repercussions for me, which he did not specy. He said thatI was a good girl and did what he was asking, I would be in the House of Lords and could visit his house abroad with him. He made a number of further inappropriate sexual comments to me such as that he could see me becoming a demanding mistress. I was distressed and shocked by his behaviour. What Lord Lester said in response Lord Lester strongly denied all the allegations during the investigation, todays report says, calling them a pack of lies. He denied groping her thigh or making any other sexual advances, it adds, and Lord Lester and his we both maintained the allegations of sexual harassment were untrue. Lord Lester also categorically denied offering a peerage in exchange for sex, saying: I have no power to make such offers or threats in respect of peerages and the allegation that I did so is ridiculous and untrue. In a statement today, the peer said: These allegations are completely untrue. I produced evidence which clearly demonstrated that what I was said to have done [several] years ago did not happen. Independent counsel who previously advised the committee on its procedures provided an advice which concluded that the investigation was flawed. I regret the committees conclusions in the light of these materials. There has to be a fair process for investigating sexual harassment claims in Parliament. Parliament is supposed to be a bastion of the rule of law but has ignored calls to reform this procedure properly for  years. I hope to be judged by my work over decades for gender equality, race relations and free speech. What the Lords standards investigation said Details of the case were made public today in a report by the House of Lords Committee for Privileges and Conduct. The committee has recommended Lord Lester be suspended from the House of Lords until June . The Committee for Privileges and Conduct was the third investigatory body to look into the allegations. First the Commissioner for Standards investigated the allegations and found the woman was more likely than not to be telling the truth. The Commissioner upheld the complaint on the balance of probabilities, saying Lord Lester persisted in unwanted touching and sexual comments, took advantage of her being alone in his house and abused his power. The matter was then passed to the Sub-Committee on Lords Conduct, which recommended Lord Lester be expelled from the House of Lords permanently. But after Lord Lester lodged an appeal, peers noted the power to expel peers was only introduced in . The alleged behaviour took place more than a decade ago - so peers decided an expulsion could not be backdated. In its final report the Privileges Committee said: We endorse the conclusion of the commissioner that in respect of that conduct Lord Lester of Herne Hill breached provisions of the code in failing to act on his personal honour by sexually harassing the complainant and offering her corrupt inducements to sleep with him.

The  raiders terrorised their victims, including women, children and babies, as they demanded money at gunpoint. They have been now jailed for almost  years between them. A jury was told they had also equipped themselves with dust masks, reinforced tape, latex gloves, torches, cable ties and demolition bars bought from branches of BQ and Poundland just hours before the raid.  A father of seven was struck with a truncheon and handgun, before falling to the ground where he was kicked, beaten with a crowbar and baseball bat, and stabbed to his arm and thigh. But the raiders were forced to flee almost empty-handed from Wheat Gratten Stable Yards in the village of Lenham, near Maidstone, Kent, when the residents fought back. They chased the raiders across field and rammed getaway vehicles, some of which were badly damaged and had to be abandoned at the scene.  Maidstone Crown Court in Kent heard during a series of trials that the stableyard, situated off a narrow country lane, was stormed at about .pm on April , . It was alleged the armed robbers also brandished a sawn-off shotgun and handgun. A total of  men were later identied by police, with fourteen subsequently convicted and jailed for conspiracy to rob following a series of trials over two years. Their sentences, ranging between nine years and  years imprisonment can now be reported following the jailing today of the final raider, Junior Shawki Tamakloe, who was described as a critical player in both organising and overseeing the raid. The -year-old from London pleaded guilty to conspiracy to rob and was jailed for -and-a-half years.  Previous sentencing hearings saw Aaron Mayers, , from Hackney, jailed for  years Nana Danquah, also  and from Potters Bar, Hertfordshire, jailed for  years Darren Myers,  and from Tunbridge Wells, Kent, jailed for  years and Jake Jenks, , also from Tunbridge Wells, jailed for  years. Connor Miller, , also from Tunbridge Wells, was imprisoned for  years Lee Baker, , from Eastbourne, was jailed for  years Nyake Alieu, , also from Eastbourne, was jailed for  years and -year-old Brady Dewson was jailed for  years. Ahmed Ali, , from London, was jailed for  years Jheryl Long, , from London, was jailed for  years Glenn Kenny,  and from Suffolk, was jailed for nine years and four months and John Smillie, , from Walthamstow, and Faisal Issah, , from Tottenham, were each jailed for  years.  None however were convicted of carrying a firearm and or imitation firearm with intent. Passing sentence, Judge Julian Smith said the mass attack on the traveller site was bold, audacious, determined and exceptional, carried out in the hope of signicant reward. One of the armed robbers himself spoke of the expectation of a le-changing financial gain.  At the start of each trial, prosecutor Nina Ellin told the jury: The masked men were dressed in dark clothing and armed with a iety of weapons including a sawn-off shotgun, a handgun, iron bars and a machete. They were demanding large sums of money at the point of a gun. They terrorised the occupants of the caravans which included women and young children and one man was brutally attacked. They tied up some of their victims with cable ties which they had brought with them ready for that purpose.  But the court heard the tables were turned when the raiders themselves came under attack. Other occupants sought to repel the attackers. Shots were fired, vehicles were rammed, and the attackers withdrew into the night, added Miss Ellin. Police found four cars abandoned at the stableyard. Another, a gold Audi TT, was traced and the occupants arrested. Others were identied and arrested through DNA, fingerprints, mobile phone data, CCTV and automatic number plate recognition cameras.  The raid involved four teams from London, Kent, Sussex and Essex coming together and converging on the stableyard at the same time. Miss Ellin said CCTV at a BQ store in Tottenham, north London, and a Poundland branch in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, showed several gang members buying their equipment, while others carried out a reconnaissance of the site. Three men, Vincent Stickings, , from Thamesmead, south London, Kieon Barker,  and from Stoke Newington, and Irasto Yoxall, , from Bethnal Green, were cleared of any involvement.

Naomi Walmsley, , and husband Dan Westall, , eat bugs, wear homemade clothes with rabbit fur and Paleolithic designs, and hunt with bows and arrows to educate youngsters. The parents, from Coalbrookdale, Shrops, admit they do get some funny looks when they turn up at the petrol station in their outfits - which include face paint - or get stuck in a traffic jam. Children think they really are from the Stone Age while adults usually so stunned they dont say anything. The couple, who have have two young daughters - Wren,  months, and Maggie, six - have created an accurate Stone Age village near Blymhill Common in Tong, Staffs.  They run OutbackBasics, an organisation which educates schoolchildren in skills and le in the Stone Age - from painting, eating bugs and making arrows to the workings of a compost toilet. Naomi describes her outfits as cave woman fashion with throws made primarily of rabbit fur, while Dan dons tines made from deer antler round his neck Naomi said: We are modern Stone Age people, thats what I always tell people. The kids who meet us actually think were actually from the Stone Age.  We try and bring this way of living into our lives when we can. I had a whole day off the other day so I made loads of arrows, and when we have a day as a family we always choose to spend time in nature in these woods or where. Dan, who also has an older daughter, Sam, who lives in London, said: I do dress up most days. Occasionally youll forget and go and get petrol and catch yourself in the reflection and think, oh damn, its happened again. The reaction in the car when I have my full face paint on in a traffic jam is pretty funny too, they just stare. Naomi added: When you go to pay its like the cashier is thinking, dont let them know I know.  They dont go wow, are you going to a fancy dress party  They dont say anything, which is almost weirder. They will askyoure having a good day. Im like, I know I am dressed up like a cave woman. The pair really are the modern-day Flintstones - and while there is no Dino on the scene, there is a giant mammoth called Matilda. Having always been interested in the outdoors, Dan worked as a survival consultant behind the scenes on ious TV shows. He met his we  years ago while working at a hostel in North Wales and together they share a passion for the outdoors. But they decided thatthey were going to properly teach survival skills then they would have to go and experience it, so in  they went on Lynx Vildens Stone Age immersion project in America.  The one month course taught cave dweller skills and culminated in living completely primitively in the wild without any modern equipment, with the couple forced to make everything they needed to survive as a primitive person from scratch. Naomi said: We wanted to teach with more authenticity, instead of saying you could make thisyou needed to, we wanted to be able to say this is what we did do. We went out there not really knowing what to expect and lived in a woodland a bit like here to the east of Washington. We learned all the primitive and Stone Age skills. It was four and a half months of learning over or six days a week. We hunted and prepared the food, we foraged, we made our own weapons, we made our own tools and learned how to make fire by friction, found clay from the ground to make pots, made all of our clothes from dead animals. Dan added: We had no communications with the outside world, no mobile phones, sosomething went drastically wrong, it would go drastically wrong. There were no provisions for emergencies, we were living like primitive people would have done, and do. It was great to have that experience of no backup as it was real. It was us and our wits and we survived.  The couple brought their experience back to the UK to focus on teaching schoolchildren after the Stone Age entered into the curriculum. Since then, they have invited , children into the woods from September  to January last year. One of the activities involves allowing children to make real cave art using traditional red and yellow ochres and charcoal. They also show them how the art would have looked in Stone Age caves using torches. But sometimes it is just good for children to get back to nature, the couple say. Naomi said: Our ancestors were pretty awesome. These kids never have the chance to sit still and do nothing. They love it and ask to do it again in the morning. The couple are now set to publish their first book, Forest School Adventure, which provides essential bushcraft basics and Stone Age survival skills, plus outdoor play ideas. They hope it will encourage the next generation to understand and care for their natural environment. Naomi said: We might not insist the kids have worm soup and we dont hunt for our dinner, but we just want to do anything we can to encourage children to go outside.

The -year-old mum, from Wolverhampton, West Midlands, claims she often doesnt speak to a single adult for weeks on end. And when she does, its often strangers in local supermarkets that she chats to as a way of coping with her crippling loneliness. After sharing her experience of being lonely online last week, Emily received an influx of messages from people who were willing to be friends with her. The full-time single mum, said: I havent made any friends for years and I often feel very lonely.  I wont speak to a single person for up to three weeks and when I do its a shop assistant or a complete stranger. I visit supermarkets to interact with other adults and to engage in conversations I havent had for weeks. No one thinks loneliness affects people in their s, everyone thinks its something that affects older people. Every always sees me as a happy and bubbly person but deep down I am very lonely. Its even more apparent at this time of year when people start to think about Christmas and parties that theyll be attending. I hope other people read my story and can relate to the way I feel as its really isolating.  Emily knows that some people will argue that its impossible to feel lonely with three children but she doesnt agree. She added: I cant have proper conversations with my children and often theyre at school or at their dads. My youngest is three years old and although they do keep me occupied, they dont ease my loneliness. I have tried attending parent and baby groups but I still felt isolated at those so I stopped going. I visit the supermarkets as a way of speaking to people and it definitely helps combat some of my loneliness for a while. I spend over an hour doing my food shopping when it could be done in less than half that time. But I take my time so Im able to have more interaction with others.  It has been hard dealing with the feeling of being lonely but I have learnt how to cope with it over the years. Emily believes thatmore stories were shared like hers that more could be done to prevent other young women feeling lonely. She added: I feel like Im more lonely than the elderly as theres less support. At least they will get to speak to their carers or will have days out arrangedthey live in an old peoples home. When youre young there isnt that kind of support and its hard to make others understand how you feel. I havent made a new friend for over a decade and although I do speak to my mum and brother, I rarely see them. Im going to contact some of the people who reached out to my Facebook post as even just meeting up with someone once a month for a coffee would make a huge dference.

Grandparents are thought to be more likely to treat their grandchildren and feed them too much.But spending time with kids is supposed to have the opposite effect on the elderly, Lincolnshire Live reports.Older people are said to live longer being babysitters - as looking after children keeps them fit and active.  A study at the University of Sorbonne followed the progress in development of , children from when they were born to the day they turned eight, The Sun reports.It showed that kids who go to nursery for a year or more rather than get looked after by the grandparents are less likely to struggle socially. They were also discovered to be less likely to develop behavioural issues. In , the University of Glasgow looked in detail at children and the influence of grandparents. A review of  studies from  countries was conducted and yielded some rather eye-opening results. The results of the experiment found grandparents were unaware about their influences on factors such as weight and diet – through treating, overfeeding and a lack of physical activity.  Exposing them to second-hand smoke was also highlighted as a concern. The study was conducted by the university’s Social and Public Health Sciences Unit. Their findings were more worrying as they said that in the modern day two-thirds of grandparents now help with childcare.Dr Stephanie Chambers told The Sun: “Exposure to smoking and regularly treating children increases cancer risks as children grow into adulthood, it is also clear from the evidence that these risks are unintentional.“Currently grandparents are not the focus of public health messaging targeted at parents and in light of the evidence from this study, perhaps this is something that needs to change given the prominent role grandparents play in the lives of children.” However, there are positives from leaving the grandparents in charge. As well as helping create an incredible bond, it has been found affording such responsibility on your parents can help them live longer. people ages  and older took part in the Berlin Aging Study and it showed that the elderly who care for their grandkids had a lower risk of death.Factors such as being cognitively stimulated and keeping active were all attributed to helping the elderly live longer.Ronan Factora, MD of Cleveland Clinic did not take part in the study but told goodfullness : “There is a link between providing this care and reducing stress and we know the relationship between stress and higher risk of dying.“If providing care to grandchildren and others in need is one way that can actually reduce stress, then these activities should be of benefit to folks who are grandparents and provide this care to their grandkids.” "},{"url":null,"title":"meghan markle didnt stand queen","story":"NewsWhy Meghan Markle didnt stand with the Queen and Kate Middleton on Remembrance DayRoyal family fans became concerned after noticing that the Duchess of Sussex wasnt stood with members of the royal family during the Remembrance Day commemorations at the CenotaphShareCommentsByCourtney PochinAudience Writer:,  NOV Updated:,  NOV NewsMeghan Markle didnt stand with her fellow royals on Remembrance Day \"Get Royal Family updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailOn Sunday, November  thousands of people across Britain fell silent to mark  years since the end of the First World War. Among these were members of the royal family who solemnly watched Remembrance Day commemorations in London from a balcony overlooking the Cenotaph war memorial. In attendance were the Queen, the Duchess of Cornwall, the Duchess of Cambridge and the Duchess of Sussex. However royal fans noticed something rather bizarre about the positions in which the family members stood.  The Queen, Kate Middleton and Camilla all stood together on one balcony to watch the proceedings, while Meghan Markle stood on another balcony at a dferent window. Meghan, , wasnt alone though, she was joined by Elke Buumledenbender, the we of German President, Frank-Walter Steinmeier. One interpretation of this balcony situation is that Meghan had been asked to look after the Presidents we - a sign that the Queen has faith in her to handle diplomatic situations. However many people think this wasnt the case and claim the expectant mother was snubbed by the Queen.  Joe Little, managing editor of Majesty magazine, told PEOPLE he believes it was all to do with a royal pecking order and its something that was also obvious during Meghans Trooping the Colour debut in June - when she stood behind Prince William and Kate. He explained: She was not as prominent perhaps as some people might have expected, but theres a pecking order. There was no slight intended, but William being the older, more senior brother would go out [first] with his we.  Meghan was still in a good position, she was central rather than the alternative of being in the front row and along the balcony to the left or right. A palace source added that Meghans balcony position would have come from her. They added: Theres no one laying this out, telling her where to stand. And there were a lot of kids who everyone would want at the front.

The Queen selects her meals from a red leather-bound book put together by the royal chef. She marks her choices in pencil, crossing out dishes she doesnt want and writing in suggestions. During the week she wakes at .am and receives a cup of Darjeeling tea from her chambermaid, which she sips while listening to Radio ’s Today programme.  At her breakfast table cereals are presented in Tupperware containers. She also likes yoghurt, and marmalade on toast, sometimes tossing the crusts to her beloved dogs. For afternoon tea, usually at pm, she takes a selection of sandwiches with the crusts cut off and cakes including chocolate, ginger and fruit cake.

The nightclub bouncer, from Hull in Yorkshire, was sunning herself on a lounger on holiday in Cyprus with her -month-old daughter Layla on her lap when mum Carol, , snapped the pair off-guard. Little Laylas foot happened to be in an unfortunate position at the time - and the babys body blocks her mums clothes - making the photo look a little bit rude.Shawnna, from Hull, Yorkshire, said: I couldnt get it againI tried. Its definitely a one in a million shot. Because it was so sunny we couldnt really see the pictures so we were just taking absolutely loads. We didnt try and do anything funny which just made it funnier.I thought we could sort through them when the sun wasnt shining on the screen. I couldnt actually see them until we got back and I couldnt believe we had caught that picture. Its just how her foot was and how we had caught it in the angle of my lap. When we got back to the villa we started to sort through them. My mum pointed at one and said thats a nice picture that and I said I cant put that online. She was like why .So I just told her to look at the picture. She looked more closely and saw where Laylas foot was. She was shocked and told me I had to put it online because its so funny. She posted it on Facebook with the caption: MASSIVE MASSIVE PHOTO FAIL. When it just slips out of your bikini.Laylas little foot looks awfully like I have something hanging between my legs.

Some people are really lucky and get on with their partners parents like a house on fire, others just get burned. The latter is the case for one bride-to-be who thought her mother-in-law was a big fan of her, but has recently discovered things arent quite what they seem and now theyre not even speaking. The woman revealed all the hairy details in a post on Reddit and claims it all started when they went wedding dress shopping.  It should have been a special day, but one small thing ruined it all. Going by the username Baboou, the bride-to-be revealed online that shes been with her fianceacute for five years and theyve decided to get married. And like any bride, she needed to find something to wear on the big day, so she invited a group of people to go with her in search of the perfect dress. My mom and one of my good friends came up from southern Calornia to go dress shopping for a wedding dress. I invited my soon to be mother-in-law and my finances sister to come along as well.  Overall we had a great day and I got the most amazing dress. My mom cried and my fianceacutes mom cried, it was special. Over lunch, the Reddit user revealed that they continued the wedding talk, getting on to the topic of whose name she was going to take once she settled into married le. At lunch my mom told everyone she suggested I keep my maiden name for work only and take my fianceacutes name for personal le.  I have a problem with clients asking to be friends on Facebook and Instagram which I can not do because it goes against my works rules. I want to keep my personal le private from my work le. My fianceacutes mom agreed with my mom because that is what she does for work too. But later after everyone had gone home she discovered her fianceacutes mom didnt agree with it at all. She explains: Later that night after we all parted ways, I get a text message that was accidentally sent to me. It was from my fianceacutes mother. I made the mistake of reading it from my car with my fianceacute in the car.  The text said the whole day was a s*** show and that my mom advised me not to take my fianceacutes name. The bride-to-be says the message hurt her and shes furious that her mother-in-law is spreading lies about her mom - and to top it all off she had to explain to her partner what really happened. I tell him about the lunch and what my mom said and he totally got it because his mom uses her maiden name for work and her and I work in the same industry. He asked his mom to apologise for what she said but she is refusing.  She added: Im not sure what to do at this point. I saw my future mother-in-law the other day and she refused to look at me or even talk to me. But Im the kind of person who likes to kill you with kindness which seems to drive her crazy. What do I do from here  Loads of people have replied to the worried bride sharing their best advice. One person wrote: You cant really do anything about it - shes not going to change. It wasnt about your mom in the slightest. Another commented: Id just know where she stands and keep her on a short leash with personal interaction and information. A third said: Be careful and dont let her try and rug sweep this incident becauseyou allow her to act like none of this ever happened, shes going to think she gets a free pass to treat you like crap.

The incident took place at the Tadoba Andheri Tiger Reserve in the district of Chandrapur in the central Indian state of Maharashtra. Footage shows at least two passengers inside the Maruti Gypsy jeep when a tiger suddenly spots them and starts running after the vehicle. Some of the passengers are heard panicking while the big cat powers after them at top speed, getting very close to the vehicle at one point. The incident came just three days after a committee of animal experts and government officials launched an investigation into the killing of the tigress Avni.  Local authorities were strongly criticised for shooting the tigress, which is believed to have killed  people in the last two years. Avni was tracked down in the forest and shot dead. Animal rights groups slammed the way in which the tigress was labelled a man eater and killed, instead of authorities trying to capture it alive. The forest department has been asked to carry out a full investigation into Avnis killing.

A search-and-rescue operation was launched on Sunday night after the alarm was raised when the windsurfer - last seen at pm - had not ed home. RNLI leboats, the coast guard helicopter and a naval vessel were deployed to the area and battled severe winds and sea swells in the darkness to search for the man off the Irish coast. A spokesman for the Fenit RNLI said: Fenit RNLI was requested to launch their all-weather leboat at .pm following initial reports from the Irish Coast Guard that there was a person reported overdue off the Ballybunion coast in Co Kerry. The all-weather leboat under Coxswain Tony Stack launched immediately and the volunteer crew made their way to the scene. Later in the evening, the inshore leboat from Kilrush RNLI was subsequently requested to launch and join the search.  The search continued until about pm when news came that the windsurfer had managed to make it ashore and raise the alarm with a member of the public. He was subsequently transferred by ambulance to University Hospital Limerick. The windsurfer had managed to travel the  nautical miles from Ballybunion in Co Kerry to Kilkee in Co Clare. Speaking following the call-out, Charlie Glynn, Kilrush RNLI crew member and leboat press officer said: This is such good news this morning and we are delighted that after the windsurfer was missing for so long yesterday evening, that this man is alive, he said.  While we dont have the details from the casualtys perspective, he had to have been an experienced windsurfer who was wearing the correct clothing and gear, and who knew what to do when he got into dficulty. He stayed with his board and managed somehow to travel the long distance to shore. All in the RNLI wish him well for a full and speedy recovery following what must have been a frightening experience for him. We would remind everyone taking to the sea to always respect the water. Always carry a means for calling for help, such as a personal locator beacon, especiallyyou are on your own, it could be a lesaver. Always tell someone you are going out and when you will be back. Make sure they know where you are sailing and who to callyou are not back in time.

Friday night action and insists the healthy crowd despite dficult weather conditions proves there is an appetite for it.He said: “I love Friday night football and think we should push for it a little bit more.“The crowd were great.“At five, six o’clock people have that decision to make as to whether to go along to the game or not.“I could fully understand why they wouldn’t with the conditions and the wind.“However, our supporters responded well with good numbers and real voice because they saw their team play in a good manner.“Hibs also took up a good support.“Playing on a Friday night has always been good for us and it was great that we managed to get another win.”Friday night football also offers the opportunity to put points on the board and then watch how rivals react over the weekend.Victory courtesy of a Gary Mackay-Steven goal leapfrogged Aberdeen above Hibs into the top six.Although it was Scotland cap Mackay-Steven who netted the decisive goal, McInnes reckons striker Stevie May caused the Hibs defence major problems.A £, signing from Preston North End last summer, May has netted just once this season.The -year-old received a standing ovation when substituted late on.McInnes said: “Stevie was brilliant and I didn’t want to take him off but he was feeling a tight calf.“He has had a really strong game and a half now in the last couple of games now.”In-form Aberdeen have now racked up four straight victories that have produced a rise up the Premiership table and booked a Betfred Cup final slot with Celtic on December .Shutting out Hibs was the third clean sheet within that run of four wins, with Rangers and Hamilton also drawing blanks against the Reds.McInnes said: “The responsibility to keep a clean sheet is there for everybody, it is down to the whole team.“We were lacking in size against Hibs and only really had two bits of height in Mikey Devlin and Scott McKenna.“You have Lewis Ferguson, Max Lowe and Shay Logan giving away inches inside our box but they were still really competitive and got their head on things.“It is a team that delivers a clean sheet but there is no doubt there are some key players within that helping.“The centre-half partnershiphas been very good recently and hopefully that continues.”Seven Aberdeen players have joined up with Scotland on international duty.Joining Alex McLeish’s senior squad for the UEFA Nations League ties with Albania and Israel are Graeme Shinnie, McKenna, Gary Mackay-Steven and Devlin.Meanwhile, Bruce Anderson, Connor McLennan and Lewis Ferguson have met up with Scot Gemmill’s Under- squad to face Turkey in Spain later this month.Ferguson is a first-team regular, while Anderson and McLennan are pushing for a regular slot.McInnes insists their emergence underlines the strength of his squad.He said: “The squad is in a good place at the moment and there are boys on the bench itching to play their part.“A couple of the younger lads, Bruce Anderson and Connor McLennan, are looking to get involved.“It is pleasing to have a clean bill of health at the minute and have the players knuckling down and getting on with the game in

might be a good chance to raise some much-needed cash for motor neurone disease, as well as allowing Kenny to have a catch-up with friends from his playing days.The ageing group took to the pitch yesterday at Balmoral Stadium, home of Highland League team Cove Rangers, who donated the facility free of charge.After the game, an aching Adrian Bremner, who helped organised the event, said: “It

he is.“Part of it was so that we could all see people from the old days, but it was mostly for Kenny. Everyone appreciated him as a player and as a person, and it’s an absolutely horrible thing that’s happened to him.”According to Adrian, Kenny was “emotional” before the match, as friend and former EE sports editor Charlie Allan read out a speech on his behalf.Through Charlie, Kenny said: “I really appreciate the fact that everyone is here. I live for the day now and I’m sure I’ll enjoy this day more than most.“I had the honour of playing with and against most of you and it means a lot to me that you’re here.”Adrian was keen to thank Cove Rangers for their part in the game.He said: “It was really good of them to let us use the pitch, it was a nice thing that they did.“Half of us weren’t too happy about it though because the pitch is absolutely massive.”"},{"url":null,"title":"young striker macrae learns from the best in the league","story":"Cove Rangers striker Jordan MacRae believes he is learning from the best player in the Highland League in Mitch Megginson after the champions beat Forres Mechanics -.The victory makes it  out of  for the Granite City side in the league.

I came here to win things. We’ve won all  league games and the Aberdeenshire Cup and we want to keep winning.”Cove manager John Sheran said: “Playing Forres is always tough, but I felt we were dominant and in control for the majority of the time.“We played some great football and on another day there could have been more goals but the keeper had some good saves and we were unlucky.“After a - defeat to Formartine in the Aberdeenshire Shield it was good to bounce back with three points.“I don’t like to single people out but I thought Jamie Masson and Blair Yule in the middle of the park were outstanding.“But the whole team played well and that was the pleasing thing that they showed a great appetite and hunger to work hard.”On five minutes the visitors should have led. Simon Allan’s free-kick was met by Ross MacPherson, Stuart McKenzie saved the powerful header but with the goal gaping MacPherson nodded the rebound wide.Two minutes later Cove led when MacRae’s ball found MEGGINSON, the striker wriggled past Callum Howarth on the right side of the area and fired low into the bottom left corner.On  minutes Can-Cans keeper Blair Moir made a fine ing save to keep out Daniel Park’s  yarder.On  minutes Masson was unlucky as his shot from  yards hit the outside of the left post.Three minutes from the interval Moir made a point-blank stop to deny Megginson from three yards after Harry Milne cut the ball back from the left. The crucial second goal came for Cove  minutes into the second half.A corner wasn’t cleared by Forres and the ball was worked out to MASSON who moved in off the left flank and fired an unstoppable right-foot shot into the top right corner.Cove had chances to add to the score. Megginson shot wide on the turn and Milne came close with a low strike before Megginson galloped through but clipped just wide from the left of the penalty area.With  minutes left Forres missed a chance to get back in the game as Scott Moore sent Andrew MacRae through but McKenzie saved his angled shot.In stoppage time Forres’ Graham Fraser was given a straight red card by ref Scott Leslie for denying a clear goalscoring opportunity after he hauled back Jordon Brown  yards out.Forres manager Charlie Rowley said: “I’m delighted with the way we applied ourselves and I thought we showed bravery throughout the game and were beaten by the better side.“I think the red card was an incredible decision because it was  yards from goal and I felt we had two covering defenders that could have got back to cover. It was a booking and Graham will have to serve a suspension because of that decision.”"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 34","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowWe head Loch Caolisport for this week#s reader#s photograph.It was taken by Delores Firth of Ormsary from her garden looking down towards Loch Caolisport and Ellary.Delores said: #The cloud formations were my real focus when I took this picture.#Send your favourite photographs to the Argyllshire Advertiser for publication.

So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs.

I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

Star lost possession in midfield and Connor Crawford’s clearance was closed down by the Kings Park forward whose shot beat Kalache from the edge of the box and the hosts took a - lead on the hour mark.This visibly knocked the confidence of the Star team and Kings added a second goal when poor play again from Star trying to break gted possession to the hosts and once again their striker was on hand to make it - and give Star a mountain to climb in the last twenty minutes.Star didn’t give up however and could have been back in the game when the ball fell to Gregor Peacock in the box, the ing striker hit the shot and the ball was saved by the Kings Park goalkeeper.Kyle Selfridge went close to claiming a late leline but his free kick from twenty yards cannoned off the bar and the game finished - to the home side.The Star management team were disappointed as that’s the first time the Lochgilphead side have failed to score in the league in more than two years.On Saturday November  Red Star play host to Campbeltown pupils in what looks like another tough league match.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13548879.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS166431538.jpg","title":"beith juniors president says club","story":"NewsBeith Juniors president says club are ready for Scottish Cup day with Ayr UnitedThe Mighty president, John Boal, says Ayrs large travelling support will be given a warm welcome at Bellsdale Park.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  NOV NewsBeith president John Boal\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBosses at Beith Juniors today insisted they are ready and able to host Ayr United in the Scottish Cup.

Accusations of spies lurking furtively in the shadows. And claims of sabotage as posters advertising a “summit” meeting are mysteriously ripped off walls and hoardings. No – it’s not a meeting of the Klu Klux Klan in Hickory Hollow, Arakansas in the s. And no . . . it’s not a clandestine, cover-up being leaked in the basement of Washington’s Watergate Hotel in the s. This is Troon, South Ayrshire  . . . and the cloak-and-dagger involves the proposed take-over of a community activity centre. It’s Dundonald Gymnastics Clubversus Muirhead Tennants and Residents Association . And in the middle we have SAC. Normally this would mean South Ayrshire Council . . . but in this case, it really stands for Sell All Centres. Andthere’s room for another acronym – let’s throw in the real reason behind this rammy – it’s called C.A.T . . . Community Asset Transfer. SAC wants to get Muirhead Activity Centre – and its running costs – off its books. DCG – a well organised and well funded gymnastic club – would love it as their new permanent home. They’re currently based in Dundonald Activity Centre – but having to move vaulting horses and other equipment after every session is apparently getting in the way of healthy exercise. With DACattached to Dundonald Primary School and protected from CAT, the Muirhead building is a sitting target for them. But DGC operate classes seven days a week – and a take-over would leave little or no room for other sports and clubs that currently use Muirhead. And it’s this possible exclusion of other sports and interests - by a single self-serving club - that has rightly upset MTRA. But the real villain in this localised skirmish is the Community Asset Transfer policy itself. Our local council is using it as a convenient back door to off load the expense of running village halls and community properties across the whole of South Ayrshire. Interestingly, last week’s Budget - in a nod to the centenary of  – announced extra funding to protect and preserve the many village halls built to help small communities recover from the ravages of the Great War. In stark contrast, South Ayrshire Council wants to wash their hands of them! The Muirhead decision will finally fall to a full SAC meeting. It will be interesting to seethe four elected Troon councillors look their constituents in the eye – or choose to look away in line with council policy. From where I sit, Dundonald Gymnastics Club has  plus members, a waiting list, over  internet followers and employs more coaches than Dodds of Troon. It appears everyone and their auntie wants to see the wean wearing a wee blue leotard and a medal. That’s fine. But surely not at the expense of other children with other interests and needs. If DGC want a place to themselves – let them find it and fund it themselves.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilSchoolsWorld War TroonDundonaldAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13556297.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS166933205.jpg","title":"cafe owners ayrs newmarket street","story":"NewsCafe owners in Ayrs Newmarket Street pay tribute to businessman Craig BrysonKaren and Nino Pajovic say they have lost \"one of their own\" in the passing of Craig Bryson, .ShareByStuart Wilson:,  NOV NewsNino and Karen with their tribute \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailCafe owners in Ayr’s Newmarket Street this week led tributes to their “loyal friend” Craig Bryson.

Lieutenant Walter Tull, was Britain’s second black professional footballer who had signed up with Rangers, and trained as an officer cadet in Gailes, Ayrshire. Walter- along with millions of other soldiers- will be honoured on Sunday, November  in a nationwide gesture of remembrance. A large-scale portrait of Walter Tull designed by sand artists Sand In Your Eye, will be drawn into the sand on the beach and washed away as the tide comes in. And the public will be asked to join in by creating silhouettes of people in the sand, remembering the millions of lives lost or changed forever by the conflict. The project is the latest collaboration between the National Theatre of Scotland and - NOW, the UK’s arts programme for the World War  centenary, and will use  beaches all around the UK as their canvasses for the mass art-work. Each of the beaches taking part in the project will commemorate a dferent WW casualty.  Walter Tull was born to Alice Elizabeth Palmer, from Kent, and Daniel Tull from Barbados, the son of a slave, on April , . After the death of his parents he and his brother Edward were placed in a children’s home in Bethnal Green. Edward was later adopted and it is believed that he went on to be Britain’s first black dentist after taking over his father’s practice on St Vincent Street in Glasgow. Walter, however, began playing football with Tottenham Hotspur in , and after touring South America with them he was offered a contract, making him the second black professional footballer in Britain. When playing for Tottenham and later Northampton Town he faced a lot of racial abuse and prejudice, yet he went on to have a successful football career. In , Northampton Town began negotiations to transfer Tull to Glasgow Rangers. However, the First World War broke out before Tull could play a game for Rangers. He enlisted as a private in the Footballers’ Battalion of the British Army, where he was quickly promoted to be a sergeant. He took part in and survived the Battle of the Somme, after which he was sent to England to recover from illness. He then went to train as an officer cadet in Gailes, Ayrshire. Although black officers were not allowed in the British Army at this time, he was commissioned in May , thus becoming the first black combat officer in the British Army. He died in battle in France in , during the last major German offensive. His body was never found. Walter will be remembered this Sunday as the public pay their respects to millions of fallen servicemen. • Activities on Ayr beach will happen between .am and am.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnBritish ArmyArmed forcesAdoptionWorld War Ayr United FCAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"detectives step up hunt armed","story":"NewsDetectives step up their hunt for armed thugs who attacked and attempted to rob woman in her homeShareByGary Fanning:,  NOV Updated:,  NOV NewsPolice are now appealing for information after the incident\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailDetectives today have stepped up their hunt for two armed thugs who attacked a terried woman and tried rob her in her Ayr home.

The incident along with other concerns has sparked a proposed shake-up of taxi and private hire rules. The middle seat in the front could be ditched from fleets of larger vehicles following a public consultation. The public are going to be askedpeople should still be allowed to sit in the front of vehicles. The consultation will also questionthe number of passengers sitting up front should be reduced to one. South Ayrshire Council’s Leadership Panel heard last week how the middle passenger was seated too close to drivers. A report presented to councillors said the close proximity left drivers open to accusations of “inappropriate conduct. Explaining one incident reported to the council,licensing team leader Morag Douglas said: “There were concerns that a driver was threatened by young girls who booked a private hire. “They left without paying and stated thatthe driver took any action the driver would be reported to the police for inappropriate conduct.” She said the council received other gripes from drivers about what a tight squeeze it is with two passengers in the front. Ms Douglas told how drivers said having “two larger people in the front seats” meant it is dficult to control the car without touching middle seat passengers. All eight seater vehicles licensed by the council have two passenger seats in the front and six in the back. Depute council leader Brian McGinley said: “It is as much about protecting the drivers as the passengers.” He added: “We need to be cautious and make sure that whatever we come up with doesn’t have unintended consequences.” Glasgow and Edinburgh City Councils don’t permit passengers in the front seats of taxis. Feedback from South Ayrshire Taxi and Private Hire Operators’ Forum members suggested the inidual drivers should decidethey want passengers up front. The members also told the council there should still be an option to have two passengers seated in the front. There are  licensed taxis and  private hire vehicles in South Ayrshire.

McSherry, now an Ayr publican, said: “Johnny, who had long hair like one of the Beatles, was one of my heroes when I was starting out as a player. “When I joined the club in , Johnny and his we were so welcoming to me.

He joined Ayr for pound, in  and went on to score  goals in  games. In October of his first season, he scored all four as Ayr came from - down to beat Airdrie - at Broomfield.

Ally handed him the captaincy in - and great times continued as Ayr beat Dunfermline - in April  – player of the year Johnny scored twice – to secure a place in the inaugural Premier League. Graham twice played for the Scottish Football League XI. He ed to Falkirk at the start of season - but within two years came back to Ayr as reserve team coach.

This is a very concerning piece of news, especially given the fact that the Tesco bus also serves the health centre.ldquoIt comes at a time when we are being told that we need to use public transport more because of dire warnings about the impact of climate change and when massive house building will lead to gridlock unless newcomers can be persuaded onto buses.Mr Turner added: ldquoEast Lothian generally, and Musselburgh in particular, is now renowned for its excellent bus services so this announcement comes as a blow and runs counter to all that has been achieved on the public transport front in the last few of years.ldquoLetrsquos hope that the council, working with the operators, can come up with a proposal to replace the extremely useful Tesco bus, and in doing so letrsquos try to serve some places that are currently remote from buses ndash Edenhall Road and the Muckletts, for example, both had buses until a few years ago and theirwould, I am sure, be welcomed by elderly residents.ldquoI think the Tesco bus should be replaced by something very similar, perhaps marketed as the Musselburgh community bus.

We actively engaged with local providers and Prentice coaches are implementing changes to the  service, which will start on October  from Longniddry to Fort Kinnaird via the Tesco turning area and will now mirror the times of the T T to allow connection from other services.ldquoOperators looked at the T  service the general conclusion was that a straight like-for-like service was not commercially viable due to the numbers using the service.ldquoThe council is not licensed to operate the running of service work and our own fleet is at full capacity however, we will continue to discuss options, which will include community buses as a way to support residents who are affected.Ross Prentice, managing director of Prentice Coaches Ltd, said: ldquoWe are starting a new bus service, the , on Monday.

She is originally from another European country but has made Haddington her home, with her husband and two wonderful children.Her explorations of nearby woods led her to discover an unusual grave amongst the trees. It is a grave of a horse, buried in the th century. It was this grave she had offered to show me. To get there we had a beautul walk along a secluded section of the banks of the Tyne. It was the trees I noticed first, of course, which were dotted along the banks of the river.Autumn was just then beginning to brush the trees with its colour, and it was one of those evenings when the setting sun seemed to take its time, bathing the land in bright streaks of orange light. Along the way, Marije paused and said: ldquoThis is my tree.It was a beech tree of signicant age, its branches arching over the Tyne, asfishing. She showed me her sitting place, underneath its embracing canopy. Here the roots curved to make a natural seat. Her older son spoke of seeing kingfishers, and sure enough, this was a perfect place to absorb the majesty of the Tyne as it flowed towards Haddington. Another beech of similar age grew close by. Their branches entwined, making it look like they were sisters holding hands.But I sensed then there was more to Marijersquos connection to this place, although I then had no idea just how powerful her story was.When we finally got to our destination in the woods further upriver, the light was too weak to penetrate the trees. The old grave of the horse was shrouded in darkness.Yet with the help of mobile torches we could view it, and for sure the grave was interesting and worth a story in its own right. I vowed to find out more about its background as we headed back to Marijersquos house in the dying embers of a sunset.When we reached her house we were treated to wonderful hospitality. It was then that Marije told her story of the beech tree.Not long ago she had been diagnosed with cancer. She faced the possibility of being taken by this cruel disease. Numbness and disbelief at first overcame her, then there was the realisation that le might be very short and she would have to leave her two young children.She walked to the beech tree soon after her diagnosis and sat cradled by its roots. Despite having family and friends whose love and support was invaluable, Marije explained it can also be a desperately lonely feeling. ldquoWe all know we canrsquot live forever, she told me, ldquobut to face the reality of my end at such a young age and with children was unbearable.ldquoI went on that walk to the tree in the most dire situation, she told me. ldquoI felt a connection as I sat under the tree, I really felt her old wisdom and energy.Her love for her young children is what gave her strength in the worst of times. The tree seemed to symbolise this powerful bond, its roots deeply holding it safe.ldquoPeople talk about mother nature, Marije said, ldquoand I understand why. When my hair fell out, I lsquogave it backrsquo to nature, underneath the beech. I know it makes me sound weird, but it really helped me.It is not weird, of course. Trees are full of wisdom, not in the sense of actual words but in the spiritual sense. Beech is said to be the matriarch of the wood, sometimes called the mother of the forest. It is a good listener. Our best ideas and inner reflections can come when we sit under the embrace of an old tree even science tells us this now.Sadly not everyone wins the fight against cancer, but thankfully Marije recovered after treatment. The experience has left her treasuring every single day and taking no sunrise for granted. And she is thankful to her beech tree, which was her companion and confidant in those times of emotional agony. It remains for her a place of contemplation and peace, where she can give thanks and absorb the joy of being alive.ldquoI cherish every day now in ways I didnrsquot before, she told me. ldquoI think it is important to allow our kids to feel the connection with nature. That means being in nature, and respecting it. After all, we are all part of it.This was the real story of that walk on that day a story of incredible bravery, pain, love and determination by a young mum I now have the privilege to call a friend."},{"url":null,"title":"labour-ties-bring-meeting-to-a-halt","story":"Prestonpans businessman Ferhan Ashiq had applied to increase the size of an alcohol display ndashand for a name change ndash at one of his stores.But Councillor Jim Goodfellowimmediately recused himself from the application because of his friendship with Mr Ashiq, who is a member of East Lothian Labour Party.After a short adjournment, Councillor Fiona Dugdale , convenor, also declared an interest.Remaining Labour councillor John McMillan, however, said he did not believe his relationship with Mr Ashiq, who has shops in Musselburgh and Prestonpans, could have an impact on his ability to make a decision, while Conservative councillor Jane Henderson said she did not know him.The boardrsquos legal adviser described the situation as ldquounusual but said the board was no longer quorate and Mr Ashiqrsquos application would have to be continued to the next licensing board for a decision.But a bemused Mr Ashiq noted: ldquoWhen it comes to the next meeting I will know most of the board members there.Legal adviser Carlo Grilli advised Mr Ashiq to send his father, whose name was on the application, and an agent instead.The application was to change the name of Mr Ashiqrsquos Prestonpans store on Redburn Road from Day-Today to Day Todayand increase the alcohol display from . square metres to . square metres."},{"url":null,"title":"rare-bottle-of-whisky-to-be-auctioned-for-combat-stress-charity","story":"It is one of only , matured in an American bourbon barrel for eight years, with a cask strength of  per cent alcohol.The auction is part of a fundraiser for Combat Stress, the veteransrsquo mental health charity, and is being organised by the music group the Flying Aspidistras ahead of their concert of remembrance, Now the Guns are Silent, at Gosford House on Sunday.The occasion will be a reflection on the harsh reality of war and the suffering felt beyond the battlefield.Kilchoman distillery on Islay has bottled this special single cask to coincide with the centenary of the end of the First World War.More poignantly, it is also to commemorate the sinking of two troopships, the SS Tuscania and the HMS Otranto, with the loss of nearly  men, in the waters around Islay in .Ailsa Fortune, the events organiser, said: \"The war affected every community in Scotland, from Islay to East Lothian.\"The end of any war leaves many broken lives.

network was a ldquodirect result of cuts to local authority funding by the Scottish Government.He said: ldquoThe condition of roads is a problem across Scotland. This is a direct result of the Scottish Government slashing council funding over this period, with East Lothian Council having suffered cuts of around pound million in the last five years.ldquoEast Lothian Council has done its utmost to protect the budget.ldquoThe Scottish Government needs to recognise the impact its cuts are having and give local authorities the funding they need to protect services, including road maintenance.The county is currently covered by km of roads, ranging from class A routes to unclassied lanes.And an Annual Status and Options Report, produced on behalf of East Lothian Council, has revealed that  per cent are currently in need of repair.The report, which looks at the impact of future funding on network maintenance in the long term, warns that the current level of investment of pound.million a year will mean that more than  per cent of the roads will be in a state of disrepair in  yearsrsquo time.And it reveals that, as an asset, East Lothian Councilrsquos carriageways depreciate in value by poundmillion every year.It also found that nearly km of rural public roads in the county were in poor condition and needed immediate investigation and possible treatment.The report said: ldquoThe level of investment on public roads in East Lothian has not been sufficient to limit the decline in the overall condition of the network.It revealed that additional investment of pound.million over the next  years could signicantlyimprove the state of the roads, with fewer than  per cent likely to need repairs by the end of the decade.Peter Forsyth, asset manager for East Lothian Council, said that the recommendation for operating the carriageways following the report was to continue with the current level of investment.In a report to the councilrsquos policy and performance review committee, he said the costs of corrective treatments, in particular carriageway reconstruction, were ldquoprohibitive and a preventative treatment approach should ldquomitigate the need to invest signicantly.But he warned: ldquoShort-term under-investment could result in major long-term expenditure necessary to recty major defects which could have been addressed earlier.Councillor Jane Henderson , leader of the opposition, said: ldquoOur road infrastructure assets are vital and dficult decisions will need to be made.ldquoWithout investment now the amount of money needed in the future will be a greater problem the old expression of lsquoa stitch in time saves ninersquo was never so apt.ldquoThe decision on how much to spend on roads now will inevitably mean choices.

It is a collection of stories and anecdotes mainly relating to sporting le and animals.The following tale is inspired from one of the anecdotal stories in Eganrsquos book:ONE autumn evening in the early th century, a storm descended on the county. Dark clouds opened their dreich souls and drenched the land with a torrent of rain. The wind and downpour kept people awake for the whole night, and but by sunrise the tempest was over.Yet all the sudden rain had caused the River Tyne to flood. The folk of Haddington gathered by its banks to witness a strange sight. For the surface of the water was laid with huge masses of hay. The storm had obviously caused the hay recently cut and stacked in the fields upriver to be blown into the flood water, or swept away by it.They watched as small mountains of hay floated by. It was an intriguing sight but of course for farmers it was their winter feed for their animals going waste to the sea.Then someone spotted a swan. It seemed to be attempting to find a place to land. The river was in a torrent and at times the majestic creature seemed to give in to the current and glide on its course until once again it found the strength and motivation to make for the river bank. It was in no imminent danger, but clearly desired to get out of the fast-moving water.As people watched the swan it was noticed that a strange black spot could be seen amidst its white feathers. As the swan drted closer to the bank, people realised what the black spot was: a rat!The rat was clearly alive, at times peeping over the plumage asto see where they were. The swan seemed unperturbed by the ratrsquos presence on its back. In fact, as people watched more closely there seemed to be a connection between the swan and the rat which was most unusual.The royal bird was clearly giving the rat a collie-buckie, or piggy back. How the rat came to be on the swanrsquos back in the first place nobody could tell. The wee creature was very likely at home in one of the bales of hay when it was swept away by the river. In the swirling water it must have struggled to survive.Then rescue came with the swan. Could the creature have scrambled onto the swan without its permission  Surely not! Did the swan actively help the rat  If so, the moment of rescue had been a compassionate act unseen by human eyes. As people followed the drama they realised that the swan was looking for a place to land, not for itself but for its passenger.A crowd had soon gathered to witness the swanrsquos progress. The power of the flood water meant it had real dficulty in finding a place to get close to the river bank. But finally the swan found the strength and opportunity to swim close to the riverrsquos edge.The rat, recognising the opportunity, leaped from the swanrsquos plumage and landed safely on dry land. For an instant the rat turned and looked at the swan, then scampered away. The swan, its mission accomplished, majestically glided back into the main flow of the river.If the rat had thought itself safe then it soon realised this not to be the case. The people watching the spectacle had motivations very dferent to the swan. As soon as the rat landed, dozens of young men, urged on by their elders, chased it with sticks and set their dogs upon it.The animal, having survived naturersquos tempest, now faced an even greater danger his le was sport for humans. The creature zigzagged as people, yelling and howling with delight, chased it this way, then that. The rat, being cornered by a group of about  lads armed with stones and sticks, turned and headed back towards the water.But it didnrsquot make it. The creature was given a deadly blow by a lsquomerciless fellowrsquo. A cheer rang out and people came to view the dead rat. Then a strange silence descended as people reflected, now too late, on what had happened. In the frenzy of the chase it had been so easy to see the rat as merely vermin, rather than a living creature who had struggled to survive and so earned the right to le.People dispersed, no longer cheering.The whole scene had been witnessed by the swan from its vantage point on the river. What its thoughts were on the human behaviour it saw we can only guess.Humans can be made to do this to each other as well, of course. In the frenzy of war, people are encouraged to see others as no more worthy of le than that rat. And the insidious power of this is that both sides are encouraged to think the same way.But deep down, when we touch our humanity, we know how wrong this is. Old soldiers themselves are the first to understand the tragedy of it and see the humanity in those who had been on the lsquoother sidersquo. While there are undoubtedly people who commit evil and need to be stopped, it is the conditions which allow hate to flourish which give rise to their power and influence in the first place.In our remembrance of those who have fallen, let us do so with the reflection and not the frenzy. Let us not forget that the real enemy of us all is hate."},{"url":null,"title":"inspectors-impressed-on-visit-to-elphinstone-primary-school","story":"Parents of youngsters at Elphinstone Primary School and Nursery Class received a letter this week from Education Scotland and the Care Inspectorate following an inspection visit in September.The letter outlined a number of strengths at the school, as well as areas to improve.Fiona Robertson, head of education at East Lothian Council, told the Courier: ldquoWe are pleased that inspectors from both agencies recognise the positive dference that nursery and primary school staff are making for the children and their families in Elphinstone.ldquoThey considered leadership, learning, attainment and wellbeing amongst other areas and concluded that the school was good across these quality indicators.ldquoIrsquom especially pleased to see Alison Cameron receive recognition for her leadership and direction so early in her time as headteacher of the school.ldquoI know that she and the staff team will continue to put pupilsrsquo learning at the heart of all they do.ldquoIrsquod also like to recognise Heather Williamsrsquo work in laying the foundations for this positive outcome during her time at Elphinstone.The letter noted strengths in the schoolrsquos work, including kind and articulate children who make the most of their learning, and the warm, inclusive ethos that creates a family feel.No further inspections are planned, with the school urged to ldquodevelop a strategic, joined-up approach to self-evaluation to ensure that all children can achieve the best possible outcomes and to continue to develop the curriculum.Councillor Shamin Akhtar, cabinet spokeswoman for education, echoed the comments of Mrs Robertson regarding the schoolrsquos former and current headteacher.She said: ldquoThe inspection recognised a number of areas such as the positive relationships across the nursery and school which are making a dference for children and families.ldquoThey also commented that children were making the most of their learning and were provided with real leadership opportunities at the school."},{"url":null,"title":"austerity-over-in-the-county-definitely-not","story":"Jim Lamond, head of East Lothian Council resources, dismissed claims austerity was coming to an end as a report warned of uncertainty about the future of farming, food and drink, and tourism after the UK left the European Union .Audit Scotland identied the potential problems facing East Lothian as the key sectors of its economy came under risk.

And right here is where you start paying hellip in sweat.Imagine, then, my excitement when I found out that itrsquos not too late to don a leotard and pair of footless tights ndash legwarmers optional ndash and release my inner ballerina.Adult ballet is a fast growing trend, thanks mostly to the revived interest in dance sparked by the reality TV series Strictly Come Dancing.There are now adult classical ballet classes for Absolute Beginners at Scottish Ballet, where you can learn how to do a plieacute without the pressure of feeling like a failureyou donrsquot make the corps de ballet.Anybody of any age, shape or fitness level can and does take part in these classes. Ballet is great for fitness, boosting cardio, strength and flexibility, co-ordination and balance and is weight-bearing so it helps build muscles and bones. Ballet burns  calories an hour ndash more than a spin class ndash and is fantastic for posture and is also a known stress buster.There are waiting lists to get on the Scottish Ballet -week courses for absolute beginner, beginner and intermediate dancers and I found out why when I signed up for an absolute beginnersrsquo class there.Dance teacher Preston Clare is not quite as strict as Debbie Allenrsquos character Lydia Grant in Fame, but he does insist on correct technique with his students, who range in age from  to late s.ldquoI want everyone to be safe, so I teach them how to bend with their knees over the toes and the proper way to move through the foot against the floor so there arenrsquot any injuries, he says.One of the joys of teaching this class, Preston says, is watching the transformation in his students.ldquoTherersquos one man who is quite heavy. He had such a curved spine and hunched shoulders that when he lay flat on his back, his head couldnrsquot touch the floor. After a few weeks of ballet, he can now lie flat and hersquos lost a lot of weight.One of the reasons ballet is such an effective way to change your body, he explains, is the music ndash classes at Scottish ballet are accompanied by pianist Michael Barnett.ldquoProfessional ballet dancers have the physiques of athletes but dance is an art form, not a sport. The music lts you up ndash it helps you reach that bit further.Preston shows me into the large, bright studio at Scottish Balletrsquos headquarters at the Tramway in Glasgow. I gaze longingly at a pile of colourful tutus stacked outside the class but have to content myself with what Irsquom wearing: gym gear I usually wear to pilates. I notice the other women are in black leotards and tights with flippy little ballet skirts, but at least I have proper soft ballet shoes.Irsquove always been hopeless at learning new steps and Irsquom a little nervous about looking like one of the dancing hippos in Disneyrsquos Fantasia. However, Preston reassures me that everyone starts out the same.ldquoRelax and have fun, he says. ldquoMy students know they are not going to join a ballet company they are here to enjoy themselves. I love teaching adult beginners because they are so dedicated.Alexandra Lesley, an actress in her early s, and her partner, Keith Hooley, , are certainly committed: they travel from Thornhill in Dumfriesshire to attend the class once a week, a round trip of three hours.ldquoI love it. I get such a buzz and come out walking on air, says Alexandra. ldquoBallet keeps me fit and flexible.Keith, a retired quality controller, says: ldquoAlexandra encouraged me to go with her and I really enjoy it. My sciatica cleared up after one class and I donrsquot slouch any more. It also helps to keep my mind sharp ndash ballet doesnrsquot just exercise your muscles, joints and ligaments. At home we practise in the kitchen, using the counter tops as a barre.Josh Polson, , a teacher from Glasgow, has been impressed by how much more flexible and stronger he is playing American football since starting ballet last year. He was inspired to take up ballet after seeing his girlfriend, who is with Scottish Ballet, on stage.ldquoIrsquod never done anything like this before and wanted to see how dficult it was. Now I have even more respect for my girlfriend and how hard she works.Josh, too, finds the benefits arenrsquot just physical.ldquoI have a stressful job teaching children with behavioural dficulties. Ballet is very calming and allows me to switch off because Irsquom focusing so much on the steps.Itrsquos time for me to join the class. We start off with some simple barre exercises and I soon get into the swing of things, despite wobbling when we have to let go the barre and balance on tiptoe on one leg. Preston keeps the atmosphere light with some teasing and jokes and Irsquom soon having fun.ldquoThis is easy-peasy, I think, dreaming of skipping straight to beginners. But it soon gets harder as we move into a Polonaise ndash a skipping, sliding dance invented by Louis IV, to allow men at his court to show off their calves. I soon get mixed up with the steps but manage to keep up. The pirouette is trickier to master as you have to whip your head around as you turn to avoid being dizzy. I end up dizzy ndash and hot and sweaty.Ballet is much harder than I expected and the next day my calf, arm and stomach muscles ache.A beginnersrsquo over-s class, surely, will be easier. But the class at Dance Factory on Glasgowrsquos Southside, is also demanding. After a few simple barre exercises, I end up tripping over two left feet during the dance sequence. I can sort of do the graceful arms, though, and channel Margot Fonteyn. The other women skip about with confidence, landing softly when they jump, their backs straight and arms properly swan-like. They may be in their s and s, but there isnrsquot a middle-aged spread or dowagerrsquos hump to be seen.ldquoBallet is excellent for strengthening your core and improving posture, says dance teacher Olivia McLay. ldquoItrsquos good for menopausal women because it builds bone mass ndash bones begin to thin at that age. It improves physical and mental agility, helps with balance, co-ordination and memory because you have to learn a sequence of steps.ldquoI sleep better, Irsquom stronger and feel more stretched and mindful, says Linda Weir, , from Glasgow. lsquoI just love it and would recommend it as a way to be stronger and fitter. Irsquove also made friends.Alison Lock, , from Glasgow said: ldquoItrsquos a physical and mental workout. Itrsquos much more fun than going to the gym, and it has stopped me feeling isolated.Linda Trainor, , was a talented ballerina as a child who won a scholarship at to the Royal Academy of Dance, but had to leave when her mother died.ldquoI always felt there was a hole in my le and itrsquos been wonderful to go back to ballet, even this late in le. It makes me happy.The many physical and mental benefits are the reason Scottish Ballet has classes for people with dementia, Parkinsonrsquos Disease, and a class for the elderly called Regenerate. Soon there will a class for people with multiple sclerosis.ldquoThere are proven benefits, says Catherine Cassidy, director of engagement at Scottish Ballet, who has seen a growing interest in the adult beginnersrsquo classes since they started three years ago.ldquoBallet improves balance, co-ordination and fluidity of movement. The music and rhythm combined with visualising unfolding your wings like a swan, for example, helps people with neurological conditions to move.ldquoBallet is also relaxing and gives you a sense of achievement as you master new skills. The mental health benefits are huge.Kerry Livingstone, head of the associatesrsquo programme at Scottish Ballet and head of Ballet at the Royal Conservatoire, says: ldquoIn these fast-paced days of social media and constant interruptions from emails and text messages, ballet forces you to concentrate fully and is great for mindfulness. It gives you self-discipline and because itrsquos an art, itrsquos uplting and creative.Undeterred by my clumsiness and encouraged by Preston and Olivia, Irsquove signed up for an Absolute Beginners course at Scottish Ballet ndash and Irsquom absolutely loving it.Ill never be the next Darcy Bussell but Irsquoll hopefully be stronger, more flexible and have the poise and graceful posture of a ballerina.See www.scottishballet and www.dancefactory"},{"url":null,"title":"herald-calendar-captures-the-beauty-of-scotland","story":"Herald calendar captures the beauty of ScotlandAn early morning view of the River Shiel near to Acharacle, on the Ardnamurchan ltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtpeninsula.

I noticed it one day when I went to collect my son. This would have been around .I mentioned it to a friend. She and I were in the same womens group and a friend of hers had died from breast cancer. The brass plaque beside the tree was mottled and not very well looked after.One day I saw my friend cleaning it. She told me that her friend who died had been active in the feminist economic movement and she was cleaning the plaque in her memory. The Glasgow Womens Library got involved and they campaigned for it to be Tree of the Year in .The Suffragette Oak makes me think about the forgotten history of these women: the hard work and striving that went unnoticed. Thanks to these women who went that extra mile, we now have the vote ndash we have a voice.The tree was badly damaged in a storm last year and the council had to make it safe. The bits cut off were given to Glasgow Womens Library and they are making it into things to sell to raise funds. Isnt that lovely Another special tree was one I saw at a holiday place we rented at Achnacloich, near Oban.The gardens there have this amazing redwood that looks like a gigantic hand.The reason it looks like a hand was that when it was planted a rabbit kept nibbling the bud in the middle. Every time this rabbit nibbled it, another shoot would come out the side. It was one of the first redwoods to be grown in Scotland.We were staying there with loads of kids and it was the best climbing tree in the world ndash they would get lost in it.You would be sitting outside having a cup of tea in the morning and suddenly hear a wee voice from up in the tree asking: \"Whats your favourite flavour of crisps \"Carole Baxter, Beechgrove Garden presenterI LOVE rowan trees. All the species are beautul. There is such a range of colourful berries and they are a hardy plant. In my garden in Aberdeenshire I have eight ieties including cashmiriana, Joseph Rock and the native rowan.I have enjoyed the rowan for its berries as long as I can remember, certainly from a young age. It is a value-for-money plant: you have the blossom and fruits, lovely foliage and great autumn colour.People perhaps arent aware of the range of species and named ieties. You dont need to have the one that has the orange-red berries you can get white, yellow and pink berries.There are some small ones as well, such as Sorbus reducta which is ideal for a rock garden. We have that one at Beechgrove as well as vilmorinii, which has pink berries with almost blueish foliage. Those were my plant choices.What is interesting is that birds tend to home in on the red and orange berries to start off with so,you have cashmiriana with its white berries, it tends to hold the berries a bit longer.This year has been particularly good for the fruits because we had a cold spring and it gradually got warmer, so we didnt have the frost and the blossoms werent damaged, which was then followed by a nice hot summer.It is nothing to do with the fact we are going to have a hard winter as people often say ndash thats an old wives tale ndash it is the fact that we have had a good season.Episodes of Beechgrove Garden are available on BBC iPlayer until November Gordon Buchanan, wildle filmmakerSCOTS pine has been my favourite tree from a young age. I grew up on Mull and I have always loved woodland. I spent a lot of time as a kid walking through the woods.One walk we did took us a mile or so out of Tobermory. When you are eight or nine, even just going a couple of miles out of town feels like you are exploring the other side of the planet.It was while out walking that I first saw a Scots pine. It was one of those classic old \"granny\" pines with so much character, the limbs were all twisted ndash there was one that came out at a right angle and shot skywards.This Scots pine stood among mixed birch and there was no other tree around it that looked the same. It seemed so exotic and out of place. Your eye was drawn to it.As I got older and spent time in the Cairngorms and Abernethy Forest, I learned that much of Scotland was covered in forests filled with these trees. I thought it was the most magical habitat.The tree then became a symbol for all the wildle that you find living in those forests. I have spent time filming capercaillie as well as red deer, red squirrels and pine martens among the trees.Weirdly, now I have travelled further than just a couple of miles out of town, whenever I see Scots pine, they dont look exotic to me. I have recently been working in Russia where there is mixed birch woodland and what I call \"Caledonian Forest\" ndash this reminder of home.My love of Scots pine is undiminished but they have gone from being a symbol of the exotic to something very familiar.A couple of years ago I was working in a mountainous region of Turkey and you could almost have been in the Cairngorms. It was very similar. I felt at home.Animal Families and Me with Gordon Buchanan is at Kirkintilloch Town Hall on November , Brunton Theatre in Musselburgh on November  and Rothes Halls in Glenrothes on November Kirsty Wark, broadcasterA TREE is a marker, something you look out for at a particular time of year. My Japanese maple in the garden, for example, you just know when the leaves are going to turn, be vivid and then flutter to the ground.The yellow-berried rowan is one of my favourite trees. I love lime trees because I think they are so vivid in the landscape.Trees represent a constancy. Planting trees is entirely altruistic because, unless they are fast-growing, you are never in your letime going to get the real benefit of them. I love the fact that parks were laid out by the Victorians ndash and even much earlier with Lancelot \"Capability\" Brown.After my father died, we planted a rowan where he loved to fish most, which was Kendoon Loch in Galloway. That was in . It is beside the water and Im not sure it is the most fertile place for it, but it is hanging on in there. I went to see it last week.In Celtic mythology the rowan symbolises courage and protection. That is why you will often see old houses with rowans planted in the front garden by the gate. We planted a red rowan for Dad, but I really like a yellow rowan too.I used to know the names of all the trees because I was in the Brownies. I dont know them all now. I love walking in the forest up to Glenashdale Falls and Whiting Bay on Arran, those specic spaces where you are surrounded by flora and fauna.Sir John Lister-Kaye, author and naturalistTHERE is an ash tree that is one of the biggest trees in the garden here at House of Aigas near Beauly and almost certainly the oldest ndash it is possibly  years old. It is right beside the house.Ashwas a very valuable timber throughout the th and th centuries. It was used for all sorts of things ndash implement handles, cart frames, furniture.It is a very good, close-grained hardwood. Very few ash trees ever survived more than  or  years, perhaps  years, because they were too valuable. Highlanders were not well off and it was a good way of making money.There are very few old ash trees in the Highlands. This one has survived simply because it is so close to an th-century house and I think the owners must have said many times: \"Dont fell that tree, we like it\". And so it survived.What is wonderful about it is that it has survived for so long and that means it has seen so much. For instance, it will have seen Bonnie Prince Charlie come through raising the clans which, of course, culminated in the Battle of Culloden.It saw the folk mourning after the loss of Culloden and it saw Cholmondeleys regiment come and camp here and then burn the tacksmans house down right beside it. The tree must have been scorched by that fire. The Frasers who were living here at the time were all murdered in May .It has witnessed some real horrors. Later, it will have witnessed the Highland Clearances, people pulling out and leaving for the New World. It will have witnessed the Victorians arriving with their grand ideas and turning the place into a sporting estate.This \"loftier ash\", as I call it ndash because that is what Fraxinus excelsior means ndash has seen a lot of history and for that reason alone it is a very valuable tree. In my book Song of the Rolling Earth: A Highland Odyssey, I dedicated a whole chapter to it.Let me read you a bit from it: \"The ash tree has witnessed it all. I stand at its foot. Great roots have corrugated the ground around it with broad woody thongs undulating outwards in a circular plate of tangle and deep grip, roots that trail far across the lawns in every direction.\"It is solid, purposeful, locked in. Its trunk writhes with power. It is all heart. My fullest reach, both arms stretched, extends to less than a third of its circumference an inconsequential hug leaving me in awe of its rigid grandeur.\"Its bark is deeply grooved with long vertical ripples of hardness like a throng of ribbed buttresses all heading upward, shoring up its might, shedding veils of green dust at my touch.\"The bark fissures draw in treecreepers: those tiny mouse-like birds that dash upwards in little jerky pulses, defying gravity. Then, giving in to the earths pull, they flick down again, back to start, like a game of snakes and ladders never won.\"I am enthralled by this tree, rapt. Every time I stand here, I shrink it grows. I age it shrugs off such foibles and just goes on expanding into a thousand shaded alleys. What is  minutes or a week when you are  years old \"Song of the Rolling Earth: A Highland Odyssey by Sir John Lister-Kaye is published by Abacus, priced pound.. Visit aigasPaul Murton, Grand Tours of Scotland presenterA TREE that I have always admired is a rowan that grows from a huge boulder. It is one that everyone will have seen as they are driving north up the A to Fort William.Just as you get to Rannoch Moor and are climbing up above Loch Tulla, there on the left-hand side of the road is a massive boulder left over from the Ice Age.There is a crack in it where, for many years, this amazing little rowan tree has been growing.It has been blasted by the elements and cant be getting many nutrients from the rock, so I dont know how it survives.There is something quite symbolic about it. I have filmed it several times for programmes over the years. It also appears in one of my favourite books, Mountaineering in Scotland by WH Murray.In fact, the first time I saw this rowan tree was in WH Murrays book when I was  or .I hitchhiked from Dunoon to Glencoe to go climbing and I remember seeing it in the flesh and thinking: \"Oh, thats the one in the book\".That was exciting because I felt I was on the trail of real mountaineers. Any mountaineer who had been up to Glencoe going back decades will have seen that wee tree.How did it end up there  Perhaps a crow or a raven carried a berry, dropped it and it then got stuck in a crack where there was enough nutrients for roots to grow. It must be at least  years old.Im a bit of a secret tree hugger. I planted a lot of trees at my mothers place in Argyll years ago and it is nice to admire how much they have grown. There are a couple of chestnut trees, beech trees and Scots pine.Episodes of Grand Tours of Scotlands Lochs are available on BBC iPlayer until November . The series will be repeated on BBC in Greg McHugh, actorI GREW up in Morningside in Edinburgh and at the bottom of the garden were steps down to a wood. There was a mud road with a wall and trees behind it. I loved spending time there.All the kids in my street would go down and play. It was an incredible place. I know people think of Morningside as being posh, but this wasnt a kept space. It was completely wild and overgrown. My mum would always shout as I went out the door: \"Dont go near the giant hogweed!\"It was this little hidden spot in the city. When I was in third year at school, I did a history project on it and learned that this was the old \"poorhouse\" road that had grown over.To think of the families that would have walked up and down there, the trees have been witness to all of that.We would gather conkers, climb and make rope swings among the trees and put old doors down over the stream. On fireworks night there would be a big bonfire and all the families in the street went along.One of my brothers mates stood on a wasps nest and was incredibly badly stung. Afterwards it gave spending time among the trees a new element of risk. The thing that sticks in my mind is that, while during the day it was our playground, we would never dare go down there at night.The inaugural Scottish Tree Festival organised by Discover Scottish Gardens features more than  tree-themed events and runs until December .

To find a location, he followed instructions said to have come to him in a dream and loaded panniers of gold on the back of a donkey.William followed the animal as it roamed across his lands. When night fell, it rested under a tree on a higher and rockier site close to the steep-sided Allt Dearg.The castle was built on that spot with the unique quirk that it was constructed around the tree. This subsequently became a feature of part of the cellar, known since as ldquoThe Hawthorn Room.Legend has it that the tree has magical qualities which have on more than one occasion saved the castle from disaster.Modern scientic analysis has revealed that the tree died in approximately , most likely as a result of being deprived of light because the castle had been built around it.

As the old sheaves of the copper-red bark die, they peel themselves off revealing the young, smooth bark beneath.The changeable colours of the treersquos leaves are equally dazzling. Starting out as orange in the spring, they become a pinkish-brown and then yellow, before finally turning deep green.By late autumn, the leaves have taken on a deep red hue, complementing its peeling, coppery bark.

This is to defend the jobs and conditions of the staff we represent in the STUC and to ensure the organisations future ability to campaign effectively on behalf of all its affiliate members. We will continue to address those concerns through the internal processes of the STUC.\"As the umbrella body for nearly  affiliated trade unions, the STUC represents around , workers and acts as the voice of organised labour north of the border.However, critics have questioned the STUCrsquos independence under Mr Smithrsquos leadership after it emerged the body received over % of its funding from the SNP Government last year.Mr Smith, who became general secretary in , has also faced sniping from within the trade union world over the way he has topped up an STUC remuneration package thought to be close to pound,.As a board member of jobs quango Scottish Enterprise between  and , Mr Smith is believed to have received up to pound, in fees.He currently has three additional posts which attract payment.

The General Council is currently reviewing our processes and procedures. We are considering how these can be improved to ensure that the considerable influence the trade union movement has on such bodies and on public policy can be further enhanced.ldquoIn serving on public bodies, the General Secretary is following the same practice as his predecessors. I believe that in doing so, the General Secretary is always focused on advancing the interests of unions and working people. Grahame has served as General Secretary for  years and is widely respected throughout the trade union movement and wider civil society.

Professor Norman Drummond, the former army chaplain who chaired the Scottish First World War commemorations , made it clear in his address that the service, attended by over , people including Princess Anne and the First Minister, was not just about then, but now as well. The memory of the Great War, he said, was a tool for the living and a warning not to let politics get out of hand. No one referred to anything ndash or anyone ndash specic, but the congregation will have had their own ideas about what he could mean.The service had started in the light at pm and ended in the dark an hour later in a day full of symbols. At am, pipers played laments all over the country, at .am cathedral bells began to ring out and at am, thousands of Scots made the traditional gesture of silence, which this year was given added poignancy because it marked what came to be called the Great Silence: the days and weeks after the guns stopped on November , .The service at Glasgow Cathedral was the focal point of the day and, in words and music, concentrated on four themes: first, sadness at the loss of lealso, the sense of victory against the odds and the seeds of social change ndash the congregation was reminded that the Glasgow rent strikes happened just a short walk from the cathedral.The fourth theme was one that perhaps some might feel less certain about in uncertain times: courage for the future. In his prayer, Professor Drummond quoted the Canadian medical officer Lieutenant Colonel John McCrae: ldquoTo you from failing hands we throw the torch be yours to hold it high. That torch of hope and love, said Professor Drummond, continues to be thrown to each and every one of us, in our homes and in our families, in our communities and across the nation. But the torch is not as bright in some places as others, the places where war is still happening,  years later.One of the next generation taking the torch symbolically at the cathedral was ten-year-old Cara Lucas from Peebles who read the prayer of St Francis of Assisi. ldquoLord make me an instrument of your peace she said, but the words were especially poignant because Cararsquos family knows peace is far from being sorted yet: Cararsquos father Alexander James Lucas was a Royal Marine Commando when he was killed in action in Afghanistan on November , . He was  years old.Cararsquos reading was among the many words of peace and hope in the service, but there were also reminders of the greatest tragedies. Such as the fact the signing of the armistice did not immediately mean the end of the killing. It was signed very early in the morning but a few hours later, at .am, trooper George Ellison of the th Royal Lancers died near Mons. He is the last known British soldier to be killed. Scottish battalions also continued to be involved in operations until  and in southern Russian until .The music at the service reflected the desire, or duty, to remember these stories ndash at one point the Glasgow Cathedral Choir, their voices beautully filling the nave, repeated one refrain ldquowe will remember them. And the service reflected how valuable music was to the men in the trenches by including Pack Up Your Troubles in Your Old Kit Bag. The bit in the song about lighting your fag may not have quite the resonance it once had, but it was one of the most moving moments of the service when the congregation sang the song in  just as men would have done in the trenches in .The music also focused on particular stories ndash like John Lauder, the son of the great Scottish entertainer Sir Harry Lauder. Soloist Amy Hawthorn and the congregation sang perhaps Lauderrsquos most famous song Keep Right on the End of the Road. The words are still inspiring, especially when sung by a thousand people: ldquo yoursquore tired and weary still, journey on til you come to your happy abode. But the congregation was reminded why Sir Harry wrote it: his son was killed in action in December . Sir Harry decided the show had to go on and ed to the stage just a few days later.The congregation at Glasgow also included the descendants of some of those who died in the war, including the family of four Glasgow brothers, including William Herbert Anderson who was awarded the Victoria Cross. Lieutenant Colonel William Herbert Anderson, known as Bertie, was commanding the th Battalion, The Highland Light Infantry, as it moved through France in March . He was awarded the VC for leading his command in a double-counter attack, successfully driving the enemy away despite being overwhelmingly outnumbered. However, his bravery cost him his le and he died behind enemy lines on  March  at the age of .Bertie was the last of four brothers to perish in the war ndash Charlie had died on  December  at the age of , followed by Ronnie on  October  at the age of . Both had also served in the Highland Light Infantry. A week before Bertiersquos death, his youngest brother Teddie, who had transferred to the Royal Flying Corps, went down in a plane over Winchester on  March  aged just .Bertiersquos great-grandson, Robin Scott-Elliot, who attended the commemoration with his we Karen and their daughters Iona and Torrin, said he had always found it hard to imagine what his ancestors suffered.ldquoItrsquos unthinkable what the parents of Bertie, Charlie, Ronnie and Teddie must have gone through, losing all four sons in less than four years, he said. ldquoWhen I think about when they died in relation to my age now, Irsquom struck by how truly short their lives were.ldquoThe impact of their deaths was felt in the family for years ndash their parents never recovered, and my grandfather, who was a toddler at the time of Bertiersquos death, had to go through le without a father - an experience which was shared by many after the war.ldquoI am very proud of the brave actions of my great-grandfather and great-uncles. Itrsquos so important to pass these stories on to the next generation so that the devastation caused by the war is never forgotten.Iona Scott-Elliot, aged , great-great granddaughter of Bertie, added: ldquoI think we should always try to remember my great-great grandad and all the other men and women like him even though they died a long time ago.It would be hard to put it better than Iona did, but the Glasgow service did succeed in pointing out that the centenary commemorations have to be about more than remembering.The service reminded the congregation, and the audience watching on BBC, that amongst the troops at the front line there was relief at having survived but there was also anger and resentment too about what they had been put through.Some good came from that anger and restlessness ndash the vote was extended to all men over and to women over . But the service reminded us too that the lessons of the Great War were not immediately learned ndash there was a determination to be as hard as possible on the Germans in the peace negotiations after the war - and so - as we know - the seeds of the Second World War were sewn.This concern about how we learn the lessons of war and peace was reflected in one of the most powerful readings by Gurjit Singh Lali, a member of the Scottish commemorations . He quoted Gandhi: ldquoI am a man of peace, I believe in peace but I do not want peace at any price. I do not want the peace that you find in the grave. There were also words from King George V speaking in Flanders in . ldquoCan there be more potent advocates of peace upon the earth, he asked, ldquo than this massed multitude of silent witness to the desolation of war Norman Drummond explored similar themes in his address. Four years ago, when the commemorations began and a service was held in Glasgow Cathedral in , Professor Drummond asked an important question: what have we learned from all this  There were some who were critical of the idea of four years of remembrance and still are. Others asked whether it was right for then PM David Cameron to spend poundmillion on the commemorations. Part of the justication was that we should learn from the past and teach future generations, but four years on, Professor Drummond, and everyone , is still trying to find an answer to his question: what have we learned from all this In his address to the congregation, Professor Drummond said personal connections to war were important and had become more important over the last four years ndash cupboards were opened, boxes found, and letters from a century ago read and re-read. But Professor Drummond said he had learned that certain values are timeless ndash loyalty, devotion, courage, resilience. The lesson was to be there for each other ndash to be the stretcher bearer, in war and peace, for those in any kind of need.The final words of the service and the final powerful symbol went to the Right Revd Susan Brown, the moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland. Mrs Brown admits herself that she is not a big woman, but her voice was big in a cathedral that was bigger. Remember the poppy, she said. The black at its centre is the blackness of war. The red of its leaves is the red of blood. But most important of all is the green of its stem, she said, because that is the green shoot of hope.And the last bit of music in a service of music  That went to Andy Cant, who started the service with his violin high up in the roof of the cathedral. For the closing moments, he switched to the pipes and ended Scotlandrsquos act of remembrance with a wordless gesture that was perhaps its most moving. A lone piper sounding out clearly, powerfully and hopefully.The service at the cathedral was the centrepiece of a poignant day of remembrance that started before the sun came up. The first act of commemoration was at am when pipers across the country, standing in the dark, played Battlersquos Orsquoer, the traditional lament that is often heard at the end of war.Many of the pipers played at their local war memorial, but the lament was also heard at the Forth Bridge, and Cpl McClintock of Sqn ATC had the honour of piping Battles Orsquoer at the tomb of the Unknown Warrior in Westminster Abbey. The lament was also heard at Ibrox Stadium.Just a few hours later, at .am, the bells of Dunblane Cathedral were rung to mark the moment  years ago when the bells were rung at the end of the war. Across the day, church bells were also rung in Edinburgh, Aberdeen, Glasgow, Inverness and Stirling ndash some by new bell-ringers recruited over the last year to commemorate the , British bellringers who died between  and .There were other, new ways to remember too, starting at Ayr beach in the morning. Slowly, as a group of volunteers worked away on the sand yesterday, a face emerged, only to be washed away later by the tide. The face on Ayr beach was of Walter Tull, the first black officer in the British Army and one of British footballrsquos first black players. Tull had signed for Rangers when he was  but was killed while engaged in combat near Arras in Northern France. Yesterday, the sea slowly erased the sand-painting of his face as a reminder of his sad loss.Similar events were staged at other beaches across the UK, including West Sands at St Andrews, where they commemorated Elsie Inglis, a pioneering surgeon and suffragist. Other beaches taking part in the project in Scotland were Scapa beach, Orkney, St Ninianrsquos beach, Shetland, Roseisle beach, Moray, and Culla Bay on Benbecula.The beach events were the idea of the filmmaker Danny Boyle, who said they seemed the perfect place to reflect some of the consequences of the Great War. ldquoBeaches are truly public spaces, where nobody rules other than the tide, he said. ldquoThey seem the perfect place to gather and say a final goodbye and thank you to those whose lives were taken or forever changed by the First World War.The beach remembrance events happened throughout the day but it was at am that most of the country took part. The Armistice was signed in  in Compiegne and came into force on the th hour of the th day of the th month and at the same time  years later politicians, civic leaders, veterans and relatives gathered to mark the centenary at the symbolic centres of remembrance across the country.At the Cenotaph in London, the Prince of Wales led the Royal Familyrsquos tributes as the Queen looked on from a balcony. Charles laid a wreath on behalf of his mother for the second year in a row, while an equerry laid a wreath on behalf of the Duke of Edinburgh.In a signicant and hopeful break with history, the President of Germany, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, was also present and laid a wreath on behalf of the German people. It is the first time since the Cenotaph was inaugurated in  that a representative of the country has taken part in the UKrsquos national service of remembrance.At am precisely, the traditional two minutes of silence was held, but there was also a signicant and welcome sound: the chimes of Big Ben. The clock is being renovated and has been silent since August  when works began, but it has been fitted with a custom-built electronic mechanism built to power the striking hammer to ensure it can still sound for important national events.In Scotland, the am silence was observed at the Cenotaph in Glasgowrsquos George Square, while in Edinburgh First Minister Nicola Sturgeon laid a wreath at the Stone of Remembrance outside the City Chambers.Following the service, the city then thanked those who served with a procession from St Gilesrsquo Cathedral to the steps of the Scottish National War Memorial at Edinburgh Castle. The memorial houses and displays the rolls of honour of Scots servicemen and women from all the armed services, the Dominions, Merchant Navy, Womenrsquos Services, Nursing Services and civilian casualties of all wars.By the time darkness fell after pm, the remembrance took on a new shape at the Scottish Parliament when the names of the , men and women from the rolls of honour were projected on to the building. Along with Scottish servicemen, the names included nurses, munitions factory workers, Merchant Navy personnel, and overseas servicemen.The scale of the loss was reflected by the fact it took seven hours to show all the names, finishing around midnight. Each name shone on the building for around  seconds to the sound of Sir John Blackwood McEwenrsquos String Quartets Volume  by the Chilingrian Quartet. There were also images and designs that tell the story of the global war.The presiding officer Ken Macintosh said it was a striking tribute. ldquoThe fact it will take seven hours to project the names of all those who died reflects the sheer scale of the loss and devastation the warhad on communities right across Scotland, he said.The parliamentrsquos tribute was not the only light of hope and peace that shone into the dark evening. Shortly before pm, Shetlander Geoffrey Priest made his way to Saxa Vord, in the north of Unst, where he lit a beacon that was the centrepiece of the islandrsquos commemoration of the centenary. It is no surprise that Shetland would want to mark the sombre occasion, as  Shetland men lost their lives in the First World War ndash a higher proportion than anywhere  in Britain.Finally, the day and night of commemoration came to an end at .pm when an audience of around  filled the Usher Hall in Edinburgh for a performance of the multimedia production Far, Far from Ypres, which brings the story of prototypical Scots soldier Jimmy McDonald to le through songs, poems and real stories.The show featured large screen projection of images from the war and a cast of folk singers who remained on stage throughout the performance, singing the lsquotrenchrsquo, lsquomarchingrsquo and Music Hall songs of the time.Jimmyrsquos story brought the day of remembrance to an end and there was then a chance for Professor Norman Drummond to reflect on what has been learned over the last four years.Professor Drummond told The Herald that he wanted the last four years of commemoration to reflect a theme of reconciliation but also education.ldquoWhen I was invited by the Scottish Government to chair and set up the Scottish Commemorations Panel, I accepted on three conditions ndash that it would concentrate on education, genealogy and legacy and we asked: what do we learn from all this  he said. \"I think the Scottish commemorations have been pivotal in reminding us that this is not just remembrance ndash important though that is ndash but itrsquos about what we take forward to the future.ldquoWe live in ided times and I think the First World War gives us evidence of what happens when we let politics get out of hand.Professor Drummond and his family have also felt the last four years personally. His grandfather Norman Walker, who served on the Western Front, where he was badly gassed, was awarded the MC in . Later, he was an international cricketer and played for Scotland ndash all on one lung.ldquoI was about seven or eight when he died, said Professor Drummond, ldquobut I can identy with those who wish they could talk to those who are no longer with us, to ask them: what was it really like Professor Drummondrsquos we Elizabeth also has personal connections to the conflict through her grandfather John Burn, of the Tyneside Scottish, serving with the Northumberland Fusiliers. He was killed on the th September  and, earlier this year, Professor Drummond and his we went out to Johnrsquos grave in France.ldquoThere we were, he said, ldquo years on, around one grave almost to the hour of when he would have been killed.Professor Drummond said he wanted the day to reflect four themes ndash the first being a collective sadness at the loss of le. Historians still argue about the precise number of Scots who lost their lives but we can safely say that over , died.And it was particularly poignant on the centenary of the end of the war to note that many soldiers died on the last day itself, including  Scots.The second theme was victory and Professor Drummond acknowledged that it was not just about joy but profound mixed emotions.He also hopes that the commemorations over the last four years have struck the right tone. He said: ldquoWersquove always tried to have the appropriate tone and the advice wersquove received is that, yes, the victory was important at that time ndash therefore, we commemorate it from a long lens. But there was joy and relief that it was all over and that we had withstood overwhelming odds and were really proud of the way our men and women responded.The third theme was seeds of change ndash an effort to reflect the fact that the First World War led, in the short and longer term, to economic, social, cultural and political changes."},{"url":null,"title":"wind-turbines-generating-98-of-scotlands-electricity-demand","story":"WWF Scotland said that National Grid demand for the month was ,, MWh and that almost all of this could have been provided by wind turbines, which provided record levels of power.Turbines generated the equivalent of % of all Scotlands electricity demand or enough to power nearly five million homes last month, the group said.Read more:End oil and gas and hit the worst emitters hard ndash how Scotland could fight climate changeThe best day was October  when turbines generated ,.

First based in an old wood-chopping factory in the grounds of Whitefoord House in Edinburgh, it moved in  to an old printing works in the city’s Warriston Road.And after this year’s very special Armistice centenary year, the factory will be on the move again – albeit on a temporary basis.A team of around  ex-servicemen and women who hand-assemble more than five million poppies and , wreaths every year for the Scottish Poppy Appeal will be moving to Redford Barracks for two years to allow for a much-needed refurbishment of the factory.The aim is not to rip out the heart of what is a very special workplace – boasting regimental flags and thank you letters and posters from the thousands of school children who have visited.But some £. million from the Libor Fund – fines imposed on banks for manipulation of Libor levels – will ensure the factory is fit for the st Century.Overseeing the move immediately after this year’s Remembrance Day will be factory manager Charlie Pelling, who has been at the helm since .During a tour of the factory, Charlie explained more about the move.He said: “We’ll be moving on November  with the aim of being operational by the start of January.“The aim is to be back at our factory in time for the  or  appeal.“We have a small window of opportunity to make the move as the factory operates year round.data-src\"https:res. jpress image fetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.buteman webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Special year...for PoppyScotland with Gordon Michie, its head of fundraising, hoping to raise an additional #, from the  Poppy Pledge campaign. \"  \"  Armistice : PoppyScotland’s  Poppy Pledge campaign viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BUTE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BUTE | Article Teaser\"“We are like a toy shop in that we work  months of the year with sales throughout that period but our sales climax in the run-up to Remembrance Day in the way a toy shop does at Christmas.“We’ve got to strip out asbestos from the factory, update the heating and wiring, modernise the windows and install a lt to the first floor.“We have to make the factory health and safety compliant and fit for purpose for the st Century.”Charlie is also hopeful that they will be able to create a learning facility.He said: “Thousands of visitors tour the factory every year – from pensioners to pre-schoolers.“Around  school children visit the factory each year, with the same number of adults too.“We want to create an educational facility where they learn about the factory before touring the site.”The workers who power the factory will, however, remain at its beating heart and will be involved in the refurbishment and move.“We have records for more than  servicemen and women who have worked here,” said Charlie. “Since , we’ve had in excess of  workers.“The factory exists to provide employment for ex service personnel who may otherwise struggle to find employment.“They work year round to ensure that enough poppies are created for the Poppy Appeal and for the many wreaths laid at ceremonies across the country.“The move to Redford Barracks will undoubtedly be challenging.“But we’ve got a plan and some very good people here so we’re confident we’ll do it and still be able to create all the poppies for .“The fact we don’t have a modern production line is something we cherish.

guide...David Adamsonwas on hand to show us around as we toured the Lady Haig Poppy Factory in Edinburgh, prior to its temporary move to Redford Barracks on November  this year to allow the premises to be refurbished. And it’s perhaps for this reason when you walk through the Lady Haig Poppy Factory doors in Edinburgh, there’s a sense of leaving your worldly woes behind.There’s also no sense that the  or so former service personnel are standing on ceremony for visitors – the good-natured banter continues as they go about their business.It’s a camaraderie sadly now missing from many workplaces where the bottom line means more than the product.But here the focus is firmly on production with pride in every poppy that leaves the factory floor. feels at home at the factory, where he has worked part time since Decemver .

He hopes, in future, toto college to become a counsellor and help other veterans who find themselves in his position. Previously housing a printing press, it somehow feels like home – not least because we are warmly welcomed like old friends.It’s a special year for the veterans, marking  years since the end of World War One and the creation of a unique anniversary poppy.But the pressure is largely off when we visit as the majority of the five million or so poppies created for this year’s appeal have already been despatched.Work continues apace, though, as staff finish off wreath orders which will be laid at ceremonies theand breadth of the country.The team are, however, more than happy to give us a tour and tell us about their own experiences.David Adamson is our very informative tour guide.The -year-old, who was in the army for  years and thereafter the police for , has worked at the factory for the last seven years.data-src\"https:res. jpress image fetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.deesidepiper webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"At the helm...Charlie Pelling, manager of Lady Haigs Poppy Factory in Edinburgh, is preparing for a temporary move to Redford Barracks, which will start on November . \"  \"  Armistice : Lady Haig Poppy Factory is on the move viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"DEES | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"DEES | Article Teaser\"He said: “I finished with the police on the Saturday and started working here on the Monday and have been here ever since.“I’m now one of the official tour guides and I thoroughly enjoy it.“It’s been fascinating for me finding out about the history of the poppy and what it means to people.“Most of the stuff up on the walls has been presented to us by visitors and military organisations.“Around  school kids also visit every year and they love every minute of it.“It can be like herding cats at times but they always ask really interesting questions and we’re often surprised by the knowledge they have.“We show them how to make the poppies and tell them that our numbers are on the back of each box sold.“Soyou ever see school children looking at the back of the box, they’re looking for our numbers – mine is .”On a whistletop tour, we discover how the poppies are printed and cut out on  year old printing presses – left in the building when the Lady Haig Poppy Factory relocated from the grounds of Whitefoord House in  to the city’s Warriston Road.Lapel poppies may no longer be cut by hand but each one is still handcrafted.The paper from which the poppies is made arrives into the factory in large rolls.These are passed through the cutting and pressing machine and the poppy petals cut to size.Then the team add the distinctive ribbing which makes the Scottish poppy unique, before they start assembling them.Around one million stick on poppies and four million green stem poppies are produced each year.And visitors are always given a chance to make their own which school children, in particular, love, as testied by the many letters and posters on the walls.David, who has three children and seven grandchildren, added: “The bairns lap this place up.“They love making the poppies then they go back to school, do a project and send in posters or letters for our walls. We’ve not got a lot of space but we try to display as many as we can.“Instilling a sense of pride in the poppy in future generations is one of the things I love most about working here.”David and his colleagues also display personal mementoes, some of which serve to remind them of just how much their work means.Thomas McPhillipswas a Royal Corps of Signals radio operator in the s.His grandfather, William Anthony, a Lance Corporal with the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, died at Passchendaele on July , .And a picture of his cousin’s son, Gary O’Donnell from South Queensferry, now also takes pride of place on his desk.He explained: “Gary was killed trying to defuse a Taliban bomb in Afghanistan in September  he was only .“In  he was awarded the George Medal for bravery demonstrated in Iraq. “He was awarded another George Medal postumously in March . He is one of the few soldiers to receive two.“I keep Gary’s picture on my desk, just in case my head ever goes down a bit.“That rarely happens here, though. It’s a lovely place to work. “I’ve been here for  years and it’s just like being back in the barracks. I love it.”One of the youngest recruits, Danny Renowden joined the army when he was just  years old.He served for seven years, including a tour in Afghanistan in  which later resulted in his medical discharge in January  due to post traumatic stress disorder .The -year-old initially applied for a job with PoppyScotland which put him in touch with the Poppy Factory.He said: “I emailed in my CV and, within a matter of minutes, Charlie Pelling, the factory manager, replied asking me to come in.“He offered me a job right away. I’ve been here, part-time, since December .”It’s the perfect fit for Danny who, for health reasons, wanted to ease back into employment.He said: “It’s giving me the routine that I really needed but in a workplace that feels like second nature.“Everyone has been in the military so that camaraderie is already there.“They are a great bunch eventhey do like winding me up because I’m originally from Cornwall!”The factory’s flexibility is ideal for dad-of-one Danny who hopes, in future, to help veterans who find themselves in his position.He added: “I’d like to go into counselling veterans but I need to go back to college.“I joined up when I was  and only have my high school education. So I’m looking into doing part-time or night classes, while working here.“For me, the factory has given me back some of the confidence I needed to consider a new career.

Money raised during the Scottish Poppy Appeal is used to provide vital, le-changing support to the Armed Forces community living in Scotland.And overseeing the campaign is Gordon Michie, head of fundraising at PoppyScotland whose Edinburgh headquarters at New Haig House neighbour the Poppy Factory.He is hoping this year’s special Armistice centenary poppies and a  Poppy Pledge will bring in even more money this year.He said: “More than  organisations have signed up to the pledge to raise £ in this special anniversary year.“It’s our most ambitious fundraising campaign to date and we hope it will bring in an additional £, for the Poppy Appeal.”Gordon, a Fer who served in the RAF from  to , first volunteered with PoppyScotland ten years ago.He was appointed two and a half years ago and feels like he is back in service again.“I was only  when I came out of the RAF so I never viewed myself as a veteran,” he said. “When I started volunteering, I began wearing my veterans badge.“Now I make sure I wear it with pride daily.”While Gordon is now employed by PoppyScotland, it’s clear that the role is more than a job to him.data-src\"https:res. jpress image fetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.midlothianadvertiser webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"The Dalkeith pavilion which was set on fire.

Not all schools can come to Edinburgh so we want to take the factory to them from April .”To find out more about the work PoppyScotland does, visit the website at www.poppyscotland.org.uk."},{"url":null,"title":"council to consider setting wheels in motion for kintore blackburn link","story":"A new #, pedestrian and cycle route linking Kintore and Blackburn is expected to be approved by councillors.Aberdeenshire Council has been providing new facilities along the A corridor for cyclists on a phased basis.Phase one began in  with a shared use path linking Kintore to the town’s business park, while phase two works have recently been completed linking Kintore with Inverurie.That route is already proving a hit with pedestrians, with an average of  daily users recorded during October.Now the local authority is seeking a decision on a favoured option for phase three works to provide a shared use path between Kintore and Blackburn.In a paper to the Garioch Area Committee which meets tomorrow , infrastructure services director Stephen Archer says the route would essentially provide a facility for cyclists wishing to commute onwards to Aberdeen.Discussions are currently ongoing with Aberdeen City Council with a view to the creation of a connection from the city to Blackburn.Mr Archer will report: “The proposal to develop the phase three works was included on the Procurement Work Plan which was approved at the Infrastructure Services Committee of March , .“A successful grant application was subsequently made to the Sustrans Community Links Programme and a % funding commitment has been made by Sustrans for the project.”A feasibility study was undertaken to identy four potential routes, with option two running adjacent to and north of the A and south via the A underpass being favoured by officers.Mr Archer continues: “While the report does not make a definitive recommendation on which route to take forward, on the basis of cost, implementation and socio-economic impact, option two is regarded as being the overall best value option.“It is therefore requested that option two is now taken forward for detailed design to create a design and tender package before the end of the current financial year that would allow the council to approach funding partners for construction funding for future years.”He will also indicate that while the third option of using the old turnpike road would perhaps not fulfil the requirements for a commuting route, it could have some value as a recreational resource to the council.data-src\"https:res. jpress image fetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Naomi is looking for a home.

Jim therefore tried to find historical accuracy as far as possible by researching contemporary documents and manuscripts that held vital evidence.\"There are certain liberties you can take, like for example the drumming used by the armies preparing for battle and that is often for dramatic effect.\"The film is billed as a \"true David versus Goliath story\" of how the great th-century \"outlaw king\" Robert the Bruce used cunning and bravery to defeat the larger and better-equipped occupying English army.At the films debut during the Toronto Film Festival last year there were a few raised eyebrows when American actor Chris Pine, who plays Bruce, appeared full-frontal naked in one scene.Directed by Oscar-nominated film-maker David Mackenzie the epic was shot in ious Scottish locations throughout  and Jim spent six months working on the diegetic soundtrack.Jim said: \"I had a meeting with David Mackenzie just a few weeks before the shoot and none of this particular aspect was planned.

We all love it.\"Gill Arrowsmith and Shirley Sinclair both thought the painting was \"fantastic\" while Annemarie Simpson thought that a similar venture in Wick would help tackle the \"towns eyesore\" buildings.While on that subject, one dissenting voice condemned the piece and said there was a \"masterpiece eyesore now in Wilson Street thanks to Caithness Horizons\".Beauty is, of course, in the eye of the beholder.The mural depicts a portrait of Thursos renowned botanist and geologist Robert Dick surrounded by a kaleidoscopic representation of the CHMAG facade and the scientists specimen collection.The bold use of line and colour based on modern urban graffiti cannot fail to be noticed just like the mural on nearby Tollemache House but is sited in a much less conspicuous space ndash the gallerys car park.CHMAGs curator Merran Gunn, who was instrumental in commissioning Delaye to create the work, said the artist had also spray painted a wall within the building as part of a show running called Graffito.His earlier piece has an explosive anime style figure punching out of the wall toward the viewer.\"Marcs work is bold and vibrant, electric colours jostle for dominance, and the new outside mural is no exception with tangerine skies set behind the historic Thurso of Robert Dick,\" said Gunn.Thursos illustrious scientist had his herbarium collection feature in an earlier work by the artist Joanne Carr which in turn is featured within Delayes mural ndash a clear case of one artist paying homage to another.\"Graffiti and street art is more relevant than ever whether it be in the art world ndash with the recent record sale of Banksys girl with a balloon ndash or here in the Highlands where graffiti has made its way onto the syllabus at Farr High School through art teacher Tracy Wilkinson,\" she said.After garnering great positive feedback from the current show Merran decided to \"have a moment of spontaneity\" and raised funds through a crowdfunding website and the Dounreay Communities Fund to commission Marc Delaye to breath some le into a fairly drab corner of the town.Tracy Dodson, commercial manager of CHMAG, said that the gallery was \"breaking boundaries\" with Graffito.\"It questions what actually constitutes art and what gets shown in a gallery. Graffito is an exhibition that celebrates artwork that is available to everyone.\"Traditionally graffiti has been seen as anti-social, fringe or even as criminal vandalism, but with an emphasis on social inclusion, we are celebrating street, pop, comic and zine work as mainstream art for hanging in our gallery.\"Tracy unabashedly declares that Graffito is \"aimed at young people and the young at heart, as a way of inviting new and future audiences to a museum and gallery experience\".\"This is a multicoloured on-the-wall exhibition devoted to all manner of graphic mark-making and breaking the boundaries of what art is all about,\" she said. \"We have also hosted street painting and comic workshops, guided gallery tours, and collaborating with our local schools and council.\"Marc Delaye is an established community projects artist with Freshpaint.org which is based on the Black Isle.\"Murals are as alive now as ever before and an excellent way to introduce art to internal and external spaces, giving iniduals and communities something that they can be proud of and enjoy each and every day,\" said Marc.The murals can be privately commissioned and can be an \"ideal means of advertising products, services, messages and campaigns\".Other exhibitors at Graffito include Andy Strachan, of Comic Creations Studios Dundee, David Robertson of Fred Egg Comics and Zu Dominak, all of whom work at the University of Dundee within the Masters degrees in Comics and Graphic Novels ndash the only course of its kind in the UK.Other exhibitors include Victor Nobis and his series Fallen Giants ndash a fantasy dream space where cities like Edinburgh rise and twist through the torso of neon lit giant figures.Graffito finishes on Saturday with a day of childrens workshops, guided tours and a colouring competition.Monday  Nov  : PM"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"November ,  at : pmFlagstone repairs have started in Stromness and Kirkwall — leading to sections of the street being closed whilst the work takes place.

Will the Chief Secretary work with the Secretary of State for Business to develop that proposal and work with the Business Department and the developers to see the fruition of what could be a very important part of the Government’s industrial strategy.”Responding to Mr Carmichael, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, the Rt. Hon. Liz Truss MP, said: “As part of the spending review we will be looking at the most efficient way we can achieve our carbon targets, and I am working closely with the Department of Business Energy and Industrial Strategy to do.”Commenting after the exchange, Mr Carmichael added: “The Minister’s response will do little to assure the industry that they are a priority for the Government. There was nothing in the Budget for this industry, and the Government have been working closely across departments for some time now. It is disappointing that little progress appears to be being made.“Wave and tidal power generation and new and innovative forms of producing green energy. The ambition of the industry however has not been matched by the policy framework, which continues to prevent this sector from reaching the point where it becomes commercially viable.“Renewable energy generation, particularly wave and tidal stream power are areas at which the Northern Isles is at the very forefront, and the creation of these Innovative Power Purchase Agreements would make great strides towards helping these innovative industries continue to flourish. The Minister should stop dragging her feet and start delivering for the industry.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

They also campaign to improve their lives and remember the fallen.Mark Bibbey, chief executive of Poppyscotland said: “Members of the Armed Forces are often based far away from home so an initiative like this which offers a signicant discount on travel must be applauded. This will also make Loganair’s extensive network more accessible to those who have served, and to Forces families too.It underlines Loganair’s commitment to supporting the Armed Forces community and is just the latest way in which they have demonstrated this. We thank them for their continue support.”To find out more about the Armed Forces Fare visit www.defencediscountservicecopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

If we continue to turn a blind eye to the risk of developing type  diabetes as a result, we can only expect to see the number of undiagnosed cases escalate.‘Diabetic retinopathy is one of the leading causes of blindness among people of working age in the UK so it’s hugely important that diabetes is detected early and monitored correctly to avoid furthering the risks.‘At Specsavers, we offer digital retinal photography. This takes a detailed picture of the back of your eye and the microcirculation of blood – helping to highlight indicators of diabetes that need addressing.Eye screening is also a key part of your diabetes care and people with diabetes should have routine screenings done every one to two years by an optometrist. Contact your local GP or local diabetic screening service for more information.Sophie Castell, Director of Relationships at RNIB, says: ‘Sadly, all too often, people with diabetes can lose their sight due to complications. Yet with early detection and treatment, sight loss due to diabetic retinopathy can be prevented. Regular eye tests are important for everyone, but especially for people living with diabetes who should also ensure they attend appointments for specialist diabetic eye screening. It’s a few minutes that could save your sight.’ https:www.diabetes.org.uk resources-s - diabetes_in_the_uk_.pdf https:www.diabetes.org.uk about_us news over--of-people-unaware-diabetes-can-lead-to-blindness- State of the Nation’s Eye Health, Specsavers  RNIB  https:www.rnib.org.uk knowledge-and-research-hub-research-reports prevention-sight-loss stateofthenation http:www.rnib.org.uk sites default files RNIB_evidence_based_review_of_working_age_people.pdf vw, px\"  copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

These figures clearly show wind is working, it’s helping reduce our emissions and is the lowest cost form of new power generation.“It’s also popular, with a recent survey also showing more and more people support turbines in rural areas.“That’s why it’s essential that the UK government unlocks market access for onshore wind.”The worst day was  October when generation was ,.MWh, enough to power ,, homes,  per cent of households.On  days generation was over  per cent of households while on  days generation was more than  per cent of demand.The majority of the turbines were onshore, with offshore ones accounting for . per cent of output in October.Alex Wilcox Brooke, weather energy project manager at Severn Wye Energy Agency, said: “October’s figures are a prime example of how reliable and consistent wind production can be, with production on  days outstripping national demand.”The data comes from WeatherEnergy, part of the European EnergizAIR project which is supported by the Intelligent Energy Europe Programme and led by the European Agency for Competitiveness and Innovation.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4826977.1541765540!/image/image.jpg","title":"nile rodgers interview bringing chic to scotland","story":"The music legend talks to Janet Christie about a le dedicated to getting people dancing, working with Bowie and Madonna and theof good times ahead of Chic#s Glasgow gigMusic legend Nile Rodgers has his guitar strapped to his back. He’s about to get on a plane but the worn white Fender Stratocaster with the maple fingerboard, on which he wrote best selling hits with his band Chic and produced some of the biggest-selling albums of all time with David Bowie, Madonna and Diana Ross, won’t be shoved in the hold. The Hitmaker, as he calls it, and which is integral to his funky ‘chucking’ style, won’t be out of his sight. He left it on a train once, luckily got it back, but yes, he did freak out...The Grammy Award-winning musician, composer, arranger, guitarist and co-founder of Chic says, “I have a replica, and a plexiglass one and they sound really great live and on record, real close, but it’s not the same.” Rodgers is about to fly out of Toronto when we speak, heading for London in his trademark dreadlocks and beret to put the funk into the X Factor, replacing the touring Robbie Williams as a judge. He’s also collecting a humanitarian award from the Global Gt charity for his work with his We Are Family Foundation, named for his Sister Sledge anthem. Career-wise he’s flying high too, after releasing the first Chic album for more than two decades this summer featuring Elton John, Emeli Sandé and Lady Gaga, with another album due out in February and about to kick off a -date European and UK tour with the band that’ll make Glasgow Dance, Dance, Dance in December. He’s the newly elected Chairman of the Songwriters Hall of Fame and as the recently-appointed inaugural Chief Creative Advisor for Abbey Road Studios, it’s time to celebrate Good Times. Rodgers is responsible for decades of floorfillers, after starting out as a musician on Sesame Street, playing clubs and bars before co-founding Chic in  with bassist Bernard Edwards. There were Chic disco hits: Dance, Dance, Dance, Everybody Dance, I Want Your Love, Le Freak and Good Times, and hits he produced for others: He’s The Greatest Dancer, We Are Family, , I’m Coming Out, Upside Down, , Like A Virgin, , Let’s Dance . Then there are his collaborations, with Daft Punk on the Random Access Memories album and single Get Lucky, global hits that won him three Grammys, with Avicii, Sigala Disclosure and Sam Smith, plus the genre crossing talent that saw Good Times spark the advent of hip-hop when it was picked up as the base for Sugarhill Gang’s Rapper’s Delight. In all, his work has sold more than  million albums and  million singles, but it’s been  years since Nile Rodgers and Chic released a studio album. Hence the title It’s About Time. “Yes,” he laughs. “For one thing there’s the obvious – it was about time I did this stuff and got it back out.” It would have been earlier, but as Rodgers was working on the album the deaths of his friends and previous collaborators Prince, David Bowie, George Michael and Chris Cornell hit him hard. “What happened was I had got a large tape drop from Warner Brothers of masters that I thought were gone for ever and that made me feel so happy and nostalgic and I was about to release an album. But then people started passing away that I had written tribute songs about, and it made me feel like I’d be capitalising on Bowie and Prince’s passing, and it was just so wrong.”The time is right now, however, and at , Rodgers has been thinking about mortality. He’s beaten prostate cancer once in  and last year had a lump removed from his kidney. Today he declares himself fit and healthy,a little tired from last night’s Toronto gig, but he’s determined to fulfil his mission to get everyone dancing to feelgood music.“I know that our time on this planet is finite,” he says “and you know what, I want to spend the rest of my le making really great dance music. When I was producing Eric Clapton one day he came out of the studio and said to me that he was gonna play blues for the rest of his le. I said ‘Eric, you mean to tell meI come see a Clapton show I’m not gonna hear Sunshine of Your Love  Or any of those Cream and Blind Faith cool songs ’ And he said ‘no, you’re not gonna get that again, because I’m not going to play it again.’ I went home and thought about it for a bit and I said, ‘well, hell,Eric Clapton is gonna play blues for the rest of his le, I’m gonna play dance music for the rest of my le. Right! I just wanna play music for ever.“Not that I think I’m Eric Clapton, but you know,you’ve put in all this time, you have the right to decide what you want to do and I decided that I like to make music that makes people happy, makes people want to dance. It really feels good to me to see people express themselves through motion.”Speaking of dancing, as a legendary exponent of dance music, what does Rodgers consider to be his hottest move  How would he wow one night in a disco on the outskirts of Frisco  Rumba and Tango, Latin Hustle, too, Yowsah, Yowsah… “I have no idea,” he says and laughs. “I don’t consider myself a good dancer any more, because I was actually a serious dancer. I was actually a ballet dancer in another le. Not many people know that, but it’s true. Around the time I was working with Sesame Street when I was  or , and I took it very seriously for a while. Then I just started gigging a lot more and I didn’t have time to practise and ballet you gotta practise just as seriously as you practise music.” As for the upcoming tour, Chic fans can expect to hear the old favourites alongside some of the new album because Rodgers knows his crowd and after playing the festival circuit with Glastonbury and Coachella last year, he’s also conscious a lot of the audience will be hearing them for the first time. “At our shows I ask people to raise their handsthey’re seeing Chic for the first time, and we’re averaging about  per cent first timers. This is amazing to me! Especially since we’ve played the UK so much. I’m like Jesus, everybody has seen us! But no, more than half the crowd will raise their hands and that’s cool.”Rodgers may have four decades in the business but he’s still an innovator and already at Abbey Road has been the first to shoot a video there and has more plans to move and shake the legendary studio.“Abbey Road’s amazing,” he says. “They’re allowing me to do everything there, matter of fact, ha! I might re-invigorate my ballet career, have a dance recital there! It’s just incredible. It’s probably one of the most artistic, creative environments I’ve ever been in. I’m making films, doing concerts, even Paul McCartney wound up having a concert there after I came.”Born in New York in  Rodgers didn’t have the easiest start in le. His mother was  when she got pregnant with him and his biological father, Nile Rodgers Senior, a travelling percussionist, moved on. With his mother and step-father both being heroin addicts, Rodgers learned young to be self-reliant. The last time I interviewed him he spoke about how once as a five-year-old he got wedged down the back of the sofa when his parents were out of it and he had to wait for his grandmother to come round to the house and retrieve him. If he could, what would he say to that little boy stuck amid soft furnishings, waiting for someone to realise he was missing  “I’d say, buckle up, it’s going to be a hell of a ride!” He laughs. After learning to play the guitar at  Rodgers figured he could pay rent and landed his first professional job in the Sesame Street band at . But despite their struggles, he’s very close to his family, especially his mother, and is grateful for the legacy of music bequeathed him by his parents. It’s in his bones and has been all his le.“I have music in me, around me, it just swirls in my head all the time. I can’t turn it off as a matter of fact. Oh yeah, I always hear music, all day long. I heard it as a child, and I hear it now,” he says. In was almost inevitable he would make his name in music, from the beginning playing and practising every day. “I wish I could do that now,” he says, “I would give my left arm to be able to do that. Oh, no… you know what I mean.” He laughs. “I just think practising makes me play better, and he quotes the violinist Jascha Heetz, who once said ‘ I don’t practise one day, I know it two days, the critics know it three days, the public knows it.’ His insecure formative years necessitated a work ethic that spurred Rodgers on and brought financial rewards such as the house by the shore in Westport, Connecticut, with the boat moored at the jetty, where he lives today. Apparently alone, but then Rodgers never talks about his relationships. “Yeah, I’m pretty discreet,” he says. And just out of nosiness, because he’s ulged this to me before, and he is the child of a pair of beatnik hippies, does he still like to hang out there naked when he doesn’t have guests  He laughs. “Yeah, of course, why would I change  Old dog new tricks  No.” With his colourful le story, Nile Rodgers The Musical, should be worth the wait, but his much anticipated autobiographical show is still being written and may be another couple of years in the pipeline. Right now he’s got his hands full with the musical he wrote with Jean-Paul Gaultier, entitled Fashion Freak Show, currently wowing the Folies Bergeres in Paris, as well as another musical bound for Las Vegas and provisionally London’s West End. “The Paris show is doing great and the other one is loosely based on disco lestyle stuff and it’s being done by [Steven Hoggett] the choreographer from the Harry Potter show that’s in the West End now.”As to who would play Rodgers in the musical of his le, he’s at a complete loss, sounding surprised at the question.“Oh, I don’t know… I wouldn’t even… I don’t even know,” he says. “That person would have to be a hell of a lot more talented than myself, because they’d have to do a lot of things at an early age that I couldn’t do when I was that age!” He laughs.Compose, perform, produce, act, oh and they’d have to add ballet to the long list of talents now too, know their ballottéfrom their boogie. “Yes, they would.” He laughs. And no, he wouldn’t consider playing himself.Today Rodgers’ mother Beverly has Alzheimer’s, but the two find common love in music and when he visited her last week, as usual they revisited their playlist for le.“She loves everything. My mom is a be-bop junkie... and loves everything from Charlie Mingus to Nina Simone to Miles to The Beatles. The other day we were singing Hey Jude and she knows every single word, even sings the ad libs…” He lts his voice and does his mother doing McCartney’s scat, “Ju-Judy Judy Judy Judy Judy.“She’s amazing.”Rodgers’ own playlist of signicant songs would contain primarily jazz and some of his own tracks, not out of narcissism, but because he rarely gets to hear them. “I only hear my music when I’m playing it and there’s a huge dference between the recorded and performance versions. In performance there’s a lot of improvisation whereas recorded is exactly the same every time. Sometime when I hear the recorded version I go ‘oh my god, I forgot I wrote that part too’. The other day I heard Let’s Dance and forgot how intricate the horn voicings were. I listened to the whole album and thought wow, this is cool.“Let’s Dance was part of Rodgers’ reinvention as a producer, the album that turned his career around after punk kicked in and left disco apparently for dead. Boogie was busted as punk gobbed in its face and Chic, with their soul, RB, funk, glitter and groove were out in the cold. “Durin’ the disco sucks era,” he says, “we couldn’t get anything, no buzz, no one would listen to us. We were just persona non grata. It’s not that the music was bad, it was just we were not flavour of the month. People didn’t like us.”The collaboration with Bowie was to reinvigorate his career and satisfy his love for discovering new sounds. “Up until David’s record I had six failures in a row. I was known for producing disco. But after David I probably had six successes in a row: David Bowie, INXS, Duran Duran, Madonna, then Duran Duran again, then Mick Jagger and David Bowie with Dancing in the Street... yeah I had a clutch.“And collaborating is fun! Not only have you got your own energy to vibe off, but you have other people’s. I love being in Chic but for the last  years I’ve been mainly in the room with brand new people, in other people’s bands.” Looking back over his career Rodgers is hard pushed to nominate an event or song of which he is most proud. “I’m not more proud of Let’s Dance than We Are Family, Get Lucky, I Want Your Love, Dance, Dance, Dance, Everybody Dance or Rapper’s Delight.”As he lists the titles, it prompts a muscle memory, the beginnings of a hustle in the hips, a shimmy in the shoulders, so perhaps it’s the longevity of his sound that’s most impressive. Rodgers, however, can’t explain his success. “If I knew the answer to that question, don’t you think every record I’ve put out would be a hit ” he says. “Most of my records are not hits. Most of my records are flops. Only a handful are hits. Well, actually, a big handful....”A very big handful...“Well, yeah, anyway...” he trails off, modest and mellow.Holding his Hitmaker, it’s time for Rodgers to board his flight, with a final word about how much he’s looking forward to the tour. “You know, I really love composing, I love making records, and when we know from the charts that people are listening, there is a joy that we get. “But when you can actually see people having a good time, that feels pretty damn good. There’s nothing like that. It’s wonderful. So... see you in Glasgow for Good Times.” @JanetChristieNile Rodgers  Chic kick off their UK arena tour at The SSE Hydro Glasgow on  December.

This column has not shirked from apportioning blame for the appalling negotiations on the UK’s poor strategy, tactics and communications. Nevertheless, the EU had an ally in Theresa May, a Remainer who, together with the British civil service and most especially HM Treasury, could be relied upon to see Brussels’ point of view on most issues. She foolishly adopted the EU’s timescale andagenda she has conceded ECJ jurisdiction in many areas when she said there would be none using Orwellian newspeak she has rebranded the Single Market as adopting “a common rule book for goods and agri-foods” and called the Customs Union a “UK-wide backstop” so we might stay in both without an exit.Yet in December the EU humbled her over the withdrawal agreement by imposing a wholly unnecessary Irish backstop that she should have resisted, and having learned from that humiliating capitulation they now seek further concessions. Media reports suggest Brussels has torpedoed the latest iation of her Chequers-Minus Plan and are insisting that EU boats must continue to have access to the British fisheries after we have left the Common Fisheries Policy.Whatever plan May is able to have accepted by the EU is only likely to get through parliament with the support of the Labour Party, but Corbyn and McDonnell would far rather reject it in the belief defeat would force her to go to the country and they might achieve a change in government.Indeed, there are strong rumours circulating that the Conservative Party is being readied for a general election to offer the nation the PM’s “deal” or face a Corbyn government. I believe this is an empty threat designed to instil discipline in the ranks – for Tory MPs would have to approve a general election and these turkeys are not likely to vote for Christmas. More likely would be a leadership challenge and change of Prime Minister.The mood in the House of Commons is febrile. The resignation of the Transport Minister, Jo Johnson, the Remain-supporting younger brother of Boris Johnson, only served to confirm how Theresa May has failed to satisfy any of the competing groups within the Conservative Party. What then can be done, what alternatives are there • : Theresa May warned of Commons Brexit defeat as eurosceptic Tories and DUP forge allianceThe MP Nick Boles is pushing the idea that the UK should take up Norway’s arrangement by confirming membership of the European Economic Area so the UK is temporarily in the EU Single Market but outside the Common Fisheries Policy and the Common Agriculture Policy. We would then use that position to negotiate a free trade deal with the EU and then leave the EEA. This arrangement without a time limit would come at a price, however there would be an annual transfer of funds to the EU running into billions, we would have next to no say in the rules our businesses would have to adopt, the European Court of Justice would still have signicant jurisdiction over the UK and, troubling to many people, we would have to accept freedom of movement. It is an arrangement not without criticism in Norway – especially from left-of-centre, for it was designed as a means to take Norway fully into the EU, not for nations seeking to leave. More importantly, the Norwegian prime minister has been as diplomatically polite as possible in pointing out that having a country join the EEA that only wishes to leave is not especially attractive. In truth we’re not wanted.There is of course the proposal for having a second referendum, given support by Jo Johnson when he resigned and backed by Nick Clegg, Paddy Ashdown, John Major, Alastair Campbell and other notables including Nicola Sturgeon. What they all have in common is having advocated remaining in the EU and sworn, indeed warned, there would be only one vote, no matter which way we voted – they have gone back on their word. In the  general election the Liberal Democrats advocated an In-Out EU referendum but dropped the idea when they went into coalition by  they opposed a referendum, and when it happened they insisted it would be respected. Having lost it they want a re-run of the referendum they tried to stop.A second referendum does not solve the UK’s problems it is not clearit should be on membership or on a deal – or both – and is complicated further because continued UK membership will not be under the current terms. We will lose our financial rebate worth billions, we shall be forced to accept immigrant quotas and once more be on the hook for Euro bail-outs that loom over the Eurozone economy. The EU army that two years ago was called a “myth” has become a reality, with President Macron saying it might even have to defend us against the United States. With May’s “Chequers-minus-minus” likely to mean remaining in her rebranded Customs Union, Single Market and Common Fisheries Policy a Norway-style deal where we would continue to be rule takers at a heavy price a second referendum continuing to ide the country and lead to demands for a third-time-luckyLeavers lostthe only alternative must be to live under World Trade Organisation rules that give us time to negotiate the trade deal that is already on the table for Great Britain, but not yet Northern Ireland.With that in mind, Jacob Rees Mogg has come forward with a plan called “No Deal – Plus” which would mean spending time between now and the end of March on ironing out what problems might exist but sweetening the EU with an offer of two years’ net payments of £bn.His case is that much of the scaremongering can be dealt with by tying up similar administrative arrangements that already exist for other countries living under WTO rules. It would also leave us free to then organise the trade deals with other countries that are so important for the UK’s economic future. As legally the default positionthe government’s deal – or any other compromise fails to be approved – No Deal is looking far more likely.

On Saturday, the American President – before failing to turn up at a US military cemetery in France because it was raining – told his  million Twitter followers he was in Paris to “celebrate the end of World War One” and asked: “Is there anything better to celebrate than the end of a war ”Mr Trump’s dependably vulgar intervention stood in stark contrast to the tone of events held around the world to mark the centenary of Armistice Day.Tempting though it is to simply ignore the President’s contribution, it stands as a useful reminder of the importance of the values we cherish as we remember those who fell in the Great War and in many subsequent conflicts. As we think of their courage, their loyalty, their comradeship, and their sacrice, we are reminded that – no matter how determined Mr Trump and others who travel his path may be to debase opponents and ide people – these are values we should hold closer than ever.After the laying of wreaths by, among others, Prince Charles, Prime Minister Theresa May, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, and German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, , members of the public, descended from services personnel, marched past the Cenotaph in London in what was described by organisers as a “nation’s thank you”.• : Silhouettes of First World War Tommies projected on to Edinburgh CastleThis simple, silent procession of those who carry with them something of those lost in battle was powerfully moving. So, too, was an event in Folkestone where the film director Danny Boyle oversaw the etching on the beach by a team of artists of a portrait of the poet Wilfred Owen. Owen – who was killed a week before the end of the First World War – had left for France from the beach on which his image was recreated. Yesterday, as millions around the world fell silent at am, the tide crept across the poet’s image, slowly washing it away. It was an elegant visual poem, a reminder of the fragility of le.The events of the weekend do not, of course, direct our thoughts solely to those who lost their lives in battle, they also make us think about the circumstances that led to conflict. As we remember those who died, we also examine the mistakes of the past that created the catalysts for war. Commemoration of the fallen without a commitment to ensure that others are not, wherever possible, called upon to make the same sacrice would be meaningless.One hundred years after the last body fell during the First World War, young men and women continue to risk their lives in the service of this nation and many of those people will, in time, need our support. The impact of war on service personnel is far better understood than it once was. Many men executed as cowards or deserters between - would, today, be recognised as sufferers of post traumatic stress disorder.And so we were encouraged to hear a suggestion from opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn for a new “social contract for veterans”. Mr Corbyn said that, under his plan, those leaving the forces would be guaranteed a home, mental health support, and opportunities in education and employment.It is abundantly clear that many ex-services personnel require a great deal more support than they now receive Mr Corbyn’s suggestion is one to which the government should give serious consideration.We remembered, yesterday, those who gave their lives in service of the UK but those people are gone now and we can offer them only our thoughts. A truly fitting memorial to those who fell would be our commitment to properly support those who follow in their footsteps.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4828177.1542029442!/image/image.jpg","title":"british airways seek support from spanish government as part of no deal brexit contingency","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...The owner of British Airways is understood to be seeking the support of the Spanish government in the event of a no-deal Brexit.International Airlines Group has asked for the Spanish government’s help to retain its operating rights should the UK leave of the European Union without a deal, according to reports.It is understood IAG has been in talks with the Spanish government since October as it seeks to prove to Brussels that it complies with its airline ownership rules.The move follows reports in Spanish newspaper El Pais.Currently, the UK is set to leave the EU but no withdrawal agreement has yet been reached.However, in the event of a no-deal Brexit, IAG’s status as a European carrier could be thrown into jeopardy as under existing rules, an airline must be more than % EU-owned and controlled to be considered European. IAG has yet to demonstrate that it meets this requirement.The group was formed following the combination of British Airways and Spanish carrier Iberia and owns a number of budget airlines including Vueling, Aer Lingus and low cost long haul carrier Level.Their operational headquarters, which controls the management of its British and Spanish subsidiaries, is in London.IAG told The Times: “We remain confident that a comprehensive air transport agreement between the EU and the UK will be reached. It’s in the UK and the EU’s interests to have a fully liberalised aviation agreement.“Eventhere is no Brexit deal, both the EU and the UK have said they will put an agreement in place that allows flights to continue.”European transport commissioner Violeta Bulc has warned that she will not bend the rules for IAGthe UK were to follow through with Brexit despite not securing a deal.

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism.

So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"whalsays new research arrives in lerwick for first time ","story":"The Research leaves Symbister with bunting flying as she heads for Lerwick on Saturday.

He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

A lot of visitor experiences are going to be marred.\"Adam Gough, CairnGorm Mountain representative, who had told of the need for the slopes aimed at beginners and intermediates, was clearly stunned by the rejection.Asked immediately after the decisionan appeal was likely, he said that a statement would be issued later.CNPA head planner Gavin Miles had stressed from the outset the application had to be determined on planning issues ndash landscaping impacts in particular ndash and not on its commercial merits, which had generated much argument.He said the business case was a matter for Natural Retreats.Mr Miles told the committee the articial slope would not extend the ski area in any signicant way but the footprint of obvious development would increase.He commented: \"Initially the team were very concerned about the landscaping but as more information was given to us by the applicants it was considered that in the long term planting would mitigate against that. There would be an impact in the short term of the dry ski slope.\"Whether it will ever be an attraction in its own right and generate signicant income, who knows, but that is not a consideration of the planning process.\"In effect it is a ersication of business in this area and therefore acceptable andit was to strengthen the stability of CairnGorm Mountain then thats a good thing.\"He said there were some hefty planning conditions attached to control the development.CairnGorm Mountains representative said some  per cent of total visits to the resort were in just three winter months of the year.Mr Gough had told the committee Natural Retreats had explored several options in depth to remove the reliance on winter income including mountain biking and zip-wiring but this plan was the most viable at this time.He said it was imperative the attraction can provide year-round employment in order to retain its best staff. This site was the most sheltered for the ski slope and close to other facilities without impacting on other slopes, he said. It could also be used for tubing and other activities.Mr Gough acknowledged the clamour for better ski uplt at CairnGorm which has been overtaken as Scotlands most popular ski resort.He said: \"We would like nothing more than to be able to upgrade ski infrastructure to improve the snowsports experience for everyone but this has to be a long term process built on solid commercial foundations.\"He said the slope could be in operation for  per cent of the year outwith winter and ice would not be a problem as it was easy practice to break it up.ABA secretary Alan Brattey said history showed articial slopes at Scottish resorts including the Lecht, Glenshee and Glencoe had not worked.He also said a bright green Snowflex slope would stand out like a sore thumb and no consideration had been given by the operator to an alternative by market leader, Neveplast, which could be camouflaged.He said that of just over  votes on Facebook on the application,  per cent were against it.Tessa Jones, of the Badenoch and Strathspey Conservation Group, asked the committee: \"What are you going to say to the world about this peatland destruction \"Committee member Dave Fallows moved the application be refused and he was seconded by Carolyn Caddick.He said he appreciated the efforts to mitigate against the ski slope but said: \"It cant possibly soften in the long term the impact that this makes on the area.\"Mrs Caddick said: \"We are going to see it for miles and miles around.\"Peter Argyle had moved in favour of the application saying he had faith in the planning officers conditions but was not supported.Mr Brattey said after the vote: \"This was very much the right decision and wed like to congratulate the planning committee for deciding to reject this planning application against the advice of their planning officials.\"We very much hope that common sense will now prevail and that the plans for the Ptarmigan Building will be dropped.\"We are left to wonder just exactly why HIE allowed their tenant to take such a madcap plan all the way to the CNPAs planning committee who were very decisive in their rejection of it.\"He said HIE should ert the pound million to new uplt. \"The hill business requires to be funicular proofed as soon as possible,\" said Mr Brattey.Monday  Nov  : PM"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118063.jpg","title":"Green light for Dalwhinnie quarry work","story":"Gavin MusgroveA quarry operator has said that measures are in place to allay concerns that their excavation plans could lead to a surge in speeding lorries in a Badenoch village.Leithshas been given the green light by the Cairngorms National Park Authorityrsquos planning committee to recommence operations at the site at Carn Dhomhnuill Bhain on the doorstep of Dalwhinnie.The company has said that it is not contingent on winning a contract to supply aggregate to the dualling of the A but that the produce will be used for housebuilding and other local construction projects.The firm was granted temporary permission for  yearsatthe CNPArsquoslatest planning committee meeting at Boat of Garten Community Hall.Production will be stepped up dramatically at the quarry around one mile north of Dalwhinnie by the A.It was previously in operation up to .But now Leiths has permission to extend the site from two to  hectares.

Importantly that means that visitors will be travelling through the Sleat peninsula, where communities have worked long and hard to build up a viable industry.“In the midst of the important debates about ferries and not least the importance of the MV Coruisk to the Armadale-Mallaig crossing, it’s important to celebrate the huge contribution that RET has made to the island economies.”If CalMac#s league tables of ferry route usage tell us anything, it is that moving the MV #Coruisk# from its purpose-built harbours on the busiest crossing in the north-west remains inexplicable.If the two tables of passengers and coaches highlight anything , it is that CalMac badly needs its two new ferries from the Clyde to be delivered according to their revised schedule and not experience a third delay.It is a mild surprise, as Kate Forbes MSP says, to discover that more people sail between Mallaig and Armadale in Skye than between Stornoway and Ullapool and that more coaches cross the Sound of Sleat than make any other journey on CalMac#s itinerary.It is good news not only for Sleat but for the whole of the island. It is good news which is tempered by the fact that this busy, bustling route is now served only by whatever ships CalMac can spare, when the tide permits them, while its purpose-built vessel, the MV #Coruisk#, which can dock at Armadale in all tidal conditions, is ploughing between Mull and Oban  nautical miles away.If CalMac had the ships, Mallaig Armadale would be dependable and therefore even busier, Mull would have a vessel of its own and almost everybody would be happy.CalMac do not have the ships in large part because two new deep-sea vessels which were commissioned in  from Ferguson Marine Engineering at Port Glasgow show no sign of turning up for duty.One of them is due to operate on CalMac#s busiest passenger route between Ardrossan and Arran. The other is to work between Uig, Tarbert and Lochmaddy, which last year carried almost , people.The delivery date for those two ships has been put back twice. On each occasion, the £ million contract to Ferguson Marine — which is the property of one of the Scottish Government#s friends, advisors and allies, the billionaire tax exile Jim McColl — was topped up by a multi-million-pound handout from the public purse.If all was on schedule at least one of those ships would now be in service, and CalMac would have substantially more leeway in manoeuvring its fleet from one part of the west coast to another. They might even be able to keep the #Coruisk# on the Sound of Sleat.They are very far from on schedule. The new Ardrossan Arran ferry is now supposed to be delivered next summer, and the new Uig Tarbert Lochmaddy ship in spring .Will they be delivered  Or will we experience a third delay, which would certainly plunge CalMac into even greater chaos as its ageing fleet breaks down or requires routine maintenance somewhere in the Baltic Those are important questions. As we reported last week, the chief executive of Outer Hebrides Tourism, Rob MacKinnon, has criticised the Scottish Government for a lack of any #tangible action# to address the islands# ferry problems.The Scottish transport ministry, said Mr MacKinnon, must #pursue all feasible options to increase ferry capacity in both the long and the short term for the benefit of both visitors and islanders#.As we report this week, Labour#s Western Isles# candidate Alison MacCorquodale has added her voice to the many demanding to know the precise terms of the private finance initiative deal which has bound the Scottish Government into using just one ferry for all passengers and freight between Ullapool and Stornoway, with unacceptable consequences.Ullapool Stornoway may not yet carry as many tourists as Mallaig Armadale. But it is the definition of a leline service, with , passengers last year, many of whom found themselves unable to squeeze onto an overbooked #Loch Seaforth#.We should be told how and why one of our biggest and most important ferries came to be owned by Lloyds Bank.We should be toldJim McColl is going to deliver two badly-needed ships at the third time of asking.It is not enough to say, as does transport minister Michael Matheson, that building CalMac#s ferries is #providing vital support to our shipbuilding industry#The way things are going, building and rebuilding CalMac#s ferries will keep Scottish shipbuilding alive well into the next decade. Their higher purpose, and Mr Matheson#s job is to provide vital support to the Hebridean ferry service. That support is urgently required."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/2018-mod-gold-medals-e1539885405814.jpg","title":"thursday at the mod skye and lochalsh gold medal","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThere was a Skye and Lochalsh double in the premier singing competition at this year’s National Mòd in Dunoon.In Wednesday night’s final Ceitidh Campbell from Kyle of Lochalsh won the women’s Gold Medal, while the men’s medal went to Ruairidh Cormack from Portree.Both singers are following in family footsteps in landing the prestigious honour, which is presented by Mòd organisers An Comunn Gàidhealach.Ceitidh’s mother, Barbara Smith, won the Gold Medal when the Mòd was held in Skye in .

November, in which Councillor Ian Cockburn put forward a motion whereby the local authority would determinefunds were available for design work to begin on replacement options to the bypass. This motion was agreed. earlier this week, the chair of the EDI committee, Councillor Allan Henderson said that the council was putting pressure on the Scottish Government to have the route classed as a trunk road. However, during Thursday’s meeting Councillor Cockburn was quick to dismiss the likelihood of this happening: “Who in their right mind would take  miles of the worst road in the Highlands” He said. “After six and a half years we still only have two options… and the delays and the consequences for the wider community have been absolutely shocking.”The SNP member for Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh also went on to question the tendering process behind the work at the bypass, saying: “Was it necessary to shut the road during the day  I believe there was a tender on the table that would have allowed the road to open during the day.”He went on to argue that the council needed to release money straight away to enable design work on the replacement options for the current bypass to begin, adding that it was a matter of urgency due to the risks identied in the  annual sloping report which detailed four very high-risk rock slopes at the Stromeferry bypass.In response to Councillor Cockburn, the council’s head of infrastructure Colin Howell said that the council did receive an alternative tender from a contractor who said they could carry out the required works at night, however, Mr Howell said the cost was signicant and due to concerns about these plans it was decided it would be wise for some of the work to be undertaken during the day.Mr Howell said that while there were ongoing issues with rockfalls and managing slopes, he believed that the council had done a good job. He went on to add that the council were prioritising the high-risk slopes and currently working on the cost and details in relation to stabilising those areas which would be delivered at the next EDI committee meeting. He added that there were “three optimum solutions” in respect to replacement options and said that the committee had “decided to leave those three on the table# and seek dialogue with Scottish Government for funding. He said: “The administration is looking for feedback, we are working on slopes with high risks and will come back to the next EDI with the costing.”Councillor Derek MacLeod described the current situation as “one episode in a long, long history of problems with the route#, and in contrast to his fellow ward member, Councillor Cockburn, he argued that the route should be “trunked between Auchtertyre and Garve” as he believed it to be strategic in linking the ferry points of Uig and UllapoolCouncil Leader Margaret Davidson told the committee that she would be meeting with the Transport Secretary Michael Matheson and would report back “what options have been put on the table.” Councillor Davidson said that the council were “acutely aware of what’s needed” and were working towards a long-term sustainable option for Stromeferry.

For anartist of his stature this was courageous, dependent as he was, tosome extent, on commissions from people who, to say the least, wouldnot be subscribers to our paper. But this was an artist who went hisown way in art and who acted as a citizen with a conscience in anIreland where State-imposed censorship distorted not only politicaldebate but also national self-image. For Robert Ballaghcreative work and active citizenship have gone hand in hand all hisle. This is depicted in his double self-portrait ‘Upstairs No.’,one of the many illustrations of his work in this superbly writtenand beautully presented book. It is not a standard autobiographywith chapters set out in chronological order beginning with genealogyand ending with this week’s news. As you would expect from Ballagh,he takes a dferent approach, starting towards the later years andcircling through his days in no particular order before coming backto the present. More than that, he weaves narrative, anecdote andreflection together seamlessly and conversationally showing a skillwith words akin to his skill with brushes. He has a story to tell ofa very ied le, from his unusual family background to his time asa showband guitar player, through his unorthodox beginning as apainter and his development as an artist and an activist. Withfrankness and clarity he tells us how he learned and matured as anartist and his brief commentaries on many of his works areilluminating both of how they were made and the concepts behind them.It makes the reader want to look again and more intensely at thepictures. The Prologue isessentially a dedication to Robert’s late we Betty, his lelonginspiration, mentor and most important critic. The first chaptertells the harrowing story of how Betty, in her serious illness, wasdisgracefully let down by a healthcare system which basically allowedher to die through neglect, as was admitted in legal proceedings. Butthis does not cast a shadow over the book, as her positive presenceis felt throughout, and is celebrated by the author. These days I rarely getthat urge immediately to re-read a book when I reach the end, but Idid with this one. Thankfully the chapters are so well defined thatthey can be read as stand-alone essays or stories. Take just twoexamples: ‘Who Fears to Speak ofEaster Week’ recounts the tremendous people’s commemoration ofthe  Centenary in which Robert played a central part, aculmination of his activism which has included campaigning againstapartheid, for the Birmingham Six, for artists’ rights, with theIrish National Congress opening border roads, in solidarity withPalestine and as an enthusiastic participant in Féile an Pobail inWest Belfast from its commencement.‘Dining at McDonald’s’is a brilliant critique of the dominant and stultying modernistideology and practise in art and an appeal for an opening up. Ballaghattacks “the notion that the artists’ choice imbues a givenobject with special properties which are tantamount to a metaphysicaltransformation of the object that it ceases to be a pedestrianartefactand becomes,by virtue of the artist’s choice, art”. This ideology leads tothe absurdity of much of the ‘installation’ stuff in galleriesthat baffles all but elitist insiders and, as Ballagh recounts, theclaim by loyalist killer Michael Stone that his attack on Stormontwas a piece of performance art. He argues that the bureaucracies mustset aside this ideology and make galleries more open and democratic .For these views and forhis artistic method and, among some I suspect, for his politics,Ballagh has been frowned upon by certain elites. One prominent figurein the Irish art world said of him with dripping condescension thathe is “not a real artist, he is a mere illustrator”. Typically,Ballagh responded with humour and defiance in a self-portrait wearinga t-shirt saying ‘Fuck the Begrudgers’. I cannot recommend thisbook highly enough. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27482  ","story":"Pearse Doherty: The Interview  Ruairí Doyle“Society is organised in the wrong way - we should not have a housing crisis - what is happening with our children in emergency accommodation is immoral. It is a scandal that we will look back at in twenty years with shame.” - Pearse Doherty TDSinn Féin TD and Finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty has spoken of his origins, his le and how they influence and inform both his political ideology in an extended online interview. He also outlined his vison for a New Ireland that provides achance for people to live, to work and to raise their families without thechronic levels of deprivation and inequality facing so many today. Speaking ahead of Sinn Féin’s Alternative Budget launch nextweek Deputy Doherty laid out his party’s vision “for a new economy for a NewIreland”.The Donegal TD was born in Glasgow and lived with hisparents and five siblings in a one-bedroom flat in Ibrox before the familyed home to Gweedore in Donegal in the ’s. This informed his belief that no matter when someone leftIreland, evenit were  or  years ago, they still have a great sense ofbelonging, of that tangible bond with home “that’s home - you know - Níl aontinteán mar do thinteán féin - that’s their home”, commented Teachta Doherty.Pearse, who has been a TD since , talked about his drivehome when the Dáil wraps up at the week’s end, crossing the border twice on hisway up the winding road to Donegal to his we and four boys. He also gave aninsight into the dficulty of the balance between work and home le, and theunique challenges of being a public representative. The Gaoth Dobhair resident added that it is not solely challengesthat come with being a Teachta Dala. He said: “It is what shapes you and your values. It’s yourexperience - it’s your past experience - it’s your family experience and it’swhat shapes you in Irish society, the people that are around you. The peoplewho influence you and that help shape you and that’s the values that I bring tomy job today as Finance spokesperson for the lead opposition party. It’s thevalues I will bring to the job as Minister for Finance,I am in thatposition.”Sinn Féin regularly faces accusations of employing “fairy-taleeconomics” or “economic illiteracy”.Pearse dismisses these comments as cheap throw-away remarks,designed to stunt political debate. This is a debate that Pearse opines that the establishmentparties do not want because “any fair minded person would see clearly thatthere is a need to build houses, to bring our children out of emergencyaccommodation instead of cutting taxes for the wealthiest in society.”He continued: “Where despite the fact that the three main banks aremaking €. billion in profits every year, they don’t pay any Corporation Taxand some of them won’t pay for the next twenty years.  That’s the debate they don’t want to have.”As Pearse puts it, the Budget is not just about numbers -it’s about our values and ensuring we create a new economy with strong publicservices and shared prosperity where no one is left behind and no child goeswithout.Deputy Doherty said: “Society is organised in the wrong way. We shouldnot have a housing crisis. What is happening with our children in emergencyaccommodation is immoral and it is a scandal that we will look back at intwenty years with shame.  “What is happening in our hospitals is outrageous, in a country thathas the wealth that it does.  “It is just not shared properly and it is not allocated properly andthat isn’t the fault of citizens. That is fault of politicians that decided onBudget day that the resources created by the Irish people are going to beallocated in this way.”Touching on the spectre of Brexit, as a TD for a borderconstituency, Pearse argues that the North of Ireland remaining in the EU andgiven a Special Designated status is the only way to protect people on bothsides, particularly Donegal which is isolated from the rest of the  Counties.Pearse also remarks that “the debate about Irish Unity needs to go toanother level”. He continued: “We are moving, in my view, to a position where we willhave a border poll. Where a majority of people will vote for Irish unity.  “And that will come about because of demographic changes. It will comeabout because Sinn Féin is agitating for it, and other people are recognisingthat it is in their interests that we have an end to the Irish border.”Sinn Féin is not interested in maintaining the status quoand not content to merely “tinker along the edges - where you might get anincrease in public services, an extra few gardaí, an extra few public sectorworkers, a little tax cut here” Pearse Doherty said. This Budget, and every Sinn Féin Budget, would be about our vision fora new Ireland and that vision of an equal and fair society. We would also focuson the political choices that have always been available to create that society one is prepared to make them. Teachta Doherty states in the conclusion of his interview: “Our job isto provide opportunities so that people can live and work at home. We need togive people the opportunity to raise their families at home, so that they canget through le and reach their opportunities and reach their potential athomethat’s what they wish.” test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27483  ","story":" Mary Lou McDonaldPresident of Sinn FéinWe are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.- Mary Lou McDonaldDUP Leader Arlene Foster has called for fundamental changeto the Good Friday Agreement to facilitate Brexit. In other words an agreement endorsed by the majority of people north and south must make way for Brexit, a proposition rejected by a majority in the north. The latest position of the DUP leader lays bare the root of thecrisis in the north. Remember, the DUP opposed the Good Friday Agreement, campaigned for a No vote in that historic referendum and they continue to oppose the Agreement. An Agreement that has underpinned peace for over two decades.They oppose the all Ireland nature of the Agreement, they oppose the rights and safeguards of the agreement and they oppose power-sharing.   to be in them.” The institutions in the north could no-longer bear the weight of this contradiction and collapsed. This was brought to ahead by the continual refusal to implement agreements, opposition to marriage equality, rights to an inquest, an Irish language Act and the financial scandal that is the RHI Cash for Ash scheme.Add to the mix a British Government that has no understanding of Ireland, our economy or our agreements. The Tories are at war with themselves over Brexit and seem intent to bring their own country down with them. This same Tory Government entered into a toxic deal with the DUP to stay in power. That is why there are no institutions in the north, and why the DUP leadership walked away from the deal they had made with Sinn Féin in February this year to get the Assembly up and running.These latest comments by Arlene Foster are a desperate throw of the dice by an increasingly marginalised Unionist leadership. The deal with the Tories will end. Its only legacy will be Brexit. Meanwhile Ireland north and south is changing and a New Ireland is emerging. The joyous revolution of Marriage Equality and Repeal of the Eighth has resonated with a new generation in the north. The largest political demonstration in Belfast is Pride. A magnicent event that celebrates the ersity of identities that make up our communities.Similarly there is a growing demand for access to abortion services. As a placard proudly announced in Dublin Castle when the Repeal result came through, “The North is Next”.Brexit has also unied those who voted to remain within the EU. Brexit will be a disaster for the economy in the north, particularly for agriculture. A community that values prosperity and access to the EU is looking beyond Brexit and Westminster and instead towards Irish Unity. We are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.As for Arlene Foster and the DUP - the game is up. If their leadership want the institutions in the north up and working then they must support real power sharing, respect, equality and the rights of others. When this happens Sinn Féin will be a willing partner. Now is the time for political courage, to look forward in the interests of all communities. Meanwhile the debate on Irish unity and a unity referendum grows. I am confident that we can build a New United Ireland, a home for all that share this island. That is the big challenge for our generation. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27484  ","story":"• RUC unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons Mícheál Mac DonnchaCivil Rights campaigners in Derry had been pressing for a march in their city which had long been a byword for unionist sectarianism and discrimination.Using gerrymandered electoral boundaries and a corrupt voting system which allowed wealthier citizens to have multiple votes in local elections, the unionists maintained a majority of members on the council in a city with a nationalist majority.Nationalists lived in very poor housing conditions and were affected disproportionately by the % unemployment rate in the city.Unionists had long regarded the old walled town as a citadel that could never be surrendered and their dominance was symbolised by the walls towering over the crumbling th century terraced streets of the nationalist Bogside. The last time nationalists had attempted to hold a parade inside the walls was on St Patrick’s Day  – when they were batoned by the RUC.Housing was a massive issue in Derry and the Derry Housing Action Committeeprovided the focus for leadership as the Civil Rights campaign took off. The DHAC had organised a James Connolly commemoration in the city in July  which was banned by the unionist government.The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Associationagreed to hold a march in Derry on  October. The loyalist Apprentice Boys organisation immediately announced a counter-demonstration with the purpose of forcing the unionist government’s hand to ban the Civil Rights march. But the regime at Stormont did not require forcing because the Home Affairs Minister was ultra-unionist William Craig, who promptly imposed the ban.NICRA held an emergency meeting with the DHAC. Many on the NICRA Executive and some Derry nationalist figures, including John Hume, wanted to cancel the march, but the majority of Derry activists were determined to defy the ban. They won out and the march was to proceed as planned.It was a relatively small march, beginning on Craigavon Bridge with several hundred people. The objective was the Diamond in the city centre.The march was stopped in Duke Street by the RUC. A meeting was held with speakers including Gerry Fitt, Betty Sinclair, Eddie McAteer, Ivan Cooper, Austin Currie and Eamonn McCann. Three Westminster Labour MPs were also present.After the meeting, the marchers found themselves hemmed in on all sides by the RUC. They could not disperse and after a tense stand-off the RUC, oblivious to the presence of TV cameras and photographers, unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons, boots and fists. Water cannons were then used.Bernadette Devlin McAliskey, then a young People’s Democracy activist, recalled:“Quite deliberately, they hosed in the upstairs windows and shopfronts, and they went right across Craigavon Bridge, hosing all the onlookers.

While there may never be agreement on the ious contested narratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.- Declan KearneyThis week the NIO consultation on dealing with the legacy of thepast in the north of Ireland closed.It will inform a legislative process and bringforward future legacy legislation.Failure to deal with the past remains one of the most signicantimpediments to political progress here.It is a barrier to the development of a comprehensivereconciliation and healing process in this society.British state policy has been the primary factor in preventinglegacy issues from being addressed or resolved.Powerful sections of the British military and intelligence systemhave never embraced the peace process. They remain psychologically andpolitically locked into a conflict mind-set even twenty years after the GoodFriday Agreement was signed.The role of British State forces and their agents, a refusal toacknowledge and be accountable for their actions, combined with a disregard forsuccessive binding court rulings, has defined the British state’s approach tolegacy matters.That has been reinforced in recent times by a cynical and narrative, including interventions by the British Prime Minister Theresa May,and British Secretary of State in the north, Karen Bradley, to suggest thatonly state forces were being made subject to legacy investigations.These statements are offensive and wrong, and are an egregiousdemonstration of the partisan nature of British policy towards dealing with thepast.They are consistent with the British practice of denying wrongdoing, concealing the truth, and preventing accountability.This poses a major challenge to ensuring that a robust,independent, and impartial facilitation of the legislative process will emergefrom this consultation on addressing the legacy of the past.All sides suffered, and caused suffering to each other during theconflict.There are multiple narratives regarding our tragic past. There isno single narrative despite the attempts of the British state and politicalunionism to assert otherwise.The past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering andpain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contestednarratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.The Stormont House Agreement, , , set out an agreedframework of legacy mechanisms which provided an unprecedented opportunity tocomprehensively deal with the past in all its aspects.Subsequent draft legislation reneged on the British government’sobligations under the SHA by introducing a national security veto, which hadthe effect of blocking a way forward on the issue of legacy.Full implementation of the SHA on a human rights compliant basispresents the best opportunity to deal with the legacy of our past and guaranteea framework which is victim centred.Facilitation of any future legislative process will require thatthe British government must ensure all victims are treated with equality,respect and dignity that the legislation reflects the policy intent of theAgreement and, that the legacy architecture is fully independent, human rightscompliant, and properly resourced and funded.The following key principles should be central to the operation offuture legacy legislation and mechanisms.-          Allprocesses should be victim centred-          Allprocesses must secure the co-operation of all relevant parties to ensuresuccess-          Allprocesses should be based upon equality, respect, and dignity-          Allprocesses must be free from political interference and be absolutelyindependent-         Acknowledgement should be central to the operation of the legacy framework-          The aim ofthat framework should be to enable reconciliation and healing within widersocietyIf there is to be a collective and comprehensive engagement withthe past in a human rights compliant manner, there can be no hierarchy ofvictimhood or humanity.There must be no change to the definition of a victim.High-quality services should be provided to all victims at thepoint of need.This should extend to the immediate provision of a pension for allseriously and psychologically injured during the conflict.The British Government should also immediately release therequired funding to resource the Lord Chief Justice’s inquest plan, as aseparate distinct process from any new legacy mechanisms.The Office of the Police Ombudsman should be adequately andimmediately resourced.Any attempt by the British state to introduce a statute oflimitations to protect its forces and agents would be a violation of the SHA and must be opposed.Full participation and unfettered disclosure by British stateforces and its agents with the legacy mechanisms will be essential to achievefull public confidence in their ability to deliver on behalf of all society.Periodic reviews should be carried out to inform the extent offunding requirements and necessary timeframe, for all legacy mechanisms.Legacy processes should not be limited or impeded by closedmaterial proceedings. In addition, for future legacy mechanisms toasintended, it is essential families are given full access to legal aid.The legacy legislation which ultimately emerges from theconsultation must comply with the policy intent of the SHA by:-          Promotingreconciliation-          Upholdingthe rule of law-         Acknowledging and addressing the suffering of all victims and survivors-         Facilitating the pursuit of justice and information recovery-          Beinghuman rights compliant-          Beingbalanced, proportionate, transparent, accountable, fair, and equalThe full implementation of that Agreement representsthe best potential and opportunity to address the legacy of our politicalconflict and the suffering experienced by everyone during the conflict inIreland, Britain and beyond. So, it is now time to finally deal with the past.  It is time tobuild for the future. It is time to lay the foundations for reconciliation andhealing, and to open up a new phase of the peace

permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office”Ive been wondering lately whether anyone in Democratic Unionist Partyleadership circles actually try to reflect upon what republicans, nationalists, and other progressive minded citizens think about the current political situation.Do they even care what others think The evidence suggests not.Several days ago the DUP leader pronounced that her party could and would change the Good Friday Agreementat a whim. There was no hint of irony in her claim – the DUP has spent the last  years opposing the GFA, ever since it was signed.In another extraordinary, but not untypical, outburst she declared her blood red line position on Brexit and, that in the same week as the consultation on dealing with the past was concluding!Of course the DUP leader, and other key figures have form in making offensive and provocative political interventions.Her dehumanising description of republicans as \"crocodiles\" in  comes to mind.Notably, she previously called republican and nationalist Ministers in a ing Executive ‘rogues and renegades.Only the DUP knows whether this leader is naturally predisposed to being rhetorically gaffe prone, or is being deliberately offensive.Perhaps some figures in the DUP do think about wider opinion: the DUP is not a monolith after all.But, those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power sharing.  They oppose equality and rights, and reject reconciliation.Instead they have chosen to join forces with the extremists in the British Tory party to help steer the Brexit train wreck.The DUP leadership is living in a delusional bubble.Meanwhile, the party brand has become indistinguishable from the financial scandals of recent years such as Red Sky, NAMA, Brexit dark money, and financial relationships with Sri Lanka.The ongoing RHI inquiry exposé of how the DUP behaved in government makes a complete mockery of its purported adherence to good governance’.The party MPs have become power drunk through their pact with the Tories, and a serious misconception that they are king makers in Westminster.  Edward Carsons cautionary words have clearly been forgotten or disregarded.  He warnedWhat a fool I was.  I was only a puppet, and so was Ulster… in the political game that was to get the Conservative party into power.’ The DUP has a tactical approach towards everything including maintaining the status quo on its own terms, slowing down and frustrating progressive societal change, and maintaining sectarian dominance within the unionist constituency.The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office.  Its inability and refusal to embrace dference or celebrate ersity is reflected in an institutionalised bigotry against, and intolerance towards the Irish national identity and cultural traditions, and LGBT rights.The partys contempt and sharp practice in government has destroyed wider public confidence in the political institutions, and led to the decisive tipping point of RHI and withdrawal of the Líofa grant scheme in the winter of .As a result of its ingrained arrogance and lack of political humility the DUP leadership is constantly in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarianism, homophobia, and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists, and many others, including sections of civic unionism, do not believe the DUP is serious about restoring genuine power sharing. These citizens want the institutions to be restored, but not at the risk of allowing the DUP to continue practicing discrimination, disrespect, intimidation, bigotry, and sharp practice. They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power on that basis.  And, neither will Sinn Féin.The DUPs behaviour, and the onslaught of Brexit have together brought back graphically into focus the denial of rights which resulted in the Civil Rights Movement fty years ago.A generational realignment has occurred within northern nationalism.Acht Gaeilge, marriage equality, womens reproductive health rights, legacy justice rights, and the demand for a Bill of Rights are the modern day acid test equivalents of one person, one vote.  The current crisis in the north of Ireland is the visceral culmination of  years of DUP push back against the GFA.Intoxicated with its imaginary power at Westminster, the DUP leadership has finally over played its hand. The political institutions could have been re-established by the th February last, but the DUP leaders walked out of negotiations.Instead of selling the deal which they negotiated in February with Sinn Féin, the DUP leader, deputy leader, party chief executive, and its senior talks team bottled out.Since then the party has been convulsed with the resultant internal fall out.  There has been no meaningful contact with Sinn Féin, and absolutely no willingness demonstrated to resume negotiations.Any advocacy of blood red lines is a total anathema to democracy.The wider nationalist constituency is fed up to the back teeth with the subversion of the political process by the DUP, the British Tory government and others in political unionism.It is more impatient than ever for equality, rights and parity of esteem.  The history of  is being replayed. Thousands marching from Duke Street in Derry city on Saturday th October to mark the iconic civil rights march  years before is the latest example of that.  An exciting momentum for change is taking place across Ireland, north and south.  Old orthodoxies are being eclipsed by discussions about new, modern, all-Ireland constitutional and political arrangements. The permanent unionist electoral majority is gone and demographic changes are irreversible.All of this puts the onus back upon both governments to act decisively to address the denial of rights.The Irish government needs to take the lead because for now the DUP has this British government over a barrel.  But thats a short-term situation.  A British general election in the immediate to mid term cannot be ruled out.A new political discourse has begun about the future. All sections of society need to be involved in this and the unionist is critical in all of this.Brexit, the GFA, citizens rights, and an Irish unity referendum are central to that. Progressives should explore common ground and alliances for change.Republicans and unionists need to start to face the same way.  We have to begin looking at each other through eyes of the future.The benchmarks of a rights-based society guaranteeing civil and religious liberties and equality for all, are set.  These are not negotiable.So, whoever is actually in charge of the DUP for the time being has a lot of serious thinking to do...Who now leads the DUP  Do they have the authority to negotiate and stick to an agreement Are they committed to a shared future with republicans, nationalists, and others in the north Unless, and until the DUP can clearly answer these questions for the rest of society, it will remain exactly where it is now – out of power, and facing the inevitable fate about which Carson warned: getting dumped by the British Tories.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27487  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe Liberal Party was in government in Britain and had introduced the Home Rule Bill with the support of the Irish nationalist MPs in Westminster. They had abolished the veto of the House of Lords and Home Rule was due to be implemented in . The Tories seized on the issue of Home Rule as the most effective weapon to bring down the Liberals. Leading members of the British landed aristocracy, capitalists and senior military figures jumped on the bandwagon and backed up Unionist leader Edward Carson with threats of civil warHome Rule was brought in.Amidst the political frenzy there were very few Protestants in Ulster who were prepared to oppose Carsonism. But there were some and among them was the Reverend J.B. Armour of Ballymoney, County Antrim. A minister of the Presbyterian Church, Armour stood out from most of his co-religionists in advocating self-government for Ireland. In , he opposed a resolution at the Presbyterian General Assembly condemning Gladstone’s second Home Rule Bill. He was also a strong critic of landlordism.In , he again opposed a resolution against Home Rule at the Presbyterian General Assembly.Calling for freedom of conscience for Protestants to support or oppose Home Rule, Armour slammed the intolerance of Carsonism when he told the assembly:“If you deny the right of private judgment and of free speech, how much do you have of Protestantism worth keeping  Nothing at all.”Armour organised a public meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney to support Home Rule and oppose Carsonism. Banners in the hall proclaimed “No provisional or provincial government for us” and “Ulster for Ireland and Ireland for us”.The resolution stated that the meeting of Protestants of Ballymoney and the protests in The Route“against the claim of Sir Edward Carson and the self-constituted Provisional Government of Ulster to represent the Protestant community of north-east Ulster” and “disputes the narrow claim that dferences of creed necessarily separate Irishmen and women into hostile camps”. Among the speakers at the Ballymoney meeting were JB Armour himself, historian Alice Stopford Green, Jack White, son of a British Army general and later a leading figure in the Irish Citizen Army, and Roger Casement, who was executed in . This was Casement’s first appearance on a political . With his Antrim family background, Casement regarded the occasion as hugely signicant and in his speech he denounced any notion of partitioning Ireland. The meeting was a once-off and failed to turn the tide of Carsonism but it did show that a signicant minority of Protestants in the North-East were still prepared to stand up for Irish unity and self-government. The meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney in support of Irish self-government was held on  October ,  years ago this week. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27490  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.- Declan KearneyLast weekend the Irish Congress of Trades Unionsand Irish Labour History Society organised a conference to commemorate William Walker in Belfast.Walker was an anti-Home Rule unionist who was a leader in the Belfast Independent Labour Partyin the early twentieth century.When James Connolly, Irelands most signicant historical, socialist republican leader called on the ILPs membership to support socialist unity in Ireland, his appeal provoked a rebuke from Walker.This led to a robust debate between both figures in the pages of Forward between May and July .Their debate came to be known as the Connolly Walker controversy and later became an historical reference point for the anti-imperialist struggle in Ireland.I participated in a  alongside veteran trade unionist Joe Bowers, Ulster Unionist councillor Chris Mc Gimpsey, and ICTU Assistant General Secretary, Owen Reidy, to discuss the post Walker years and the current situation in the north.Not surprisingly we delivered four very dferent perspectives on Walker and his legacy as well as, Brexit the north strategy and politics on the Left and, future prospects.A very challenging but fraternal debate ensued between the lists and the audience.I opened my comments by saying that any consideration today of William Walker’s legacy needs to be within the historic and contemporary reality that the advancement of socialist and Labour politics has been held back due to the effects of British colonial policy in Ireland.He was a product of his native Belfast and directly influenced by the communal environment within which he grew up.He was a protestant in a largely protestant workforce. Sectarianism in the late s and early s stalked Belfast.While Walker was severely limited in his political analysis he was committed to improving the conditions of his fellow workers.He is an integral part of Belfast’s industrial history and his contribution to the city’s labour heritage deserves recognition.British policy in Ireland and its consequences for Irish society has ided Irish workers along communal lines. It has paralysed the labour movement from effectively challenging partition and championing the strategic aim of Irish unity.Partition is the central fault line at the heart of Irish society and politics.Sectarianism remains a visceral blight in this state.Following partition, it was used by the ruling unionist elite to cement the foundation of the state and prevent unity among citizens on issues of common concern.The fact is Labour was indeed told to wait as the resurgent struggle for national independence grew in momentum just over  years ago.The counter revolution which took place post partition represented a strategic setback for labour and working-class interests in the new free state.It eclipsed the seminal influence which socialist republicanism had on the  Proclamation and the Democratic Programme of the First Dáil.The rights of workers became subservient to the conservative elites, north and south.However, sections of the labour movement were compliant with British policy in Ireland and the imposition of partition.That was personied in the political thinking of Walker and others pre partition.This tendency opposed Connollys core position that \"the two currents of revolutionary thought in Ireland, the socialist and the national, were not antagonistic but complementary\".Walkers debate with Connolly reflected a key contradiction inherent in the Irish labour movement and its relationship with the Irish national liberation struggle, and anti-imperialism generally.That contradiction has existed ever since.Walkers brand of ‘Municipal Socialism’ was in reality a euphemism for self-imposed strategic and political limitations which went on to define the Trade Union movement in the north.As a result, the Irish labour movement, particularly in the north has failed to challenge partition and modern British political policy towards Ireland.Partition has been an abject failure. It was never designed to make the northern state a political or economic success.From the beginning this state has carried within it the conditions of inherent instability.It was built upon institutionalised and structural sectarianism which ensured that a substantial minority was destined never to be treated as equals.The Civil Rights Movement fty years ago exposed the inability of the unionist state to treat the minority as equals.That belligerent opposition from powerful sections within political unionism against reform of the northern state persists today in the form of political unionism, and specically DUP hostility towards implementation of the Good Friday Agreementsince .Refusal by the DUP to embrace a rights-based society and equality, culminated in the collapse of the GFA political institutions in January , and our associated political crisis which has continued since then. Those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power-sharing.The party brand is now indistinguishable from financial scandal and sharp practice in government.As a party, the DUP is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic reforms, social modernity, and standards in public office.Its project is negative and tactical, and entirely focused upon slowing down and blocking progressive change, while maintaining a sectarian hegemony within the unionist constituency.The DUP is in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarian, homophobic and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists and many others, including sections of civic unionism, have concluded that the DUP has had its chance and cannot now be trusted in government.They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power at the risk of allowing it to continue practicing discrimination, intimidation, bigotry, or sharp practice.The enduring political crisis is accentuated by systemic structural weaknesses in the regional economy.The required investment in local public services and protection of workers’ rights are confronted with a combination of Tory austerity and Brexit.Pressures on public services are intensying.The regional block grant, or public expenditure settlement, has been reduced by .%.Real term cuts to public funding are now factored into future budget profiles alongside ·         Actual net cuts in take home pay for public and private sector workers·         Welfare cuts and the universal social charge·         Higher inflation and living costs, adults in working families live in relative povertyAverage wages in the north remain lower than ten years ago.Precarious working conditions, zero hours’ contracts, and the scam of bogus self-employment used by some employers are in common practice.Workers’ rights and protections are being systematically reversed.The onset of Brexit will be a catastrophe for the regional and island economiesIt will deepen an existing race to the bottom by further undermining the potential for economic growth, and new investment.The Brexit agenda, twinned with Tory austerity threaten jobs across all economic sectors, workers’ terms and conditions, and, any potential for sustainable public services in the north.The dawning political and economic reality is that Brexit has changed everything.It has exposed the negative role that partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentally anti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.  The British state has been pushed into an unprecedented, existential political crisis.Brexit is a train wreck being jointly steered by the DUP and extremists in the British Tory party.But it also has become a defining moment for these islands.A new generation is questioning partition.There has been a seismic sht in the ambitions and expectations of citizens in the north.A new political discourse has begun about the future of Ireland north and south, and our relationships with Britain and EuropeThe debate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have moved centre stage.The time has come for a fundamental paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.The Irish government needs to begin preparing constitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish Unity.It should facilitate an open, inclusive national conversation involving all citizens, political parties, social partners, and civic society.That is a dialogue about our collective future on this island which addresses all the concerns, accommodations and compromises relevant to negotiating a new, all Ireland, constitutional, pluralist democracy.Today this new focus upon Irish unity provides Irish trade unionists and workers with an opportunity to influence the debate about future constitutional and political change.Previous moments of political change have required that labour should wait.The emerging challenge for the Irish labour movement north and south is to engage with this emerging discussion.To paraphrase Connolly in his opening contributions to the Connolly Walker debate\"Constitutional change then is almost a certainty of the future.”The labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.I said to the Belfast conference this reality will require Irish trade unionists to take strategic positions on supporting an Irish unity referendum and then to campaign positively for constitutional change.On Monday of this week I reiterated that opinion when I met Patricia King, General Secretary of ICTU in Dublin.Of course, this will be a challenging discussion for the Irish labour movement, as comrades noted both during and after the plenary discussion. But it should not be feared or avoided.Today in modern Ireland there is a battle for hearts and minds about how society is organisedThe status quo has failed us all.Connolly’s vision of a united Ireland which serves the interests of the many instead of the few will not be wished into existence.Labour should not wait again.The Irish labour movement needs to assert itself on the Irish unity debate by introducing a progressive labour agenda to the unfolding discourse on future constitutional and political change.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27491  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe writer, newspaper editor and Irish republican Seumas O’Kelly was a native of Loughrea, County Galway. Author of short stories, plays, poems and a novel, The Weaver’s Grave which was his masterpiece, O’Kelly’s le was cut short because of his commitment to Irish freedom. The O’Kelly family of Loughrea were flour millers and merchants and Seumas received a good education. He was a fellow student of James Joyce in University College Dublin. There is a remarkable photograph of the BA degree class of  including Joyce, O’Kelly and George Clancy. Like O’Kelly, George Clancy, a close friend of Joyce, was to die a tragic death. He was Sinn Féin Mayor of Limerick when on  March  he was murdered in his home by the Black and Tans, on the same night as former Mayor Michael O’Callaghan. Seumas O’Kelly was a committed republican from an early age. He is recorded as one of those to the fore in the centenary commemorations of the  Rising in . He was writing for Arthur Grfith’s Irish Republican Brotherhood-funded newspaper The United Irishman from  and for its successor Sinn Féin from . While a full list of attendees is not available it is probable that he was at the founding meeting of Sinn Féin in November . In  O’Kelly was appointed editor of the Leinster Leader in Naas, County Kildare. He founded a branch of Conradh na Gaeilge in the town and was active in Sinn Féin locally. He welcomed republicans to his home during the annual Wolfe Tone commemorations in nearby Bodenstown. O’Kelly’s first book of stories was published in  and his first play was produced the following year. Several of his plays were produced at the Abbey Theatre. Constantly busy with literary and journalistic work, O’Kelly was subject to poor health. He joined Óglaigh na hÉireann when they were founded in  but was unable to play an active military role. His brother was a Volunteer and was jailed in England after the  Rising. The paper Nationality, edited by Grfith, was established in  and O’Kelly was one of its writers. It was the main organ of Sinn Féin during the  and  by-elections. In May  Grfith was arrested and jailed in England and O’Kelly took over as editor of Nationality. Following the  November  Armistice which ended the First World War, British soldiers and loyalists ran riot through the streets of Dublin, attacking suspected Sinn Féin supporters. On the night of  November a crowd of drunken soldiers invaded the Sinn Féin Ard Oig at  Harcourt Street . Seumas O’Kelly was at his desk in the Nationality office and tried to defend himself with his walking stick. The office was wrecked and O’Kelly collapsed. He was brought to Jervis Street Hospital where he died of a brain haemorrhage. Seumas O’Kelly was honoured with a republican funeral to Glasnevin Cemetery, attended by huge crowds.

In  the Women’s Social and Political Union was founded in England and the militant feminists commenced the battle for the vote. In Ireland there had been groups working for women’s suffrage but the campaign really began here on the instigation of Hanna Sheehy Skeffington and Margaret Cousins. Margaret Cousins came from a unionist family in Dublin but she later wrote: “I belonged in my heart from the beginning to the fighters for freedom.” Her husband James Cousins also rejected the unionism of his background and became involved in the Gaelic revival. Margaret came into contact with the women’s movement in England in . On herto Ireland she co-operated with a remarkable young woman who was to make her mark on Irish history. Hanna Sheehy was the daughter of a Fenian, David Sheehy, who took part in the  Rising and was elected as a Parnellite MP in . Hanna was an exceptional student and excelled academically despite the restrictions on women’s access to education she achieved a first class honours MA in . She became a teacher and married Francis Skeffington. In line with their shared feminist principles they adopted each other’s surnames. Francis resigned his post as registrar of University College because the authorities refused to register women on the same basis as men. In  Hanna and Margaret founded the Irish Women’s Franchise League , with the active support of both Francis Sheehy Skeffington and James Cousins. From the beginning they stressed that the IWFL would address the specic needs of Irish women in “a subject country seeking freedom from England” and would “work on independent Irish lines”. Margaret Cousins described the IWFL’s position: “Its policy was to educate by all forms of propaganda the men, women and children of Ireland to understand and support the members of the League in their demand for votes for women, and to obtain pledges from every Irish Member of Parliament to vote for Women’s Suffrage Bills introduced in the British Houses of Parliament, and to include Women’s Suffrage in any Irish Home Rule Bill.” The IWFL campaigned throughout the country and made an impact beyond their numbers of about  activists. Not all militant women agreed with the IWFL’s tactics the republican group Inghinidhe na hÉireann refused to join in lobbying the British parliament, preferring to “organise a women’s movement on Sinn Féin lines, or on lines even broader still”. Despite this dference, republican women such as Constance Markievicz played an active role in the IWFL’s work and Hanna Sheehy Skeffington herself was strongly republican. Markievicz urged young Irishwomen to prepare to fight: “Arm yourselves with weapons to fight your nation’s cause. Arm your souls with noble and free ideas. Arm your minds with the histories and memories of your country and her martyrs, her language, and a knowledge of her arts and industries. Andin your day the call should come for your body to arm, do not shirk from that either.” Markievicz said Irishwomen were “doubly enslaved with a double battle to fight”. Following the  general election the Irish Party at Westminster was in a position to press the Liberal government to publish a Home Rule Bill. But Redmond and his party still refused to support women’s right to vote. The IWFL became more militant and Hanna and Francis founded the Irish Citizen newspaper to further the cause of women’s rights as well as Irish independence, social justice and pacism. When British politicians visited Ireland they were challenged by the IWFL. Margaret ‘Meg’ Connery confronted British Tory leader Andrew Bonar Law and Unionist leader Edward Carson when they came to Dublin. In Belfast Hanna Sheehy Skeffington challenged Winston Churchill. Margaret Cousins joined protests in England in  and was jailed for a month. In June  eight women from the IWFL smashed windows in Dublin Castle and other prominent buildings. Hanna was arrested at the Castle and she and the seven others were imprisoned in Mountjoy. The following month British Prime Minister Asquith visited Dublin and there were more protests. Three English feminists had followed Asquith to Ireland and they were also jailed for their protests. After a hunger strike in Mountjoy by the English suffragists and the IWFL women, all were released except two of the Englishwomen who were subjected to forced feeding. Many meetings of the IWFL were physically attacked at this time by Redmondites who saw the campaign for women’s suffrage as a threat to their political dominance and their relationship with the British Liberal government. In contrast, republicans such as Pádraig Mac Piarais and Thomas MacDonagh were supporters of the IWFL. The IWFL also won the support of prominent trade unionists James Larkin and James Connolly. They were closely allied with the Irish Women Workers Union in Liberty Hall and in  Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed after a confrontation with the Dublin politan Police during the Great Lockout. She was released after a six-day hunger strike. That year also saw the death in England of feminist Emily Davison who ran on to the course at the Epsom Derby and was trampled by a race horse. Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed again in  for campaigning against recruitment to the British Army. Her influence and that of the IWFL was seen in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic of  which enshrined women’s right to vote. Her friend James Connolly told her: “You will be glad to know that in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic we are including equal citizenship for women.” Hanna replied that she knew who was responsible, meaning Connolly himself. “We were practically unanimous, Only one questioned it,” replied Connolly. Francis Sheehy Skeffington was murdered in Portobello Barracks by a British Army officer during the Easter Rising. Hanna embarked on a tour of the United States to expose the truth about the murder and other British atrocities. She continued to play a leading role in the struggle for Irish freedom, as did many of the pioneering feminists of the IWFL. In  the IWFL saw its central aim achieved when women voted for the first time in the general election which resulted in a massive Sinn Féin victory, although women under  were still excluded.

They must not be allowed to destroy the democratic option for making change in the north. - Declan Kearney MLAThe publication of an open letter to An Taoiseach, LeoVaradkar from over one thousand signatories in the Irish News is a powerfulintervention supporting the rights of Irish citizens in the north of Ireland. December that Irish citizens in the north “would never again be left behind by anIrish government”.These Irish citizens have explicitly urged Leo Varadkar toadhere to his expressed commitment from last year, “and to redouble yourefforts, and the efforts of your government to ensure that our rights areprotected”.Their intervention comes at a time of deepening politicalcrisis, and increased uncertainty and instability caused by the continueddenial of citizens’ rights, and the fast approaching Brexit catastrophe.This initiative indicates the frustration and anger amongrepublicans and nationalists and other progressive minded people about thedenial of rights here, and which are taken for granted where throughoutthese islands.It is outrageous that the northern state remains a rightsback water where language, marriage equality, womens reproductive health andlegacy justice rights, as well as a Bill of Rights are blocked.Northern nationalists are absolutely incensed with thecontinued denial of democracy and democratic rights.They are not prepared to put up with their Irish identitybeing treated with disrespect and contempt.Some of the signatories who have backed this highlysignicant intervention were active supporters of, and participants in theoriginal Civil Rights Movement  years ago.But many more are the children and grandchildren of those whocampaigned and marched in support of modest civil rights reforms and who werebeaten and shot off the streets and roads in the north because the unioniststate refused to deliver equality and rights.These citizens reflect the ersity, depth, confidence andstrength of those who identy as Irish citizens in the north.They represent tens of thousands of others in the north, andfrom right across Ireland, who have invested in the promise and ambition of theIrish Peace Process and Good Friday Agreement . They are articulatingthe voice of a progressive silent majority.However, they also persony a fundamental realignment withinnationalist and progressive opinion, including some sections of civic unionism.A new dangerous tipping point has been created in thepolitical process due to the destructive bigotry of the DUP the combinedefforts of both the DUP and British Government to systematically undermine theGFA, and to impose Brexit and, as a result of their toxic pact.The GFA guaranteed the delivery of equality, rights, parityof esteem and mutual respect.The DUP and others in political unionism have consistentlyopposed it from .Twenty years after the signing of the GFA it has still to befully implemented despite its status as an internationally binding agreement whichhas been laid with the United Nations.As a consequence, both the British and Irish Governments haveobligations as co-guarantors to ensure its implementation.However, the British Tory government turned its back on theGFA since it took power in .Now the DUP, British government and the most extreme elementsin political unionism are engaged in a full frontal assault against theAgreement. Brexit is the antithesis of the GFA.Its imposition will deepen the rights deficit in the northand will further destabilise the political process.That reality goes to the very heart of the existing politicalcrisis in the North, and which blocks the political institutions from beingre-established.A wreckers’ agenda is being driven by the DUP and Torygovernment. They must not be allowed to destroy the democratic option formaking change in the north.It is these circumstances which bring sharply into focus theIrish governments responsibilities.Those who courageously signed this letter to the Irish government are saying the negative position of the DUP and British governmentmust not be tolerated.These are citizens who want the political institutionsre-established but only on the basis of democracy and equality.They are assertive in their resolve to see a rights basedsociety created, which guarantees rights, respect, and parity of esteem, in ashared, inclusive future.But they are not prepared to be treated as second-classcitizens in this part of Ireland.Those days are over.It is time for the Irish Government to indeed redouble itsefforts to step up to the mark by absolutely opposing the imposition ofBrexit, and guaranteeing equality and rights for all citizens in the north.An Taoiseach and the Irish Government needs to reflect verycarefully about the signicance and timing of this intervention, respondpositively and act decisively, in cooperation with the politicalrepresentatives of Irish citizens, and others in the north, to ensure thattheir democratic rights are delivered upon.test"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8695614.1541521803!/image/image.jpg","title":"irish language group funding snub claim rejected by dup","story":"A DUP councillor has rejected claims that unionists #snubbed# a request to fund an Irish language event.Irish language group Conradh na Gaeilge submitted a request to Mid and East Antrim Council to fund an event as part of Seachtain na Gaeilge , which takes place each March.Sinn Fein councillor Patrice Hardy claimed unionist councillors had “refused to even countenance” the request, adding: “Seachtain na Gaeilge is a hugely positive, global event which this council should be supporting rather than snubbing. “The Irish language community aren’t seeking special treatment, they are only seeking equality.”Last year, Ms Hardy accused the council of being “anti-Irish to the core”, after a move to have the local authority participate in Irish Language Week was rejected following a vote by members. In a statement yesterday, she added: “Despite all the controversy over the previous refusal to fund Seachtain na Gaeilge or even to engage with the Irish language community to discuss this, it appears that some members of the council have learned nothing.”But DUP Councillor Gregg McKeen said Conradh na Gaelige had been treated “the same as any other group” who had made a funding request, by pointing them towards the council’s grants programme.He told the News Letter: “They will be assessed under the same criteria as everyone . It is not that they are being refused funding, but they need to go through the same process as everyone .

Boyle, Chief Executive of Ballymena Business Centre. The project is part funded by Invest Northern Ireland and the European Regional Development Fund under the Investment for Growth  Jobs Northern IrelandProgramme.I used to be a childminder and had two young children and didnrsquot think it was possible for me to get into the beauty business - but then I went back to college and studied beauty at the Roberta Mechan College, she said.I have a real interest in health and well-being and wanted to offer these services to others. I opened in April this year and I currently offer specialist skincare, nails, massage and waxing.Helen turned her dream into a reality after taking part in the Go For It Programme which is delivered free of charge by a team of experienced business mentors through Northern Irelandrsquos wide network of enterprise agencies.It provides expert advice and help with developing a robust business plan to help turn ideas into a commercial enterprise.Commenting on the success of the programme, Helen said: Often it is hard to know where to start that was my experience before starting the Go For It Programme. The support and guidance offered through it helped me fine tune my business idea from concept to working reality.They helped me with practical things in the early stages like setting out a business plan and doing a detailed analysis. It was great for helping me to budget and forward plan.ldquoI would urge anyone who has ever had the idea of starting up their own business, or evenyou have just started operating your own business to apply for a place on the Go For It Programme. The skills and knowledge imparted is beyond the realms of what you could achieve on your own.Melanie Christie Boyle, Chief Executive of Ballymena Business Centre, on behalf of Mid and East Antrim and Borough Council, added: ldquoHelen joined the Go For It Programme driven by a desire to launch her very own beauty business, driven by a passion to help women improve their skin and help them feel good about themselves.Helen undertook an intensive beauty course under tutelage of an industry expert with a clear vision and motivation to open her own salon as soon as she completed her examinations.We worked with Helen to develop a business plan, focusing on key areas such as defining her service provision, marketing and financial forecasting, as well as helping her secure commercial premises at Ballee and Harryville Community Enterprise Centre.It is great to see how Helen has progressed her business in such as short space of time, building a loyal customer base and a excellent reputation for her quality customer service and using only the very best range of products.If you have a business idea yoursquod like to develop oryou are thinking about starting a business call    or visit: visit www.goforitni.

The desire to produce the right deal can be superseded by the perceived need to produce a deal.This is why all negotiations need measures to prevent this, a check mechanism and preferably multiple ones.With the current UK-EU negotiations, there are two identiable check mechanisms or lines of defence to concluding an unwise agreement - Cabinet and Parliament.Last week, I wrote to the Prime Minister outlining broad concerns about the direction of travel.This could be discerned from shts in public comments, private engagements and what was being briefed in London, Dublin and Brussels. I wrote in the hope of reassurance and with the desire that an acceptable deal for us all was within grasp. Instead, I received confirmation that we were right to be concerned.If what is outlined in the reply is the type of deal the Prime Minister intends to conclude, then the DUP could not support a deal which annexes Northern Ireland from the rest of the United Kingdom.Indeed, many others in Westminster and throughout the United Kingdom, true to their commitments to respect the referendum, the national interest and to the Union, have contacted me to voice their concern.Equally we cannot be assured that this current proposal will be the final deal. The European Union price for agreement appears to rise daily whether it be our fishing industry or an ever growing list of level playing field commitments.Last December when this backstop appeared we were deeply concerned. This is why we sought and got the paragraph  assurance of a democratic protection against a sea border.In March, the EU made clear its intention to ignore paragraph  and rewrite paragraph . We took no solace from our predictions being correct but we did take solace that it was universally rejected.Neither the passage of time nor the application of pressure has made it any more acceptable now.The new idea of a UK customs arrangement does not appear to be a genuinely UK-wide offer but a GB offer and an NI offer badged as one - Northern Ireland in THE EU customs territory and GB in A customs union.The real intent is not to solve any land border issues in Ireland but to handcuff the UK to the EU, with the EU holding the keys. The United Kingdom would be trapped.The focus on customs arrangements should never blind anyone to a sea border of regulations.We certainly did not forget it and why we raised it repeatedly and consistently.It was something the Prime Minister ruled out after Salzburg: \"…no new regulatory barriers should be created between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK unless the Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly agree.\"The limited and low level checks that exist at the moment in Belfast and Larne do not compare to what wo uld be the future arrangement.Key industries in Northern Ireland would be subject to rules and standards with no democratic input to them. Rules would be made in Brussels rather than Stormont or Westminster.The regulatory sea border with some caveats in the Prime Ministers letter is still a sea border.This is not haggling about checks but preventing Northern Ireland from being left in the EU with the Northern Ireland Assembly reduced to vassal status or the devolution settlement torn up.Our most important trade flows are to be hampered and regulated by the EU. Despite all of this a Northern Ireland specic backstop still remains.The Scottish Conservative MP Ross Thomson has rightly warned: \"…Northern Ireland would erge unconsciously from the United Kingdom against the expressed will of its people - it would also feed Scottish nationalist demands that a similar ergent arrangement be made for Scotland.\"The DUP does not stand alone against this proposal. We appreciate the support from MPs across the United Kingdom.We are ready to stand with those in Cabinet and in Parliament to work for a better deal. One which works for the whole United Kingdom. We want the referendum result to be respected and the entire United Kingdom to leave together with a sensible deal.Arlene Foster is leader of the DUP"},{"url":null,"title":"ballymurphy massacre inquest difficulties exacerbated by loss of records","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHomes  InteriorsSeptember CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

In the mid s Timely was known as Atlas Comics and Lee was writing romance, Westerns, sci fi and horror.That all changed at the end of the decade when a DC Comic editor revived the superhero archetype with an updated version of The Flash and later with the Justice League Of America.In response, Lee was tasked with creating a new superhero team, prompting him and artist Jack Kirby to create the Fantastic Four, based on Kirby’s previous Challengers Of The Unknown.The radical story of reluctant superheroes whose powers are forced upon them broke the mould and was immediately popular and led to the creation of the Hulk, Thor, Iron Man and the X-Men, as well as Daredevil with Bill Everett and Doctor Strange and Spider-Man with Ditko.Lee and Kirby grouped some of the characters into The Avengers, reviving the Sub-Mariner and Captain America.His influence also extended to the introduction of a credit  for each story, naming not just the writer and penciller but the inker and letterer.He wrote a monthly column called Stan’s Soapbox, which often addressed issues of discrimination and prejudice and churned out promotional copy often signed off with his trademark motto Excelsior!In  he stopped writing monthly comic books to assume the role of publisher and later became a figurehead and public face for Marvel Comics, appearing at conventions and lecturing at colleges.He continued to write, launching the Spider-Man newspaper comic strip with John Romita Sr in  and producing The Savage She-Hulk with John Buscema in .In  he moved to Calornia to develop Marvel’s TV and film properties and occasionally ed to comic book writing and in  he set up POW!Entertainment to develop more projects.In  Marvel commemorated his  years with the company by publishing a series of comics starring Lee meeting many of his co-creations including Spider-Man, Doctor Strange and Silver Surfer.At Comic-Con International in , Marvel Legends introduced a Stan Lee action figure and in  comic convention Comikaze Expo was rebranded as Stan Lee’s Comikaze presented by POW! Entertainment.In August  he confirmed another of the shows created by him, Lucky Man, which stars James Nesbitt, wouldto air on Sky in  for a third series.Earlier in the month he also shared a picture of himself and actor Chadwick Boseman, the star of the  Black Panther film due for release in , which is based on the comic book of the same name.Lee’s career was not without controversy though. Ditko claims Lee had only the bare bones of an idea for Spider-Man and in fact he was the one who made the character what it is today.Until he died in , Kirby claimed Lee was a fraud and it was he who had the ideas for their most beloved characters, including the Hulk, Thor and Iron Man.He also faced financial obstacles when his internet-based superhero studio Stan Lee Media filed for bankruptcy. The company was later sold and it ultimately filed a lawsuit against Marvel, Lee and POW! Entertainment and its subsidiary.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Stan Lee addresses fans at Stan Lee’s Comikaze Expo on Saturday, Sept. ,  in Los Angeles.

Those responsible have branded by the local politician as ldquogrossly irresponsible.Cllr Curran described those who engage in such behaviour as ldquoselfless, reminding them that they are guilty of an environmental crime by dumping their waste in unauthorised areas.There are a number of illegal dumping hot spots across the district with the Downpatrick councillor suggesting the mentality of those responsible is particularly dficult to fathom.ldquoI cannot understand why people do not make use of household waste centres in Downpatrick, Castlewellan and Ballynahinch, declared Cllr Curran.ldquoThe mentality of those who dump waste along rural roads is beyond me. What puzzles me most is that people who engage in this activity end up paying for its removal through their rates bills. They are literally costing themselves money, but that does not appear to register with them.Cllr Curran said there was no excuse for illegal dumping as there were so many ways for people to dispose of their waste legally and safely.ldquoFly tipping and illegal dumping results in a blot on the landscape and is an image no one wants to see. I firmly believe that those responsible for despicable behaviour should feel the full force of the law, otherwise this activity will continue, he warned.ldquoIllegal waste can range from bin bags dumped at the side of the road to old household furniture, rubble or old trees. For a modest fee, bulk waste can be collected outside peoplersquos homes.ldquoFor the le of me I do not understand why people are prepared to load up their vehicles and drive to secluded, rural areas to get rid of household waste. Why not just drive to one of the three household centres in our district Cllr Curran said local council officials were placing increasing emphasis on promoting the district as a major tourist destination and the last thing they wanted to see was roads littered with waste.He added: ldquoThe message must go out that illegal dumping is unacceptable and that the countryside and indeed town centres must be respected, not used as open air dumps by people who should know better.ldquoWe are fortunate to live in a stunningly beautul area which should not be blighted by the reprehensible actions of a mindless few.

Cushendall are expected to lt the Ulster crown for a record-breaking th time. They have an abundance of experienced players in Carl Carson, Sean Delargy, Neil McManus, Eoghan Campbell, Ryan McCambridge, Donal Naughton and Paddy McGill, but they know they are in for one heck of a scrap on Sunday.If Ballycran can come up with a plan for depriving Carson, McManus, Campbell, Naughton and McGill of the sliothar, then they are in with a shout, but that is easier said than done, given the experience in the Cushendall set-up.One thing that is certain is that Ballycran will give it their all, but some times that is just not enough.Meanwhile, Burrenrsquos bid to recapture their glory days in Ulster is over for another year following their - to - defeat to Scotstown in their provincial SFC quarter-final in Newry on Sunday.Burren trailed - to - at the break, but a stirring second half display saw them give the Monaghan kingpins a run for their money.

Delamont Country Park offers huge potential and re-establishing a network of community trails is an exciting proposal which we hope will come to fruition, he said.ldquoThe response from the public to have its say on the future of the park was brilliant and thanks to everyone who took the time to take part in what was a very worthwhile event.

Projected as three-screens, the film was cleverly edited to juxtapose the ying yellow line constructions, from the scouts lining up their yellow kayaks to the farmers forming their line of yellow bales.With the use of dramatic aerial shots, the formation of the yellow lines could be seen clearly as they cut through the landscape, representing both the Border and itrsquos people. The film received great response from the audience participants as they witnessed the powerful result of their involvement.With lsquoAcross and In-Between,rsquo Suzanne Lacy highlights the wit and cleverness of Border le in the face of political pressures, focusing on the power of play in creatively responding to complex issues.Suzanne commented: ldquoOur project draws those who live along the often-invisible boundaries between countries into a conversationmdashmetaphoric and literal ndash on personal and symbolic meanings of this border and by extension all such borders drawn by political forces.ldquoThe artwork explores inverse paradigms: visible and invisible, official and unofficial, rural and urban, the real border and imagined ones.

If they succeed, this would automatically mean more barriers to trade with the EU, including across the Irish border, she stated.Dr Hayward agreed that the Mrs Fosterrsquos argument against any sort of backstop was ldquoperfectly reasonable as it is not ldquothe intended destination. But she still argues that it is of ldquocritical importance.. It is the issue over which the whole Withdrawal Agreement could collapse, leaving all of us in the mire of a lsquoNo Dealrsquo outcome.ldquoIt is therefore very important that all judgements of the backstop are based on a clear and accurate understanding of what it actually means, unclouded by hyperbole.And it is in relation to the backstop where Dr Hayward, who is a Fellow in the Senator George J. Mitchell Institute for Global Peace, Security and Justice, took most issue with Mrs Foster analysis:ldquoFoster claims that Northern Irelandrsquos access to the UK single market would be restricted. In actual fact this is entirely in the hands of the British government ndash it is a domestic issue unrelated to UK-EU negotiations, the Queens Reader asserted, before adding:ldquoSecondly, Foster says that lsquoEU access, comes with the requirement for Northern Ireland to fully adopt and implement EU regulations with no changesrsquo. But it is not necessary to have full regulatory alignment with the EU in order to have tarf free access to its market. That would be like saying wed have to have all our laws imposed by Beijingwe are to get tarf-free access to China.Dr Hayward does however admit that major ergence would require an operational backstop:ldquoThat said,the UK erges widely from the lsquocommon rulebookrsquo of the EUrsquos single market, it would not be possible for goods produced in Northern Ireland to have free movement around the single market as is currently the case. It would be in just such an instance that the backstop could come into play. This would not mean that all EU laws would apply in Northern Ireland but rather that goods produced here could be considered to be of EU standardcertain procedures are followed.In her opinion piece last week Mrs Foster stated that:ldquoFree Trade Agreements donrsquot just cover regulation but tarfs too. This would require not just being in the single market but in the customs union. In other words, a total sea Border descending between Northern Ireland and its largest market, Great Britain.Dr Hayward does not agree however and says ldquothere is absolutely no prospect of a total sea border under any scenario.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Located on Pearse Street right beside Trinity College in the heart of Dublin city, it made the perfect location to for the tour, with quirky and fascinating décor and superbly stylish and comfy rooms to retreat to after a day’s exploration.After unpacking, we progressed to the veranda, mixing with guests from all over the island. The atmosphere was relaxed and friendly and boded well for dinner in the Courtyard Restaurant, which included ham hock, blackberry sorbet, and a iety of cheeses and enjoyable wines.Of particular note was the delicious freshly baked bread, the creme brulee and the sirloin and the craic was good with a friendly and cosmopolitan mix of guests.After a very comfortable night, the breakfast was also top class, albeit, for once you are recommended not to try everything as one is typically tempted to, leaving room for the gourmet tour ahead.With the advent of cheap air travel in the s, however, came easy access to the cuisine of France and Italy and a real revolution began the strengths of top quality Irish ingredients then began to be married to the Latin flair and creativity,Our guide for the day was likeable foodie historian and former chef Chris Binchy. Starting in the heart of Trinity University campus, he gave a fascinating talk on the evolution of Irish cuisine. Our parents and their parents, he noted, would have enjoyed a pretty nutriotious but plain diet which ied little from week to week. Originally dominated by dairy produce, as Irish society was organised around cattle, the arrival of the French Normans in the th century brought a dferent type of agriculture and cultivation of crops.Dairy products, oats, fruit and root vegetables, cabbage, bacon, eggs and chicken were later added to with scones, tarts and pastries.With the advent of cheap air travel in the s, however, came easy access to the cuisine of France and Italy and a real revolution began the strengths of top quality Irish ingredients then began to be married to the Latin flair and creativity, giving what is today the st century foodie haunts across the city. Consequently, our first stop was a dedicated cheese shop, Sheridans, where we were entertained and informed by a true French man, who took care to extol the virtues of a wide range of new Irish cheeses made in the French style, all of which were passed around with crackers to sample.Next up was Powerscourt Shopping Centre, what was traditionally a wide open quadrangle in the centre of classic four storey Georgian buildings, but has been transformed into a charming indoor shopping complex, the central feature of which is the glass roof.A centre of all things ‘design’, we were treated to scones and cream from the Pepper Pot, which has a pedigree in custom baked breads and bagels, with a cult following among locals. They serve six dferent breads, all baked daily, which form the centre of all their dishes. Who knew Irish cream is dferent to English cream - clotted and not whipped with no sugar it is delicious enough without anything added, we were informed. DUP leader and Dublin minister both mark WWI carnage Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Next up was the Loose Canon, deliberately named after a colourful cleric. Specialising in natural cheeses, which were delicious, we also sampled a range of delicate parma-style hams, some of which were produced at Ballycastle and have a revered following in Dublin on account of the quality produce. For a change of pace we then popped into a traditional Victorian pub, the Swann, however this was a pub with a dference. It is ‘the’ rugby pub of Dublin, traditionally favoured by touring players the night before games - in the amateur era at least. It was run by legendary Ireland and Lions prop, Sean Lynch. Now run by his son Ronan, Sean still pulls the odd pint behind the bar and the rugby memorabilia on the walls is worth studying.This was followed by a trip to George’s street arcade, filled with ‘boho’ stalls and second hand bookshops, where we stopped at Lolly and Cooks for ‘Savage Rolls’ in Dublin the word ‘savage’ means ‘great’ and boy did these sausage rolls deserve the label. As big as your fist, they were as delicious as the meat loaf my mother used to make. Our last stop was the Temple Bar food market, which is even a hidden gem even to many Dubliners. As you enter, you may hear passionate yells from the acting school a few floors up, while a kaleidoscope of smells invade your senses.First up we tried the fresh oysters and the Temple Oyster Bar - surprisingly delicious. After that we moved onto the Market Kitchen, a food stall with a dference their menu on any morning depends on what all the speciality stalls around them are selling that day. We had sourdough with tahini and pumpkin puree, kale and chilli - out of this world! An interesting and worthwhile tour for visiting friends or family, stag and hen weekends or business trips. * Including overnight accommodation with breakfast and a Fab Food Trail, prices start from £ per room based on two people sharing.

Knowing this, John gave up his teaching course and took a full time job at the boatyardhellipand the rest is history.Mr Freemantle moved from Penarth and started his own boat building workshop in South Clive Street in  with British Road Services ndash now National Freight Consortium.In , the business was expanded and relocated to a greenfield site within Cardf Marina, which is now the exact location of Bayscape.The boat yard at the time stored around - boats. Long before the Cardf Bay Barrage was built, the water was tidal and boats moored in the middle of the river.As there was no road to the marina, Mr Freemantlebuilt a track to enable him to get to and from the boat yard. In  he put pontoons for the boats and laid the first cement for the slipway which was all created by Mr Freemantles own hands.In  the Freemantlesset their sights on retiring and sold the boat yard - which had grown to storing more than  boats - to a family friend of their business partner who used to visit the boat yard as a child. And so Bayscape began.One day the couple were walking along the waterrsquos edge and looked across to see the unique development taking shape in the exact spot of Mr Freemantles beloved boat yard, where  years previously they brought in the original electrics, telephone line and water. The couple decided to move back to where they had spent many happy years.Mrs Freemantlesaid: ldquoWe love living here, it feels really safe and therersquos a great sense of community.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community.

Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The charity is calling for the loophole to be closed as part of its Roads to Justice campaign, which says an urgent review should be carried out.Currently,a driver can convince a magistrate that they, or an innocent party, will face lsquoexceptional hardshiprsquo as a result of losing their licence they may be permitted to keep it.The latest figures show there are almost , drivers across Great Britain who have retained their licences despite passing the points limit, some with more than  or  points.In the Vale of Glamorgan the highest number of points received by one driver who is still allowed to drive is .John Bache, chairman of the Magistrates Association, said added: ldquoThe process for establishing exceptional hardship is robust ndash magistrates scrutinise every case very carefully.A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: ldquoThe vast majority of drivers who get  penalty points are automatically disqualied. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Mrs Prancersquos husband, Clive, died at  from kidney cancer at the Marie Curie Cardf and Vale Hospice in August , and Mrs Prance said the support she and her husband received was invaluable. She has since raised more than pound, for the charity through tea parties held on her street.Day therapy healthcare assistant Maggie Whitfield also took part in the event, while Jean Round travelled from Swansea to take part having supported the charity for a number of years.Hospice ambassador Mariclare Carey-Jones also took on the challenge for the charity. She is set to take part in her second overseas trek for the charity next year to Vietnam, with husband Dave.Hannah Leckie, community fundraiser for Cardf and the Vale, said: ldquoThank you so much to everyone who conquered the coals to raise vital funds for Marie Curie and those who turned out to support everyone taking part.ldquoEvents like this are essential in helping us continue to raise vital funds to provide care and support for people when they need it most.Cakes were donated for the event by Memory Lane Cakes at the Finsbury Food Group, while Sue from Burger Palace had hot dogs and burgers cooking for participants and their supporters throughout the night.The amount raised from the event is still being counted up.Marie Curie provides round-the-clock care and support to people living with a terminal illness, and their families at its hospice on Bridgeman Road in the town.The charity also provides a Hospice at Home service and has a team of clinical nurse specialists in the Vale who provide support such as symptom control and pain management.To find out how you can get involved in challenges and fundraising for Marie Curie, visit www.mariecurie.org.uk get-involved. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

Boyle, Chief Executive of Ballymena Business Centre. The project is part funded by Invest Northern Ireland and the European Regional Development Fund under the Investment for Growth  Jobs Northern IrelandProgramme.I used to be a childminder and had two young children and didnrsquot think it was possible for me to get into the beauty business - but then I went back to college and studied beauty at the Roberta Mechan College, she said.I have a real interest in health and well-being and wanted to offer these services to others. I opened in April this year and I currently offer specialist skincare, nails, massage and waxing.Helen turned her dream into a reality after taking part in the Go For It Programme which is delivered free of charge by a team of experienced business mentors through Northern Irelandrsquos wide network of enterprise agencies.It provides expert advice and help with developing a robust business plan to help turn ideas into a commercial enterprise.Commenting on the success of the programme, Helen said: Often it is hard to know where to start that was my experience before starting the Go For It Programme. The support and guidance offered through it helped me fine tune my business idea from concept to working reality.They helped me with practical things in the early stages like setting out a business plan and doing a detailed analysis. It was great for helping me to budget and forward plan.ldquoI would urge anyone who has ever had the idea of starting up their own business, or evenyou have just started operating your own business to apply for a place on the Go For It Programme. The skills and knowledge imparted is beyond the realms of what you could achieve on your own.Melanie Christie Boyle, Chief Executive of Ballymena Business Centre, on behalf of Mid and East Antrim and Borough Council, added: ldquoHelen joined the Go For It Programme driven by a desire to launch her very own beauty business, driven by a passion to help women improve their skin and help them feel good about themselves.Helen undertook an intensive beauty course under tutelage of an industry expert with a clear vision and motivation to open her own salon as soon as she completed her examinations.We worked with Helen to develop a business plan, focusing on key areas such as defining her service provision, marketing and financial forecasting, as well as helping her secure commercial premises at Ballee and Harryville Community Enterprise Centre.It is great to see how Helen has progressed her business in such as short space of time, building a loyal customer base and a excellent reputation for her quality customer service and using only the very best range of products.If you have a business idea yoursquod like to develop oryou are thinking about starting a business call    or visit: visit www.goforitni. try catch     .               ..

Butwe can’t identy and shame offenders then there may be no alternative.”On the other side of the argument it was pointed out: “It’s not fair to ban all dog walkers for the minority that can’t pick up after their dogs although I can see your point, we bring our wee dog up and you literally have to watch every step the pitch is covered! Absolutely disgusting.”Another said: “Likely it’s few spoiling it for the many but it’s a rugby club not a dog walking club, anddog mess in wounds results in an infection or even an amputationthen it’s the right decision, especially when s of kids train and play there as well as the seniors.”It’s not an uncommon problem. The pitches in Lurgan Park have long been a favoured spot for dog walkers, and again while the majority appear to be responsible and picking up after their pooches there are a few who have turned the area into a pooh minefield.‘Eventful weekend’ for policeFamily escape injury following arson attack at house Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"For players it adds an extra level of ‘danger’ to the sliding tackle but even dog walkers are having to watch their step.One regular walker there said: “You really do have to watch your step on the pitches.

A national debate which “we have been swept up in”, he says.While he says there remain serious issues which leave his business, and the rest of Northern Ireland, in the dark, far from seeing the port’s proximity with the border – in fact much of the mass of water is in the Republic – as a negative, Brian believes it could positively position it following Brexit.“We are unique as we are both a UK and European port, which is a fantastic opportunity with Brexit coming up.“We are talking to the City Deal people, the UK and Irish governments along with Donegal.“I think we, along with others, particularly, have an opportunity… there are dficulties we could face, especially with a no deal. We are pleased we can articulate our concerns and still hopefully have practical solutions.“Even in a ‘no deal’ scenario, where we are located, there will need to be good relations. Around %commute from Donegal. They will still need to do that.“In a paradox, it does bring some benefits. We have benefits with this Atlantic gateway – it is under-used, and can be utilised in a way to straddle the border. We are speaking about how we can join the dots.”Brian says the port has been working with Donegal County Council, over plans for its new cruise ship terminal at Greencastle. “We have the ability to import materials into the Irish side in the case of a hard Brexit. It wouldn’t take a huge amount of investment to make that happen.“There’s another dimensioninfrastructure capacity. We have a lot of things in place which is strong.“We have deep water available, and have access to probably the biggest land bank in the British Isles.“Project Kelvin  – the high-speed trans-Atlantic fibre-optic cable connection – runs right past our offices. We have over MW of power right beside us. In terms of the building blocks for basic industrial development, they are all in place.“In effect, a ‘no deal’ hard Brexit would be the ultimate impact… it means additional bureaucracy, would cost our port customers time and money, and might make them look at alternative ports to bring material in.“We are not insulated form the operational side of things. Materials coming in from the rest of the world. What could be an extreme in this, ultimately, it might mean, bringing in two million tonnes a year, % from Europe – that % could be subject to tarfs, or a lot of bureaucracy.”Laying it all out, the key concern ishuge bulk cargo – such as grain or animal feed – has to be ‘unitised’ into separate lorry loads, which require single certication each time.“It could create a fairly substantial bureaucracy around the logistics. That’s the very worst situation.”But business is good. Brian says the port employs  staff directly, but around , indirectly.“The numbers we put out in turnover are really strong, but they are modest in a sense that they don’t reflect the impact of what we do,” he says.“Percentage-wise, it’s mostly about the job creation that comes into the regional economy. “We have reinvested £m in the last few years, have a £m asset base and handle about £.bn in commodities a year.”In the other corner, Brian’s closely involved in Derry’s bid for a City Deal, similar to that submitted by six councils, including Belfast, last month.“We are working really closely with the infrastructure around the City Deal. There are two strands – there is the innovation, which is being led by Ulster University, and there is the infrastructure, which we will be playing a fairly central role in.”So, back to Brexit. What will Brian and his team be doing on the morning of March   “As much as you can do, we will continue as normal,” he said.“We have a number of preparedness scenarios. We are as prepared as I think we can be.“We could be prepared, but log jamsare beyond our control. “I don’t hear anyone talking up, or looking for a no deal outcome. I think Northern Ireland businesses have articulated itvery well, and we are punching above our weight.”The biggest issue is whereby a customer could look to moving where, thus moving trade away from the north west, Brian says.Looking back almost two and half years ago, and examining the current landscape today – whereby the UK is set to leave both the customs union and single market – Brian says: “I would have stayed in the customs union and single market. Our strategy has been to defend and grow – why would anyone want to turn away from the biggest customer base “I am not critical of people who wanted to leave the EU – but the way it has been done has not exactly been helpful. “What we see, in my own personal interpretation, when we talk to politicians, particularly from the UK, that the decision to leave the EU was made onof immigration.“That is what took us on the path. There’s then the second thought of the Irish question. If you can solve the issue for Derry, you can solve it for Dover. I don’t think that was considered when the case for leaving on immigration.“We have been swept up in an alternative, national debate – not something relevant for us.”And what’s next for the port  Brian says it’s been through three successful strategies, so far, in terms of expanding the growth.“It’s about leveraging in the coreand selling out the additional capacity to other capacities.“For example, in our marine, we invested in vessels – dredgers.

Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub, run in partnership with Catalyst Inc, is a stunning, modern incubator and hub which will see dozens of entrepreneurs and start-up businesses shape and craft their ideas in the heart of Danske Bank’s own Belfast city centre headquarters. The partnership with Catalyst Inc makes a lot of sense, as it already plays host to dozens of knowledge-based businesses across  acres in the Titanic Quarter, and the Innovation Centre in Londonderry. Vicky Davies is managing director of strategy and corporate development at Danske Bank. “We have a clear ambition to be the best bank in Northern Ireland, and we plan to do that by making more possible for our customers, employees, stakeholders and society”, she says. It’s that message, ‘Making more possible’, that adorns the wall of one of the main meeting rooms in the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub. “Banking is changing so fast. It’s relentless in terms of new entrants, innovation and the level of new fintech money coming into the industry.” “We know we need to change at pace, or face being left behind.” “We needed a partner in this venture, and we were looking for someone with reach and expertise,” she said. Following an initial meeting last year with senior management at Catalyst Inc, Vicky says there was an immediate mutual connection, and they went from there. “They have the expertise in running a space like this, and we have access to banking and business expertise – with both of us having great experience in helping businesses to grow. So, every dimension we looked at – it was a really good fit.” The hub is an impressive space, awash with splashes of colour, connectivity, co-working spaces and meeting rooms – including a nod to Princess Leia with an image on a wall – and it is able to play host to around - entrepreneurs and business start-up professionals, with top end cable and fibre internet connections. It’s further evidence of Danske Bank ensuring it’s well ahead of the pack and out in front. It’s about bringing a business from an embryonic start-up, to a thriving company, helping lead the way in its sector. But for Danske, this isn’t all about the bottom line. It’s about creating a thriving hub for the future stars of Northern Ireland’s burgeoning tech sector. And it’s a two-way street – with the bank aiming to learn as much from the start-up businesses nestled in the top-end spacious ground-floor hub, as the other way around. So, what does this mean for Danske Bank in terms of business banking and as an institution further bolstering its credentials in the digital space. Richard Caldwell is managing director of personal banking and small business. “We want to be part of the local fintech journey. We want to help influence and develop ideas,” he says. “There are more than , businesses in Northern Ireland, and we want to continue to support start-ups in general – by putting expertise and support into this partnership, we will help this particular set of small businesses to grow in what is a burgeoning sector.” “Ultimately, real success for us would be seeing products brought to market, and helping businesses grow from an embryonic idea, through to start-up, growth and expansion. With the business maybe ending up as one of our loyal corporate customers in the future.” Richard says research showed that many of Danske Bank’s existing bigger business customers wanted the bank to provide “something more tangible” for start-ups, to grow companies for the future. Although tenants in the new fintech space don’t necessarily have to bank with Danske, the Bank does offer banking support, including everything from a current account, to receiving assistance from a growth adviser to support them with their banking needs. gt “This is a major investment for us,” Richard says. “This is one of the most expensive ground-floor retail premises in Belfast, and we have devoted it to this hub. This is front and centre in the heart of Belfast.” The location of the new hub couldn’t be better – with the new Glider bus linking the hub to Catalyst Inc headquarters in Titanic Quarter. And, as modern tech businesses evolve and reach out to new markets and time zones across the globe, there is also  hour access to the Fintech Hub. The hub has a team of four, two from Danske Bank and two newly recruited by Catalyst Inc. Together Danske Bank and Catalyst Inc have also launched a new online  to help the wider growing number of start-up businesses across Northern Ireland to connect with investors, peers and potential new recruits across Europe - thehub.io helps connect start-ups to relevant resources, such as talent, networks, financing, tools and advice from experts which will help them overcome some of the challenges of scaling up. It is clear that strategically this is a big push by both organisations to play a key supporting role through the provision of both physical and online resources. Digitalisation Richard is keen to point out support for the hubs is just part of a bank-wide digital transformation agenda at Danske. “For example, we want to change the nature of traditional relationship management at the Bank. In addition to managing traditional banking needs as we have always done so well, we are now moving into the added value space. As well as the human touch, customers increasingly want top notch digital solutions to make their lives easier, to give them ease of access and quicker credit decisions.” The digitally-savvy way of thinking is giving Danske Bank competitive advantage, and that is from an already well-established position in the market. Last year they appointed a chief digital officer, who is a member of the Bank’s executive committee. “Our people are still our best asset and will remain so,” Richard said. “We have great people. And customers still highly value that human touch and expert advice. But what the journey looks like for transactions, well we have digital solutions for everything. For your payments, wages, drawing direct debits or paying suppliers. “Right now we are piloting and rolling out digital credit decisions for business customers. This is transforming the credit journey for both our customers and our business relationship managers. For example, one customer recently applied for an overdraft through the digital credit solution and got approval and the funds in their account in  minutes.” Danske Bank was the first of the local Northern Ireland banks to bring in app banking, and solutions such as Samsung Pay, Fitbit Pay and Garmin Pay. And this new Fintech Hub is very much another stride forward. The bank is also leading the pack when it comes to customer satisfaction, right across businesses of all shapes and sizes. “For some time now we have been the market leader in business banking. Research continues to show that our customer satisfaction scores are first for large business, and first for small business,” Richard said. Both Vicky and Richard are keen to see what they predict will be short and long-term benefits from the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub. There’s an organic osmosis, allowing ideas to flow freely between the Danske Bank people visiting from upstairs and those entrepreneurs which it hosts on the ground floor. “The entrepreneurs in the hub bring a fresh mindset, one we can learn from as we continue our own digital journey throughout the bank,” Vicky says. Richard added: “The fintech sector is seen in many quarters as a challenger to traditional banks, but we are embracing it and feel we can grow with it, to the benefit of our customers.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Riccc.jpg","title":"ni house prices outpace uk market","story":"Posted on Wednesday November  by John Mulgrew RICS residential property spokesman, Samuel Dickey Northern Ireland homes have avoided a UK-wide dip in prices, according to a new survey. The latest RICS and Ulster Bank Residential Market Survey shows a larger proportion of surveyors pointing to a rise in the average cost of a home. That was a higher level than anywhere  in the UK, during October. It says that “Northern Ireland surveyors are also the most optimistic, looking forward. A net balance of % expects prices to rise in the three months ahead, while a net balance of % expects the number of sales to increase in the same timeframe. Most other regions expect prices and sales activity to fall or be broadly flat in the final quarter”. In terms of supply, the survey pointed to a slight rise in properties coming onto the market in Northern Ireland for the first time in five months. RICS residential property spokesman, Samuel Dickey said: “Interest from first time buyers and a strong rental have been two of the factors driving the Northern Ireland housing market, with first time buyers and investors both very active this year. “Surveyors remain confident about the market, despite political and economic uncertainty, and  is shaping up to have been a more positive picture for the housing market than perhaps was initially anticipated.” Terry Robb, head of personal banking at Ulster Bank, said: “As the survey indicates, demand remains relatively strong and we continue to see a good-pipeline of mortgage applications. “Our new paperless mortgage process has generated interest but more fundamentally, interest in the market remains firm from a broad range of mortgage purchasers including first time buyers, home movers and those remortgaging.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/albion_1.jpg","title":"new apartment building for belfast city centre","story":"Posted on Monday  November  by John Mulgrew  A new £m apartment building could be built in Belfast city centre amid early development plans, Ulster Business can reveal. The Albion scheme could see the redevelopment of an area off Great Victoria Street, currently a car park, turned into a “multiple unit residential development for rental or sale”. The area is located at Wellwood Street, and bounded by Glenalpin and Norwood Street. Those behind the scheme, which could be worth around £m, say around  construction jobs would be created at the peak of the build. A pre-application event is due to take place at the nearby Holiday Inn on November . Ciaran Deazley, project architect from Like Architects said: \"The Albion development seeks to provide a landmark building for inner city living. It has been designed as two buildings connected by a landscaped square, the high quality brick and glass facade will bring a contemporary presence and vibrancy to the area.\" It’s one of several major schemes under way across the city. Elsewhere, McAleer  Rushe wants to build a nine to -storey building, to include around  apartments, and  car park spaces.
