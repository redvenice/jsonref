The fire was still burning on Thursday morning (pictured)          Those who had not been evacuated said they heard a loud bang and saw smoke rising from the building site where the bomb was found overnight           Before officers began trying to defuse the bomb, disposal experts had warned there was a 5050 change it would go off because the detonator had become embedded in the deviceIt is not believed that any bomb disposal experts were near the device when the blaze started and no injuries were reported. Unexploded bombs and mines are discovered so frequently in Germany that the country has a dedicated squad - the Kampfmittelbeseitigungsdienst, or War Ordinance Disposal Service - which defuses a device every two weeks on average. The fire was still burning around the bomb at midday on Thursday with an extinguisher robot being used to cool the device down.Police said helicopters were being used to coordinate the cooling and experts would only move back in once the bomb was deemed safe.Downtown Hong Kong is sealed off and 1,200 people evacuated...Detonation of WWII bomb discovered near London City Airport...Share this articleAround 8,700 people who were ordered out of their homes after the ordinance was discovered on a building site will have to remain in shelters until the device is fully disposed of.A police spokesman said: \u0027Once the cooling is complete, the bomb can be released from debris. Then a risk assessment can be made. \u0027That will decide whether or not the exclusion zone can be shrunk.\u0027The spokesman added that experts need to figure out how much explosive is left in the bomb before the area can be reduced. Before work began on the bomb, experts had said there was a 5050 chance the device would explode.           The unexploded bomb was found by construction workers in downtown Dresden before being taken away by the bomb squad to be defused           8,700 people were evacuated around the site where the bomb was found and were told they would have to stay away on Thursday morning           A concrete blast wall was erected around the bomb site on Wednesday to provide protection for disposal experts and surrounding buildingsDresden police chief Horst Kretzschmar said the bomb is in a condition that cannot be defused by conventional means, mdr.de reported.The detonator\u0027s tip has penetrated so far into the initial ignition part of the bomb and experts from the ordnance disposal service believe that the bomb will explode with only minimal rotation, he explained.Saxony police spokesman Thomas Geithner told mdr,de  the authorities were working on a plan to attach a device to the detonator in order to remotely detach it from the bomb.He added \u0027the probability is 50 percent\u0027 that the device will go off when the process begins but material such as water tanks and big stones will be used to insulate against the blast should that happen. Police also tweeted that a protective wall was also being built to help insulate the area against any blast.Several businesses and buildings located within the exclusion area including a senior citizens’ home, a nursing home, a vocational school, a day care centre, an allotment garden and various shops, have been evacuated, thelocal.de reported. At 9.00 am on Wednesday the police tweeted that the last people in the restricted area were being evacuated. Much of Dresden was turned to rubble by Allied bombing during World War II, immortalized in Kurt Vonnegut\u0027s famous novel \u0027Slaughterhouse-Five.\u0027More than 70 years after the end of the war, bombs are still regularly discovered in German cities during construction work.

Europe and Moscow are making diplomatic overtures to save the Iran deal, now under threat after the recent US withdrawal.In a joint appearance before the start of the talks, Macron said: \u0027I believe we must work together on joint initiatives. Putin meanwhile said he was ready to talk \u0027about key international issues, the resolution of which are important to both France and Russia\u0027.Mother\u0027s fury after her altar boy son, 14, is sent home from...Convicted killer, 50, who beat street drinker to death is on...Share this articlePutin handed Macron\u0027s wife Brigitte flowers as he greeted the couple late in the afternoon at the Konstantin Palace, a former residence of Peter the Great set some 12 miles outside Saint Petersburg.The meeting comes almost exactly a year since the freshly elected Macron hosted Putin in Versailles, when the French leader accused Russian media of producing \u0027lying propaganda\u0027 during a joint press conference.The trip will also see Macron address the Saint Petersburg International Economic Forum.The talks take place after US President Donald Trump in early May controversially pulled the United States out of the 2015 landmark pact with Iran that placed limits on its nuclear programme in return for easing economic sanctions.    Putin and Macron are expected to discus the crisis in Iran as well as the ongoing war in Syria           Putin held talks last week with Angela Merkel and Japan\u0027s Shinzo Abe will arrive later this weekSaving the deal provides a rare point of agreement between Moscow and European countries, which have seen relations tank in recent years over crises in Ukraine and Syria, as well as accusations of meddling in foreign elections and the poisoning of an ex-Russian spy in Britain.Alexander Baunov of the Carnegie Moscow Centre said talks over Iran will be positive. He said: \u0027Russia shares the position of the majority of the international community including Western leaders.\u0027The West has realised that a dialogue with Putin is \u0027inevitable\u0027 in order to preserve the accord, he said.Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will also visit Russia at the end of the week.Baunov added: \u0027Merkel and Abe have already begun a thaw with Moscow and Macron is scared of losing the advantage that France has always had with Russia.\u0027  But there are a number of sticking points that will prevent a full rapprochement between Paris and Moscow.Chief among them is Syria, where at least 350,000 people have been killed since war broke out in 2011.Moscow intervened in 2015 to prop up its ally President Bashar al-Assad - in a move generally seen as decisive in turning around the multi-front conflict - while France has participated in strikes on regime targets.Another issue is the conflict in eastern Ukraine, which broke out after Russia annexed Crimea in 2014 and has so far claimed at least 10,000 lives.Paris and Moscow, along with Berlin, signed peace agreements in Minsk in 2015 that aimed to bring the fighting to a close but there is currently no end in sight.International investigators on Thursday said a missile that downed a Malaysia Airlines flight over eastern Ukraine in 2014 belonged to a Russian brigade. Moscow rejected the accusation.Before Macron\u0027s trip, Human Rights Watch also implored him to raise the issue of rights abuses with his Russian counterpart, following a crackdown on dissent and pressure on minority groups in the country.But the talks between the two presidents will not be the only bilateral activity of the day, as a raft of commercial agreements are also set to be signed during the economic forum.The presence of the French president at the forum \u0027legitimises visits by business people. Those who are worried about the risks, sanctions or criticism are covered to a certain extent by the president,\u0027 analyst Baunov said.\u0027If anything, the political leadership will get criticised for this rapprochement and not the business community.\u0027 "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/24/17/4C9771C900000578-0-image-m-16_1527177774764.jpg","title":"Is Roman Abramovich moving Tel Aviv","story":"Disgraced soldier kicked out of the army for offensive...Self-driving Uber \u0027saw mother-of-two pedestrian but did not...Share this articleThe Kremlin said Vladimir Putin was unaware of any attempt by Abramovich to seek Israeli citizenship.Presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: \u0027No, the Kremlin is not aware of it.

A North Korean airport official is seen guiding South Korean journalists upon their arrival at North Korea\u0027s Kalma airport in Wonsan yesterdayIn 2008, a cooling tower at the Yongbyon Nuclear Scientific Research Center was demolished in front of the eyes of the world\u0027s media.The tower was part of the complex that produced polonium used in the country\u0027s first nuclear test, and at the time was seen as a symbolic move toward disarmament.Youngbyon had ceased operating the year before after a series of complex negotiations between North Korea, China and the US.But it is believed North Korea only closed the site having enriched enough material for several nuclear tests, only to reopen it years later when it needed more.The country claimed to have restarted the site in 2015, and in 2016 the International Atomic Energy Agency agreed that the plant was probably operational.The chances of success for the unprecedented face-to-face between Trump and Kim had recently been thrown into doubt.On Thursday Pyongyang hardened its rhetoric by attacking US Vice President Mike Pence as \u0027ignorant and stupid\u0027.That broadside appeared to hit a nerve with Trump, leading to him abruptly pulling out of the talks.          Meanwhile, South Korean President Moon Jae-in (seen left with Trump at the White House on Tuesday) says he\u0027s \u0027very perplexed\u0027 that the U.S.-North Korea summit won\u0027t go ahead as planned\u0027Sadly, based on the tremendous anger and open hostility displayed in your most recent statement, I feel it is inappropriate, at this time, to have this long-planned meeting,\u0027 read Trump\u0027s letter to Kim, which was dictated word-for-word by the US leader, according to a senior White House official.Meanwhile, South Korean President Moon Jae-in says he\u0027s \u0027very perplexed\u0027 that the U.S.-North Korea summit won\u0027t go ahead as planned.Yonhap news agency cited Moon as urging direct talks between Trump and Kim.Moon was speaking at an emergency meeting of his top security officials in Seoul after Trump announced he was canceling the summit because of North Korean \u0027hostility.\u0027Moon was quoted as saying: \u0027I am very perplexed and it is very regrettable that the North Korea-U.S. summit will not be held on June 12.\u0027He said, \u0027Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and the establishment of permanent peace are historic tasks that can neither be abandoned nor delayed.\u0027Moon met Trump in Washington on Tuesday, but appeared caught unawares by the president\u0027s decision Thursday. \u0027Ready to fight TONIGHT\u0027: Trump\u0027s Pentagon ramps up the rhetoric and he boasts of \u0027massive\u0027 nuclear arsenal after canceling North Korea summit with Kim - even though he says talks might still happenPresident Donald Trump\u0027s Pentagon issued a warning to North Korea late Thursday, hours after he canceled a planned nuclear disarmament summit, that U.S. forces are ready \u0027to fight tonight\u0027.Pentagon joint staff director Gen.

No way it can happen otherwise.\u0027\u0027If and when Kim Jong-un chooses to engage in constructive dialogue and actions, I am waiting,\u0027 he continued, punctuating the last three words.              Pentagon Chief Spokesperson Dana White (left) and Marine Lt. Gen. Kenneth McKenzie (right) told reporters Thursday that America\u0027s armed forces are locked and loaded, and ready to strike North Korea if called upon\u0027In the meantime, our very strong sanctions, by far the strongest sanctions ever imposed, and maximum pressure campaign, will continue as it has been continuing.\u0027Trump\u0027s letter to Kim on Thursday boasted of America\u0027s gargantuan nuclear arsenal, and he drove the point home at the White House.\u0027I\u0027ve spoke to General Mattis and the Joint Chiefs of Staff,\u0027 he said. \u0027And our military, which is by far the most powerful anywhere the world – that has been greatly enhanced recently, as you all know – is ready if necessary.\u0027\u0027Likewise I have spoken to South Korea and Japan, and they are not only ready should foolish or reckless acts be taken by North Korea, but they are willing to shoulder much of the cost of any financial burden, any of the costs associated by the the United States, in operations if such an unfortunate situation is forced upon us.\u0027\u0027Hopefully, positive things will be taking place with respect to the future of North Korea,\u0027 Trump told an audience of one watching in Pyongyang. \u0027But if they don\u0027t, we are more ready than we have ever been before.\u0027 Pentagon spokeswoman Dana White told reporters that the Defense Department represents one prong of Trump\u0027s \u0027maximum pressure\u0027 strategy, which combines economic sanctions, diplomatic tension and the weight of a constant military presence.\u0027We are ready to fight tonight. That\u0027s always been the case,\u0027 said White. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/29/09/4B7E3E3800000578-0-image-m-9_1524989292580.jpg","title":"After 13 years home ownership finally rise","story":"    Figures show the level of home ownership has risen for the first time in more than a decadeThe Government did not say what factors were behind the turnaround – but it is likely flat house prices have made it more affordable for many young people to get on the property ladder.The Help to Buy scheme, under which the Government provides equity loans to first-time buyers or shared ownership, may also have helped.The first increase in home ownership since 2004 was hailed last night by housing minister Dominic Raab.‘On this measure, it is welcome that owner occupation has increased, albeit modestly, for the first time in 13 years,’ he said. ‘We are restless to do more and build the homes young families, key workers and those on lower or middle incomes can afford. \u0027This Government is determined to restore the dream of home-ownership for the next generation.’The figures were released yesterday by the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government. It found there were 23.9million dwellings in England on March 31, 2017, an increase of 217,000, or 0.92 per cent, on the same day the previous year.Home ownership for young families plummets across Britain as...End of the home owning dream: 20 years ago, two thirds of...Number of young homeowners halves in 35 years amid soaring...Share this articleOf these, 15.1million were owner-occupied, 4.8million were private rented homes and 4million were social housing owned by councils or housing associations.Between March 2016 and March 2017, the owner occupied dwelling stock rose by 262,000 and the private rented stock decreased by 46,000.The social and affordable rented stock increased by 3,000 dwellings and the other public sector stock decreased by 1,000 dwellings. The figures also revealed that despite the housing crisis, there was a significant increase in empty properties.In October 2017 there were 605,891 vacant dwellings in England, an increase of 16,125 (2.7 per cent) from the year before. Empty homes account for 2.5 per cent of the dwelling stock.The document reported: ‘The number of owner-occupied dwellings increased between 2014 and 2017 after a period of decline. The proportion of dwellings in owner-occupation increased steadily from the 1980s to 2002 when it reached its peak of 69.5 per cent.

The lava has been pouring down the flank of the volcano and into the ocean miles away.  The volcano has opened more than 20 vents in the ground that have released lava, sulfur dioxide and steam   Only one person has been seriously hurt as a result of the eruption when they were hit by a flying piece of lava The eruption has destroyed 50 buildings, including about two dozen homes.One person was seriously injured after being hit by a flying piece of lava.Activists have also warned that a geothermal power plant in Hawaii at risk of being overrun with molten lava from the erupting Kilauea Volcano is a \u0027ticking time bomb\u0027, claim local activists.Locals in the badly effected Puna district fear the fiery river of molten rock could overcome the plant which they have warned for decades was a disaster waiting to happen.And as aerial photos showed the lava flow looming closer to the perimeter of the Puna Geothermal Venture (PGV) plant, engineers worked into the night on Tuesday to cap the 11th and final well, which provides about 25 percent of the Big Island\u0027s power.As of Wednesday, lava had poured over warehouses just outside the plant and was about 100 yards from the facility as officials feared it could trigger the release of deadly hydrogen sulfate gas.On Thursday, Stovall said lava spatter from one vent was forming a wall that was helping protect the plant. Lava from that vent was shooting further into the air and producing the highest lava wall of all the vents, which was blocking molten rock from flowing north toward the plant.Plant workers have already removed 60,000 gallons of highly flammable pentane gas from the site and installed barriers and protective coverings over the area.          A satellite photo provided by DigitalGlobe shows lava coming out of fissures caused by Kilauea volcano, near Puna Geothermal Venture, a geothermal energy plant, which could explode if hit by lava           The wells at the Puna Geothermal Venture plant were plugged overnight as lava from Hawaii\u0027s Kilauea volcano inched closer to the site. The plant is pictured above on Tuesday But local activists, who for decades have argued the power plant should never have been built in a residential area, and have filed multiple lawsuits challenging its placement on Kilauea volcano, claim the danger is clear and present.Activist Kalikolehua Kanaele of the protector group Aloha Aina (Love the Living God), told DailyMail.com: \u0027This has been the greatest concern of this community for 50 years.\u0027If the wells break the gas could ignite and there could be a huge explosion. It\u0027s a ticking time bomb and we always knew this situation could arise. We just hope that a disaster can be averted and nobody gets hurt.\u0027Kanaele, 68, and others say the wells, which run as deep as 8,000ft, pose a serious risk from the lava if they overheat or are breached by underground seismic activity.If the wells break, they could release tons of flammable and toxic hydrogen sulfide into the air around the current evacuation zone, which is already choked with volcanic smog. The gas has the potential to cause huge explosions and winds could spark an emergency evacuation covering a 10-mile radius.This past two weeks the Puna district has been hit with as many as 140 smaller earthquakes every day.The PGV plant is 15 miles from the heart of the volcano, but while Ormat Technologies Inc – which runs the facility - last week insisted there was little risk of the lava reaching it, everyone\u0027s worst nightmare is coming true.Lava erupts several feet into the air in Leilani Estates area near Pahoa, Hawaii on Wednesday   A satellite photo shows lava coming out of fissures caused by Kilauea volcano, running towards the Puna coast, lower right, along Malama Ki Forest Reserve recreation area in Pahoa, Hawaii   This Wednesday photo provided by the U.S. Geological Survey shows the active fissure complex near Pahoa, Hawaii Tourism officials cheered news that a Norwegian Cruise Lines ship that tours the Hawaiian Islands would resume stopping in Kailua-Kona next week. Businesses catering to tourists on the cruise have been hurt since the company suspended Big Island port visits after the eruption began.The company said it would resume calling on Hilo, a town on the eastern side of the island closer to the lava, when conditions allow."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/24/09/4C9377F000000578-5766037-image-m-25_1527152030005.jpg","title":"Tot builder Four year old effortlessly manoeuvres fathers JCB","story":"    Baby driver: Teddie Johnson, of Evesham, Worcestershire, is only four but can drive a JCB  The car-mad tot (pictured aged four left and right) is able to drive Range Rover as well as a quad bike and JCB\u0027I think he\u0027ll be a natural at that too.\u0027Teddie wants to be a racing car driver when he grows up, and I don\u0027t doubt that he\u0027ll be able to do it.\u0027I take him driving three times a week to make sure he gets lots of practice.\u0027Teddie\u0027s father believes that his driving skills are down to his intelligence.

Six of them were convicted in courts martial of LSD use or distribution or both.None of the airmen was accused of using drugs on duty. Yet it\u0027s another blow to the reputation of the Air Force\u0027s nuclear missile corps, which is capable of unleashing hell in the form of Minuteman 3 intercontinental ballistic missiles, or ICBMs. Although seen by some as a backwater of the US military, the missile force has returned to the spotlight as President Donald Trump has called for strengthening US nuclear firepower and exchanged threats last year with North Korea. The administration\u0027s nuclear strategy calls for hundreds of billions of dollars in new spending in coming decades.The service members accused of involvement in the LSD ring were from the 90th Missile Wing, which operates one-third of the 400 Minuteman 3 missiles that stand \u0027on alert\u0027 247 in underground silos scattered across the northern Great Plains.\u0027Ready to fight TONIGHT\u0027: Trump\u0027s Pentagon ramps up the...Kim GHOSTED us, says Trump\u0027s secretary of state after...North Korea \u0027blows up its nuclear test site\u0027 in series of...Pentagon withdraws China\u0027s invitation to major US military...Share this articleDocuments obtained by the AP over the past two years through the Freedom of Information Act tell a sordid tale of off-duty use of LSD, cocaine and other drugs in 2015 and 2016 by airmen who were supposed to be held to strict behavioral standards because of their role in securing the weapons.In response to AP inquiries, an Air Force spokesman, Lt. Col. Uriah L. Orland, said the drug activity took place during off-duty hours. \u0027There are multiple checks to ensure airmen who report for duty are not under the influence of alcohol or drugs and are able to execute the mission safely, securely and effectively,\u0027 he said.Airman 1st Class Tommy N. Ashworth was among those who used LSD supplied by colleagues with connections to civilian drug dealers.\u0027I felt paranoia, panic\u0027 for hours after taking a hit of acid, Ashworth said under oath at his court martial. He confessed to using LSD three times while off duty. The first time, in the summer of 2015, shook him up. \u0027I didn\u0027t know if I was going to die that night or not,\u0027 he said as a witness at another airman\u0027s drug trial. Recalling another episode with LSD, he said it felt \u0027almost as if I was going to have like a heart attack or a heat stroke.\u0027Airman Basic Kyle S. Morrison acknowledged at his court martial that under the influence of LSD he could not have responded if recalled to duty in a nuclear security emergency.In prosecuting the cases at F.E. Warren, the Air Force asserted that LSD users can experience \u0027profound effects\u0027 from even small amounts. It said common psychological effects include \u0027paranoia, fear and panic, unwanted and overwhelming feelings, unwanted life-changing spiritual experiences, and flashbacks.\u0027It\u0027s unclear how long before being on duty any of the airmen had taken LSD, which stands for lysergic acid diethylamide. The drug became popularized as \u0027acid\u0027 in the 1960s, and views since then have been widely split on its mental health risks. Although illegal in the US, it had been showing up so infrequently in drug tests across the military that in December 2006 the Pentagon eliminated LSD screening from standard drug-testing procedures.   At least six airmen from the 790th Missile Security Forces Squadron were buying, distributing or using the illegal hallucinogen, LSD. In this February 2016 photo, members of the unit demonstrate their training for recapturing a Minuteman missile siloAn internal Pentagon memo at the time said that over the previous three years only four positive specimens had been identified in 2.1million specimens screened for LSD.Yet Air Force investigators found those implicated in the F.E. Warren drug ring used LSD on base and off, at least twice at outdoor gatherings. Some also snorted cocaine and used ecstasy. Civilians joined them in the LSD use, including some who had recently left Air Force service, according to two officials with knowledge of the investigation. The Air Force declined to discuss this.Airman 1st Class Nickolos A. Harris, said to be the leader of the drug ring, testified that he had no trouble getting LSD and other drugs from civilian sources. He pleaded guilty to using and distributing LSD and using ecstasy, cocaine and marijuana.He acknowledged using LSD eight times and distributing LSD multiple times to fellow airmen at parties in Denver and other locations from spring 2015 to early 2016.\u0027I absolutely just loved altering my mind,\u0027 he told the military judge, blaming his decisions to use hallucinogens and other drugs on his addictive personality.Other airmen testified that it was easy to obtain LSD in a liquid form spread on small tabs of perforated white paper. Airmen ingested at least one tab by placing it on their tongue. In one episode summarized by a military judge at Harris\u0027 court martial, he and other airmen watched YouTube videos and \u0027then went longboarding on the streets of Denver while high on LSD.\u0027Harris was sentenced to 12 months in jail and other penalties, but under a pretrial agreement he avoided a punitive discharge. The lead prosecutor in that case, Air Force Capt. C. Rhodes Berry, had argued Harris should be locked up for 42 months, including nine months for the \u0027aggravating circumstance\u0027 of undercutting public trust by using hallucinogens and other drugs on a nuclear weapons base.\u0027I cannot think of anything more aggravating than being the ringleader of a drug ring on F.E. Warren Air Force Base,\u0027 Berry said at the courts martial.In all, the AP obtained transcripts of seven courts martial proceedings, plus related documents. They provide vivid descriptions of LSD trips.\u0027I\u0027m dying!\u0027 one airman is quoted as exclaiming, followed by \u0027When is this going to end?\u0027 during a \u0027bad trip\u0027 on LSD in February 2016 at Curt Gowdy State Park, about 20 miles west of Cheyenne, where F.E. Warren is located. A portion of that episode was video-recorded by one member of the group a transcript of the audio was included in court records.Others said they enjoyed the drug.\u0027Minutes felt like hours, colors seemed more vibrant and clear,\u0027 Morrison testified. \u0027In general, I felt more alive.\u0027 He said he had used LSD in high school, which could have disqualified him from Air Force service he said that his recruiter told him he should lie about it and that lying about prior drug use was \u0027normal\u0027 in the Air Force.At his court martial, Morrison acknowledged distributing LSD on the missile base in February 2016. A month later, when summoned for questioning by the Air Force Office of Special Investigations, Morrison confessed and became an informant for the agency, an arrangement the Air Force said yielded legally admissible evidence against 10 other airmen. Under a pretrial agreement, he agreed to testify against other airmen and avoided a punitive discharge. He was sentenced to five months\u0027 confinement, 15 days of hard labor and loss of $5,200 in pay.Most of the airmen involved were members of two related security units at F.E. Warren - the 790th Missile Security Forces Squadron and the 90th Security Forces Squadron. Together, they are responsible for the security and defense of the nuclear weapons there as well as the missile complex.By coincidence, the No. 2 Pentagon official at the time, Robert Work, visited F.E. Warren one month before the drug investigation became public. Accompanied by an AP reporter, he watched as airmen of the 790th Missile Security Forces Squadron - whose members at the time included Harris, the accused leader of the drug ring - demonstrated how they would force their way into and regain control of a captured missile silo.Work, the deputy defense secretary, was there to assess progress in fixing problems in the ICBM force identified by then-Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, who ordered an investigation after the AP reported on personnel, resource, training and leadership problems in 2013-14. Those problems included the firing of the general in charge of the entire ICBM force for inappropriate behavior the Air Force said was linked to alcohol abuse. A month later the AP revealed that an unpublished study prepared for the Air Force found \u0027burnout\u0027 among nuclear missile launch officers and evidence of broader behavioral problems, including sexual assaults and domestic violence. Air Force officials say the force has since rebounded.In an interview, Work said he was not aware during his visit that anything was amiss. Nor was he briefed later on the investigation. He said he wouldn\u0027t have expected to be briefed unless the Air Force found that LSD or other illegal drugs were a \u0027systemic problem\u0027 for the nuclear force, beyond the security forces group at F.E. Warren.Work said he had never heard of LSD use anywhere in the nuclear workforce.For the inexperienced members of the drug ring, Harris, the ringleader, had set out several \u0027rules\u0027 for LSD use at a gathering of several airmen in a Cheyenne apartment in late 2015 that was recorded on video. Rule No. 1: \u0027No social media at all.\u0027 He added: \u0027No bad trips. Everybody\u0027s happy right now. Let\u0027s keep it that way.\u0027But social media proved their undoing. In March 2016, one member posted a Snapchat video of himself smoking marijuana, setting Air Force investigators on their trail.As the investigators closed in, one of the accused, Airman 1st Class Devin R. Hagarty, grabbed a backpack and cash, text-messaged his mother that he loved her, turned off his cellphone and fled to Mexico. \u0027I started panicking,\u0027 he told a military judge after giving himself up and being charged with desertion.The Air Force said Hagarty was the first convicted deserter from an ICBM base since January 2013. In court, he admitted using LSD four times in 2015-16 and distributing it once, and he said he had deserted with the intention of never returning. He also admitted to using cocaine, ecstasy and marijuana multiple times. He was sentenced to 13 months in a military jail.In all, disciplinary action was taken against 14 airmen. In addition, two accused airmen were acquitted at courts martial, and three other suspects were not charged."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/23/01/4C8AE92100000578-0-image-a-4_1527034213902.jpg","title":"Syria Kurds announce capture prominent French jihadist","story":"A handout image provided by the Syrian Democratic Forces (left) shows French jihadist Adrien Guihal, known as the voice that claimed 2016 attacks in France for the Islamic State group.

My parents ignited my property bug. When I was in my early 20s they gave me a plot of land next to their home and said I could do what I wanted with it. Battling for planning permission and studying plans allowed me to see the potential for investment. I sold it a few years later at a good profit.We bought a property in Cheshire three years ago for £850,000. I razed the ugly house and started again.We spent £500,000 building our perfect family home — four bedrooms, each with an en suite. It is now worth double what we paid and we love it. We bought the villa in Portugal in 2008 after falling in love with the area while visiting friends and built it from the ground up. It is a two-acre estate. It has four bedrooms, all en suite, with a pool and an outside kitchen and bar. It is worth around €3 million.We rent out the villa when we are not there.

It doesn’t have to go too far: just to the beaches of Anglesey or the azure sea of St Lucia. And I can do that — and still be at home!I got on the property ladder after I was awarded financial compensation. I’d been badly injured in a hit-and-run accident in London in 1995.The sum I received just about allowed us to put a deposit on our first property in West London. It was while I was renovating the flat, enjoying experimenting with fabrics and colours, that I realised I could earn a living from design and interiors.

Yet during that time I was renovating our next home — another London flat. We sold up and moved to Cambridge in 2013, before our youngest child was born. Our detached home there is modern and practical with six bedrooms, an open-plan kitchen, dining room and living room, all painted in bright colours. It’s cosy, family chaos, but also big enough for us to all come together and have our own space, too.I’ve been going to Anglesey on holiday since I was a child. It’s a really special area for me.We bought our place there in the village of Rhoscolyn, in 2015. I think a family home is different from a holiday home. It took me a year to get it how I like it: now it’s a stunning New England beach- style house which can sleep 12. It even has a hot tub. I rent it out when we’re not there.

It took a year to build our four-bedroom, four-bathroom home.The children all have their favourite place.

Jane says:Ever since I was a little girl growing up in a council house in the Midlands I always knew I’d have a property overseas one day.And I was right. Today, I still get a rush of pleasure waking up to azure blue skies and a twinkling, inviting swimming pool — and ending the day with something chilled and gorgeous, as I watch the sun go down.This is the life I adore in Cyprus for five months of the year.

When I returned to the UK, I married and raised my family. I’m one of life’s grafters and so when the children finally flew the nest, I set about making my dream a reality. I sold my UK property in Staffordshire and used the proceeds to buy a place off plan in Cyprus.It took three years to build my three-bedroom dream home in the sun. I’d fly out to see the progress and gradually fell in love with the Cypriot way of life. I’m not someone who ulges the costs involved, as I regard that as personal.When it was ready three years later, I sold my house in Staffordshire and moved here full-time. Not everyone was here in Paphos permanently and before long people began to ask me to manage their property. I found it was something I not only enjoyed, but was good at.I went from managing eight to then launching my own company and marketing approximately 100 holiday homes, although today I have scaled the business back to 80 properties.

I find the summers too hot in Cyprus, and also it’s closer to Birmingham, where my grown-up children live.The wildlife is stunning I sit on the terrace and wind down while watching geese waddle by or listening to the woodpeckers in the forests.I am already thinking about my future though, which is why I have just snapped up a town property in Cleethorpes. It’s a rather chi-chi seafront flat, which I regard as a great investment. I can see it is somewhere we could both retire to when I eventually sell up.My family are rather proud of me. They know how have worked hard to achieve this. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/06/00/4BE50C2E00000578-0-image-m-22_1525561470263.jpg","title":"Look Aidan Turner dastardly MP taken shine Demelza","story":"    Heartthrob Ross Poldark carrying his wife Demelza from the sea in the popular BBC1 dramaRoss and his wife have already cheated on each other, with Demelza kissing naval officer Hugh Armitage, played by Burberry model Josh Whitehouse, in the final episode of series three.It came after she was told that Ross had kissed Elizabeth Warleggan, his first love and former fiancee.BBC made me a mincing camp joke but what\u0027s so funny about...If only he\u0027d been selling ice cream too!

Dust came at you, the heat came at you. It was extremely loud,\u0027 Sky News\u0027 Tom Cheshire, who was among the journalists invited, wrote on the British broadcaster\u0027s web site.Punggye-ri has been the staging ground for all six of the North\u0027s nuclear tests, including its latest and by far most powerful one in September last year, which Pyongyang said was an H-bomb.Experts are ided over whether the demolition will render the site useless.Skeptics say the facility has already outlived its usefulness with six successful nuclear tests in the bag and can be quickly rebuilt if needed.Jeffrey Lewis, of the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, also told Vice News that North Korea has two further tunnel complexes running into adjacent mountains that are undamaged from previous tests.North Korea also did not invite any independent observers, raising speculation that it was simply destroying evidence of its nuclear program with the blessing of the United States.This is also not the first time that North Korea has demolished one of its nuclear facilities without hampering the country\u0027s progress in building a nuclear bomb.          A North Korean airport official is seen guiding South Korean journalists upon their arrival at North Korea\u0027s Kalma airport in Wonsan yesterdayIn 2008, a cooling tower at the Yongbyon Nuclear Scientific Research Center was demolished in front of the eyes of the world\u0027s media.The tower was part of the complex that produced polonium used in the country\u0027s first nuclear test, and at the time was seen as a symbolic move toward disarmament.Youngbyon had ceased operating the year before after a series of complex negotiations between North Korea, China and the US.But it is believed North Korea only closed the site having enriched enough material for several nuclear tests, only to reopen it years later when it needed more.The country claimed to have restarted the site in 2015, and in 2016 the International Atomic Energy Agency agreed that the plant was probably operational.The chances of success for the unprecedented face-to-face between Trump and Kim had recently been thrown into doubt.On Thursday Pyongyang hardened its rhetoric by attacking US Vice President Mike Pence as \u0027ignorant and stupid\u0027.That broadside appeared to hit a nerve with Trump, leading to him abruptly pulling out of the talks.

As usual, the sky tries to wring every single cloud and squeeze out every single drop. A rainy day … right after a day full of nightmares.A rainy day … to cleanse, to wash away the sorrow, to eliminate the grief, to stop the inhumanity, to end the viciousness and barbarity. A rainy day … after another death on Manus. Salim died on Tuesday morning. He committed suicide. He was riding the bus that takes the refugees to town. He got up off his seat, he opened the door, and he jumped out. And moments later the wheels of the vehicle ran over his head. He was left there crushed on the concrete. Another suicide, another extreme set of circumstances. The third death by suicide on Manus in under a year, the seventh death of a refugee on Manus in total. When I say suicide, I am using the definition that the police use to describe the death. Sign up to receive the latest Australian opinion pieces every weekdaySalim would at times fall to the ground and begin to tremble. His mouth would foam and he would yell. All the refugees were familiar with his situation. All the staff working in Manus prison, the medical personnel, everyone in the immigration department including the immigration minister, human rights organisations, and the journalists reporting about Manus, they all knew about Salim. We introduced him to every authority figure who visited Manus from Australia. Our hope was that by witnessing this man they would be so moved that they would put an end to the torture, that they would understand what they were doing to us. Everyone could see what he was going through. And maybe this was why immigration officials were determined to keep him there, to help reinforce the ruthlessness and brutality of the system. I had known Salim for a long time. The first time I encountered him was in Oscar prison. It was the same day that Sudanese refugee Faysal Ishak Ahmed died due to numerous health issues which included heart problems. For six months Faysal had been begging doctors from International Health and Medical Services to help him. Like Faysal, Salim was struggling to stay alive. He approached me, indicating to his heart, to his head, trying to tell me that he was afraid he would end up like Faysal. During our first interaction he had hope that I might be able to do something for him, he hoped that someone might hear his cry for help. Salim could not speak a word of English. He was possibly the most vulnerable refugee who had to endure the violence of Australia’s border regime all these years. I also remember Salim in other ways. There is one particular feature that remains in our memory. He was always in anguish, but he had an extraordinary love of flowers. He would pick flowers from along the prison fences and playfully place them behind his ears or put them in his hair. There are pictures of him sitting by the fences holding flowers, but it is clear that his spirit had been crushed. There was a time when he was more vigorous. It was in November when we were under siege for 23 days by Australian immigration and the local police. In the final days when they began to attack with more force, Salim took his flowers and went to welcome them to the prison – he showed compassion and respect to the same people who had come to beat us. Salim did not know a word of English but he was fully aware of what was going on around him. He used his body language in powerful ways to convey his message, even though his body had been punished and tortured. He used his flowers to communicate his opposition to the system.Salim had epilepsy. Two years ago immigration decided to transfer him to Australia for treatment. He stayed in Darwin for a while but they exiled him back to Manus while he was still experiencing a great deal of suffering. There is no hope in Manus prison’s medical centre, which is run by IHMS. How many people have they treated successfully in these five years? Salim had nowhere else to turn he returned to IHMS for help over and over again, at least to collect some pain relief. It was a like seeking asylum from your torturer. The IHMS has always been under the command of immigration. The institution is part of a predetermined political strategy which smothers sick refugees and tosses them into a horrific bureaucratic maze. They not only leave refugees untreated, they also aggravate the minor pains of healthy refugees and force them to return to the countries they fled. All the documents pertaining to the torture of Salim are available now and there is a lot of evidence of his maltreatment. Salim and many others were driven to death by the application of systematic torture. The death of Salim is the outcome of organised tactics of violence that involve a chain of command and administrative procedures. These are deaths ordered by political actors and a government that knows what it is doing strategic manoeuvres designed to eliminate people incarcerated on Manus in the most violent way. The deaths that have taken place have had a profound effect on the inmates. Physical violence is only one aspect of the attacks after all these years the system also plays sick games with tortured and vulnerable souls. Many, like Salim, have lost all hope in the political system and the medical services. It is not surprising that the first reaction from many of the prisoners was: “Good for him, at least now he’s free.” By sacrificing his life Salim freed himself from the shackles administered by the doctors and nurses, from all the documents and forms, freed himself from registering on lists and anticipating treatment, from hoping aimlessly for aid when there was no intention to help him in the first place. Salim was a Rohingya who fled genocide. He crossed a treacherous ocean, endured five years of illness in a prison on a forlorn island, and in the end he lost his life in the most tragic way. He was a father and a husband. He had three children: eleven, eight and five years old. He had never seen his youngest because the child was born while he was on his way to Australia. The deaths on Manus must be understood in the context of the various interlocking processes that occur here: the never-ending queues under the burning sun just to receive food the hierarchies constructed to ide people in the prison the rationalisation and control of every decision and action the humiliation prisoners experience, and the contempt of the staff and authorities the denial of rights and respect the demeaning of human life chains of events leading to death death via a mechanical process death as a commodity, for political profit.For years Salim was like a possessed corpse who would die a number of deaths every day … death at sunset, death every night. He would be reborn every morning without any recollection and without resuming anything from his life in the past. He would just walk over to the medical centre in the hope of being healed. Death by a thousand blows death endured over and over again death of the body, death of the soul death silenced by the noise of the tabloids and latest fashions death covered up by the bride of a royal wedding death lost among the chatter of celebrities death that has the lowest value possible. The rain washes away the blood spill, it cleanses the anguish. The killers and the victims, the scene of the crime … the rain carries them all away. Everything returns to nature, everything that has happened returns to the land. But the rain cannot fathom the perpetrators, the government of killers. The rain cannot comprehend the blood that has been spilled by using the law as a weapon.These words are a form of lament in honour of a man who always had a few flowers tucked into his hair. Just like the falling rain … wash over this jungle … cleanse these plains.• Behrouz Boochani is a journalist and an Iranian refugee held on Manus Island.

You saw The Human Centipede, and were secretly disappointed that it wasn’t as interesting as the premise suggested. You saw The Human Centipede 2, then spent a full month wondering why you bothered. You ignored The Human Centipede 3, because you have a vague recollection of someone once telling you not to feed the trolls. And now it’s time for you to actively run away from The Onania Club.Little is known about Tom Six’s new film The Onania Club, except for the following. It’s set in California. Its tagline is: “Come and see, see and come.” It’s almost definitely going to be about masturbation. And, inevitably, its own press release has described it as “one of the most vile, inhumane movie experiences of all time”.Now, normally it isn’t the job of a press release to call a movie vile and inhumane, let alone historically so. That’s usually the job of critics and audiences, or anyone who streamed out of Lars von Trier’s latest tinpot attempt at teenage provocation. It’s the sort of line that a studio would pass over for poster inclusion, instead landing on the next best review, which in this case is likely to be something like: “I suppose it exists” or “On the plus side, at least it’s short.”But at this point in Tom Six’s career, this is essentially all that he has got left going for him roaring loudly about his own irreparable wretchedness in the hope that a handful of dimwit would-be incels will watch it as a dare. And The Onania Club’s own poster – tweeted this week by Six himself – does nothing to dispel that notion.The poster is an amateurish collage of aggressive stupidity. There’s a terrorist with a gun. There’s a row of what look like military prisoners on their knees. There’s a crying baby. There’s a charred corpse in sunglasses. There’s a cancer patient. There’s an actual real-life photo of the World Trade Center being attacked. There’s also a large image of a woman with her eyes closed, but it’s honestly hard to tell whether she’s in the throes of sexual ecstasy or just disappointed that she signed up to star in such a trainwreck of a movie.Honestly, what is the point of Tom Six? It can’t be to make art, because he’s spent an entire career doing the precise opposite. And it can’t be to act as a walking distillation of all of humanity’s ugliness, because we already have Twitter.In fact, there’s a very good chance that Tom Six exists for exactly this for members of the press to get riled up by all his knuckleheaded posturing. Which means I’m part of the problem. So well done Tom Six, you win this time. Someone remind me not to react when he farts out The Onania Club 2 this time next year.

On Saturday he aims to deliver on a promise to spare his childhood friend the despair and disbelief that accompanied Liverpool’s triumph in Istanbul. The gift set will be complete when he brings a European Cup winner’s medal back home.“I remember AC Milan v Liverpool in 2005,” Mané explains. “Three-nil down, then 3-3 and penalties. This was a big memory for me. I was watching in my village, Bambali. I remember being with my friend, a big friend of mine, and at 3-0 down he was completely out of it. He stopped watching and ran like crazy to get away. Then he came back at the end and he could not believe it. Even to this day he cannot believe it. He came back after the game when Liverpool had won.”Mané dissolves into laughter at the 13-year-old memory, half his lifetime ago. The Liverpool forward laughed at his friend’s antics at the time – “I was not supporting Liverpool then, I was a Barcelona fan,” he admits – but thoughts of the club’s eighth European Cup final appearance stir pride. “If you had said then I would be playing the final I would say it is something incredible in my life,” he says. “Hopefully we are going to win.”Bambali, bedecked in red, will be united behind the Senegal forward against Real Madrid in Kiev. Their pride in Mané’s rise to global stardom is not lost on the 26-year‑old, who remains in regular contact with family and friends back home, including the one who missed the comeback that secured Liverpool’s last Champions League triumph. “I spoke to him yesterday,” Mané says. “He is a big Liverpool fan. He is still in Senegal. His name is Youssouph Diatta. He asked me that this time do not be 3-0 down.“Nobody in the village will work this day. My family still live in the village. My mum and my uncle. They are all going to be watching. There are 2,000 in the village. I bought 300 Liverpool jerseys to send to the people in the village so the fans can wear them to watch the final. I will be going back in the summer after the World Cup and hopefully I will be showing everyone a winner’s\u0026nbspmedal.”Istanbul staged the most famous rapid-fire Liverpool performance of all, with three goals in six second‑half minutes stunning Milan en route to the club’s fifth European Cup. But devastating bursts of firepower have been such a feature of Liverpool’s Champions League campaign under Jürgen Klopp that not even a Real team pushing for a hat-trick of titles provoke fear.Liverpool scored three goals in 12 minutes in the play-off against Hoffenheim, three goals in 16 minutes and two in another five‑minute spell against Maribor, two in nine at Sevilla and three in 15 minutes plus two in four against Spartak Moscow at Anfield. And that was just the group stage. Porto, Manchester City and Roma were all in effect banished from the knockout phase before they could identify the threat and regroup.He adds: “I am just thinking it is incredible to be in the final, not about pressure. I’m just happy and excited. It is the best time for the whole squad to play.“We are in the best shape there is no tiredness. This kind of game does not happen all the time and it is one of the most important of a career. It will not be easy. They have experience and are one of the best teams in the world, but we have quality and can beat any team in the world.”Liverpool are leading scorers in this season’s Champions League with 40 goals (excluding the six against Hoffenheim in the play‑off). Mané, Roberto Firmino and Mohamed Salah are responsible for 29 of them. It is a record that invites comparisons between Liverpool’s fearsome front three and the prodigious Real attack of Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema, albeit not from Mané himself.“You can write this, I didn’t say it,” he adds. “We are happy people name us at this level. Thank you for the compliment. It is something we have been working hard on to play in this Champions League. I am always honoured to play alongside these great players. People talk about the front three but it is the whole team that makes us better. They did a great job behind to help us score goals.

The fresh legs of Shanice van de Sanden then sealed the tie for the French side as she three times raced clear on the right, first providing the assist for Le Sommer, then for an unmarked Hegerberg – her record-breaking 15th Champions League goal in a single campaign – and finally for Abily, on her final appearance for Lyon at 33.Lyon had dominated in normal time and had felt aggrieved when a Le Sommer header seemed to cross the line, only to be waved away. “Watching their goal go in was heartbreaking, and having just had a goal disallowed that definitely crossed the line was a very up and down situation,” said Bronze.“We push for more and more in these big games. Lyon and Wolfsburg are trendsetting and pushing women’s football. We do as much as we can as players on the pitch, but we need the referee and goalline technology to be up to standard as well,” she added.Bronze was full of praise for the Lyon substitutes, particularly the former Liverpool player Van de Sanden, whose pace was just too much for the exhausted legs of the German side. “Shanice was a game changer in the end, she got three out of four assists, came on and made the difference with the pace she’s got getting in behind. Both teams were tiring and she’s so energetic, works so hard and won us the game. She deserves every credit.”This was the third meeting of the two sides in a Champions League final. Both previous encounters were tight affairs in 2013 only Martina Müller’s penalty for Wolfsburg at Stamford Bridge could separate the European giants, and in 2016 Lyon won on penalties.The first chance of this match fell to Lyon after five minutes, after Griedge M’Bock Bathy was brought down in the middle of the park. A swung-in free-kick fell to Henry but her shot bounced clear off a Wolfsburg body. Minutes later, up the other end, Popp’s ball across the front of Sarah Bouhaddi’s goal was teasingly out of reach of the incoming Ewa Pajor.The tree-lined Valeriy Lobanovskyi Stadium was close to empty shortly before the whistle, perhaps thanks to heavy security. However, 35 minutes into the match the little 17,000-seater was heaving, mainly with locals.Lyon edged the first 45 with the tricky winger Amel Majri and the left-back Selma Bacha causing plenty of trouble for Anna Blässe on the left.However, the half had failed to light up, half chances and misplaced passes the order of the day. After 15 minutes Lyon began to up the pressure a little, and a Dzsenifer Marozsán corner was cleared as far as Bronze, whose volley went wide.With the Wolfsburg defence resolute and well organised, Lyon were forced to try their luck from distance, a swerving shot from the left-hand corner of the box by a frustrated Marozsán comfortably collected by Almuth Schult. As the half drew to a close, Harder, the heartbeat of the Wolfsburg attack, was increasingly forced to go deeper to get the ball.With Wolfsburg struggling to make anything happen, their manager, Stephan Lerch, swapped the winger Caroline Graham Hansen for Tessa Wullaert at the break to try to shake things up. An uneventful opening to the second half was brought to an abrupt halt when Sara Bjork Gunnarsdóttir crumpled to the ground, on her own, clearly in pain – the exertions of the German cup final win after extra time and penalties at the weekend starting to show in the legs of the players.Lyon spent much of the second period camped in the opposition half and they were denied a breakthrough in the 69th minute when a corner from the left found Henry, who flicked the ball goalwards. Replays seemed to show the ball crossed the line, but Noelle Maritz cleared and the referee waved away appeals. Lyon kept pushing for what would surely be a winner. Cascarino, on for the bright Bacha, sent in a low cross but Le Sommer’s shot was nicely saved by Schult.Wolfsburg came out fighting in extra time, as Harder raced forward and her deflected strike from outside the box gave the German side a surprising lead. It was then that the game exploded. Popp received her second yellow before Hegerberg’s lovely chip found the onrushing Henry, who put the ball into the top of the net. Moments later the holders took the lead as Van de Sanden raced down the right and her cross was met by Le Sommer to poke past the keeper.With Wolfsburg forced to push forward they were left even more exposed, and again, Van de Sanden found an unmarked Hegerberg to put the game out of an exhausted Wolfsburg’s reach in the first half of added time. Then Abily put a lovely curling strike beyond Schult with two minutes to play, giving her an emotional send-off as she rounded off Lyon’s record fifth European title, one she said was “amazing, I couldn’t hope for a better end. I came in and scored and we won, it was a perfect night for me.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/63c3c6e2638359132fb7c1b2ec3cc31916ee5f9e/0_94_1417_850/master/1417.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1c029b5a16298615d59cd48741e22e01","title":"safe haven nile south sudan old fangak in pictures","story":"Before civil war erupted, Old Fangak was home to about 5,000 people.

Is it always wrong to mix kids and social media?Follow some bloggers or Instagram stars and you will know more about their children than you do about the children of your closest friends and relatives. You will see them sleeping or having tantrums in their swimsuits in paddling pools or having their nappies changed. You will see their mealtimes, their holidays and what they looked like on Christmas morning. You may have seen them in the minutes after they were born, umbilical cord still attached, and perhaps even before they embarked on this childhood of unwitting digital documentation, in a fuzzy black-and-white ultrasound picture. The ethics of this – publishing photographs of one’s children to build a social media following, and then monetising it – have always been shady, but the issue has been amplified this week.On Mumsnet over the past few months, there have been active threads criticising parenting bloggers or “influencers” – that euphemism for advertisers – mainly about the transparency of sponsored posts and advertising content, but also about the perceived exploitation of their children. The account of one Instagram-user, Clemmie Hooper, was taken down this week and though it is unclear who took it down and why – there were allegations of abusive comments under a post – she has in the past attracted criticism for the use of her children. Hooper’s account, Mother of Daughters, had nearly 470,000 followers and documented life with her four girls. The account of her husband, Simon Hooper, who runs Father of Daughters for his 845,000 followers, is still running – and his posts almost always feature one or more of his daughters. The couple have been singled out this week – neither would comment for this piece – but they are far from the only ones.So is sharing pictures online of our children something we should be worrying about? “In an age of visibility, it is important that parents discuss the pros and cons of sharing with their children, even when quite young,” says Sonia Livingstone, professor of social psychology in the department of media and communications at the LSE, and one of the project’s researchers. “We interviewed several families where even small children wished their parents would share fewer photos, and consult them more. We observed in a few families that children are even learning to tell their parents to stop. But insofar as this sharing is to bring families together, even when geographically dispersed, there are also advantages, and children appreciate those, too. It’s a matter of respect and consent, and protecting that is important, more than the actual fact of sharing itself.”Are generations of children now growing up without privacy? “I don’t think so,” she says. “The conditions of their privacy are changing, partly because of their own actions, partly others’. What will matter to children is to feel they have agency, respect and dignity – that’s at the heart of privacy. So anyone sharing or using their images should prioritise this.”Genevieve von Lob, clinical psychologist and author of Five Deep Breaths: The Power of Mindful Parenting, says: “More and more parents are questioning the wisdom of posting so much about their kids online. The pictures that are uploaded can form a permanent digital tattoo. Because it’s all so new for parents, we need to start thinking about asking children’s permission to post online.”If you think about how children are being profiled on the basis of social media images, there is a real riskMost children won’t have the finances to bring a court case, “and a child is normally not considered to have the capacity to bring legal proceedings themselves”. And the implications of such a case on family relationships could be disastrous. Bessant prefers the idea of educating parents and children “so there can be a dialogue at an earlier age. I’ve done research talking to parents about how they share information and what they think privacy is and there are a number of parents who said that once their children start to say, ‘I don’t want those photographs out there’, they would be quite willing to either not post at all, or only post once they have spoken to their kids.”Veronica Barassi, a media and communications lecturer at Goldsmith’s, University of London who is leading the Child Data Citizen research project, says “there is a moral panic” about sharing pictures online. However, she admits there are dangers. “If you think about big data and how children are being profiled on the basis of social media images, there is a real risk. I’m particularly interested in things like facial recognition: the way in which that data is sold, and the lack of transparency, is the most worrying aspect of so-called sharenting.”It’s important that parents consider the long-term implications for their child of having a highly visible digital footprintWhat, then, should parents do? Those setting out with the intention of making themselves and their children famous are one thing. “It’s important that parents consider carefully the long-term implications for their child of having a highly visible and widely shared digital footprint,” says Livingstone. “In our interviews with parent bloggers, we found they were becoming more conscious of this, and often taking care only to present their child in a positive light. Of course, it’s possible that this too could be problematic, creating an ideal self that the child must live up to.”As for the rest of us, who have no intention of using photographs of our toddlers to advertise a nappy brand but are still exposing them online, consent is key and “can begin very early,” she says. “Perhaps sharing should be kept to a minimum early on. Sharing photos with a handful of friends and family is one thing. Sharing on public sites is quite another, and I’m not sure parents should do that at all.”Much of it is common sense, says Bex Lewis, senior lecturer in digital marketing at Manchester politan University and author of Raising Children in a Digital Age. “Try not to put their school uniform in, try not to show that you have a regular pattern every day.” Most parents, you would hope, wouldn’t post pictures of their children naked but there are other things parents should perhaps think twice about. It is probably not fair, she says, to show pictures of a child having a meltdown, “although those are quite funny to watch”. Turn off geotagging, which tells internet users where you are, and lock down your privacy settings. Even then, “there is always a chance someone could screenshot the pictures, but someone could take a picture of your child in the park, and if you thought like that you’d never go anywhere. Keep the child involved in the conversation from an early age. The digital world is an everyday part of our lives now. It’s still evolving, so I’m not sure there are any fixed rules, but having a bit of thought about what you are posting and where you’re posting it is the critical thing.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/000d5ec10f035ae3fb12029c158291532e154042/0_296_4696_2818/master/4696.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cbd01117a0e7f06e4bca03e9f3993bdf","title":"katie hopkins wins complaint against mirror for ketamine headline","story":"Website suggested she was detained abroad for taking drugs, rather than allegedly spreading racial hatredKatie Hopkins has won a complaint against the Mirror after a report on the newspaper’s website left the impression that she was prevented from leaving South Africa for taking drugs rather than because she had been detained for allegedly spreading racial hatred.The rightwing columnist and broadcaster took exception to a story published online in February headlined “Katie Hopkins banned from leaving South Africa after taking ketamine”, arguing it could damage her reputation by suggesting she had been arrested for taking a drug used for illegal purposes in the UK.She said the newspaper should have made it clear her passport was briefly confiscated over entirely separate allegations she had been spreading racial hatred, an incident that coincidentally happened after she took medically prescribed ketamine. The former Apprentice contestant was in South Africa to produce a film about the treatment of white farmers when the two incidents happened, both of which were publicised on her social media accounts. One picture posted to her Twitter account showed Hopkins being resuscitated by paramedics after collapsing in the street after taking the ketamine, which she uses to reduce pain in a dislocated shoulder.Two days later she posted a separate video from Johannesburg airport in which she claimed she would miss her flight home because “my passport has been marked for spreading racial hatred here in South Africa”.She complained the Mirror had conflated the two issues in its original headline.The Mirror argued its reporting was accurate but later added a correction to the story which the newspaper felt made the chain of events clearer: “A previous version of this article suggested that Katie Hopkins was stopped from leaving South Africa because of the consumption of ketamine. We are happy to clarify that Ms Hopkins was detained for spreading racial hatred, which took place after the ketamine incident.”Hopkins took her case to the press regulator IPSO, arguing the update was not enough to “correct the misleading impression given to the millions of people who had been misinformed by the original headline”. She was concerned most readers would believe she had been detained for taking drugs, rather than alleged racism.Following an investigation the press regulator sided with Hopkins and concluded the original headline gave “the significantly misleading impression that the reason for the detention had been the consumption of ketamine”.As a result they concluded the Mirror had failed to take care over the accuracy of the piece and upheld the complaint."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/587862df72d1df9a0d7b712d394393c14db29d46/22_185_1879_1127/master/1879.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f09397b69494a9727d1898d6ce6e668","title":"buying house should i go ahead","story":"I’m under pressure and facing quite severe depression, and I’m wondering whether to pull outQ I’m currently in the process of buying a property, having to move out of the rented property where I have spent the last few years because my mother was the legal tenant and she has now gone into care since I am no longer able to cope with caring for her dementia.Throughout the process, I have felt pushed for time, friends pressured me into putting in an offer, and I have kept going with the conveyancing even though it has thrown up a number of issues over the title and building regulations approval. I’m also in the middle of a bout of quite severe depression. This is making it very difficult to trust my judgment when I keep feeling that I really don’t want this house. I have spent time sitting outside the house trying to imagine living there and sort out my feelings for it. I have actually told my solicitor to withdraw the offer once, but she persuaded me to take more time to consider it, and I have kind of drifted into keeping going. She is now saying that I will need to make an appointment to sign the contract, and I don’t think I can face doing it. I don’t know how to work out at this stage if this is just nerves and I should keep going, or if I should pull out this late in the day and maybe rent for six months to a year to actually find a place I want to spend the rest of my life in.SSA As a matter of some urgency, talk to your doctor about getting specialist help for your depression, whether in the form of medication or some form of therapy. Depression can affect your ability to think as well as your information-processing and decision-making skills. It can also lower your ability to adapt to changing situations and your ability to take all the steps to get something done. So I suspect that it’s your depression rather than your nerves that is getting in the way of your completing the purchase of the property and I’m not surprised that you can’t face signing the contract.However, I’m not sure that pulling out now would be in your best interests, not least because you’ll still have to pay the legal fees for the work your solicitor has done to date. In addition, a recent survey by the Bank of Scotland found that buying is cheaper than renting.As far as how you feel about the property, you must have liked it enough to put an offer in although it’s perfectly understandable in a period of such upheaval in your life that you’re experiencing cold feet. So I wonder if it would help to take the emotion out of the situation and think of the house in the same way that you would think about a rental property. Continuing with the purchase doesn’t mean that the house has to be your home for the rest of your life. You could think of it as the temporary stepping stone to a longer-term home."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd926972de1f98c4633c72a1b8918102bdc492d4/0_139_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bac571dd63d68d9b2dab8e9c6dc206ed","title":"readers recommend share great solo performances","story":"Nominate in the comments and a reader will pick the best eligible tracks for a playlist next week – you have until Monday 28 MayAnything goes this week – so long as it’s a single person performing throughout, with instrumentals also welcome.

Now they’re finally having second thoughts. But is it too late? In March, parliament’s foreign affairs committee asked me to come and tell them what to do about dirty Russian cash. As a journalist, I’ve spent much of my career writing about financial corruption in the former Soviet Union, but the invitation came as something of a surprise. After all, ever since I was at school in the 1990s, British politicians have welcomed Russian money to our shores. They have celebrated when oligarchs have bought our football clubs, cheered when they’ve listed their companies on our Stock Exchange. They have gladly accepted their political donations and patronised their charitable foundations.When journalists and academics pointed out that these murky fortunes could buy influence over our democracy and undermine the rule of law, they were largely dismissed as inconvenient Cassandras warning MPs to beware Russians bearing gifts. But earlier this year, after the poisoning in Salisbury of the former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia, those little-heeded prophecies jumped straight into the pages of Hansard. “To those who seek to do us harm, my message is simple: you are not welcome here,” Theresa May told the House of Commons on 14 March, in a speech that blamed Russia for the attack. “There is no place for these people, or their money, in our country.”Britain’s entire political class joined the prime minister in this screeching handbrake turn. MPs who had long presented the nation’s openness to trade as a great virtue suddenly wanted to be seen as tough on kleptocrats, tough on the causes of kleptocrats. Having allowing so much Russian money into Britain, these MPs were now seized with concern that Vladimir Putin might, through his power over his nation’s super-rich, be able to influence our institutions. Were we selling Putin the rope with which he would hang us, they wondered.That is why, on 28 March, I took a seat in committee room six, a chamber high up in the Palace of Westminster, with heavy furniture, a view over the River Thames, and a carpet like a migraine. The foreign affairs committee exists to monitor the work of the Foreign Office – essentially, to keep an eye on Boris Johnson – but its members can investigate any subjects they choose. This time, they had chosen to look into the money Putin and his cronies hold in Britain and its overseas territories, with a view to exploring fresh opportunities for sanctions.I had brought along a list of things I wanted to talk about: how we should improve our defences against money laundering how we need transparency about who owns property how MPs themselves must stop taking money from dodgy ex-Soviet oligarchs if they want others to do the same.But the first question, from Priti Patel, the former international development secretary, threw me: “Can you give the committee a sense of the scale of so-called ‘dirty money’ being laundered through London?” she asked.It is a vast question, worthy of a book in itself, and one that even the National Crime Agency would struggle to answer, let alone me. Then came her second question: “What assets has that hidden money gone into?”I tried my best – I mentioned property, private schools, luxury goods – but I think she and I both knew I’d fluffed it. I should have brought along specific examples, with times and dates and names. The embarrassing truth is that, although I have written about Russia and its neighbours for two decades, during which I have increasingly specialised in analysing corruption, it had never really occurred to me to ascertain precisely how much stolen Russian money had found a home in the UK, or to chart exactly where it had ended up.If someone like me had been this culpably incurious, it is hardly surprising that politicians with dozens of other priorities have had to scramble to understand what we’re facing. But for the past couple of months, I have belatedly tried to discover an answer to the foreign affairs committee’s questions.It turns out that the situation is even more worrying than I had suspected.One way to begin investigating exactly how much Russian money there is in Britain – and how much of it is dirty – is to look at the official data. According to Russia’s Federal State Statistics Service, at the end of September, Russian investors held financial assets in the UK worth a total of $3.5bn (£2.6bn). Our own Office of National Statistics provides a broader measure of all Russian investment in the UK, and assessed it – at the end of 2016 – at £25.5bn.That seems like a lot of money but, on a national scale, it’s small change. Investors from Finland alone have a stake in Britain worth twice that much, and we don’t lose sleep over the Finns destabilising our democracy. Sadly, the statistics are telling a misleading story. Russian money that moves through another jurisdiction before arriving in Britain isn’t counted as Russian and, since the overwhelming majority of money that enters and leaves Russia does so via tax havens such as Cyprus and the Bahamas, this means the official figures reflect only a small portion of the money the MPs were interested in.Over the past decade, £68bn has flowed from Russia into Britain’s offshore satellites such as the British Virgin Islands, Cayman, Gibraltar, Jersey and Guernsey. That’s seven times more money than has flowed directly from Russia into the UK. (On top of that, some £94bn has poured out of Russia into Cyprus, £13bn into Switzerland, and £23bn into the Netherlands, which has its own network of tax havens.)This wealth is not actually in the offshore centres – it is just registered there, which helps to obscure its origins. If you’re a Russian official whose wealth is wildly disproportionate to your salary, this anonymity allows you to spend your money in London without anyone realising you’re a crook. The French economist Thomas Piketty estimates that more than half of Russians’ total wealth is held offshore in this manner – some $800bn (£597bn) – and by a tiny number of people, perhaps just a few hundred. “Rich Russians live between London, Monaco and Moscow,” Piketty wrote in a blogpost in April. “Post-communism has become the worst ally of hyper-capitalism.”This means that there is not a single sewer pumping dirty Russian cash into the UK to which we can attach a meter, so as to measure its output. Instead, the cash is diluted into the great tidal flows of liquid capital that pour in and out of the City of London every day, from every corner of the globe. The ordure churned out by Russian crooks and kleptocrats is thus, thanks to the skilled attentions of the tax havens’ best brains, indistinguishable from ordinary investment.One of the few studies to forensically address this phenomenon came from analysts at Deutsche Bank, who, in 2015, looked at discrepancies in the records of money that flows into and out of the UK, and concluded that since the early 1990s, £133bn had arrived here without ever being publicly accounted for. They estimated that “less than half” of that sum was likely to be Russian, which means that Russians could have secret holdings here of up to £67.5bn, on top of the officially declared figure. (That is still a small amount compared with the holdings of German, American or French investors.)So whose money is this? How is it getting here? The bank’s analysts didn’t look into that question. However, had they wanted to, they could have walked down the hall and asked their colleagues, since it turned out that Deutsche Bank itself was a significant culprit in spiriting money out of Russia without informing the authorities. Less than two years after the report – called Dark Matter – was published, Deutsche Bank traders in Moscow were caught secretly moving $10bn (£7.5bn) of their clients’ money out of Russia by illegally exploiting the stock market. (As a result, the bank had to pay fines of $425m (£317m) in the US and £163m in the UK.)With institutions as sophisticated as Deutsche Bank working to hide Russian money, it is unsurprising that the total amount in the UK remains vague. So there is no real answer to the foreign affairs committee’s first question, except to say that the volume of Russian money in Britain is far larger than the official statistics would have us think.There are two reasons why we should be worried about this. The first is the low-probability but high-impact chance that Putin is hiding money here in the financial equivalent of sleeper cells, ready to slip out and buy influence when a crisis comes. The second is more significant: no one steals money if they can’t keep it. By letting Putin’s allies launder their stolen fortunes, and hide them in our country, we are drawing a line under their crimes, and rewarding them for actions we should not be condoning. Do we really want Britain to be the Kremlin’s fence?To attempt an answer to Priti Patel’s second question – what assets has all this money gone into? – we need to look at how wealthy Russians responded to the collapse of communism. They chose to spend their newly freed money on assets they had long been denied, and ones that could not be taken away from them. Above all, they bought luxury goods and property outside their own country, particularly in London.In early 1993, rich Russians were enough of a novelty for the Independent to report that three of them had bought flats in Kensington – at prices between £200,000 and £320,000 – under the headline “Property – a haven for rich refugees”. A month later, a Russian tycoon dropped £1.1m on a house in Hampstead, and then bought all the contents, too. “All he took into the house were four televisions and a vanload of carrier bags from Harrods,” an estate agent told the Evening Standard.Those purchases were the first ripples of a tsunami of wealth that crashed over the whole south-east of England, with spectacular consequences. In 2013, an analysis by the estate agency Knight Frank estimated that almost a tenth of all buyers at the top end of the London market came from the former Soviet Union, while rival estate agents Savills calculated that Russians like to buy the biggest houses of any group of purchasers. Average house prices in Kensington have risen eightfold over the past two decades, at least partly thanks to the influx from Russia.The poster boy for ostentatious expenditure has been the oligarch Roman Abramovich, who bought Chelsea football club in 2003. But even his London house – valued at £125m – was second ision in the spending league. In April 2011, a Ukrainian bought the world’s most expensive flat – the penthouse at One Hyde Park – for £136.4m. Five months later, a Russian bought Park Place, a stately home near Henley-on-Thames, for £140m. Russians who acquired homes valued merely in the tens of millions barely deserved notice.Among those lesser buyers was a banker called Grigory Guselnikov, a boyish 42-year-old who moved to London in 2008. He and his family came on tier 1 investor visas, which provide successful applicants with residency in exchange for an investment (of, at the time, £1m) in government bonds. In the eight years to September 2015, Russian citizens made up 764 of the 3,396 people who paid for these so-called golden visas – making them the second largest group of applicants, after Chinese citizens. This arrangement brought in around £800m of Russian investment, but the flow dropped markedly after April 2015, when the UK authorities began to check the origin of the money used to buy these government bonds. Once rigorous checks were put in place and the price of the visa was doubled, the number of applications fell sharply. In the final quarter of last year, just 16 Russians applied for a golden visa.Guselnikov believes that politicians’ sudden panic about Russian money in Britain is misplaced. When we met in his office in a grand terraced house on Grosvenor Square, he began by pointing out that Russian money had less influence over British business than people think. “I can’t recall any big enterprise controlled by Russians, or any big company. They open restaurants, wine shops, they buy luxury stuff like football clubs.“Where the impact is significant is real estate,” Guselnikov continued. “And primarily real estate in London.” His most high-profile investment was the shop that houses the Rolex concession on the ground floor of One Hyde Park, which he bought in 2011 for £12m (and sold for £20m three years later), and which demonstrates the peculiar dynamics at the top end of the property market, where the price of residential property is inflated beyond any conceivable income it could generate. “There is a shop, with advertising, 300 sq metres and the price is £12m. The flat above has no advertising, no shop, no ability to make money it’s the same size, 300 sq metres, and cost £25m. The shop was two times cheaper than the flat, that was really funny,” he said, with a laugh.His second point was that it was a misconception to think Russians are Machiavellian masterminds buying up slabs of Britain in order to undermine us from within. “You have to understand why people buy real estate abroad – they see it as their pension, they want to ersify the risk. In Russia, you have to be ready to lose everything, you never know what will happen,” he said. “They just spend money here. They don’t invest, they spend.”One reason the Russian super-rich come to Britain, Guselnikov said, was for education. His own children attended private schools, although they now have British passports, so they were not counted among the 2,806 Russian children attending schools surveyed by the Independent Schools Council last year. By multiplying that total with the average fees parents pay, we can calculate that a minimum of £48.3m comes to Britain’s private schools each year from Russia.Guselnikov said banks had become more stringent in their checks on the provenance of money in the last few years, so it was unlikely that significant flows of dirty money were entering the UK from Russia any more. But he conceded things had been different in the past. “If any dirty money is invested in UK property, it was before 2008 or before 2011 at the latest, not now. I don’t think the UK’s attractive any more, I don’t think it’s possible any more,” he said.It may well be that, as Guselnikov said, many honest Russian businesspeople have indeed been behind these purchases of London property. However, thanks to tax havens and skilled enablers from the world’s major financial institutions, their money has been mingled with the proceeds of theft, bribery and corruption. Imagining that Britain will be unscathed by this influx is the macro equivalent of letting a kidnapper, a bent copper, and a heroin trafficker move into your village, and still expecting warm chats at the school gates.Transparency International published a report last year, which, relying only on public sources of information, identified 160 properties in the UK, together worth £4.4bn, that had been bought by what it called “high-corruption-risk iniduals”. Most of those properties were in London, and half of them were within three miles of Buckingham Palace – and that is just a fraction of the true total. “There is currently no credible deterrent in place for money-laundering failings from estate agents,” the report noted.Two years ago, a former fund manager called Bill Browder gave evidence to parliament’s home affairs committee in which he revealed how $30m (£22m) that had been stolen from the Russian state by a group of corrupt police officers and officials had come to the UK, via 12 different banks, and been spent on an array of luxury goods: $176,000 went on chartering a private jet $192,000 on redecorating a yacht $20,000 on private school fees $41,000 on a wedding dress $295,000 to pay off an exclusive women-only credit card that offers “the most privileged and luxurious service”.Browder, who was born in the US but is a British citizen, ran a successful Moscow-based fund until 2007, when the corrupt officials fraudulently claimed ownership of two of his investment companies. They realised that, by fiddling the books, they could claw back the $230m in taxes that he had paid on the year’s profits, which is what they did. The $30m that ended up in the UK derived from this act of grand larceny. When Browder’s lawyer Sergei Magnitsky exposed the fraud, he was arrested and detained in jail, where he was beaten and denied treatment for pancreatitis until he died. Browder has devoted the years since Magnitsky’s death to seeking justice for his lawyer, and punishment for those responsible. He employs a team of forensic accountants, who have traced the movement of the money that was stolen from the Russian budget.The spending that he described to parliament fitted the pattern laid out by Guselnikov: it was being blown on luxury goods, rather than being invested to win influence over British politics or society. But that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t be concerned about it. This money should have been paid as taxes and spent on hospitals, schools and other services in Russia. Instead, it had been stolen from taxpayers and splashed on an absurd array of goodies. This is the kind of money Britain has been happily fencing for decades. Even now, British MPs only seem to care about it because its owners might harm our national security, rather than because it should be returned to the people it was originally stolen from.Browder told the home affairs committee that he had traced chunks of the stolen money to 11 other countries – including France, Switzerland and the US – and investigators in every one of those countries had opened criminal cases based on the information he provided. But in Britain – where he had spoken to the politan police, the Serious Organised Crime Agency (now part of the National Crime Agency), the Serious Fraud Office, and HMRC – he had been turned away every time.Why was Britain the only country that declined to act on the information Browder provided? His conclusion was that too many influential people – lawyers, bankers, accountants, property developers – were dependent on dirty Russian money for their livelihoods. “If that money was stopped,” he said in 2016, “certain people would find themselves without businesses, and I think those people have political weight in this country.”Many British institutions have indeed accepted donations from wealthy Russian businesspeople: Sadiq Khan’s City Hall from Elena Baturina, whose husband was mayor of Moscow the Conservative party from Lubov Chernukhin, whose husband was one of Putin’s ministers, and who paid £160,000 to play tennis with Boris Johnson and David Cameron in 2014.But it is not venal politicians who are stopping British police conducting investigations into the laundering of Russian money in the UK. According to Tristram Hicks, who was the detective superintendent in charge of economic crime at the Met until 2009, and who now acts as a freelance consultant to police forces around the world, the problem is far more serious than that.In order to prosecute a foreign crook in Britain, you need to prove their money originated in a crime of some kind, and that requires evidence from overseas. Essentially, if you want to prosecute a Kremlin insider, you need evidence from the Kremlin, which naturally it will not provide, and that stops investigations from progressing. And this is not just a British problem. After France, Switzerland and the Netherlands received information from Browder that some of the stolen $230m had been spent in their countries, they froze the assets in question – but their criminal investigations are yet to secure convictions. Only US prosecutors have managed a result, and even that was just an out-of-court settlement, without an admission of guilt by the defendant. “You cannot underestimate the technical hurdle that is bringing the evidence to a British standard for a British court,” Hicks said.That isn’t the only obstacle to investigating money laundering. Given that all wealthy Russians have political connections – otherwise, they wouldn’t be wealthy – if the UK does gain cooperation from Russian investigators in a prosecution, the defendant will invariably claim, often with good reason, that he is being politically persecuted, which allows his lawyers to discount the evidence being used against him.Take Andrey Borodin, the owner of that £140m house in Henley-on-Thames. He arrived in Britain in 2011, pursued by Russian charges of having defrauded his own bank. Borodin insisted the charges were politically motivated, and gained asylum here. Had prosecutors brought charges in the UK, his lawyers could have discounted any evidence from Russia as the revenge of political rivals, and Hicks conceded this would essentially doom the prosecution’s case. “That’s hard to argue against,” he said.There is also a third difficulty that Hicks didn’t address, which is just as serious. If a wealthy, ruthless Russian faces investigation, he can stop any chance of prosecution by killing the witnesses. This may well have been what happened to Alexander Litvinenko, who was murdered with radioactive polonium-210 in 2006, and who was working with Spanish and British authorities to expose Russian money flows. It may also explain the death of Alexander Perepilichny, a 44-year-old banker who was helping Browder’s team to understand the destination of the $230m stolen from the Russian budget, and who died while jogging in Surrey in 2012. Investigators at first thought he had suffered a heart attack, but it appears that he may have been poisoned with a rare plant extract.In short, to bring a successful money-laundering prosecution against a wealthy Russian, officers need to win cooperation from Moscow, which is all but impossible to convince a UK court that any cooperation that does result was not politically motivated, which is extremely difficult and then to keep their witnesses alive, which has proven rather hard. In the circumstances, it’s not surprising that the NCA decided bringing a prosecution in the Magnitsky case was not the best use of its resources.The amazing thing is that we have tolerated this situation for so long. Britain has consistently welcomed Russian money, and consistently ignored the warnings of those concerned about what it is buying. In March 2000, when Putin was still just acting president and had spent six months pulverising Chechnya, Tony Blair dashed to St Petersburg to be the first western leader to secure a meeting with the new man, and to urge more investment in each other’s countries.At least Blair could claim not to have known what kind of man Putin was, but David Cameron had no such excuse. In September 2011, Cameron went to Moscow to seek business for the City of London, although most of the facts that are currently concerning MPs about Russia were already known. Litvinenko had been murdered five years previously, and Russia had given one of the Met’s suspects in the case a seat in parliament. Magnitsky had died in jail two years earlier, and his tormentors were walking free. But Cameron went to Moscow anyway.“The whole point about trade is that we are baking a bigger cake and everyone can benefit from it and this is particularly true, perhaps, of Russia and Britain. Russia is resource-rich and services-light whereas Britain is the opposite,” Cameron told students at Moscow State University, on a trip that also involved meetings with Putin and his then placeholder president Dmitry Medvedev.In his speech, Cameron boasted that Russian companies accounted for a quarter of share offerings on the London Stock Exchange. “Governments need to remember that businesses don’t have to invest in our country – they choose to. And we need to help them make that choice,” Cameron said. “It means minimising the burden of regulation so that business and entrepreneurship can flourish.”With a prime minister who considered regulations on the origin of money to be a burden, it’s unsurprising that not many of them were made. This approach did not of course begin with Cameron, or even with Blair. In fact, it goes back to the mid-20th century. After the second world war, Britain was all but bankrupt, the City of London was somnolent, and economic power rested on Wall Street. City bankers wanted to get back into business, but were frustrated by the weakness of the pound, and its unsuitability as a means to finance the world’s trade.Their salvation came from an unlikely quarter: the Soviet Union, which didn’t want to keep its dollar reserves in US banks. Instead, it kept them in London, where British banks began lending them to each other in an entirely unregulated market – they became known as “Eurodollars” – thus giving birth to offshore finance, and providing the City with the startup capital it needed to get back in business. By the end of the communist period, Soviet institutions routinely sent their money through Britain’s offshore territories, and the City was booming. The Central Bank in Moscow even had a shell company in Jersey, which it used to hide money from the government that it was supposedly a part of.This is one of the problems with trying to ascertain the volume of dirty Russian money in London: how far back do we go? Do the fees Midland Bank received for banking Soviet money in the 1950s still count as Russian cash, and if so, are they dirty? Does the commission the estate agent earned by selling those flats in Kensington in the early 1990s count as dirty money? And what about the £800m that Russians paid for government bonds in return for golden visas? Or the $41,000 of Magnitsky money that was spent on a wedding dress in London? How many times does money have to circulate in the economy before we decide it’s not dirty any more?This money is so deeply embedded in the UK that extracting it, or even identifying it, would be an unrivalled feat of investigation. “It would be impossible,” says Prem Sikka, professor of accounting at Sheffield University. “They have the big accountancy firms advising them where best to stash the money, to conceal it, to disguise it, all kind of things. The brains of this pinstriped mafia are available to everyone. They’re for hire.”Recently, I spoke to Jon Benton, who led teams fighting dirty money at the Met and the NCA, and advised Cameron at the Cabinet Office, until his retirement in 2016. “We used to get these suspicious activity reports coming in, Russian ones, all the time. It would be for an investment or a property or a load of other things,” Benton said. “You’re looking at something that doesn’t look right, doesn’t smell right, but we had a tiny number of resources. To get caught up in some really complex Russian money-laundering case, when we weren’t going to get any assistance – you have to weigh it up. Do I try to throw lots of resources at this, when I know I’m really going to struggle to get the door open?”Benton was optimistic about the introduction of so-called unexplained wealth orders, which came into effect in February this year. Once a UWO has been issued, property is frozen, and its owner has to respond and justify why they own it. But that will only confiscate property, Benton noted. It won’t put anyone in jail.“The time when we might have been able to do something about this was 20 years ago, when it wasn’t particularly sophisticated, and the large sums of money were just arriving in the country,” he said. By ignoring the provenance of dirty cash, and allowing it to be spent on property, British authorities have cleansed it of its taint: it is legitimate investment now. “Unpicking all that is a real challenge. The reality is that it’s probably the hardest area to penetrate in the world.”We don’t know how much dirty money there is in the UK, nor do we know exactly where it is, and there’s nothing we can do about it. Or rather, there’s nothing we can do about it with the laws as they stand, and without giving greater resources to law enforcement agencies. Almost 100,000 UK properties are currently owned via offshore companies, obscuring their ownership, many of them undoubtedly by Russian criminals and kleptocrats we could happily do without. The government has promised to force these offshore companies to disclose their true owners, but that won’t be until 2021. For the next three years, criminals will be free to profit from their property in the UK without admitting they own it. Why can’t we hurry that up? To answer both of Priti Patel’s questions – how much money is there, and where is it? – we need transparency.The foreign affairs committee published its conclusions this week, drawing on the evidence that I and others gave it, and they were impressively robust. Its report demanded a more coherent government approach to the “assets stored and laundered in London (which) both directly and indirectly support President Putin’s campaign to subvert the international rules-based system, undermine our allies, and erode the mutually reinforcing international networks that support UK foreign policy”.Earlier this week, it was reported that Abramovich is finding it hard to renew his British visa, and some newspapers are speculating that this suggests Britain is already pioneering a new approach to Russian money, one that demands checks on the fortunes even of the very richest, and even when there is no apparent evidence of corruption. We do not yet know the reasons for the delay in the Chelsea owner’s visa, but such checks should be welcomed anyway: in cases where evidence emerges that someone is corrupt, that person should be kept out of Britain. But this alone is insufficient we need to find the dodgy money that is already here. Confiscating it and finding a way to return it to the Russian people would diminish those who mean us harm, while simultaneously helping those we wish to befriend.That requires strengthening Britain’s investigative power. The National Crime Agency and the UK’s police forces currently lack the resources to bring the prosecutions that could really make a difference to criminals’ calculation about whether to bring their money here. If we wish to prevent Russian kleptocrats from buying our country, we need to start catching them and their enablers in the act, and prosecuting them. That is the only true deterrent.• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7590d7e1289de916add482294d6e027c951f874d/0_250_4010_2406/master/4010.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=44549b0677266ca2310aaf583170242c","title":"cricket first test england new low pakistan","story":"England’s bold new era proved something of a damp squib after a limp batting performance on day one at Lord’s left them facing an uphill battle in the first Test with Pakistan.There was one negative for Pakistan, though, as they were spoken to by the ICC anti-corruption officer after a couple of their players were spotted wearing what appeared to be smart watches out in the middle.Joe Root, the England captain who has called on his players to up the ante after a poor winter, was as culpable as any of the batsmen with a loose drive as he went for four their sub-par 184 all out that followed was compounded when the tourists reached 50 for one in reply.Not since 1955 against South Africa have England won the toss at Lord’s and returned a lower total batting first – from 133 all out they went on to win by 71 runs. Alastair Cook, who top-scored with 70, is now hoping for a similar turnaround.“Pakistan bowled good lines and lengths and got their rewards. It could be one of those first innings plays fourth-innings matches. Or I could be totally wrong. They gutsed it out well but their 50 for one could be 80 for four, 120 for seven and the game changes.”On the dismissal of Root, who has returned to No\u0026nbsp3, Cook added: “We’ve all played a bad shot and will play another as a batter you don’t mean to nick it. Sometimes you have to hold your hands up and say ‘bad shot’. But the bloke averages 50 and is a world-class player, so we don’t need to worry. If he scores 150 in the second innings it doesn’t matter, does it?”While there was no suggestion of any wrongdoing by Pakistan, an ICC spokesman told ESPNcricinfo: “Apple watches in any way connected to a phoneWifi or in any way capable of receiving comms such as messages, are not allowed. In effect, it is considered a phone unless ‘disabled’ and just a watch.”Hasan, who took a career-best four for 51, added: “Yes, the anti-corruption officer came to us and told us this is not allowed, so nobody will wear it again.

By the end, this was a familiar story, a dominant all-round performance spearheaded by the brilliance of Ben Barba – however, this victory carried extra significance, you feel.Only twice throughout the entirety of last season were Castleford beaten here St Helens have achieved that themselves in the last fortnight, following their victory in the Challenge Cup. That, if anything, underlines just how far ahead Justin Holbrook’s side are of the field at present.Hearts will have been in mouths midway through the second half here when Barba hobbled off after long since assuring another victory for the Saints. His odds surely continue to shorten for the Man of Steel award after this latest performance.How relieved St Helens fans will have been to hear Holbrook deliver a reassuring post-match update on the full-back, saying: “He’s fine, he’s just got a couple of bumps and bruises.” With a Challenge Cup quarter-final against Hull a week away, those words may have been the most welcome of the night for the supporters.The fact Castleford dominated last year’s regular season – much like the Saints are doing this – and ultimately failed to win the Grand Final should at least provide hope to them, and the rest, that things can change come play-off season but this was a chastening evening for them.A late flurry of tries aside, which added some respectability to the scoreline, they were well-beaten. “Players have got to be able to do their jobs better,” said the Castleford coach, Daryl Powell. “Too many of our players have to change if we are to have a chance of doing anything.”In effect, victory felt assured for the Saints by half-time, when they were leading 22-4 thanks to four wonderful tries, the pick of which was a sensational inidual effort from Barba, who raced the length of the field. He was ably assisted by the stand-off, Jonny Lomax, who will have done his England hopes no harm with this performance.Barba’s departure failed to stunt their attacking prowess while Jake Trueman and Oliver Holmes were among Castleford’s late scorers.The Saints finished the scoring with two wonderful breaks that were both finished by Théo Fages as their dominance at the Super League summit continued."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f183d9937a705b78a19c48d286edd2031e262242/149_311_5091_3054/master/5091.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=773dcc18600aac09386e55787cc05f9e","title":"amazon alexa recorded conversation","story":"The company, which has insisted its Echo devices aren’t always recording, has confirmed the audio was sentNo matter how suspicious it has seemed that Amazon is encouraging us to put listening devices in every room of our homes, the company has always said that its Echo assistants are not listening in on or recording conversations. Over and over again, company spokespeople have promised that they only start recording if someone says the wake word: “Alexa”.It’s a spiel Danielle, an Alexa user from Portland, Oregon, had believed. She’d installed Echo devices and smart bulbs in every room in her house, accepting Amazon’s claims that they were not invading her privacy. But today she asked the company to investigate after an Alexa device recorded a private conversation between her and her husband and sent it to a random number in their address book without their permission.Danielle found out her Alexa was recording when she received an alarming call from one of her husband’s colleagues saying: “Unplug your Alexa devices right now, you’re being hacked.”She told KIRO-TV in Seattle that at first she didn’t believe the co-worker, but then she said: “You sat there talking about hardwood floors.” Danielle realised the colleague must have heard everything.“I felt invaded,” she told KIRO-TV. “A total privacy invasion. Immediately, I said, ‘I’m never plugging that device in again because I can’t trust it.’”An Amazon customer service representative confirmed that Danielle’s audio had been sent to the number and apologised but didn’t provide any information about why the device had been activated. A spokesperson for the company said it had “determined this was an extremely rare occurrence”.At 6pm ET on Thursday, an Amazon spokesperson provided an updated statement with an explanation for why they believe Alexa forwarded the conversation. They said: Recognising the improbability of this series of mishaps occuring, they added: “As unlikely as this string of events is, we are evaluating options to make this case even less likely.”Although Amazon maintains this was a malfunction rather than proof Alexa is always listening, the company has filed patent applications in the past for functionalities that involve always listening, such as an algorithm that would analyse when people say they “love” or “bought” something.

In the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, UK citizens more than ever need reassurances their data is as safe as it can be and that organisations are accountable for it.”She said businesses would now have to prove they had been given permission to use a inidual’s information, including contact details.“Except in certain, limited instances, organisations now must demonstrate they have our explicit consent to process our sensitive personal data. Generally, we’ve also given greater control to the British public over how their data is used. No doubt like me you’ll have received a flurry of emails in recent weeks from the organisations currently holding your data, and perhaps some you weren’t even aware did, asking for you to re-submit this consent.”The cascade of emails from businesses has become the most visible consumer-facing effect of the new regulation, sent by firms who want users to actively give their consent to remain on a mailing list. But, according to the Information Commissioner’s Office, such emails aren’t necessary to comply with the law.“Some of the myths we’ve heard are, ‘GDPR means I won’t be able to send my newsletter out anymore’ or ‘GDPR says I’ll need to get fresh consent for everything I do’,” Steve Wood, the deputy information commissioner, wrote on the organisation’s website earlier this month. “I can say categorically that these are wrong … You do not need to automatically refresh all existing consents in preparation for the new law.”Campaign groups and political parties who have come to rely on large email mailing lists to contact supporters could find they lose one of their main ways of communicating with the public. It has been suggested that businesses could be forced turn to more traditional methods – such as targeting customers with direct mail through the postal system – to reach customers.As the GDPR deadline neared, some websites and services started to push users to agree to onerous new terms of service before they could continue on to their destination. Websites run by Oath, the media firm formed through the merger of Yahoo! and AOL, received a blanket request on Thursday morning, asking users for consent “to use your … data to understand your interests and personalise and measure ads”. Users could click OK to move on, or follow a chain of further links to discover that the consent granted involved sharing data with more than a hundred ad networks. Another Oath site, Tumblr, placed a similar clickthrough before users. The blogging platform did offer some links to understand “how our partners use this data”. However, even this background information was hosted on Tumblr blogs, meaning users had to accept the terms in order to read information about the terms they were accepting. The US media network NPR took a simpler approach. Users could either agree to the new terms, or decline and be taken to a plain-text version of the site, looking for all the world like it had last been updated in 1996.It wasn’t just websites. PC hardware maker Razer issued an update to one of its computer mice, warning that users may find their devices weren’t working if they didn’t update Chinese smart-home manufacturer Yeelight disabled inter-connected lightbulbs because of the data protection regulation.And a growing number of companies are taking the nuclear option to ensure compliance: blocking all European users from their servers.Instapaper, a service owned by the US firm Pinterest which enables users to save articles to read at a later date, became the latest to disconnect European customers on Thursday. It said the cutoff was temporary while it made the required changes, and told users: “We apologise for any inconvenience, and we intend to restore access as soon as possible.” Pinterest did not respond to a request for comment.Other companies have taken a more permanent approach. Unroll.me, an inbox management firm, announced it was completely withdrawing services for EU companies due to an inability to offer its product – which is monetised by selling insights gleaned from reading users’ emails – in a way that was compatible with EU law. “We are truly sorry that we are unable to offer our service to you,” the company told EU users.American media network A+E has blocked EU visitors from all its websites, including History, and some multiplayer online games, including Ragnarok Online, have switched off their EU servers.Other firms have not gone so far as to blame the new regulation but have closed EU operations with convenient timing. Crowdpac, a political fundraising organisation set up by David Cameron’s former advisor Steve Hilton, announced it was closing its UK wing “for business reasons” until further notice. The company, which was still raising funds in the UK as recently as Sunday, now says it “hopes one day to be back”.Klout, a social media analytics service, and Super Monday Night Combat, an online game, will shut down on Friday. Lithium, the owner of Klout, said: “Klout no longer made sense as a standalone service. The upcoming deadline for GDPR implementation simply expedited our plans to sunset Klout.”Brian Honan, a data protection expert, said he viewed the shutdowns as a reasonable consequence of the new law. “The GDPR’s primary goal is to enhance the protections around the gathering and processing of the personal data belonging to iniduals residing within the European Union,” he said.“Companies have had well over two years to prepare for the enforcement date and to be ready.”Unfortunately, even going to the extremes of blocking every user based in the EU might not be enough to inure companies from the consequences of GDPR: the law applies to data processed on EU citizens wherever they are based in the world."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a90a16d09b702c885465fef2c48e9a8fb2da5980/0_0_2988_1793/master/2988.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=befea1fef4e849400ce1209588a611ef","title":"marine le pens niece tipped as future far right leader drops family name","story":"Marion Marechal, granddaughter of National Front founder Jean-Marie Le Pen, changes surname but keeps rightwing viewsThe name Le Pen, for decades associated with anti-immigration and often racist politics in France, is so out of fashion that one of the leading members of the country’s far-right family has abandoned it.The move has further dismayed Jean-Marie Le Pen, the nationalist patriarch who co-founded France’s National Front (FN) party in 1972 and built it up into a formidable political force.First his daughter Marine led a campaign to “detoxify” the FN after taking over as leader in 2011 – in the process disavowing Le Pen senior’s history of incendiary rhetoric. During the 2017 presidential election Marine Le Pen used only her first name on campaign material in a bid to widen her appeal, and she plans to confirm a name change for the party on 1 June as part of a rebranding exercise.Now granddaughter Marion Marechal-Le Pen, often tipped as a future leader of the far right despite stepping back from public life last year, has dropped one of the most famous – and infamous – names in French politics.“Marion perhaps thinks that it is too much of weight to carry,” Jean-Marie Le Pen said last week.On her social media accounts Marion has changed her profile names from Marion Le Pen to simply Marion Marechal and announced she intends to be known by the latter from now on.The change “was a way to demonstrate my transition to civilian life. I have never and will never feel ashamed of my name”, she told the rightwing Boulevard Voltaire website.Marion, a photogenic 28-year-old former MP and devout Catholic, added her mother Yann Le Pen’s name to her surname in 2012 as she launched her successful bid to enter parliament, she explained. Following reported tensions with her aunt Marine, she announced last May that she would not seek to defend her seat in the FN’s southern heartland in the Vaucluse area in order to spend more time with her daughter and work in the private sector.Some observers suspect she intends to return to politics, perhaps to succeed Marine, and a widely publicised appearance at a conservative political meeting in Washington in March fed speculation about her intentions.“Just like you we want our country back,” she told her American audience.Her first act since leaving politics has been to launch a study programme in the south-eastern city of Lyon called the Institute of Social Science, Economics and Politics (Issep).The school, which will offer masters qualifications with no formal recognition, will offer highly conservative courses with an emphasis on “cultural identity”.Its directors and teaching staff are mostly drawn from far-right and hard-right political circles, with conservative views on immigration, gay rights and French culture. It will open its doors to students in September."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/33000b90e34bd9d2d2bab0c856247a0c32a92b1a/0_393_5015_3009/master/5015.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f00ca193acc03624638546c9001d7286","title":"who betrayed anne frank book claims to shed new light on mystery","story":"Son of Dutch resistance member says Nazis were alerted to family’s secret chamber by Jewish collaboratorA new book has provided what it claims is fresh evidence that Anne Frank and her family were betrayed by a Jewish woman who was executed after the second world war for collaborating with the Nazis.The mystery of how the Franks were found in a secret annex in a building on Amsterdam’s Prinsengracht in August 1944 has thwarted formal investigations and troubled academics ever since.The involvement of Ans van Dijk, who was executed in 1948 after admitting to collaborating in the capture of 145 people, including her own brother and his family, had been previously claimed. But, the Anne Frank House museum and research centre had been unable to come to any conclusion, despite police investigations and its own studies.Fresh claims have now been made in a book by Gerard Kremer, 70, the son of a member of the Dutch resistance of the same name, who was an acquaintance of Van Dijk in Amsterdam.According to the book, Kremer Sr, who died in 1978, was the caretaker of an office building at the back of Prinsengracht on Amsterdam’s Westermarkt, two floors of which was taken over by the German authorities and the Dutch Nazi organisation the NSB during the occupation of the Netherlands.It is claimed that after her arrest on Easter Sunday 1943 by the Nazi intelligence service known as the the Sicherheitsdienst, Van Dijk became a regular visitor to the building, albeit in disguise. She would also use the telephones in the requisitioned offices, Kremer noticed.The book suggests that in early August 1944, Kremer overheard Van Dijk taking part in discussions in the Nazi offices about Prinsengracht, where the Franks were hiding. The Franks were arrested on 4 August, while Van Dijk was said to have left for The Hague.Anne had been hidden for two years in the concealed annex above the canalside warehouse with her father, Otto, mother, Edith, and sister, Margot.The 15-year-old was sent to the Westerbork transit camp, and on to Auschwitz before finally ending up at Bergen-Belsen, where she died in February 1945 from typhus. Her published diary s the period in hiding between 1942 and 1944.A spokeswoman for Anne Frank House said the museum had been in touch with the author of The Backyard of the Secret Annex, but that there remained no proof of Van Dijk’s guilt.“We consider Gerard Kremer’s book as a tribute to his parents, based on what he remembers and has heard. In 2016, the Anne Frank House carried out research into the arrest of the Frank family and the other four people in hiding in the secret annex.“Ans van Dijk was included as a potential traitor in this study. We have not been able to find evidence for this theory, nor for other betrayal theories.”Last year an FBI agent launched a cold case review into the Frank family’s discovery by the Gestapo in 1944. Investigative techniques developed in the past decade, including the crunching of big data to uncover leads, are being used by a team of 19 forensic experts led by Vince Pankoke. Van Hoof said the review led by Pankoke was examining the claims in the book.A 2010 book by Sytze van der Zee, a former editor-in-chief of the Het Parool newspaper, previously noted that many of Van Dijk’s victims had lived near Prinsengracht.David Barnouw, an emeritus researcher at the Dutch Institute for war, holocaust and genocide studies, offered a cautious response to the book’s claims, and suggested the Franks’ discovery may have been pure chance.Speaking to the De Volkskrant newspaper, Barnouw said there lacked a “smoking gun” in regard to Van Dijk’s claims. He said: “And I wonder if we’ll ever see that smoking gun. I fear that it is now too late to establish conclusively who it was.”After the war, Van Dijk moved to The Hague, where she was arrested at a friend’s home on 20 June 1945. Two years later she was charged on 23 counts of treason and brought to the special court in Amsterdam, where she confessed on all counts, and was sentenced to death.Her attempts to appeal the decision and gain a royal pardon on the grounds that she had acted out of self-preservation failed. In January 1948 she was executed by firing squad at Fort Bijlmer, in Amsterdam. She converted to Roman Catholicism the night before her execution."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Stefan Zait (45) died from serious head injuries after attack in Co Down on TuesdayLeave the jumpers and badges at home and make sure to bring ID as polls open from 7amBoth sides issue final appeals to 3.2m voters after long, isive campaignPartial indulgence for people unable to attend who follow event via broadcast mediaYounger people tend to be poorer at turning out on election day, as does rural IrelandUK proposals to maintain regulatory alignment with EU for limited time are a \u0026lsquofantasy\u0026rsquoIreland\u0026rsquos femicide rate on par with those of England, Scotland and WalesAgency tells D\u0026aacuteil committee CervicalCheck \u0026lsquoassertion does not accord with the facts\u0026rsquoEoghan Murphy says attempt to affect result could be made by questioning electoral register procedureFormer TCD professor Gerard Hogan is leading authority on Irish ConstitutionLocal authorities must tell property owners if they will face levy by next FridayNo defined structure at BreastCheck for managing patient information, says HiqaOwner wanted to expand Merchant\u0026rsquos Arch Bar to cater to \u0026lsquobus loads of tourists\u0026rsquoConference hears of \u0026lsquoexcessive duplication\u0026rsquo with \u0026lsquounnecessary form-filling\u0026rsquo2016 Census showed almost 400,000 people in Ireland live aloneFacebook video appears to show young men attempting to make exahusted pony stand upThree FF TDs indicate they will not back legislation for abortion up to 12 weeksFianna F\u0026aacuteil TD says article by Sammy Wilson and Owen Paterson has no recourse to factsR\u0026oacuteis\u0026iacuten Shortall claims Government \u0026lsquois not going to do anything\u0026rsquo to tackle issue"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3507562.1527190001!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"minister worried no campaigners may try to undermine vote","story":"As the moratorium takes effect both sides reflect on the referendum campaign and how the outcome of the vote will shape Ireland\u0027s future. \t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEoghan Murphy: the Minister says he has “full confidence in each of the presiding officers in each of our polling stations, that they will be able to do their job properly and accurately”.The Minister with responsibility for the electoral process has said he is “worried” that No campaigners may try to “undermine the integrity” of Friday’s vote on whether the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution should be repealed. Eoghan Murphy, the Minister for Local Government, said some campaigners could be attempting to undermine the referendum result by questioning the referendum process. Earlier this week in the Dáil, Independent Tipperary TD Mattie McGrath – a prominent No voter – said there are “irregularities” with the electoral register, claiming some people had been put on the register without their knowledge. He also asked if “international observers” would monitor the referendum process.Mr McGrath’s claims were rejected by Mr Murphy, and other figures campaigning for a Yes vote.Speaking to The , Mr Murphy said: “We have a very robust electoral process in this country. And I’d be worried that some people on the No side might be trying to undermine the integrity of the outcome by questioning that process and by questioning the procedure by which people get on the register of electors and go out and actually exercise their right and go and vote.“We don’t yet know what the outcome will be. Obviously we are advocating for a Yes and we hope there will be a Yes vote and I fully expect both people on the Yes and No side to respect the outcome of the vote.”Mr McGrath had claimed he had “emails from people all over the country who have been registered in Dublin when they have registered in Mayo, Cork and different places and they did not ask to be registered here”. “There were French students. And I had Majella on to me from Mayo. She was registered in Mayo, and I have confirmation of that, and she is now registered in Dublin, without asking or inquiring. There are irregularities.”He said he had written to Mr Murphy on the issue, and the Minister said he was aware of one incident of someone being added to the register when they should not have been. It did not, Mr Murphy said, mean this person is entitled to vote.A Garda spokesman said issues relating to polling cards are generally referred to local authorities.“If the council realises there is an issue, that cards have been issued fraudulently, then a returning officer would make a complaint to the Garda,” the spokesman said.Some local authorities have maintained that there will always be some slight anomalies in the voter registration process.Mr Murphy said he had “full confidence in each of the presiding officers in each of our polling stations, that they will be able to do their job properly and accurately”.“Where they have any concerns, it is their responsibility to ask questions, to seek identification. That falls to them to do that job but I have confidence in them to do that job and I have confidence in the processes that have been put in place.”Get the latest news and best analysis about the Referendum on the regulation of termination of pregnancy here"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3507678.1527192306!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"irish backstop provisions cannot be used for britain says eu","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish prime minister Theresa May:  “The UK thinks everything has to change on the EU’s side so that everything can stay the same for the UK,”  a senior EU official said. Photograph: Will OliverEPAProposals that the UK would use the Irish “backstop” provisions in Britain as well as Northern Ireland after Brexit will simply not be acceptable, the EU told British negotiators at talks in Brussels this week.A senior EU official on Thursday night described the proposals from prime minister Theresa May as a “fantasy”.The UK is proposing to maintain regulatory alignment with the whole of the EU for a limited period after transition out of the EU to avoid cutting the North off from the rest of the UK and to obviate the necessity for a border on the Irish Sea.But its negotiators were told during three days of talks here that “regulatory alignment was not available on an all-UK basis”, because it would mean a form of cherry-picking and a breach of fundamental single market rules.And the UK could not be allowed simply to commit to joint all-UK customs controls on a “time-limited basis” because they would “undermine the whole purpose of the guarantee”.The EU official warned that progress on the Irish border – “let alone substantive progress” – was proving “elusive”.The UK is suggesting the withdrawal agreement protocol and its backstop guarantee should include an assumption that an eventual alternative arrangement will be agreed for frictionless borders between the UK and the EU as a whole. But if such an agreement is not forthcoming, officials here say, there must be the backstop provisions to fall back on. Time-limiting their application would remove that guarantee.In the Northern Ireland strand of the discussions, they had made progress on issues such as the single electricity market, and VAT rules, but had not discussed the “crunch” issues of the Border, regulatory alignment and customs.The issue was raised, however, by the UK team in the discussion on the future relationshiptrade agreement, where they said that Ms May was determined to implement the backstop on an all-UK basis “through the overall EU-UK relationship”.The EU team said that the “backstop must be Northern Ireland-specific”.“We have to do away with the fantasy that there is an all-UK solution to this,” the senior official said.A senior official described the talks on the full range of Brexit issues, from Northern Ireland to the future relationship, as frustrating, observing that: “To paraphrase The Leopard by Tomasi di Lampedusa, I have the impression that the UK thinks everything has to change on the EU’s side so that everything can stay the same for the UK.”The  reported senior sources at the Brexit department, however, rejecting the suggestion that Brussels had dismissed the UK’s new backstop plan, suggesting that it was “simply a negotiating position” and that they believed the EU was open to the idea. “It’s a public stance for them to take during the negotiation,” one said.A No 10 source added: “This is what they do every time. As usual we’ve heard it all before. There’s nothing they’ve said which concerns us.”In their discussions of an overall trade deal, the UK rejected the suggestion from the EU of a free trade pact, and pressed their demands for a generalised system of mutual recognition and managed ergence. EU officials said that a system of mutual recognition, however, would not be available outside the single market – it would require higher external levels of trust than internally.-the-  each Tuesday,

frigate gulf serious naval deployment since 1971","story":"Sea Ceptor, which will be carried by the Royal Navy’s Type 23 frigates, provides a powerful shield against airborne threats, including hostile combat jets, helicopters and other missilesThe UK is to send a frigate to be “an enduring presence” in the Gulf, in the most serious naval deployment to the region in more than 40 years, the Defence Secretary has announced in a show of support for Nato.A Royal Navy Type-23 Frigate will be based from the UK’s new £40 million National Support Facility at Mina Salman in Bahrain, unveiled by Crown Prince Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa and the Duke of York last month.Britain has not had a similar posture since 1971, when HMS Juffair in Bahrain was closed following the country’s declaration of independence.Speaking at the Sea Power conference at the Royal United Services Institute, Gavin Williamson warned “liberty, justice and tolerance are under attack from every angle” and Britain must work with allies to defend common interests. “NATO couldn’t be more relevant”, he said.He said that Britain will invest heavily in the Middle East and weave a web of partnerships with allies.Sea Ceptor provides a powerful shield against airborne threats, including hostile combat jets, helicopters and other missilesA Navy spokesman told The  the Gulf forward deployment shows the Royal Navy is going back to the principle of being a more reactive and more available force”.The maritime force will work under Operation KIPION as part of the UK’s support to the US-led coalition of maritime forces in the region. The enduring commitment demonstrates Britain’s ongoing commitment operationally and diplomatically in the region, naval sources told The .Britain has had a presence in the Gulf for decades, but the three-week sea passage to deploy and recover a ship meant there were long periods with no Royal Naval assets in the region.The plan to base a Type-23 Frigate – and from the mid-2020s the next generation Type-31 – would likely see the whole ship’s company flown out to take over the vessel based in Bahrain.Routine maintenance of the ships would be carried out at the Mina Salman base, with the ship likely to remain in the region for about three years. The more comprehensive depth servicing every five to 10 years will be done in the UK. Gavin Williamson has announced the move in a show of support for NatoSmaller minehunter vessels have been based in the region for the last 10 years, but crews have deployed via Royal Fleet Auxiliary ships. The use of the new support base and a Type 23 frigate is a step change in naval capability.The Defence secretary also spoke of to the “increasing aggression and increasing assertiveness” of Russia. In 2010 the Royal Navy had to respond once to a Russian navy vessel approaching UK territorial waters. “Last year we had to respond 33 times”, he said.GDPR fraudsters con people out of thousands with wave of phishing emailsCanada restaurant blast: Bomb explosion injures 15 people in Mississauga as two suspects fleeIreland abortion referendum: voters head to polls as Leo Varadkar backs pro-choice campaignKirsty Wark: I want Question Time job when Dimbleby calls it a daySNP commission proposes income tax breaks to get immigrants to move to independent ScotlandHarvey Weinstein \u0026#39to be charged\u0026#39 over sexual misconduct allegationsHarvey Weinstein timeline: Key moments in Hollywood scandalVideo shows North Korea blowing up its Punggye-ri nuclear testing siteNorth Korea still open to talks with US as Donald Trump threatens Kim Jong-un after scrapping summitCalls for junk food to have graphic cigarette-style warnings on packagingEU accuses Britain of \u0026#39chasing fantasy\u0026#39 over plans to avoid hard Irish border in blistering attackUS denies involvement in Syria missile strike which kills 12 Putin and Macron question Trump\u0026#39s withdrawal from Iran deal and North Korea summitGardener\u0026#39s World presenter Rachel de Thame reveals she is battling breast cancer on live TVHow much water do you use in the morning?The Trouble with M\u0026ampS, review: a lacklustre account of how Marks lost its sparkHumans, series three, episode two review: Thoughtful science fiction with plenty of heart and dramaGrenfell survivors claim fire brigade\u0026#39s \u0026#39stay put\u0026#39 advice cost residents chance to escapeThe Grenfell Tower survivors: Lucky to escape, but living with the horror of what they sawWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"mi6 launches first television advert james bond image recruit","story":"MI6 has launched its first television advert as it attempts to recruit more women and shed its macho James Bond image. The spy agency is emphasising the soft skills it needs new entrants to have, including emotional intelligence, interpersonal skills, integrity and creativity, in an effort to attract more women and ethnic minorities to the service. The agency\u0027s first television advertising campaign shows a mother with her child in an aquarium. A shark gliding menacingly towards the boy who steps back in momentary alarm before turning to his mother who sweeps him up smiling in her arms.The voice over says: We are intelligence officers but we don\u0027t do what you think.

The trend is really worrying.”The government’s focus on improving the take-up of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (Stem) subjects could have played a part as figures show sciences and maths did not suffer the same fate at A-level. The number of entries in computing – one of the government’s flagship subjects – jumped by 26 per cent from 7,710 in 2017 to 9,685 this year. And uptake of the maths A-level rose by 3 per cent.Unions say the government’s exam reforms – such as the introduction of the tougher English GCSE– may also have deterred some students from studying English in sixth-form.Jill Stokoe, a policy advisor at the National Education Union, told The Independent: “I think part of it is the drive towards Stem.“With English, history and geography, it could be that the difficulty of the new GCSE specification has put people off at A-level.”And reforms – which mean AS levels no longer count towards final grades – are likely to have led to fewer students taking these subjects in Year 12 and then deciding to take them onto A-level.Figures show that entries for AS levels have fallen by almost 60 per cent this year – from 659,880 to 269,090 – continuing a trend triggered by the decoupling of AS levels from A-levels.UK news in picturesUK news in picturesAlastair Cook batting against Pakistan during the first test match of the summer at Lord’s cricket ground, London.

And in performingexpressive arts, entries among GCSE students plummeted by 40 per cent. Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the school headteachers’ union (NAHT), said: “Students’ experiences of a narrower curriculum at GCSE is now having an impact on their sixth form studies.”Disadvantaged students with lower grades do as well in medical schoolHe added: “It is now impossible to argue that the EBacc measure is not having a narrowing effect on young people’s choices at GCSE. “These reforms put schools in an impossible situation where they must reduce the opportunities they offer to pupils in order to satisfy an arbitrary government target.”A Department for Education spokesperson said: “The Government has worked with employers to reform GCSEs and make them gold-standard qualifications. They will prepare pupils for future success and help deliver the skills Britain needs to be fit for the future. Entries to the core academic EBacc subjects have increased, with over 4 million of these exams being taken this year, including significant increases to those taking the inidual sciences.They added: These subjects give pupils the best foundation to progress into further education and employment. Thanks to our reforms and the hard work of teachers, academic standards are rising with 1.9 million more children in good or outstanding schools than in 2010.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Is the adoption of other people\u0027s customs and cultures fair game or has political correctness gone mad?\u0026nbspDavid Barnett treads warily\u0026nbspLet’s get this out of the way: I am a straight, white, middle-aged man, so what follows you may take with a pinch of salt or disregard completely. But we’re going to talk, you and I, about the thorny issue of cultural appropriation.It was only a year ago that Oxford Dictionaries put the phrase into their official lexicons, with the definition, “the unacknowledged or inappropriate adoption of the customs, practices, ideas, etc. of one people or society by members of another and typically more dominant people or society.”Cultural appropriation is sometimes so blatant it smacks us in the face. The Black and White Minstrel Show ran on British television for – what seems now to us, looking back at it – and astonishing 20 years, from 1958.Even halfway through its run the show, in which white entertainers “blacked up” to sing songs in a Deep South of America style, was the subject of petitions calling for it to be taken off the air because of its in-your-face racism. It can hardly be seen now without an overwhelming feeling of embarrassment. How did we ever think that was acceptable?The show was harking back to the minstrel shows in 19th-century America, and blackface was a popular form of entertainment until the enlightenment of the 1960s, coupled with rising racial tensions across the US, finally put paid to it. Even Al Jolson, dubbed “the world’s greatest entertainer”, was renowned for performing in blackface. Jolson was Jewish, and while there can never be any excuses made today for blacking up, it’s interesting that in their 2008 book the Encyclopedia of American Jewish History, authors Stephen Harlan Norwood and Eunice G Pollack talk of Jolson’s 1927 movie The Jazz Singer in terms which suggest some kind of what we would today call intersectionality. For example: “Is there any incongruity in this Jewish boy with his face painted like a Southern Negro singing in the Negro dialect? No, there is not…The son of a line of rabbis well knows how to sing the songs of the most cruelly wronged people in the world\u0027s history.”Can a Jewish man really pretend to be a black man without racism? Is this cultural appropriation of the very worst kind or solidarity that only two historically subjugated peoples can appreciate? And what, then, of a Jewish woman who dresses up as a Japanese woman for entertainment?The cries of “cultural appropriation” were resounding around social media even before Netta Barzilai had finished her (ultimately competition-winning) performance of Toys, the Israeli entry in this month’s Eurovision song contest held in Lisbon.Netta wore a stylised kimono and was surrounded by dozens of maneki neko waving lucky cat statues. Twitter in particular was rather exercised by the thought of the cultural appropriation taking place before its very eyes. Or, I should say, mainly white Western Twitter. It seems the only people not too fussed were the Japanese themselves.According to the website soranews24, which repackages and discusses Japanese news stories for an English speaking audience, the overwhelming response on the ground seems to be a mildly nonplussed reaction.The site quoted from Japanese social media accounts which included the responses, “Culture is meant to be stolen. If it’s not worth stealing, then it isn’t culture”, “If people keep claiming ‘cultural appropriation’ then people will not touch our culture. Then, people will not understand our culture and it will be easier to become our enemy”, and, perhaps crucially, “Westerners care too much about silly things”.Is that the problem? Are we, Westerners, liberal Westerners, too over-sensitive of the feelings of others brought on by white guilt? Or are we right to call out what we think is wrong when we see it? Should we wait before speaking, to see what the actual people affected think? Or is it our duty to step in first?Perhaps it’s now we should go back to the Oxford Dictionaries definition of cultural appropriation, particularly the bit that talks about the “more dominant people or society”. Is Israel a more dominant culture than Japan? Or vice-versa? What do we think? What do they think?A couple of weeks before Eurovision, Eastern dress was setting Twitter alight again, this time when a Utah teenager posted online pictures of her wearing her prom dress which was actually a qipao, traditional Chinese dress. The 18-year-old was accused of cultural appropriation and casual racism. People of Chinese heritage chimed in with arguments on both sides of the debate, with some pointing out that the outfit was originally worn by women carrying out domestic duties, and thus not something to be really celebrated, and another writing, “I’m Asian and Chinese, you looked beautiful in that dress, I’m sorry you got bashed for it.”Cyprus\u0027 singer Eleni Foureira performs the song FuegoIsrael\u0027s singer Netta performs the song Toy Belgium\u0027s singer Sennek performs the song A Matter Of Time Estonia\u0027s singer Elina Nechayeva performs the song La ForzaCroatia\u0027s singer Franka performs the song Crazy Albania\u0027s singer Eugent Bushpepa performs the song MallCzech Republic\u0027s singer Mikolas Josef performs the song Lie To MeIreland\u0027s singer Ryan O\u0027Shaughnessy performs the song TogetherSwiss duo ZIBBZ\u0027s singer Corinne Gfeller performs the song StonesBulgarian group Equinox\u0027 singer Zhana Bergendorff (R) performs the song BonesLithuania\u0027s singer Ieva Zasimauskaite performs the song When We\u0027re OldFinland\u0027s singer Saara Aalto performs the song MonstersGreece\u0027s singer Yianna Terzi performs the song Oniro MouAustria\u0027s singer Cesar Sampson performs the song Nobody But YouAzerbaijan\u0027s singer Aisel performs the song X My HeartIceland\u0027s singer Ari Olafsson performs the song Our ChoiceArmenia\u0027s singer Sevak Khanagyan performs the song QamiMacedonian duo Eye Cue\u0027s lead vocalist Marija Ivanovska (R) and guitarist Bojan Trajkovski perform the song Lost And FoundBelarus\u0027 singer Alekseev performs the song ForeverNorway\u0027s singer Alexander Rybak performs the song That\u0027s How You Write A SongRomanian band The Humans perform the song GoodbyeSerbia\u0027s band Sanja Ilic \u0026amp Balkanika perform the song Nova DecaSan Marino\u0027s Jessika featuring Jenifer Brening perform the song Who We AreDenmark\u0027s singer Rasmussen performs the song Higher GroundPoland\u0027s singer Gromee feat.

The fashion shows routinely feature collections riffing off a range of global cultures. For the coming autumn, Gucci recently unveiled a series of headwear inspired by Sikh turbans. Vogue ran a photoshoot in its “Diversity Issue” last year with a model in full Japanese geisha outfit. Not unusual, and perhaps nothing wrong with it… save for in both cases (and in the Victoria’s Secret show last year in which a model flaunted a Native American-style headdress) all the models were white.Here’s where cultural appropriation smacks up against representation. Maybe if Victoria’s Secret had employed a Native American model, if Vogue had used a Japanese model, if Gucci had – as the Sikh Coalition suggested in the aftermath – used Sikh models who would have properly observed the correct way to wear what is, after all, a sacred clothing item, then the later dissemination of these items on to the high street might not be quite so problematic.There’s a difference, too, between fashion and performance. When I was very young, on a holiday at a Pontin’s camp on the North-West coast, I was wrapped in a blanket, had two stripes of lipstick put across my face, and a feather from a passing seagull taped to my head. I was entered into the fancy dress contest (I didn’t win). I was of course, a Red Indian, as Native Americans were called in those less-enlightened times.As bad as the Black and White Minstrels? Possibly. But “Red Indians” back then were almost a fictional, fairytale group of people, the image drawn from Monday matinee westerns not renowned for historical accuracy, from Peter Pan, from Hiawatha and Little Plum. Would I have dressed my children like that when they were the same age? Undoubtedly not. Times change. Sensitivities alter.Utah teenager, Keziah Daum, sparked a huge debate on Twitter about cultural appropriation after posting photos of her traditional Chinese prom dressAnd I look down at what I’m wearing right now as I type this. A T-shirt, which has its origins as an undergarment in 19th-century America. A pair of jeans, which were originally developed in Italy (Genoa, which gave rise to “jeans”) and France (the fabric of Nimes, or de Nimes, from which is derived “denim”). A pair of flip-flops (don’t judge me), evolved from the Japanese zōri which servicemen took back to America post-Second World War (though early flip-flops have been discovered in ancient Egyptian burial sites).I am a melange of styles borrowed, begged and stolen from around the world. Is this cultural appropriation, several generations down the line? Should I be wearing what my grandfathers wore? Polyester slacks and an Oxford shirt, a cardigan, brogues? Where is the line, and on which side of it are we?Music is another cultural appropriation battleground. Every time Katy Perry or Taylor Swift goes “ghetto” for another video, or Lana Del Ray puts on a Native American headdress, it’s there to see. White folks stole rock’n’roll from African rhythms filtered through the American South, we stole electronic dance music from the predominantly-black post-disco clubs of Chicago and Detroit, and Italy. Take away the cultural appropriation, and what’s left? A couple of rousing choruses of Knees Up, Mother Brown or The Lambeth Walk, perhaps.Should we talk about food? Those great British traditions such as pizza, or chow mein, or curry? A few miles from me, Bradford is awash with curry houses. The clientele is largely white. Is that cultural appropriation? Well, no, because most of the restaurants are owned and worked in by people of South Asian heritage. But what was deemed cultural appropriation was when, earlier this year, a restaurant called Fanny’s announced it was opening a venue for the purveying of “posh kebabs” in London’s Stoke Newington.The move was lambasted on Twitter because, for one, Stoke Newington is a hub for Turkish restaurants and takeaways… the people who, you know, invented the kebab. For another, because the people behind Fanny’s weren’t Turkish (one of the founders is called Claude Compton, for your information), and the tag-line “posh kebabs” intimated that these “lads from Fulham” were basically going to beat the Turks at their own game (as a side note, Fanny’s subsequently dropped the “posh” bit from their marketing and logo).Fanny\u0027s Kebabs finally dropped the \u0027posh\u0027 bit from their marketing (fannyskebabsInstagram)If you’ve made it this far, you might be wondering where I’m heading with all this. And the honest answer is, I just don’t know. Cultural appropriation seems, on the face of it, like it should be something that all of us should fight against, but the flip-side of that is knowing exactly just what it is and when we should call it out.As I said at the top of this piece, take what I say with a pinch of salt, given that I am a middle-aged white man. But where does that leave me, if we remove years of embedded cultural appropriation? Dressed in my grandad’s clothes, listening to a 78 of George Formby classics, and clutching a chip butty? And on that score, should I be calling cultural appropriation on the New York magazine The Insider’s awestruck piece last month on a Turkish restaurant that was selling this remarkable new thing, a sandwich stuffed with fries?The answer’s no, of course, because cultural appropriation will never affect me in the way it does other, marginalised people. I have working-class roots but I’m still pretty close to the top of the privilege chain all I can realistically get away with is some faux outrage at posh kids slumming it at Wetherspoons and Greggs for Instagram likes.But maybe those who identify as white, liberal allies should hit the pause button before calling out cultural appropriation, and just take a moment to think. The obvious stuff, the outright horror of the Black and White Minstrels and the more subtle but by no means any less problematic racism, yes, by all means, dig in. Dog-piling on teenagers for wearing a prom dress, maybe hold off a bit.Cultural appropriation is a big desert, and one on which we might have to draw our own personal lines in the sand as to what we know in our guts is wrong, and what we think might be, possibly, a little bit off.And with that, I bid you sayonara.Black and White minstralsor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The footage is about MI6 spies and the next scene should be of a James Bond type in a dramatic fight for survival. Instead, the camera pans out to show an aquarium and the visitors a woman reassuring her alarmed child.MI6’s first ever television advertisement is aimed at attracting recruits from ethnic minorities and women, and breaking stereotypes. The message is clear: the officer from the Secret Intelligence Service is not a macho white man, but the young black mother.MI6 are in the process of relaxing their rules of entry to reach the new recruitment pools. An official said: “We are making our Services’ nationality rules slightly more flexible to support our ersity agenda and a wider selection of candidates.”Blair denies knowledge of man tortured in Libya after MI6 renditionThere are no problems with getting people to join, say MI6, with 800 more staff due to be taken on to bolster the 2,700 strong cohort. There was a rush of applications after the nerve agent attack in Salisbury on Sergei and Yulia Skripal, something which tends to happen after high-profile cases involving terrorism and espionage.The aim of the campaign is to reach people who may not see the Secret Intelligence Service as a natural career. The voiceover for the advertisement says: “We are intelligence officers, but we don’t do what you think. It is not keeping your cool in the shark tank, it is picking up the silent cues that matter. Secretly, we are just like you.”MI6 have won a number of awards in recent years for promoting gender and ethnic equality. The latest figures, however, show that more progress needs to be made on both racial and gender balance. Overall, women make up 24.1 per cent in the senior civil service grade and 37.8 per cent among the non-senior category. There is not a single black or other ethnic minority member of the service’s senior staff and that group makes up just 6.8 per cent of the non-senior workforce.The advertisement will be first shown on Thursday evening. Alex Younger, the MI6 Chief, said at a preview for journalists: “I want to dispel the myths that still too often see potential candidates rule themselves out. The service I am proud to lead is global, modern and most capable with a deserved reputation of being one of the best intelligence services in the world.“My message remains simple, there is no ‘standard’ MI6 officer: if you have what it takes, then apply to join us. Our work is exciting, intellectually challenging and it matters. Regardless of background, if you have the skills we need and share our values, I want you to consider a career in intelligence in a service that reflects today’s society, MI6 needs the best people this country has to offer.”UK news in picturesUK news in picturesAlastair Cook batting against Pakistan during the first test match of the summer at Lord’s cricket ground, London.

She said: “I wanted a change after the birth of my third child. I wanted to do something that made a difference and this absolutely ticked that. Joining the service and serving the country seemed to be a worthwhile thing to do. I have found combining my job with my family life very manageable, certainly compared to the commercial world, which can be quite inflexible.”“I was apprehensive at first, I thought one of the requirements for the job was the ability to blend into the crowd, to be a grey man, which is not me, of course, at any level. But I find what I do interesting. I have been able to work against a full range of targets. I can put my views forward, challenge group think. I have been able to use my difference to my advantage.A senior director who had been 20 years with MI6 said an awareness of the need to be more inclusive “has been a process of evolution”. He wanted to stress the importance of thinking beyond the established norm and welcoming different views. “We are looking for people who are brave enough to speak up,” he said. “Having a more erse workforce will, we believe, help counter group think.”MI6’s head of recruitment, a mother of two children who has also spent 20 years in the service, said intelligence officers were required to have a “blend of emotional intelligence and impersonal skills”, an ability to form “instrumental relationships”, a “strong sense of integrity and creativity”, a “desire to work and live overseas” and “an interest in foreign affairs and culture”.The aim of the advertising campaign was to find a twist on the 007 theme. “The concept was to play on the Bond image but to explain very clearly that this was not James Bond,” she said. “MI6 can take advantage of this Bond image and then turn it on its head”.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Due to be released this summer, the\u0026nbspaction plan will be an official response to the survey’s findings.The news comes as the UK falls to fourth in Europe in the Rainbow Index, a yearly ranking of the progress made in LGBT+ rights, having topped the list in 2012.Though given the Conservative Party’s history of dragging their heels on LGBT+ rights, as well as May’s personal history of voting against progressive legal reform, not everyone is convinced. The Labour Party responded by labelling the plan as “empty PR”.Paul Twocock, director of campaigns, policy and research at Stonewall UK, welcomes the Government’s intention to publish an LGBT+ action plan. Stonewall research reveals that 20 per cent of LGBT+ people have experienced a hate crime within the last 12 months. For trans people, this figure increases to a staggering 40 per cent. Paul believes that the action plan, combined with the government’s recently reaffirmed commitment to launching a consultation on reforming the 2004 Gender Recognition Act, will improve life for LGBT+ people in the UK.Both the action plan and reform of the Gender Recognition Act should allow us to make important steps forward towards building a society where LGBT+ people are truly accepted, everywhere and by everyone and it will mean this government can maintain the UK’s impressive record as a world leader on LGBT+ equality.Susie Green, CEO of trans and gender identity charity Mermaids, cites hate crime as a major concern of trans youth. Susie believes that May’s action plan must urgently address this hostility, which is fuelled by sensationalist media coverage.We need stronger controls around media coverage of transgender people, and particular attention needs to be given to the use of online media to perpetuate hate crime. Young people and trans women in particular are targeted on social media, with little done to protect them.Susie would like to see statutory training for all areas of service around transgender children and young people, including schools, social care, police and healthcare. Lesson plans in school covering transgender identities should be mandatory, and included from primary school age.Teachers need to be equipped to deal with conversations around transgender children and young people, which is clearly not the case at present.Concerns over outdated sex and relationships education are also expressed by Liam Beattie, relationships and sex education policy lead at Terrence Higgins Trust. While Wales announced a progressive overhaul of their SRE curriculum, England still lags behind in its approach towards gender and sexuality in the classroom.\u0026nbspBeattie explains that a lack of inclusive sex education at school made him feel “invisible”.LGBT+ sex and relationships must be included when relationships and sex education becomes compulsory in all English schools from next year. Looking back, I’m still angry that I left school completely oblivious to the realities of HIV or the fact that, as a bisexual man, I was at higher risk than my sisters or straight friends.My gaps in knowledge had to be filled through speaking to gay and bi friends or using dating apps. We can’t continue to let young people down like this. The feelings of isolation and shame that follow so many LGBT+ people from childhood to adulthood can have a corrosive impact on their mental health. As a result, LGBT+ people are twice as likely to have a mental health condition compared to heterosexual people. Upon the announcement of May’s action plan, Paul Martin OBE, chief executive at LGBT Foundation, said:LGBT+ people continue to face a significant number of inequalities from poorer physical and mental health, increased risk of hate crime and discrimination, to loneliness and isolation and negative experiences in employment and we hope that a commitment to tackling these key issues will be outlined in the upcoming action plan.To alleviate these inequalities, human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell believes that the LGBT+ action plan must urgently confront homophobia in schools. He says:Nearly half of all LGBT+ pupils have been bullied, often leading to anxiety, depression, truancy, academic under-performance and self-harm.To combat anti-LGBT+ bullying and other forms of hate crime such as racism, the Prime Minister should make equality and ersity lessons mandatory in every school, from the first year of primary education onwards. The health and welfare of pupils must take priority.There should be no opt outs for faith schools and no right of parents to withdraw their kids.\u0026nbspAs Home Secretary, May faced criticism for her handling of asylum claims relating to sexual orientation and gender identity. At present, LGBT+ asylum seekers are still detained indefinitely, despite never having committed a crime. Leila Zadeh, executive director of the UK Lesbian and Gay Immigration Group, told indy100:An action plan to improve the lives of LGBT+ people should include clear and tangible commitments to improving the wellbeing and safety of LGBT+ people who are seeking asylum.As long as LGBT+ asylum seekers can be detained or made to share accommodation, there will be risks to their personal safety. The government should also review the quality of its decisions on asylum applications by LGBT+ people, to ensure none are returned to persecutionNigerian LGBT+ rights activist Bisi Alimi would like to see a national monument commemorating the struggle for LGBT+ rights in the UK. He believes that this will help to imprint the memories of the LGBT+ movement in public consciousness.This monument should put into account the iniduals across race, gender, religion and age that have shaped Britain pre and post Section 28 and should form\u0026nbsppart of the school curriculumThough while there are many voices welcoming the plan, there are also sceptics. Editor-in-chief of Attitude Magazine Cliff Joannou believes that, because of the government’s failure to introduce statutory LGBT+ inclusive relationship and sex education in schools, the legacy of Section 28 looms over schools and local authorities. He tells indy100:For Theresa May to announce her \u0027LGBT Action Plan\u0027\u0026nbspin a gay magazine on the anniversary of Section 28 is both ironic and crass.The government has shied away from tackling LGBT+ discrimination in faith schools, where homophobia and transphobia is most prevalent.

The European Commission’s negotiators have already rejected the plan before its public announcement, as first revealed by The Independent earlier this week.“The regulatory alignment option is not available on the all-UK basis because it would amount to selective participation on the single market,” the senior EU official said, adding that the backstop “cannot be time limited”.It is incumbent on the UK to take the responsibility for its own decision“A backstop that would be strictly time limited would defeat the purpose of a backstop,” they said, before making clear that the Prime Minister’s plan for a UK-wide backstop would have to be withdrawn if progress is to be made at the June European summit.As well as the main issues of customs and the Irish border, side issues like the European arrest warrant and the Galileo satellite system have made little progress since March too. EU negotiators complain that the British side “do not understand” that Britain will not be able to use the European arrest warrant after Brexit, with Theresa May again having pledged to stay in the system just three months ago.“There are member states that simply cannot extradite their own nationals to a non-member of the EU. This is a constraint that unfortunately will apply once the UK is outside,” the senior official said.“The European arrest warrant is simply not available. I don’t think you can expect member states to change their constitutions in order to continue extraditing their nationals to the UK.“These are not bureaucratic issues. We are talking here about the lives and liberty of citizens. This is not something that can easily be done.”Brussels says the best the UK can hope for is to conclude a separate extradition treaty with the EU, as well as bilateral agreements on procedures like intelligence sharing.The row over Galileo has also been the subject of briefing and counter-briefing by the two sides. British sources briefed newspapers this week that they would demand the UK’s £1bn investment in the project back if British companies were locked out of the project. But EU sources disputed whether this stand had actually been made, describing the claim as “spin”.  The EU says British demands to retain the same access to Galileo as a member state are unreasonable. Though officials say Britain could potentially still use the system, they do not want to give British defence firms the right to build or run parts of it because they say that would effectively give the UK, a third country, the power to turn off the EU system for member states. Officials also pointed out that the UK itself had signed off the security rules restricting non-EU countries from running parts of system, as one of the 28 European Council members, before it knew it was going to leave.David Davis, the Brexit Secretary, who is travelling to Europe to drum up support for the UK to keep access to the satellite system, said: “Today we set out more detail on how we think the UK, as a third country, can continue to cooperate with the EU on security and keep our people safe and prosperous. As I travel around member states I hear how much our partners value the UK commitment to the EU’s security.“A relationship based solely on existing third country precedents, as some seem to be suggesting, would lead to a substantial and avoidable reduction in our shared security capability. Our citizens depend on this, let’s not let them down.”The senior EU official said they shared the UK’s concerns but that “this is a consequence on the UK position and it is incumbent on the UK to take the responsibility for its own decision”.Brexit so far: in picturesBrexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

Officials say mutual recognition is not possible outside the single market, because it would amount to asking “the EU to trust the UK more, with less guarantees, than they trust each other”.Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, has said Theresa May’s red lines mean Britain can only get a free trade agreement similar to the ones the EU has with Canada and South Korea, but the UK said today that this “shallow level of cooperation” was “inconsistent with our ambition”, which would require “a more formal and deeper institutional structure”.A UK Government source said:  “This is their public negotiating position, nothing more, nothing less. We presented 7 papers this week, in the interests of resolving difficult issues in the interests of both sides, so the claim we aren’t providing enough detail is laughable. “The risk is that if they follow down this track, putting conditions on our unconditional offers and trying to insult us, the EU will end up with a relationship with its third biggest economy and largest security partner that lets down millions of citizens in the EU and UK.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Sir Ivan Rogers, the UK’s old ambassador to the EU, was criticised after he advised ministers in 2016 that leaving the EU would take around 10 years. He stepped down from his post shortly after.The EU says under the December agreement just Northern Ireland would stay in full alignment with the single market and customs union to prevent a hard border, while UK negotiators say they actually agreed that the whole UK would do so. The relevant text is somewhat ambiguous as to what was agreed.EU officials do not want the backstop to apply to the whole UK because it would give Britain access to the single market without having to uphold the so-called “four freedom” or submitting to the European Court of Justice. The UK says it cannot accept the backstop only applying to NI because that would create a potential customs border between Great Britain and NI  – which the DUP oppose. Theresa May has relied on the DUP for her majority in the House of Commons since she called an election and lost seats last year.The time-limiting element has now been introduced by the UK because Cabinet Brexiteers like Boris Johnson fear that an indefinite backstop could be a backdoor way of keeping the UK aligned with the EU in perpetuity. Ministers have publicly confirmed that a time-limited backstop is on the way.Brexit threatens life on the Irish border: in picturesBrexit threatens life on the Irish border: in picturesJohn Murphy flies the European flag outside his home near the border village of Forkhill, Co ArmaghAn abandoned shop is seen in Mullan, Co Monaghan.

The agency emailed a notice to all US citizens in China about the employee at the consulate in Guangzhou who said there were “subtle and vague, but abnormal, sensations of sound and pressure”. It advised Americans to contact medical professionals if they experience any “unusual auditory or sensory of phenomena accompanied by unusual sounds or piercing noises”. The incident harkens back to when nearly two dozen US employees working in Havana had sought medical treatment between December 2016 to May 2017 for headaches, ear pain, dizziness, and hearing issues. Symptoms, sounds and sensations reportedly varied dramatically from person to person. Some have permanent hearing loss or concussions, while others suffered nausea, headaches and ear-ringing. Some are struggling with concentration or common word recall, The Associated Press has reported.A subsequent FBI investigation did not reveal evidence of a “sonic attack”. However, the reports put the largest strain on US-Cuba relations since former president Barack Obama forged closer ties in 2014.

Cuba, for its part, denied any wrongdoing and attributed the illnesses to a possible psychological cause. The State Department said it is not aware of any similar situations in China and did not identify the person who reported the systems or when that information was relayed to the agency.

a rival to GPS - refunded if it withdraws from the venture.Britain has rejected the EU\u0027s view that it cannot remain a full member of the project after Brexit as London insists it is in the interest of both sides to continue to work closely together on security issues.Brussels has made it clear that the UK cannot access the same encrypted Galileo information as EU members, or be involved in its development post-Brexit.The paper warns the UK will go its own way if its demands are not metExcluding the UK from full participation in Galileo will cost the EU one billion euro (\u0026pound880 million) and set the project back by three years, the document states.The paper said that the position adopted by Brussels risks being interpreted as a lack of trust in the UK.The UK... has a strong objection to its ongoing exclusion from security-related discussions and exchanges pertaining to the post-2019 development of Galileo.The paper warns the UK will go its own way if its demands are not met, stating: If agreement cannot be reached on the future balance of rights and obligations, and UK security and industrial requirements consequently cannot be met, the UK could not justify future participation in Galileo.In parallel, the UK is therefore exploring alternatives to fulfil its needs for secure and resilient position, navigation and timing information, including the option for a domestic satellite system.Excluding the UK from full participation in Galileo will cost the EU one billion euroThe UK wants Galileo to be a core component of the future UK-EU security partnership.Meanwhile, the Commons Brexit committee has suggested that the UK could end up staying longer in the customs union under Brussels rule because the Government has not come up with solution for customs arrangements.The committee was though criticised by Tory member Andrea Jenkyns who claimed it was \u0026ldquotoo Remain focussed under Labour MP Hilary Benn\u0026rsquos chairmanship.She announced she was resigning as a government parliamentary private secretary to have more time to focus on her Brexit committee work to help \u0026ldquoachieve the right Brexit."},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/139/590x/George-Osborne-eighth-job-Exor-European-firm-964890.jpg","title":"George Osborne eighth job Exor European firm","story":"It is not known how much the former-Chancellor will earn a yearMr Osborne will chair Exor\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquopartners council which brings together highly successful business leaders.It is not known how much the former-Chancellor will earn a year or how many days he will have to commit to the new role.Mr Osborne said in a statement: \u0026ldquoI am delighted to have been asked to chair this impressive panel of business leaders.\u0026ldquoThey bring a wealth of experience from different industries and geographies.

Nobody would believe that.Yet the happy couple set aside family rows, petty jealousies and drunken sabotage and basked in the warm embrace of an adoring public.Windsor’s Disney-style ceremony was watched in broad daylight north of the equator and the middle of the night Down Under by happy viewers of all races and creeds.There is a message here for us all.Harry and Meghan’s wedding did more than unite this nation in sympathy and affection for a popular prince and the love of his life. It showed this country is world class.The sub-plot, of course, was the emotional union between the damaged children of two broken families.Fans have long yearned for Prince Harry to find happiness after the roller-coaster life and shocking death of his fabled mother, Princess Diana.They have warmed to a young man who transformed himself from a mixed-up kid to a likeable soldier, helicopter pilot and champion of war-damaged Invictus casualties.As for his bride, Meghan Markle is the glamorous star of hit TV series Suits, who dreamed as a child of becoming a princess.Best of all in this age of right-on political correctness, she is the daughter of a charming African-American mother and an Emmy-winning Hollywood lighting specialist.The House of Windsor is now truly multicultural.It is also hip.Our amazing sovereign, at 92, and doughty Prince Philip, 96, both heading for their royal telegrams, are the Queen and King of Cool.Where else in the world would you see an Elton John double act with Windy City preacher Bishop Michael Curry?This was a truly uplifting occasion, worn lightly by a once-stuffy Royal Family.Nobody does it better when it comes to choreographing mounted cavalry, trumpets, banners and horse-drawn carriages with an electric-powered E-Type and a vintage Rolls-Royce.All underscored by a sense of humour, as Harry and his supportive brother William exchanged banter at the altar of Windsor’s historic St George’s Chapel.Even the weather turned out in tribute, bathing Windsor Great Park’s glorious greenery in spring sunshine.There may have been some muffled coughs over Markle family squabbles but they were nothing compared with the torrid dramas leading to the Queen’s own “annus horribilis”.The world has become used to British pageantry.But this Royal Wedding was a timely reminder that Britain is not just a small island with a fading history on the edge of Europe.The Duke and Duchess of Sussex ride in a carriage down The Long Walk back towards Windsor Castle after getting married in St Georges Chapel, WindsorThe 21st-century United Kingdom is an unrivalled brand on the global stage.The world was witnessing more than mere pomp and circumstance.This was UK plc on international parade, joining hands with the global community in a way no other nation can match — even the mighty USA.Had Meghan married into the family of a French or American president, a German Chancellor or a Kremlin tsar, would anyone have tuned in?Neither China nor Russia could captivate so many friendly eyeballs.The Olympics might do it.But London 2012 revealed Britain is best on these occasions, too.On Saturday, Britain proved it is capable of reaching out to a world beyond borders.Harry and Meghan’s marriage bonded the UK indelibly with the US.If the new Duke and Duchess have kids, they will be American citizens — as well as British due to Harry’s lineage — and will eventually be liable to American tax.Importantly, this wedding had special significance for the 2.5billion citizens of 52 Commonwealth countries, especially in Africa and the Caribbean, who swear allegiance to the Queen.My Australian in-laws were constantly on the phone from Sydney this weekend, all thoughts of becoming a republic abandoned, to discuss the finer points of royal protocol.But this event was watched from lands with no current ties to Britain — South America, the Far East and the Gulf States.It was a showcase of modern Britain forever adapting to change, the key to our success as an outward-looking nation.There was a clear hint of defiance, too. This steely couple were doing it their way.Our Brexit negotiators — on both sides of the argument — should take note.That big wide world, viewing us in high definition on Saturday, is where Britain’s future lies.These are our markets.The audience liked what they saw and they want some of what we’re having.In marketing terms alone, it was priceless.Too often we underestimate our strength and standing.We have developed an absurd inferiority complex.We’ve been led to believe we are too weak and puny to stand alone on the global stage.Yet we are among the world’s greatest economies, second only to Germany in the EU.We are a nuclear power with a real professional army which has helped keep the peace in Europe, and have an envied place on the UN Security Council.Republican lefties despise all this stuff.They smear Britain’s record as a brutal colonial power while ignoring our global lead in abolishing slavery.Disturbingly, some Conservatives seem to agree the UK is washed up and past its prime.Since we cannot run our own economy, they say, we should hand the job to unelected bureaucrats in Brussels.These, remember, would be the same Brussels flunkies who created the euro, wrecked the economies of member states and put millions of unemployed young people on the scrap heap.Most of those workless youngsters gratefully upped sticks and moved here.I wonder why?Saturday’s Royal Wedding showed we are in the Premier League.Now the world is watching, perhaps with slightly less enthusiasm, as another British saga lurches towards its climax — another broken family consumed with jealousy and bent on revenge.The cast is familiar — the statutory drunk, a bully who prefers to talk with a gun in his hand, some characters who would prefer a car crash to a happy ending.Can we stop the bickering and reach a good Brexit deal?Why can’t the Leavers and Remainers put the country first, join hands, bury their differences and take a vow to work together to serve the national interest?Inspired by the Royal Wedding, by the poem Invictus, we can rise above petty differences.“We are the masters of our fate: We are the captains of our soul.”Want to celebrate Harry and Meghans wedding like a royal?Weve made a brand new Snapchat lens just for the big day!Unlock The Suns Royal Wedding lens on Snapchat here and send us your snaps to @TheSunUKOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Later, I went back with him after he had built a night school for the boys, and asked over a cup of tea: “Why are you doing this, Harry?”He replied: “This is the most important thing I do.”It tells you everything about who his mother was.Inside the Chapel, the hymn was Guide Me, O Thou Great Redeemer, which was played at Princess Diana’s funeral and one of her favourites.Di’s sister Lady Jane Fellowes delivered the only reading. Listening to it was Sarah, the Duchess of York, who had not been invited to other recent royal weddings.Inviting Fergie was a brilliant thing to do. During Diana’s troubled times every Sunday she would drive down to Berkshire to have lunch with Fergie, spending the afternoon talking about their divorces.Outside in the Chapel courtyard were 2,000 people from Harry and Meghan’s charities, including servicemen who have lost limbs.Harry is following Diana’s hugely successful campaign to stop landmines by working with those who have been wounded by IEDs.When Harry was flying back from one of his tours of Afghanistan he shared the plane with three soldiers who were in a coma.He realised these soldiers, if they recovered, would have limbs missing and facing a life of misery — which is why he inspired them with his support for the Invictus Games.And Harry and Meghan asked guests to make donations to the Children’s HIV Association.Harry has clearly never forgotten how his mother took the stigma out of Aids by embracing sufferers, including babies in Brazil.And then there was the ring. On Saturday night Meghan was wearing the emerald-cut aquamarine ring Diana first wore in 1996.Harry once told ITV’s Tom Bradby: “I wanted to do something that would make my mother proud.” He succeeded on Saturday.Want to celebrate Harry and Meghans wedding like a royal?Weve made a brand new Snapchat lens just for the big day!Unlock The Suns Royal Wedding lens on Snapchat here and send us your snaps to @TheSunUKOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So is Her Majesty the Queen. They haven’t felt the need to label themselves as such we know from their actions.As the basic scriptwriting rule dictates, show don’t tell.To her credit, Meghan Markle championed many charitable causes that advocate female empowerment before she met Prince Harry, and no one is suggesting she shouldn’t continue with this work.But what grates about the above statement is the unsaid inference that here is a feisty, independent woman who, unshackled by pomp, ceremony and dutiful political impartiality, is going to drag the stuffy, deluded old monarchy kicking and screaming into the 21st century.That this go-get-’em gal from the US of A is going to shake things up with a few bumper-sticker sentiments and teach those Brits a thing or two about how the world works.Or perhaps we should leave it to Patrick Jephson, former private secretary to Princess Diana, a man very much in the know on the inner workings of the House of Windsor.In his book, The Meghan Factor, he says: “The one key skill Meghan absolutely must perfect is how to avoid being seen as any kind of a destabilising force. It’s a useful guideline when weighing the pros and cons of any intended course of action, from saving a local playgroup, to saving an endangered species, to saving the planet. What always comes first is saving the monarchy.”Quite. In other words, don’t get up the collective nose of the British public or they might just, ahem, pick it and flick you off into oblivion.As we saw on Saturday, as Bishop Michael Curry’s address entered what felt like its third decade, The Queen’s resolutely impassive expression suggests she’d make a fine poker player.We have no idea what she thought of it, nor Donald Trump, Brexit or the highly political Me Too campaign. She has opinions, of course. But what she doesn’t do is wear them like a badge.Just like her great-great-grandmother Victoria, who advocated “never complain, never explain”, The Queen knows the future of the monarchy lies in being a non-political figurehead who promotes national unity.Jephson adds: “If you acquire a profile, a purpose and a passionate public devotion independent of the royal mainstream, then you risk being perceived and presented as a threat to the Crown itself.”We already know what Meghan thinks about an awful lot of things, because her life so far can’t be edited.We also know that her soapbox has just got bigger thanks to her new status which, to those unused to it, could foster the corrosive misconception that everyone is hanging off your every word.Read my pursed lips: They’re not. They’re just being polite.So Meghan must learn fast that she’s a very minor cog in an ancient royal machine that has survived so long by saying nothing and doing its duty to its loyal subjects.Frustrating that may be for a “feminist” (or, indeed a manist), but that’s the trade-off for the largely taxpayer-funded life of luxury that is granted, not self-generated.As a celebrity, you can say what you like and we can choose to listen or not. But opinions divide people and, as a royal, you are supposed to represent everyone.Meghan needs to understand, and implement, that distinction sooner rather than later.HUMAN rights lawyer Amal Clooney was officially crowned “best-dressed guest” by fashionistas observing the Royal Wedding.According to one, she was “a sublime vision in marigold”, though personally speaking, Colman’s Mustard yellow might be more accurate.Either way, Ms Clooney once again proved adept at pulling focus from the other mere mortals floundering in her ever-stylish slipstream.By contrast, the Duchess of Cambridge’s understated, Alexander McQueen frock coat got a sniffier reception from certain fashion quarters, not least because she’s worn it three times before.They’re missing the point.A wedding is about the bride, not the guests.And Kate understood that perfectly by wearing something that wouldn’t propel her into the limelight on Meghan’s big day.Now that’s style.THOSE attending Chelsea Flower Show (no, me neither) have declared that “she-sheds” are the latest must-have – kitted out with radiators, chandeliers and squishy sofas.Alternatively, we could have all that inside the house and just send the other half out into the garden.AN Islamic school in Birmingham has warned female pupils against using tampons.The guidance, adopted as school policy, states: “Among the types of pads, tampons may not be appropriate due to insertion.”But the head of the school insists it has “no connection to faith”.Hmmmm. Meanwhile, it has emerged that women are having “virginity restoring” operations on the NHS at a cost of £1,000 a time.The 30-minute procedure involves the hymen – which can break after using tampons, doing sport or having sex for the first time – being stitched or reconstructed.One relationship counsellor suggested that one of the reasons was that some religious women were “over- whelmed” by feelings of sexual guilt and wanted to be “as pure as possible again” for their husband.Want to? Or are forced to by religiously driven, moral expectations not placed on the man they’re marrying?Either way, is this really something the NHS should be funding when money for other, more vital, operations is so scarce?MEMO to Sir Anthony Hopkins: Yes, families do fall out and just because you’re related doesn’t mean you have to like each other.But saying you “don’t care one way or the other” whether your 48-year-old daughter Abigail has children or not seems overly cold and perhaps partly explains your 20-year estrangement.In future, a simple, “We don’t speak and I’d rather not go in to it”, might be wiser.HOW come, in this age of state-of-the-art camera phones, when anyone spots the Loch Ness monster, beast of Bodmin Moor or any of the other fearsome creatures supposedly roaming our shores, the evidential photo is always out of focus?Exhibit A: The “lion” spotted in Oldbury in the West Midlands this week.Yep.

It’s the uncertainty caused by Remain diehards in the Commons and Lords bent on scuppering it and even destroying our Government.It is destabilising for firms not to know what Brexit will look like.

The Government must think again so that people don’t fall into debt or are left at risk of losing their home.”Lib Dem MP Stephen Lloyd added: “These lamentable figures show that thousands of people have still not responded to the significant changes on mortgage interest loans being pushed by the DWP.This is yet another cack-handed benefit change by the Tories which is wholly unnecessary, and is already causing anxiety amongst some of our most disadvantaged, marginalised citizens.The DWP said that any SMI claimants who havent got a phone call about the change will still get the benefit for at least six more weeks.Those affected are urged to contact the official hotline on 0800 731 0459 for pensioners or 0800 169 0310 for anyone of working age.A spokesman said: Over time, someone’s house is likely to increase in value, so it’s reasonable that anyone who has received financial help towards their mortgage should be asked to pay that back.“Everyone who signs up to the loan will continue to get help with their mortgage interest, and it’s only repayable if there is available equity when the property is sold.“If people decide to decline the loan now but change their mind in future the loan can be backdated so in effect there would be no break in payments.“We have already contacted everyone currently in receipt of SMI to explain the change but we are making sure people have time to review the documents, obtain advice and consider their options."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000283428196.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"burn wood they said itll be green they said how the eco freaks got us all wheezing","story":"Pollution in our cities is worse than it’s been for many years. The way things are going you could give your kids 20 Rothmans a day and they wouldn’t be much worse off than they already are.And the reason for this is a genuine scandal. A real eye-opener. It shows what happens when people in authority take notice of the people who know absolutely nothing. The Green lobby. The eco-freaks. The obsessive loons. The climate change fanatics.If you’re middle class, you’ve probably got one. They’ve become incredibly popular in the last decade.Trouble is they spew out enormous amounts of something called PM2.5 particles. That’s soot to you and me.They’re the major cause of soot in our cities and the main reason everyone you know is gasping for breath.We’re about to be sued by the European Union because pollution from these stoves is way above acceptable limits.But why do we have them?Because at the behest of the green movement, the government encouraged us all to have them. Burning wood is much better, they said, than gas or coal or oil. Renewable! Doesn’t churn out as much CO2!No, it just churns out lethal amounts of soot. Billions of pounds were spent by our government on a scheme to convert us to renewable heating systems.The brainchild of the disgraced Lib Dem halfwit Chris Huhne. Millions more was spent converting one of our biggest power stations to woodchip. The wood is shipped over 3,500 miles from the US (there’s eco-friendly for you). And it’s all made everything a lot, lot, worse as a consequence.Then there are diesel cars. You may have one. The government is getting tough on those, too.It’s now been discovered that they are much more polluting than petrol cars. It’s another major cause of pollution in our towns and cities.So why do we have them? Because the idiotic Greens told us to. Back in 2001 the Labour government offered tax breaks on diesel cars. Everyone rushed to buy one.A member of that Labour government has now ’fessed up and said it was the wrong decision, no question.But they wanted their Green credentials.And just look what trouble it has caused — 37,800 more deaths every year in this country simply as a consequence of those wood burning stoves. It is close to unbelievable.I wonder what the Greens will come up with next as an idea to save the planet.Maybe we should burn magpies, or sour cream and chive Pringles, or our own trousers.The truth is they haven’t got the remotest idea. They urge these measures upon us without the slightest notion of what might happen as a consequence.And the problem is that important people take them seriously. Governments, for example.And we end up paying through the nose for their idiocies — and then, a little later, gasping for breath.The wood burning stove business should convince all members of Parliament. Never listen to a green.No matter how nice he or she might seem. Just ignore them. They’re bad for your health.WHAT a shame – Roman Abramovich can’t get back into the country because we haven’t cleared his visa. So he’s sitting on his yacht somewhere, getting snippy. I’m not sure why we let Roman in in the first place.You don’t get his kind of money by being lovely to everybody, do you?First we helped wreck the Russian economy in the early 1990s by plundering its state run industries. Then we opened the doors to a whole bunch of Russkie gangsters – sorry, oligarchs – with boats the size of Poland. Anyway, I’ll probably end up glowing like a Belisha beacon just for writing this.BROADCASTER Dan Snow has admitted he lies to his daughters.He’s told them that during the war there were loads of female Spitfire pilots. Zooming around, shooting down krauts. He says he doesn’t want them to feel limited by their gender. He should have gone further. Told them that back then Britain was led by a nice lady called Winnie.And that the first person up Everest was a little girl called Hillary. And as for that Ada Hitler . . .THE Iraqis are executing the IS jihadi brides. Loads of them.Some of them are whining that they had no idea their husbands were evil Islamists. One of them said she thought she was marrying a rapper.Yeah, right love. We’ve got a few here, mind.Women who went out to join IS and then thought better of it. They’re lucky we won’t extradite them to Iraq.HEY – got your Royal Wedding gift bag yet? Guests to the wedding are flogging them on eBay for as little as £20,000. Hell of a bargain. I’ve got a bid in on one right now. It says it contains:I’VE got a bit of a soft spot for Victoria Beckham. She’s been criticised for not smiling at the wedding of Harry and Meghan.Some people have suggested Posh Spice was looking a bit grim because David had been out on the pull again. Nah. She wasn’t smiling because, basically, she’s a miserable cow.And I like that. Why should she have to wander around grinning like a village idiot?Keep the sulk and the pout, Vikki, love. Plus I liked what she was wearing at the bash. She was dressed as if for the funeral of someone she didn’t know very well. She looked great.SO, all four of the great American authors are dead. Both Tom Wolfe and Philip Roth died this week.Saul Bellow and the finest of them all, John Updike are already dead.These gentlemen were my heroes when I was growing up. But how long will they be remembered?Updike is already unfashionable on account of his alleged sexism. Wolfe and Bellow were quite right-wing, so the literary critics will quickly consign their books to the “dead white male” rubbish bin of history. And as a consequence, we will have lost an awful lot.Keep their work alive, whatever the critics tell you.

I have my ears pierced, I cry at the end of The Greatest Showman and I enjoy shopping for clothes.Everyone has the right to say how they want the world to see them. Everyone has the right to be happy with themselves.Goodness knows there’s enough things to be unhappy about. You shouldn’t be one of them.But the Labour Party has now decided that anyone who says they are a woman is eligible for political roles that are for women only. They do not ask for any more proof than that.As a Labour member and a woman on Wednesdays, that means I am eligible to stand for one of those roles.So, when the position of Women’s Officer came up for election, I decided to apply. The post involves encouraging women to join the party and speak for women and their experiences - and can only be held by women.Standing for the position was a chance for me to talk about self-identification with my local Party and bring my concerns to their attention.Of course, I was not expecting to win, but I was ready to do the job if I did.I was happy to let people make a democratic, informed choice.Women are worried that letting men say they are women without any checks is dangerous.There is a fear that some men will identify as women just so they can go into changing rooms or loos and spy on or attack women.Women also say that it will affect women’s rights to dignity and privacy, for example on women-only hospital wards or in shelters.Those are also real concerns, but a small minority of people don’t want them to be talked about.They call feminists like Germaine Greer - who has said transgender women are not women - out-of-touch or get angry when people yell out body parts or facts on TV.Those people are stopping a very important debate. I don’t feel that’s right.And self-identification is not just Labour’s position.Nearly every political party in the UK says that the Gender Recognition Act should be changed so that anyone can legally change their sex just by saying they are a man or a woman.The Labour Party made their decision so they could be ahead of the change to the law.Some trans people say that the current requirements set out by the GRA are humiliating and difficult to cope with on top of living their lives. That is a real concern and one that has to be listened to.However, I don’t agree with the idea that you should be able to legally change your sex just by saying you want to.It ignores the very real struggles that trans people face every day.It says that I have had the same life experience as people such as the L’Oreal and Playboy model Munroe Bergdorf, journalist and TV presenter Paris Lees and Lily Madigan - a transgender schoolgirl who was sent home from school for wearing a girls uniform.It says that their life-long fight to feel right in their bodies is the same as me identifying as a woman once a week.I can’t begin to imagine what their journeys have been like, but I know those journeys need to be recognised by more than just words.Following a recent meeting of Woman’s Place UK in Basingstoke, I talked with a reporter about my nomination for the Womens Officer role. The article that he wrote led to the Labour Party suspending me yesterday, with immediate effect.I am not allowed to attend meetings or stand for election and there will be an investigation.They seem to think that I am not enough of a woman.Some people online think the same. I have to ask the question, how much more of a woman would I need to be?I hope that what I did shows we need the debate on gender identity.We need to find the common ground so that trans people can live as they want to, while allowing women the dignity, privacy and safety that they deserve.We are all here thanks to women, so let’s talk to them.Really? I mean, really? I first came across David Lewis smug grinning face in a magazine earlier this week. Announcing he was a woman from morn to midnight on Wednesdays and boasting that he is changing nothing. Not his clothes. Not his routine. Not his womanly beard.Why? Because 15 minutes of fame. Because trans rights has gone too far. Because proposed law changes.He is not trans: has no idea what it is to be trans.The situation he is describing does not happen and has not happened anywhere, except when anti-trans campaigners break the law to make a point.Being trans is not fashion, trend or choice. Mocking transness in this dishonest way hurts people.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She was later arrested and thrown in the back of a police car.Describing his photograph of Kate in 2007, Max told The Sun Online: “Kate had been in Mahiki for a few hours and jumped into a taxi at around 2 or 3am.“I think she was telling the taxi driver where to go when I took the photograph and Prince Harry and Prince William got in their royal transport shortly after.He also said that Posh and Becks would get “mobbed” wherever they went and the photograph of actor Rhys Ifans putting his fingers up was “typical behaviour” because he “didn’t like having his picture taken”."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000408607579.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"mystery sea creature crocodile whale rhossili beach swansea","story":"The five-foot long carcass found on Rhossili Beach, Swansea has a long head, giant jawline and slender tail.Beth Jannetta, 41, who discovered the monster while walking her dogs, sent a photo of the creature to experts, hoping they would identify it.But boffins are not sure if it is a type of whale, dolphin or porpoise.Beth said: It looked like a well rotted cetacean to me. Other people think it is something different, like a crocodile.It would be very interesting to find out what species it is.”Bioscience expert Dr Dan Forman, from Swansea University, said: When you look at it the first time you may think it is a crocodile, but it is certainly not.There is a big bulge on the base of the skull which is characteristic of a cetacean.”He added: We get a reasonable amount of whales and dolphins, a lot which are dead and decomposed in places like Pendine and Rhossili.“From the data around carcasses washed up, there seems to be a cluster this time of year around June and July.Mark Hipkin, National Trust area ranger, who was called to collect the body, said he thought it was a porpoise.He said: We have porpoises washing up quite regularly, as well as dolphins and seals and sometimes sheep."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000408650365.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"apply here for our first summer internship scheme to work for the the number one paper","story":"The internships, for 18 to 25-year-olds, are available in roles including reporting, news-gathering, design and production, across print and online.Placements will last up to 12 weeks and be based mainly in London.

An 83,000 increase in the year was enough to see Romania leapfrog Ireland into second place.Polish remains the most common non-British nationality – with an estimated one million.There are more Poles than any other nationality in every single region of the UK – from 108,000 in the east Midlands to 63,000 in the south West.Alp Mehmet, vice chair of Migration Watch, said: “There is still no sign of a net outflow of EU-born people as a result of Brexit.“Indeed they are still coming in significant numbers and contributing to a population increase which is simply unsustainable.”The ONS showed how immigration has transformed towns across the UK with migrants now accounting for 29 per cent of the population in Boston, Lincs – up from just 3 per cent in 2007.East Staffordshire’s migration population has soared from 3 per cent to 17 per cent.Nearly six out of every 10 people living in Newham, East London – 57 per cent – were born outside the UK.The ONS pointed out there are more Indians and Pakistanis than Romanians by country of birth – but many have since taken up British citizenship.THE Brexit vote appears to have triggered a huge spike in EU nationals seeking a British passport.Some 40,014 applied in the year to the end of March, nearly double the previous year, official figures reveal.A total of 14,137 were from the EU8 bloc, including Poland and Hungary.Ex-PM David Cameron lifted immigration controls on Romania and Bulgaria in 2014 and numbers have soared ever since.Experts claim many Romanians and Bulgarians have come to the UK to fill the gaps left by Poles beginning to return home. There were just 78,000 Romanians living in the UK in 2010, putting it 15th below Bangladesh.Separate Home Office figures today revealed 148,000 National Insurance registrations were given out to Romanians in the year to March - a third of all those handed out to EU nationals.The Home Office said the number of foreign national offenders removed in the 12 months to March fell 11 per cent to 5,630.Last year, Romania threatened to block Brexit altogether unless Theresa May gave its country’s residents a guarantee of UK citizenship.The first Romanian to arrive in the UK to work after Mr Cameron relaxed controls – Victor Spirescu – died in a car crash this January.The man – dubbed the “poster boy” for Romanian immigration – was found to have taken cocaine when he lost control of a car near Newport Pagnell.Or is the reality different?Yes, Britain voted to control its borders, like any nation beyond the EU.But we are still the most welcoming country on Earth. "},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000408674216.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"britains best pubs revealed","story":"National Pub \u0026amp Bar Awards 2018 judges sifted through 94 boozers before crowning The White House, West Sussex as the overall winner on Wednesday night .BBCs Nigel Barden and Tristan OHana hosted the prestigious ceremony at BAFTA 195 Piccadilly.In order to celebrate boozers which are huge assets to local communities, judges also found winners for each region across the UK.Mr OHana, editor of Pub \u0026amp Bar magazine said: The occasion is an opportunity for the whole of the UK to acknowledge the incredible work that these businesses do for us all – our pubs and bars are a huge asset to local communities, as well as the whole of the country.Judges found it difficult to rank each boozers aesthetics, menu and cleanliness.

Thomas visited the pub when he stayed at a property in Milkwood Road, Herne Hill - a few minutes away from the pub.The Grade II listed building which was closed for four years in 2013, has been restored and now boasts a 12 spacious bedrooms and a gastropub menu.The South Causey in Durham boasts 100 acres of land.The pub said to be eccentrically decorated also offers hot tubs within its bed and breakfast rooms.This brewery in Londonderry is also a pub and a restaurant.Landlords offer two menus, one has £3 snacks including smoked baby back ribs and the other is filled with pub classics.The Pearson family have owned Plockton Hotel for the last 20 years.Customers have access to boats and the finest seafood in the country.This former mill in Pitlochry, is a luxury pub, with a lavish food and drinks menu to match.It boasts a four-star B\u0026ampB with a fine dining room available to all.Judges loved this pubs range of traditional beers from around the world.They said: The effort that has been put into extending that part of this operation is mightily impressive.In January, nominations were taken for the best pubs and bars in each of the UKs 94 counties.The winners within each county were then entererd to become the best boozer in their region, in hope of winning the overall category.To crown find the overall winner, judges used the following criteria to assess each boozer:WEST on the Green is a beerhall-style bar located in the iconic Templeton Building.Now in its 11th year, the bar offers an award-winning German-inspired menu.This is a five-star restaurant and hotel located in a secluded cove near Port Isaac.Located in Anglesey, an Area of Outstanding Natural beauty, The Bull offers its customers a fine dining experience.Judges said: There are two venues to visit when it comes to choosing a bite to eat, each with their own character and menu style.Awarding this Staffordshire boozer, judges said: While its location allows for travelling visitors to escape and unwind, it has also built up a truly loyal following from those who live close by.Judges were wowed by this Sheffield boozers stunning venue design."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nip000407435715.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"prince philip cracked rib harry meghan wedding","story":"The Duke of Edinburgh - who was photographed with what looked like black eyes last Saturday - slipped while washing.The accident happened only days after he had thrown his crutches away following a hip op.The 96-year-old had been hailed a hero for making it to the Royal Wedding without crutches just six weeks after surgery.But a Royal insider said despite sustaining the painful rib injury he refused even the aid of a stick on Meghan and Harry’s big day.They told The Sun: “The Duke is not a fan of showering and prefers to bathe. But he’s a determined man and nothing was going to stop him attending nor would he take any kind of walking aid.”The Duke was praised for his no nonsense attitude as he smiled throughout last Saturday’s celebrations.Last night Sun doctor Carol Cooper branded him the “Iron Duke” saying he took the British stiff upper lip to a “new level”.She said: “I take my hat off to him. He is clearly a very resolute gentleman who will not stop doing what he needs to do.“Fractured ribs tend to be quite painful. It’s very rare for a fractured rib not to cause pain - even a tiny fracture.“Because your ribs move when you breathe, every breath you take can be painful.“Painkillers are often not very effective but it is possible to get have a local anaesthetic injected into the area to deaden the pain temporarily.”Prince Philip had spent days walking up and down stairs to get himself fit for the wedding after his hip replacement.Such was the speed of his recovery he was even warned to slow it down.Family biographer Penny Junor described his walk into the chapel - not even with a limp as “completely heroic”.She said: “Given that he is 96 years old and the operation was just six weeks ago, I think that shows what an extraordinary man he is.“That will have meant a huge amount to Prince Harry. He is enormously fond of his grandfather.Prince Philip has been at the Queen’s side at most major royal occasions bar the Diamond Jubilee, which he missed in 2012 because he was in hospital.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If he did he would fight to keep it together”.Mr Corbyn was asked by the BBC how a Corbyn government would handle a border poll campaign if it happened on his watch.He said: “It’s within the terms of the Good Friday Agreement that such a poll could be held if there was a willingness to do so, at that point you don’t stand in its way, but it is within the terms of the Good Friday Agreement and I think the UK government should be neutral in that respect.”It followed accusations he had snubbed the chance to meet families of IRA victims during the visit Belfast.Challenged on why he hadn’t accepted an invitation he said he had only found out about it earlier in the week.Mr Corbyn said instead his Shadow Northern Ireland secretary Tony Lloyd would be happy to meet victims’ groups.But then he provoked more fury after calling for “ALL victims of all the violence” to be respected.It came as one his own MPs branded him unfit for power because of his rejection of mainstream politics.Ian Austin hit out at his party leader’s link to terrorist groups and response to anti-Semitism blasting his”extreme views” and accusing him of hijacking Labour.Mr Austin, the MP for Dudley North, wrote on PoliticsHome: “The fact is that Labour has never in its history had a leadership as far to the left as this one. Never.”“Jeremy’s supporters - for whom he can do no wrong - will dismiss this as the usual bitter smears to undermine him.“But it is much more fundamental than that.“The reason I didn’t support Jeremy’s candidacy and have not been persuaded since is because I just don’t think people with track records of extreme views like Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell should lead a mainstream party.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

advertisers and countless ­others desperately want ­people to “review our privacy policy” and “accept new terms and conditions.”You might assume this has something to do with the recent Facebook scandal, where founder Mark Zuckerberg had to apologise for allowing users’ data to end up in the hands of political forces.But the real reason is a major shake-up of EU laws governing the information kept about you online.The less-than-snappily-titled General Data Protection ­Regulations (EU) 2016/679 comes into force tomorrow.The beefed-up “GDPR” rules mean everyone from hi-tech firms to public bodies need to change their ways.This should be good news if you are ­deluged by spam or ­embarrassed by party ­pictures on social media.Here, GRANT ROLLINGS answers some common ­questions about the changes.If that message came from a ­provider you actually like, such as a charity or your favourite football team, not responding will limit their future interactions with you.Under the new data laws you need to give clear consent to online tracking or being sent unexpected messages.And if you haven’t done so by today, that charity or football team might have to stop ­letting you know about new offers and deals.Don’t worry, though – if you miss today’s deadline it shouldn’t mean you are suddenly blocked by all the sites or services you have been ­subscribed to.Everything in the new digital age is snappy and easy to digest – apart from the long and baffling terms and conditions.That all changes from today.Under the new law, companies cannot use mind-numbing T\u0026ampCs full of impenetrable legal jargon to make you aware of the changes.The request for consent must be given in an intelligible, separate and easily ­accessible form.And if they are handing over your data to someone else, they have to spell it out in plain English.If you are suffering from unticking fatigue, help is on its way.Currently consumers face the annoying task of having to untick several boxes that ask them whether they are happy to receive “selected marketing” communications.After today, you will only receive ads from “marketing ­partners” if you are told their name and you actively tick or click on a box to say you want them.While the cascade will be greatly reduced, it won’t cease altogether.Legitimate companies should abide by the new rules but there is little to stop conmen sending emails offering to enlarge your ­manhood or informing you about a financial windfall waiting in Nigeria.If you lost out on a loan, a pay rise or a job because a computer has said “no”, you can now ask for a good old-fashioned human being to be involved in the decision- making process.The problem until now has been that computers have based their decisions on the information they are given.If the data held about you was incorrect or incomplete, you may have been treated unfairly.Adam French, a consumer rights expert from Which?, said: “For some workers an ­algorithm is used to judge whether they are completing their tasks quickly enough to be paid a certain rate.“With the new law, you’ll be able to get a human involved, because maybe you are being slowed down by faulty machinery and the ­computer doesn’t know that.”If there is a particularly sensitive image or over-opinionated late-night social media post that you don’t want anyone to see any more, help could be on the way.Under the new law you will be able to ask for so-called “Data ­Erasure”, so those words and images are removed from sight forever.But this “right to be forgotten” is not ­guaranteed and can be challenged by the firm holding the data.What caused the most outrage in the recent scandal involving Facebook was that British marketing firm Cambridge Analytica used data such as post “likes” to create a ­profile of millions of voters.But profiling is also used by firms to target adverts at consumers.And many companies, such as Facebook, have made a fortune by harvesting that data for advertisers.From now on firms will have to make it clearer that they do this, and consumers will be able to opt out of profiling for targeted ads.Ailidh Callander, a lawyer for ­Privacy International, which has campaigned for tougher data laws, said: “Companies are exploiting our data in ways we do not understand, making it their business to learn about your habits, sex interests, political beliefs and more.Companies must protect our data and the new privacy law pushes companies do this.”The new rules say that younger children cannot ­consent to online services without a parent’s agreement.But there is little to stop your kids from pretending they are an adult.There was outrage last November when taxi app Uber admitted it had kept secret a data breach that affected 57million of its customers and drivers.From today, firms will need to report any breach within 72 hours of first becoming aware of it.Failure to comply could result in a fine which is equal to two per cent of the firm’s annual global ­turnover.Every business, no matter how big or small, has to abide by the new data protection laws – from media giants to landlords with just one buy-to-let property.Public services also need to implement it, as do firms operating from outside of the EU if they want to do business within it.At the moment the Government intends to keep the new EU data laws after Brexit.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Warren Air Force Base, Wyoming, that was cracked following a slip-up on social media.Authorities launched an investigation after an airman posted a Snapchat video of himself smoking marijuana, despite strict rules from Airman 1st Class Nickolos Harris, the ringleader.Fourteen airmen were disciplined. Six of them were convicted in courts-martial of LSD use or distribution or both.“Although this sounds like something from a movie, it isn’t,” said Capt. Charles Grimsley, the lead prosecutor of one of several courts-martial.The acid ring, which began in 2015, was exposed in March 2016 but the details have not been publicised until now.It was composed of airmen from the 90th Missile Wing, which operates one-third of the 400 Minuteman 3 missiles that are “on alert” 24/7 and stored in underground silos across the northern Great Plains.One of the service members, Airman 1st Class Tommy Ashworth, said at his court-martial that he felt “paranoia, panic” for hours during his acid trip.“I didn’t know if I was going to die that night or not,” he testified.Harris pleaded guilty to using and distributing LSD and using ecstasy, cocaine and marijuana, telling a military judge, “I absolutely just loved altering my mind.”He said it was easy to score LSD and other drugs from civilian sources and admitted using acid eight times and passing it out multiple times to other airmen at parties in Denver and elsewhere from spring 2015 to early 2016.Harris implemented rules during parties: “No social media at all” and “No bad trips. Everybody’s happy right now. Let’s keep it that way,” he told airmen in a video recorded at a Cheyenne apartment in 2015.The disgraced airman was sentenced to 12 months in jail and other penalties — but avoided a punitive discharge as part of an agreement with prosecutors.The AP’s report is the result of documents obtained over the past two years through the Freedom of Information Act.Air Force spokesman Lt. Col. Uriah L. Orland maintained the drug use took place during off-duty hours.“There are multiple checks to ensure airmen who report for duty are not under the influence of alcohol or drugs and are able to execute the mission safely, securely and effectively,” he said.A version of this story originally appeared on the New York Post."},{"url":null,"title":"norwich men fashion style alan partridge","story":"Almost half of those in the city that spawned fashion disaster Alan Partridge think they look the best.That compares with 30 per cent of Liverpudlian men ranking themselves top.The figure was 28 per cent in London, 23 in Leeds and 22 in Manchester.A third of fellas in Norwich also think the city is well known for good-looking guys.Men there pay out £45 a month on their hair and wet shave compared to just £11 in Cambridge.They also spend £77 a month on clothes — £15 more than guys in London.Just for Men Moustache \u0026amp Beard, which carried out the study, said: “Norwich might be the home of Alan Partridge — whose love of golfing jumpers, string back driving gloves and horizon blue ‘action slacks’ is well known  — but the men of the city obviously take more pride in the way they look.”The poll of 1,500 UK men also found the average bloke found his sense of style aged 34.Well-kept eyebrows, getting a haircut every six weeks, owning a dinner jacket and having spotless trainers are signs of a modern, image-conscious man.And 32 per cent said having the right facial hair was fundamental to looking good.The Just For Men spokesman added: “The emphasis has shifted from simply having the facial hair, to how well kept that facial hair is, particularly in terms of being neat and full.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The number of Romanian nationals living in the UK in 2017 was estimated to be 411,000 - a jump of 25% on the previous year, and the largest increase for any country. Polish remains the most common non-British nationality, with an estimated one million in the UK. Romania has overtaken the Republic of Ireland and India to move from fourth to second place in the list. Some 350,000 Irish nationals lived in the UK in 2017, while there were 346,000 Indians.  The figures, from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), show the total number of non-British nationals living in the UK in 2017 was 6.2 million, up 4% on 2016\u0027s total of six million.  This is a smaller rise than that recorded between 2015 and 2016, when the number rose by 8%. Nicola White of the ONS migration statistics division said: Non-UK born and non-British populations continued to increase in 2017, as more people continued to come to the UK to live than move to live abroad for a year or more. Poland-born residents and Polish nationals were the most common populations from outside the UK. However, the largest increases in population were seen from those born in Romania and those with Romanian nationality.  The figures show that 3.8 million (61%) of the 6.2 million non-British nationals living in the UK in 2017 held EU nationality. This is roughly the same proportion as 2016 (60%). London had the largest proportion of non-British nationals in 2017, with the highest numbers in the local authorities of Newham (38%), Westminster (36%) and Brent (34%).

Many people took time off work or cut their holidays short to make sure they had a say over the future of the eighth amendment, which bans abortion in almost all circumstances. Ciaran Gaffney, based in Buenos Aires, Argentina, spotted four of his countrymen on a plane home to vote. He tweeted: Was actually so humbled and relieved to meet four other Irish people on the flight from Buenos Aires to London, all of them flying onwards to Dublin today or tomorrow to #voteyes.    Aoife Bennett, 25, an editor with a travel magazine based in Dortmund, Germany, will be making the journey to Dublin to vote then making the journey back in less than 24 hours.  She tweeted: I\u0027m flying home for not even 24 hours to vote for this. Anyone I\u0027ve said this to hasn\u0027t called me a muppet. Or insane. They\u0027re thanking me. This is the most important referendum we may ever face. Of course I was coming home.  She told the Press Association: This referendum is about giving women the respect we deserve. I cannot believe that, in this sense, Ireland is held back by values that are over 100 years old.   She said that a year ago her mother was diagnosed with cancer, but was told by doctors that if she was planning on having more children she would not be given the life-saving treatment she needs.  Ms Bennett said: It makes me shiver to think that if she had been diagnosed 26 years ago, or 21 - my brother\u0027s age - we could have killed her because we would have been seen as more important.  Many people from the No camp also made the journey.    Eoin O\u0027Loughlin, 20, from County Clare but living in London, told the Press Association at Dublin airport: I think the unborn baby is entitled to life - I think the abortion procedure and the whole industry behind it is fairly frightening. I think obviously the pro-choice side talk a lot about the hard cases, but this legislation that the Government are proposing goes far beyond that and I think goes way too far and will be detrimental to Irish babies and mothers.   He added: There\u0027s about 30 of us who are coming home over the next 24 hours. We\u0027ve been in touch for the last few weeks and trying to organise flights together and so on. Mary Galvin, 73, from Wexford, cut her holiday to Italy short by a day to be home for the referendum to vote No.   She said: I\u0027ve been a nurse all my life - the hard cases, there are many hard cases, like a lady who had been raped, and you help deal with that and the aftermath of that, with support.  I was involved in the pro-life back in 1983 and we had a lot to do with that. A lot of marching and it\u0027s been something that\u0027s very dear to my heart and I feel like there\u0027s a lot of pain involved in abortion on young women through their lives - it will go on and on after the day it happens. I pray to god it doesn\u0027t come in to the country.  Another woman had returned home from her holiday in Croatia to cast her vote.    She said: I\u0027m certainly going to vote No. Of course I\u0027m going to vote No. In a civilised country, that we\u0027re actually going to the polls to be asked to decide whether we should make it legal to kill an unborn child I think is terrible, and people don\u0027t seem to understand that every right is being taken away from every unborn child.   Elsewhere, travel writer Alice Murphy, who covers the Philippines and Australia , even offered to stump up the cash for another person to travel home to vote from the UK to vote Yes because she could not make it herself.  She tweeted: Irish working in the UK: If there\u0027s anyone who can fly home to vote on Friday but doesn\u0027t have the money, please DM me - I will pay for your flights home as I can\u0027t come home myself. #HometoVote #Repeal8th #TogetherForYes.

But just as you need to carefully plan your route to that seaside resort or holiday cottage, it makes sense to plan ahead for the actual journey, too. That way you’ll all still be in the holiday mood when you reach your destination and really ready for fun! Below we’ve teamed up with Halfords to reveal the 5 secrets to the perfect car journey which will leave you feeling relaxed and refreshed when you arrive. They cover everything from picking the right tunes to play on the way to why it pays to plan when you\u0027re off on a road trip. 1. Get the sounds right    A great road trip needs a great soundtrack. But with the whole family in the car, creating a playlist that keeps everyone happy can be a challenge. Even if Dad likes Dua Lipa, Mum likes Metallica and the kids change their minds every few seconds, there is a way to keep everyone happy: using a streaming service en route.  This bank holiday there’s 10 per cent off selected audio systems at Halfords – including a Pioneer car stereo. Featuring a digital radio and with support for Android devices and iPhones alike you can stream from Spotify, Apple Music and use apps like Google Maps and Waze. Remember: Halfords experts can help you with your choice and fit your new stereo seamlessly into your car. The experts can fit your new stereo in-store from as little as \u0026pound30. 2. Keep the kids happy    Keep the kids entertained and you’ll be amazed how quickly “are we nearly there yet” becomes a thing of the past. Whether it’s for big screen classics or cartoons, the Nextbase Car Dual DVD, below, is an ideal solution.  The pack includes two DVD players with built-in nine-inch screens.  You can use each separately, or connect them together to watch the same movie on both. There are speakers to listen out loud, or you can hook them up to a pair of optional wireless headphones. With the ability to play different films at the same time, it will be sure to keep the kids happy - and give you peace and quiet on the journey, even if they want to watch different films.  The chances are that if you’re travelling as a group you’re all going to want to keep your mobile devices charged up. Halfords has a range of portable phone chargers to keep your USB devices topped up – the Halfords Premium Triple USB Charger can charge three devices at once. 3. Don’t get lost    While it\u0027s pretty easy to think of things to fill a long car journey there\u0027s no sense in making it longer than it has to be. If you don\u0027t already have one, or yours is too old to be useful, then consider a new sat nav. You can pick up a great device, like the Garmin Drive, which includes lifetime map updates and traffic camera alerts for just \u0026pound79. The Garmin Drive will also ensure you get there quickly - by rerouting you and diverting you away from traffic.   Halfords also has 20 per cent off a range of other sat navs for the bank holiday, so take a look online or visit your nearest store to find one that suits you. Any questions? Check our Halfords’ Sat Nav Buyers’ Guide. You might also want to pick up a Nextbase Dash Cam, for peace of mind on the road. Halfords also has 20 per cent off on a range of dash cams ahead of the holiday. In-store experts can even fit seamlessly into your car.  4. Watch your levels    Don\u0027t risk something delaying your journey because you remember 10 miles in that you\u0027ve run out of screenwash or that the oil level is low. Why not book a FREE Summer Car Check for your car at a time that suits you. Book online and trained colleagues will carry out a free car bulb check and check your battery, wiper blades, engine oil level, air conditioning and check for any windscreen chips. They’ll even give you a free screen wash top-up and can top up your oil too. It’s all designed to make your holiday go smoothly and make preparation hassle-free. Halfords’ in-store experts can also fit anything from wiper blades to batteries and from cycle racks to roof-boxes for a small fee.

The 470 Exodus litre roof box, below, has loads of room for extra gear and luggage to keep the car clutter-free.

Aaron Thompson originally from Romford, Essex, got sick of travelling back and forth to see his girlfriend who lived in Lutterworth, Leicestershire. So bravely, he decided he would try and buy a house in her city, and that\u0027s exactly what he did.  The now 19-year-old bought the new build home with his girlfriend Jessica King, 21, and moved into the property in March.  He has revealed that while saving up for the three-bed, he would give himself just \u0026pound70 a week to spend and lived with his parents.  His new home cost \u0026pound230,000 according to the Daily Mail. And Aaron has provided a list of top tips on how to afford buying your own place - including setting a budget, using the help to buy scheme, and not being scared. Speaking about his decision to buy a property at such a young age, he said: I got with my girlfriend when I was young, I was 15. She lived in Lutterworth, it was a lot of travelling back and forth.   He told the Leicester Mercury : I got to the point one day when I thought I am not going to do this anymore. I was never going to break up with Jess, I just thought sod it I\u0027ll buy a house.  I saved up as much as I could, and thanks to the help to buy scheme we managed to make it possible. I also have to thank my parents for their support - to say to them at 18 I am moving 100 miles away to buy a house, for some parents that would be mad, but my parents support me through everything. 1) Don\u0027t be scared My number one thing is it\u0027s not as scary as you think. Even money problems- I am only an apprentice electrician, I am not earning big money. I earn bog standard money. I still have a gym membership, I still have a phone contract, I still go out with my friends. They say buying a house is a really big thing, but it\u0027s not as big as you expect. 2) Save money on some things but spend on the important things The other thing is don\u0027t cheap out on the important stuff. The sofa, and the bed, and things like that, get the best you can but you don\u0027t need to go and spend \u0026pound50 on sofa cushions when you could get them much cheaper. You can go to Ikea and get cutlery and things like that rather than spending a fortune. 3) Don\u0027t buy a glass table Everytime you sit down at that dining room table it has stuff on it and you need to wipe it down. 4) Don\u0027t rush into it Me and my girlfriend have been together four years. I know that we are happy. One thing I would say to young couples is don\u0027t rush into buying a house. If you are young and moving in with someone you have been with for four or five months and you are all loved up, you might think it\u0027s okay but you can wait. I knew I was ready to move out. 5) Use the help to buy scheme If you can, use the help to buy scheme and don\u0027t rent. The downpayment with the help to buy scheme was peanuts, it really was. It didn\u0027t take us long to get it. 6) Set a budget Leave yourself with a set amount to spend every week and put money away. Then you don\u0027t feel suffocated but you don\u0027t spend all your earnings. Aaron is an apprentice electrician by trade and is also a racing driver. He met his girlfriend, who is a former racer through racing. Although he one day hopes to be a paid racing driver, for now being an electrician is what pays the bills. He added: When I left school - I wasn\u0027t the most academic of people and I always knew I wasn\u0027t going to go to university or do A Levels. My father was a professional race car driver, he said to me go and get a trade job and then you will have work. I am in my final year of an apprenticeship, training to be an electrician. My main goal is to become a paid racing driver. I have been racing myself for 11 years but my granddad was a racing driver, my dad was too, same with my uncles, and my cousin drives in the touring cars. Saving money has been a priority for Aaron since he started working and he soon saw the benefits in buying early. He said: I am not wasteful, it\u0027s my money. I know for a fact if I am going to be a race driver or a tradesman I need some sort of pension. It\u0027s not just a family thing for me, it\u0027s an investment. The quicker I can buy one property the quicker I can buy the second property.  The main thing that helped Aaron save the money was budgeting, in addition to being able to use the Help to Buy scheme. He added: It\u0027s hard for me to say how long I have been saving for. I was living with my parents and putting stuff away. I was leaving myself \u0026pound70 a week as money to spend. Even now I am still budgeting myself \u0026pound100 a week. If I want to take Jess out for a meal, buy a new pair of trainers or anything like that it has to come out of that. After years of a long distance relationship, Aaron decided to move to Lutterworth, where his girlfriend Jessica is from.

Russell Edwards, who weighed almost 20 stone, realised his fast food habit was getting out of control after he looked at his bank statements and noticed how much cash was being spent on burgers and chips. He says he was eating breakfast at McDonald\u0027s at least five times a week. However, the 37-year-old soon turned his life around after swapping McDonald\u0027s for power walking on his lunch breaks.  When we had our son, things started to change in my life and I didn\u0027t realise it at the time - but I started to struggle with my weight, Russell told Wales Online.  Having a new child meant I had no time for fitness and I let myself go. He was a poor sleeper, so I\u0027d stay up all night watching Netflix and started eating chocolates and biscuits at around 2am.  Russell said things started to get worse after he left his job as a health club manager at The Miskin Manor Hotel \u0026amp Health Club and landed a new job at a water treatment company - which was right next door to a McDonald\u0027s restaurant. The job was office based and right next door there was a Greggs and a McDonald\u0027s. I was so big that I started to get lazy - which meant I\u0027d sleep late in the mornings and wouldn\u0027t have time to make breakfast. It wasn\u0027t long before Russell started stopping in McDonald\u0027s before work. It\u0027s lethal having a contactless debit card - because I didn\u0027t realise what I was spending there, he said. I was having breakfast there around five days a week.  It started with a coffee and then coffee and a breakfast meal and then all of that and a wrap as well. And sometimes I\u0027d even have lunch there too. One month I remember checking my bank statement and I\u0027d spent \u0026pound200 at McDonald\u0027s. I couldn\u0027t believe it! Russell added: It wasn\u0027t McDonald\u0027s\u0027 fault - you can make good choices there these days, but I was just making the wrong choices. It was my own fault - I chose to eat it and I slipped into a bad habit. Russell said his weight at the time - which was around 19 stone 4lbs - was not only effecting his physical health, but his mental health too, making made him desperately unhappy. I came home from work one day and my son said to me \u0027Dad, Dad - come and play with me\u0027 and I had to say no because I was too tired. Seeing his face all upset made me think - what are you doing? I wasn\u0027t tired I was just overweight. Russell said another experience which played a huge factor in his decision to lose weight was when he travelled to Toulouse to watch Wales during the UEFA Euro 2016 Championship.  I hadn\u0027t tried on any of my clothes, so before the game I realised none of my Wales tops fitted me and I couldn\u0027t button up my 44-inch waist shorts. I had to go out and buy XXL clothes.  Looking back at photos from two years ago, what stands out is the shirt I wore to the games, Russell said. It was the biggest size I had ever had to buy and although I knew then that I had to do something about it, I couldn’t. I was in a rut and it was really hard to get going. He added: I told my brother - who was with me in France at the time - I\u0027m not going to be like this next year. When he returned from his trip, Russell - who left his office job to return to work at the health club - started running in the lane behind his house. He also bought a Fitbit watch to track his steps. I was too self-conscious to go to the gym. I was worried people would laugh. So I started running in the lane behind my house. And I was very unfit. I could only run for around three minutes.  I was also only managing around 1,000 steps a day on my watch, and 800 of those were just walking to and from my car to get to work. So, I set myself a target of reaching around 10,000 a day. Russell also made an effort to change his diet in conjunction with the watch - which meant cutting out his McDonald\u0027s breakfast and lunch. I knew the watch wouldn’t work miracles on its own, but I understood it would make me accountable for my activity, or lack of it, he said. I started focusing on healthy meals and cooking more at home - things like spaghetti bolognese and fish. I still had the odd treat too, but I cut out McDonald\u0027s totally. Despite his lifestyle and diet changes, Russell says it was running that really helped him transform his life. So much so, that last year he completed his first 10k race and has signed up for this year\u0027s Cardiff Half Marathon. He\u0027s now hoping to inspire others to follow suit.

The new Duke of Sussex dated Chelsy on and off for seven years from 2004 to 2011 and the jewellery designer was invited to the stunning wedding ceremony at St George\u0027s Chapel on Saturday - but not the evening reception at Frogmore House.  Another of Harry\u0027s exes, Cressida Bonas, was also at the Windsor Castle wedding.  According to Vanity Fair in the days before the wedding Harry , 33, and Chelsy, 32, had a tearful \u0027parting\u0027 phone call.  The publication claim a source told them: It was their final call, a parting call in which they both acknowledged Harry was moving on.  Chelsy was quite emotional about it all, she was in tears and almost didn’t go to the wedding. The prince and Chelsy remained good friends after their 2011 split with the 33-year-old invited to Prince William and Kate\u0027s wedding the same year. That set tongues wagging the pair were back on but Harry said he was 100% single amid a flutter of speculation he was interested in Pippa Middleton after she took the headlines for her bum at the ceremony.  But Zimbabwean Chelsy has spoke about the media scrutiny their romance suffered.  In an interview she said: It was so full-on: crazy and scary and uncomfortable. I found it very difficult when it was bad. I couldn\u0027t cope. I was trying to be a normal kid and it was horrible. Chelsy appeared uneasy while sat in St George\u0027s Chapel preparing to watch her one-time-beau tie the knot with American actress Meghan Markle.       But there is no bad blood between the pair. At the lunchtime reception Chelsy greeted the bride and was all smiles as she hugged her tightly, a source told the Mirror. Harry and Zimbabwean-born Chelsy met when they were both students at boarding school. She even met the Queen at a society wedding and was a guest at Prince Charles 60th 10 years ago, as her relationship with Harry became more serious.

The Duke of Edinburgh, 96, attended Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0027s nuptials despite reportedly having a cracked rib after falling in the bath just days earlier. Showing no sign of pain, Philip appeared in high spirits smiling at Royal Wedding well wishers as he walked unaided into St George\u0027s Chapel at Windsor Castle with the Queen.  A royal insider said he refused to use a stick to help him, and added to The Sun : The Duke is not a fan of showering and prefers to bathe.  But he’s a determined man and nothing was going to stop him attending.”  The groom\u0027s grandfather is also said to have run up and down the stairs in order to get in shape for the special day. Royal biographer Penny Junor described the Duke as \u0027completely heroic\u0027 after attending the wedding. She said: Given he is 96 and the operation was six weeks ago, I think it shows he is an extraordinary man.”  Philip had also recently recovered from a hip replacement after undergoing surgery at King Edward VII hospital on April 4. Nine days later, he was pictured smiling and giving onlookers a royal wave as he was driven away from the London hospital.  In early May, Kensington Palace said they were unsure if the Duke would attend the Royal Wedding , adding that Buckingham Palace staff would have guidance on that closer to the time.   The Duke of Edinburgh, the longest-serving consort in British history and also the oldest serving partner of a reigning monarch, retired from public duties in August of last year - 64 years afer he began his service to the British public. Prince Philip\u0027s first royal engagement after the Queen\u0027s coronation was a dinner in the Officers\u0027 Mess at Eastney Barracks on July 15 1953.  Philip, who was 32, wore smart Royal Marines mess dress. The Times recorded how he motored from Odiham to Eastney Barracks and watched the massed bands of the Portsmouth Command beat retreat on the cricket field. The Duke had been appointed Captain General of the corps and the newspaper said: For the occasion, officers and men of the corps had come from all Royal Marine units in the United Kingdom and ships of the Home Fleet.

Bearing a strange resemblance to a crocodile, the 41-year-old placed a photo of the animal on Facebook , with many weighing in with their theories of what it could be.  She said: “I was going for a run with my dogs when I came across it. It looked like a well rotted cetacean to me.  “I put it on Facebook and it caused a big discussion. Other people think it is something different, like a crocodile. “It would be very interesting to find out what species it is.” Dr Dan Forman, of the Swansea ecology research team at Swansea University\u0027s department of biosciences, has now offered his view on what it could be. He said: “Its jawline suggests it is like a cetacean whale or a dolphin. “We get a reasonable amount of whales and dolphins, a lot which are dead and decomposed in places like Pendine and Rhossili. “From the data around carcasses washed up, there seems to be a cluster this time of year around June and July. “The jaw is thin in places and it looks from the picture like it is upside down. “When you look at it the first time you may think it is a crocodile, but it is certainly not.

While some Brits will bask in 30C on Monday, others will face ran storms which are set to soak large parts of the country from tonight.  The gloomy prediction comes as forecasters advise people to make the most of the unseasonably warm May weather , with summer predicted to be cooler than average.  Outbreaks of rain will start to affect central and southern England and much of Wales from Thursday evening. According to the Weather Channel, some of the downpour will be heavy and thundery with a chance of hail in isolated spots where storms are at their most severe.  It will be warm and sunny in north-west England, Northern Ireland and Scotland, but it will remain cloudy and cooler in the north-east. More showers return on Friday but there will still be some sunny spells for most regions.  Rain will travel over Wales and the Midlands to the north of England, easing to light patches in the afternoon. It will become mostly dry over the south of England and the Midlands by evening. Elsewhere it should remain dry throughout the day. On Saturday there is the risk of occasional showers and thunder on the south coast, but elsewhere will be cloudy - except for Scotland where it will be dry and sunny.  Heat will start to build through Sunday and Monday peaking at a scorching 29C in the south of England. A spokesperson for The Weather Channel commented: “There is a mostly sunny and dry outlook under high pressure with the best of the sunshine expected over central and northern areas. “It will be cloudier in the south with showers at times, due to the presence of weak troughs of low pressure, becoming more widespread later with the threat of thunder showers.  “Mostly gentle onshore easterly winds will keep maximum temperatures lower along the east coast than further inland and to the west.” Temperatures could top 29C on Monday in the south-east of England - comparable with the Caribbean. However the scorching prediction is not set to break records, with the warmest late May bank holiday weekend recorded in 1944, when temperatures in southern England reached 32.8C.

Today two men were jailed for life after being found guilty of murder , while a woman was convicted of manslaughter.  Siblings Demi, Brandon, Lacie and Lia Pearson died after the horrific attack in Walkden in December, and their mum Michelle is still recovering in hospital. Her family today said Michelle, 36, would never recover from her broken heart. Zak Bolland, 23, was handed four life terms and told he must serve at least 40 years behind bars. David Worrall, 26, was ordered to serve a minimum term of 37 years in prison. A third defendant, Courtney Brierley, 20, was handed 21 years in a young offenders’ institution for manslaughter.  In a statement from the family, read out on the steps of Manchester Crown Court following the sentencing, the children\u0027s grandmother Sandra Lever said: Today may be the end of the trial but it is not the end for us as we try to recover and get on with out lives. Michelle, the children\u0027s mum, is still recovering from her injuries, and will be in hospital for some time to come. The staff have been amazing and are trying their best to fix her, but they will never be able to fix her broken heart. We miss the children every day, our lives are just not the same without them.  And the statement continued: We will never again hear their voices... that thought leaves us numb. I hope that Bolland, Worrall and Brierley know that they have taken away the light of our lives. We are very happy today with the results and would like to thank all those who have helped us to get justice. Demi, 15, Brandon, eight, Lacie, seven, and three-year-old Lia died after two lit petrol bombs were tossed inside their home last December.  The court had heard the children suffered cardiac arrests and died as a result of a combination of smoke inhalation and burns following the blaze. Their mum, Michelle Pearson, screamed Not the kids! Not my kids! before being overcome by the smoke, heat and flames that had filled the house.  This afternoon, Bolland - who had been involved in a petty feud with the victims\u0027 brother Kyle Pearson, 17 - and Worrall were both locked up for life for murdering the four siblings. The sentences were delivered in complete silence at the court, with the grieving Pearson family watching from the public gallery. Speaking after sentencing Detective Chief Inspector Lewis Hughes from GMP’s Major Incident Team said: This is one of the most heartbreaking cases I have ever dealt with. I am glad that the sentences these three have received today reflect their atrocious acts, but nothing can change what has happened and nothing can bring back the children. I would like to commend the bravery of the children’s family. I can’t even begin to imagine what they have been through.  My thoughts will always be with their mother Michelle, along with their father, brothers and wider family and friends. They have all shown a phenomenal amount of strength during the most devastating of circumstances. When Bolland, Worrall and Brierley planned their attack, they knew that innocent children were asleep in their beds. They smashed the kitchen window and threw their handmade petrol bombs inside. The fire spread so quickly and the heat was so intense that the smoke alarms melted before they had chance to sound. This left the family with virtually no chance of escape.

The driver was snapped on the 40mph road in Bournemouth by a photographer, prompting the fury of stunned viewers. She was spotted looking in the driver\u0027s side sun visor mirror while seemingly beautifying herself, trying to keep one eye on the road ahead. At the wheel of a white Honda, she appeared to attempt to apply her mascara while keeping up with the busy flow of traffic streaming along the dual carriageway. A child, thought to be around three years old, was in the back of the car on Wessex Way, Bournemouth.  The picture was taken by a photographer from the Daily Echo as part of a campaign against drivers using mobile phones at the wheel. Furious social media users voiced their disbelief at her actions, with one writing: The penalty is still way too low. A 12 month ban and a fine might make these idiots think twice!

You are not in proper control of your vehicle and such incidents could amount to careless driving offences.

The pedestrian, Elaine Herzberg, was struck by the vehicle as it travelled at around 40mph on a busy road, and Uber has been branded reckless in the aftermath of the tragedy. It was the first time a pedestrian has been killed by a self-driving car. Now it has emerged that the car\u0027s emergency breaking system had been disabled ahead of the tragedy, which happened in Arizona in March. The 49-year-old victim was struck despite the modified Volvo XC90\u0027s radar systems observing her six seconds before the crash, a preliminary report by the National Transportation Safety Board. The car has an autonomous mode, during which a computer does the driving, and a manual mode, when a human takes over.  A safety operator behind the wheel appeared to be looking down, and not at the road, moments before the crash, according to video from inside the car released by police. The operator told the NTSB she was not looking at a mobile phone but monitoring the vehicle\u0027s self-driving systems. William Wallace, senior policy analyst for Consumers Union, the advocacy division of Consumer Reports, called Uber reckless and said the NTSB report makes it clear that a self-driving car was tested on public roads when it wasn\u0027t safe enough to be there, and it killed a pedestrian. He added that the system was far too dangerous to be tested off a closed track. It said the self-driving system software classified the pedestrian as an unknown object, as a vehicle, and then as a bicycle.  Just over a second before the impact the car\u0027s self-driving system determined that emergency braking was needed, but Uber said emergency braking manoeuvers were not enabled while the vehicle was under computer control. Uber has said it would shut down its Arizona self-driving testing program and focus on limited testing in Pittsburgh and two cities in California. Arizona\u0027s governor in March had suspended Uber\u0027s permit for the testing, citing safety concerns. The company did not directly comment on the NTSB findings but noted it recently named a former NTSB chairman, Christopher Hart, to advise on Uber\u0027s safety culture.

Championship down south, now seem the 23-year-old’s most likely destination.The Tangerines announced last night that Fraser had rejected their offer of a lucrative new deal and would be pursuing other options.He’s been speaking to a number of clubs in England and there has even been interest from abroad.For the past month or so Hearts have appeared to be leading the race for Fraser and their first-team coach, ex-Tannadice favourite Jon Daly, has watched him on several occasions.Burton, managed by Nigel Clough, have now jumped to the front of the queue.They’re expected to beat off that interest from Tynecastle as well as offers from English rivals Peterborough and Blackpool, to get Fraser fixed up.Accepting the player’s decision to go, manager Csaba Laszlo stressed United had fought hard to hang on to him.“We did everything we could to keep Scott at the club,” he said.“He is a gifted player and we made him a very good offer to stay with us.“He is a great example to young players of the pathway that is open to them in professional football and I have no doubt he will do very well in the future.“We know that good players will attract attention and, for this reason, we are already at an advanced stage in replacing Scott and a number of the other players that left at the end of the season.”Fraser himself made it clear after over a decade at Tannadice he felt the time to move to pastures new had come.His big regret is the broken foot that’s plagued him since early last year prevented him doing more to help in the battle to get back to the Premiership.He first broke it at St Mirren in March 2017 and did it again at the same venue when United lost there at the end of December.“I would like to take this opportunity to thank the club for everything they have done for me over the past 12 years.“When I joined the academy back in 2006 I could only dream of making over 100 appearances.“Unfortunately, my last season was the most frustrating I have ever had with the injury and I am gutted we couldn’t achieve promotion.“Thanks to all my team-mates, coaches and managers over the years.“I now feel the time is right for me to move on in order to improve as a player by playing at the highest level I possibly can.“Thanks again and good luck for next season.”Meanwhile, Graeme Liveston, who for many years was in charge of United’s youth recruitment in the west coast, could be set for a return to Tannadice as part of the shake-up to the youth set-up that’s taking place this summer.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/C700681F-2CB0-4155-8991-C2187F0C1BD7.jpg-e1527156782605-798x564.jpg ","title":"dundee actor brian cox

toothbrush, toothpaste and free flow cup at around four months old and parents are advised to register their children at the dentist.“Taking your child to the dentist as early as possible helps them to get used to the sights, sounds and smells of a dental practice and it will give parents access to information, advice and support to look after their child’s teeth.“At the dental practice, you will be given advice and support from the dental team, who will show you how you can help your child keep healthy teeth and stop them suffering tooth decay in the future.”Donna added: “There are many parents with dental anxiety.“Taking their children to a check-up and prevention appointment helps them to see their children enjoy toothbrushing and a chat.”People can visit the “smile” page at

All in just one year for this happy couple!Kayleigh Petrie, 22, and Aaron Ogilvie, 23, met when they were just 11 at the carnival but the pair only became a couple after Kayleigh picked Aaron up from a night out just over four years ago.Aaron, an auxiliary worker, said: “From the night that Kayleigh picked me up we were together, although it took me months to officially ask her out!”Three years later the pair were shocked to find out that Kayleigh was pregnant after originally being told that a natural conception would not be possible.Kayleigh, a social care worker, said: “We didn’t expect me to get pregnant as I was told I couldn’t have children because I have endometriosis.“However, I did fall pregnant naturally and I even had to cancel an operation to have my eggs removed that I had been waiting more than a year for.“It was a massive shock but an amazing one.”The Coldside couple welcomed beautiful baby Oak Ogilvie on March 19, weighing a healthy 7lb 10oz.Following five days in hospital, the new family arrived home and although Kayleigh and Aaron admit parenthood is hard, they say it is all worth it.When Oak was eight weeks old, she donned the family christening gown that her mum and many other relatives going back almost 50 years had worn and was christened at St Martin’s Church in the Hilltown.The surprises kept coming at the reception as Aaron decided to get down on one knee and propose to Kayleigh – although it almost did not happen.Aaron said: “I wasn’t sure if I was going to be able to propose that day as a family friend was buying the ring on a trip to Dubai and was only returning home on the same day as the christening.“I was so nervous as I am not a speaker anyway and I was worried the ring wasn’t going to arrive.“I was even sick outside due to nerves. Kayleigh thought I was just drunk and told me to stop drinking. I had only had three drinks!“The ring finally arrived around 5pm and I made a speech in front of both of our families and got down on one knee.“Kayleigh had no idea I was going to do it.”Kayleigh added: “I was so shocked. I didn’t expect it at all.“If I had known I would have battered him.“It was amazing that our families were there to see it because family is so important.“There are now five generations in my family so it was really special.“My mum kindly looked after Oak that night so we were able to go out in the Ferry and celebrate.”The couple are now busy planning their wedding in 2020, which they hope can be on the same date as their engagement.“I can’t wait for the wedding,” said Kayleigh. “Oak will be two when it comes around so she will be our flower girl and she will be able to walk down the aisle.”The happy family would like to thank Kayleigh’s mum Gillian for organising and paying for the christening and also uncle Paul who took all the pictures of the day.Kayleigh added: “We would also like to say a massive thank you to all of the godparents. We had seven in total because it was too hard to choose between our friends.“The christening and engagement made it a day and night we won’t forget.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5b0683e143065.jpg ","title":"dundee people students draw on creativity for annual creative spaces competition in dundee","story":"\t\t\t\t\tMore than 100 students from Dundee, Angus, Fife and Perth came to Dundee and Angus College for a 15th annual regional design competition.The Creative Spaces event saw 104 S2 pupils from 26 schools visit the college’s Kingsway campus for a day of good old-fashioned teamwork.The competition involves teams of four drawing, costing and constructing a scale model of a building, based on a specific brief.

Prior to that the Tangerines were unbeaten in 15 of 16 league games he played.With the 25-year-old set to return around the start of the new season, Duff believes it was vital United beat off interest from Championship rivals Ross County to get him fixed up on a new two-year contract. Having known him since he was a kid at Aberdeen the best part of a decade ago, Duff is well placed to judge what he can do.“I actually watched one of United’s play-off games with Fraser and from speaking to him I know he is working hard to get back fit,” he said.“He’s about to start running again so it shouldn’t be too long before he is back. That, and him signing a new deal, is very good news for United.“You saw the quality he has when he played for part of last season.“He was a bit of a stand-out in the United team and I will not be surprised if that’s the case again next season.“It really will not surprise me if they build the team around him because that’s the level of ability he has.”With most of last season’s team gone, Fyvie will be surrounded by new faces.That will make United something of an unknown quantity and bringing so many players in at one time has to be something of a gamble.For Duff it’s a calculated risk and, so long as the right type of player is sourced, he believes the team can gel.“I think if you go out and get the right players with the right attitude and philosophy, it can work.“You want players who want to come in and work hard to prove, basically, why the club signed them and that they should be playing at a club like United. If they do that then United can be where they want to be.”And having spent the best part of a decade at Tannadice from the start of his career, he would like nothing better than to see them back in the top flight.Last week he was back in a United strip for Dave Bowman’s annual game to raise cash for skin cancer and dementia charities. Running out at Tannadice reminded Duff where United should be.“You look around the place and it’s geared up for the Premiership but no one has the divine right to be there, you have to earn it. It will be a battle again next season because it’s a tough league.“But I was here nine-and-a-half years from when I was a kid and the upbringing here was very good – second to none – so I want United back up.”At 36, and despite recently taking on a new job with the Connect Energy Group that involves a lot of travelling, Duff has no plans to hang up his own boots.Next season he’ll again be plying his trade in the Highland League with Inverurie Locos.“The new job is keeping me busy but I do get Saturdays off so I’m available and happy to keep playing.“We finished third last year, so the aim is to go a bit higher next season.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"livingston star byrne on dundee united radar","story":"\t\t\t\t\tLivingston promotion hero Shaun Byrne is the latest player to be linked with a move to Dundee United.But the Tangerines will face stiff competition from elsewhere if they do move for him.The 24-year-old was part of the side that clinched promotion to the Premiership by beating Partick Thistle in the play-offs on Sunday.He’s now out of contract and that’s alerted United, Falkirk and a string of English clubs.

been arrested and subsequently released without charge pending further inquiries.Parents had claimed a woman wearing dark lipstick and a dark hood had targeted children of nursery age.One mum in Dundee’s Charleston area said her four-year-old daughter had been “grabbed” in the street by a middle-aged woman matching the description.The woman had allegedly asked the child, who was out walking

abduction”.The incident happened near the junction of Brownhill Street and Buttars Terrace around 7pm on Tuesday.Another local mother said: “There is a woman going about dressed in black with a black hood up and black lipstick.“She tells kids she has a puppy and asks if they would like to see it and she has tried grabbing them.“The police are all over the area and have asked people to keep an eye

wishlist","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee are in the hunt for a goalscorer and Leyton Orient marksman Macauley Bonne is top of their wishlist.The Zimbabwe international scored 25 goals for the National League side last season, sparking the Dark Blues interest.Born in Ipswich, Bonne started his career at Colchester United, where he played with current Dundee midfielder Glen Kamara briefly, before loans at Lincoln City and Woking.It’s been at Brisbane Road, however, where he’s shone, smashing in 22 league goals last season.With a year remaining on his current deal there, a fee will be required to prise him from Orient and that could be a sticking point with the non-league side holding out for six figures.With Shrewsbury, Portsmouth and Burton Albion all interested, too, Dundee have fierce competition to land the 22-year-old striker.Orient are also keen to keep him on a longer contract but a mid-table finish in the National League is unlikely to have been enough to keep him amid interest from other clubs.Dens gaffer Neil McCann highlighted a lack of killer instinct in his side throughout last season, something he is determined to rectify this summer with a proven goalscorer.With money in the bank from the January sale of defender Jack Hendry, Dundee have the funds behind them to strengthen that area of the team.And having already raided the English non-league for Roarie Deacon last summer and Elton Ngwatala last week, Neil is hoping he can attract another National League star to come north of the border.\t\t\t"},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7486028.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the

be turned into flats","story":"\u0026nbspA FORMER office block in the heart of Inverness is set to take on\u0026nbsp a new lease of life as self-catering holiday apartments.The Glen Mhor Hotel has submitted a planning application to turn the block between 8 and 14a Church Street into 29 apartments and to add a rooftop extension.The upmarket company acquired the building earlier this year for \u0026pound1.7 million.In recent years, owners Jon and Victoria Erasmus have developed their flagship hotel in Ness Bank to provide more bedrooms as well as adding luxury self-catering accommodation.Their plans for the building come as the city is witnessing a boom in the hospitality sector which is set to see hundreds of extra tourist bedrooms created in the next few years.Other ventures in the pipeline include the former Bridge House building \u0026ndash directly opposite \u0026ndash which is set to be transformed into a hotel.\u0026nbspThe application, submitted to Highland Council, features\u0026nbsp 12 one-bedroom and\u0026nbsp 17 two-bedroom apartments, each with its own private bathroom, kitchen and living area.Access would be via Baron Taylor Street and the new top floor would offer views across the city.A design statement submitted with the application states\u0026nbsp the hotel seeks to enhance the growing requirement for city centre accommodation.\"Tourism figures for the city demonstrate a strong and steady growth,\" it states.\"Indeed at time, there is a higher demand for accommodation than the current supply can satisfy.\"Mike Smith, manager of Inverness business improvement district, described the planned project as \"very exciting\"\"This is a major investment on the part of Jon and Victoria Erasmus,\" he said.\"It brings back into a use a building which needs invest-ment and bringing up to date and will complement other new ventures in the city.\"Friday 25 May 2018 8:35

gridlock","story":"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe scheme to widen the B9006 Culloden Road approach to the often gridlocked Inshes Roundabout with an additional westbound lane for city centre traffic starts on May 21 and is expected to last 22 weeks.When complete, it will provide two continuous lanes of traffic between the Inverness Campus junction and the roundabout.Signs will be erected to guide pedestrians and cyclists through the works.A Highland Council spokeswoman said: \u0026ldquoUse would be made of the evening period when traffic flows are much lower, it is likely that traffic lights will be in operation in the off-peak periods.Garry Smith, the council\u0027 principal engineer, said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore aware of the sensitivity of this arterial route into the city and the provision of an additional lane will ease the flow of traffic into Inverness from the east.\u0026ldquoThe pinch-point on the A9, over the bridge where traffic currently merges into one city-bound lane leads to driver frustration.\u0026ldquoThe scheme seeks to remove this pinch-point from the network.Signs will be erected giving drivers advance notice of the restrictions.The contract for the project was awarded to Wills Bros.Plans for a new East Link road connecting the A9 and A96 will go on display at Raigmore Community Centre on Wednesday and at Smithton-Culloden Free Church on Thursday.Friday

fund","story":"\u0026nbspA VOLUNTEER for the Highland Hospice has signed herself up for a gruelling 10-week transformation programme to try and raise cash for the charity.Tracey Morrison (47) had already volunteered to take part in the hospice\u0027 Rocky Mountain challenge this September when kind-hearted personal trainer Alan Goodwin offered the hospice a free place on his intense fitness programme.Mrs Morrison, of Milton Of Leys, accepted the opportunity to get fit fast in preparation for her upcoming trek even though it was completely out of her comfort zone.\"You could say that I am an unfit 47-year-old,\" she said.\"Activity isn\u0026rsquot the best for me and I had never even heard of a fitness bleep test. I thought\u0026nbsp I have to do something about my general health and lifestyle and get to a better place.\"She hopes people will follow her journey as she takes part in the Spartan 70 challenge with Mr Goodwin and donate pounds as she sheds them.\"I am hoping to lose 20 pounds over the course of 10 weeks so if people were happy to donate to match that, it would be wonderful,\" she said.She has been volunteering with the hospice since 2013 and was delighted to be chosen to take part in this fitness challenge and the Rocky Mountain Challenge, that will see her embark on a 10-day trek through the Canadian Rockies.\"It is the challenge of a lifetime and so completely out of my comfort zone,\" she said.\"I am delighted to have the opportunity.\"Mr Goodwin came up with the idea of offering a place on his course after a recent tour of the hospice facilities.\"The Spartan 70 programme has been so successful that we expanded it, doubled the number of recruits and took on another trainer,\" the 39-year-old said.\"I wanted to give something back and the hospice is just so great. They do so much with so little funding.\"He launched Alan Goodwin Personal Training three years ago and is now based in the Inverness Tennis and Squash Club but likes to take as many of his sessions outdoors as possible.He added: \"The fundraising team next door at Highland Hospice do an incredible job of keeping the place running day to day and, having received a recent tour, they offer something so meaningful.\"We are very lucky to have something like this in the area.\"He will be supporting Mrs Morrison to achieve her goals but he admitted that the programme can be tough.For 10 weeks Mrs Morrison will have to give up alcohol, submit a weekly food diary based on strict healthy-eating guidelines, attend early morning group sessions twice a week, attend weekly outdoor boot camps on Nairn Beach and Ord Hill and during this time she is not allowed to miss\u0026nbsp more than eight sessions.Anyone taking part in the programme who breaks these rules will be disqualified.\"It is really strict but I think Tracey will do really well,\" Mr Goodwin said.\"It is really successful because the people that take really want to get in great shape.\"He added: \"I really hope that people will give generously and sponsor her for her losses between now and July 22.\"Weekly updates on Mrs Morrison\u0027 progress will be posted on the Alan Goodwin Personal Training Facebook page and also the Highland Hospice\u0027 social media.To donate to Tracey Morrison\u0027 challenge visit https://www.justgiving/fundraising/tracey-morrison71\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspFriday 25 May 2018 8:36 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"}]
