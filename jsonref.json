Dennis SanSoucie (right), Hernandez\u0027s secret gay lover from middle school and high school, spoke out earlier this month The former football star\u0027s attorney, Jose Baez, writes in a new book, Unnecessary Roughness, that he informed Hernandez in the final days of his double murder trial that prosecutors were planning to question his fiancee Shayanna Jenkins about his affairs - one with a woman and one with another man.That is when Hernandez burst into tears wrote Baez, afraid of how Jenkins would react to the news of his secret relationship with a member of the same sex who also happened to be a mutual friend of the couple. \u0027But Jose, she\u0027ll be devastated. I never meant to hurt her. I know I keep disappointing her. But she is my soul,\u0027 Hernandez told Baez.\u0027She is all I have and will ever have.\u0027Baez then told Jenkins, and writes that while she was blindsided and felt \u0027betrayed,\u0027 she remained by Hernandez\u0027s side. Hernandez and Baez met in 2016, when the then-26-year-old was serving a life sentence for the murder of Odin Lloyd in 2013 and had just been indicted for an earlier double-homicide. The prominent attorney helped Hernandez win an acquittal in those murders on April 14, 2017, and was planning to appeal the previous conviction before the athlete killed himself days later on April 19 in the maximum security prison.          Hernandez\u0027s attorney, Jose Baez, writes in a new book, Unnecessary Roughness, that he told Hernandez in the final days of his double murder trial that prosecutors planned to question his fiancee Shayanna Jenkins about his affairs - one with a woman and one with another man  That is when Hernandez burst into tears wrote Baez, afraid of how Jenkins (pictured with Hernandez, right) would react to the news of his secret relationship with a member of the same sex who also happened to be a mutual friend of the coupleBaez claimed in the wake of his death that a brain scan revealed the star suffered from chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) after having taken innumerate blows to the head on the football field.\u0027He had a serious brain disease,\u0027 Baez wrote. \u0027We need more awareness of it, or we\u0027re going to see more suicides.\u0027After revelations about his brain injuries, Jenkins said she would be suing  the New England Patriots.A lawsuit filed last year on behalf of the two by Baez said Hernandez had \u0027the most severe case of Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy medically seen in a person of his young age of 28 years\u0027 by Boston University researchers.The lawsuit also named the NFL initially, but they were then dropped as defendants in the case.Hernandez had just signed a seven-year, $40million contract with the Patriots prior to the 2012 season, one of the biggest contracts in the league at the time.Prior to his time in New England he had numerous run-ins with the law during his college football career at the University of Florida.Jenkins stood by Hernandez\u0027s side throughout his trial, and in the aftermath dismissed claims that he was gay, despite his prison lover speaking out and exes confirming they knew about his predilection for members of his sex.   Aaron Hernandez hid secrets behind his smile - The Boston GlobeState investigators concealed degree of Aaron Hernandez’s drug use prior to suicide - The Boston Globe"},{"url":null,"title":"CHRISTOPHER STEVENS reviews years GBBO final","story":"    Rahul Mandal holds up the trophy alongside judges Paul Hollywood and Prue Leith after winning the Great British Bake Off          Rahul\u0027s final showstopper this series was an edible rock garden made from nearly 200 elements, the bake which won him the competition          The final was not without its controversies, however, as the eventual winner had to be given 15 minutes extra time after a storage jar shattered on his worktop. Pictured: Presenter Sandi Toksvig consoling him after the incidentWhether viewers will recall the name of last night’s victor a year from now is anyone’s guess. But one thing is certain: if it takes a nervous disposition, a slightly nutty character and a disarming lack of self-confidence to make a Bake Off hero, then Rahul Mandal, who emerged blinking and victorious at the end of this series, fits the bill perfectly.So did his closest rival, super-shy Kim-Joy Hewlett. The third finalist, Ruby Bhogal, revealed she had to bolster her self-belief by scribbling inspirational quotes on Post-It notes and plastering them over her fridge.With so much attention focused on the finalists, all of Asian heritage, judges Paul Hollywood and Prue Leith were almost by-standers. Sandi Toksvig and her co-presenter Noel Fielding had more to do, mostly comforting the contestants and talking them out of their panics. But it’s a shame that in 2018 some television personalities still feel they have to flash their cleavage to get themselves noticed.Noel spent the whole weekend with his psychedelic shirt open to the solar plexus, displaying skin as white as an albino rat with a tuft of limp chest hair.It wasn’t an appetising sight. He looked like a tubby Dracula, in need of a spray tan and a waxing.          Rahul, pictured with his mother as a baby in Kolkata, India, only took up baking two years ago having never made a cake before          Close-ups of the smashed storage jar show it had shattered all over Rahul\u0027s bench, making it impossible for him to finish the challengeTry as he might to distract the cameras, all the attention was on the search for the Most Overwrought Baker. King of the Nervous Nellies was Rahul, who appears to be a frightened 11-year-old boy trapped in the body of an undersized man aged 30. During the technical challenge, when the finalists were sent outside to bake pitta breads on open fires, Rahul flung his arm up in the air like a schoolboy desperate to be excused games. ‘I need help, am I doing it right?’ he pleaded.A nd after presenter Sandi gently explained that she wasn’t able to give advice, he muttered sadly, ‘I’d better just not come tomorrow. Just utter disgrace.’Rahul began each morning with a glass of milk. I suspect this is because his mother told him to do this when he was four, and he is still an obedient boy.But all that calcium doesn’t seem to have stiffened his spine: ‘I am very, very, very nervous,’ he admitted at the start of the final signature bake, featuring decorated doughnuts.Not that he’d ever been brave enough to actually try tasting one. ‘It looks like deep-fried bread,’ he fretted. ‘I’m not going to eat it.’ Quite right – harm could come to a young fellow.

But we all know that glass doesn’t simply explode on warm summer days, or tropical countries wouldn’t be able to have windows in their houses.That jar disintegrated because Rahul’s terror had set off a vibration of physical intensity.‘This is a sign from God that I need to stop baking,’ he wailed as he swept up the fragments.Kim-Joy tried to match his levels of eccentricity, by building a ruined temple in Atlantis out of gingerbread, and Ruby popped a unicorn on her profiteroles, but there was only ever going to be one winner.‘Oh no-no-no-no-no,’ he mumbled. But oh yes, Rahul – you’re this year’s Star Baker. Better get used to it.

But as this wipes out half of the gain for higher earners, he should have come clean and mentioned this in the Budget speech rather than leave it in the Budget small print.’However a rise in the basic rate income tax threshold to £12,500, which gives a £130 saving, will still leave top earners with a total reduction to their tax bill worth £495.The Conservative Party had pledged to increase the personal allowance to £12,500 and the higher-rate threshold to £50,000 by 2020. But these increases will now come into effect 12 months ahead of schedule at the start of the next tax year on April 6, 2019.The £4bn stamp duty farce: That’s how much higher rate has...Hammond\u0027s raid on Scots: Stealth hike to National Insurance...Labour revolt after John McDonnell says he WON\u0027T try to...Share this articleCritics have claimed the change benefits the wealthy more than the worse-off. But Mr Hammond told ITV’s Good Morning Britain that many middle-income workers in schools, hospitals and police services had been dragged into the higher rate of tax, adding: ‘It’s important to raise all of these thresholds. We promised to do so and we have done it.’Experts had feared Mr Hammond would be forced to renege on his promise to increase income tax thresholds in a bid to cover the cost of the £20billion funding pledge to the NHS. But speaking later on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Mr Hammond said: ‘When you make a promise to the electorate and they elect you then you have an obligation to deliver on that promise.’The Institute for Fiscal Studies yesterday said the Conservatives had pulled almost a million people into the higher tax bracket in the past eight years.          Philip Hammond tours the Eminox factory.  Experts calculated that half the £730 windfall of upper rate taxpayers would get wiped out by increased NI contributions It claimed that the rise in the threshold only went a small way to reversing the massive reductions since they came to power in 2010.It found there are now 900,000 more people in the higher rate tax bracket than if the 2010 threshold was maintained in line with inflation.The IFS also pointed out that the tax burden is the highest for almost half a century – back to the time of Harold Wilson.Tax receipts are now 34 per cent of national income, the biggest figure since 196970.The new thresholds will be frozen until the tax year starting in April 2021. At this point they will increase with inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index, currently 2.4 per cent.This will mean that as people earn more they will not automatically be dragged into a higher tax band."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/31/07/51D4305D00000578-6335477-image-m-18_1540970981893.jpg","title":"Maternal Meghan plays adorable little girl New Zealand","story":"Pick pleats like the Duchess of Sussex in GivenchyGivenchy bespoke navy pleated midi skirt and jumperShop a similar Givenchy skirt at Farfetch...She’s made it to the end of her first Australian tour, but The Duchess of Sussex still had time to treat us to one final look before she boarded the plane back to England!The royal turned to one of her favourite labels, Givenchy, for the occasion.

She later had to be treated in hospital for serious injuries including a collapsed lung and a zig-zag cut down her left breast.Wilkinson of Lancaster was arrested later on suspicion of attempted murder but claimed the victim had come at her with the blade.At Preston Crown Court, she admitted wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm after she initially denied wrongdoing. She made her boast of being \u0027your worst nightmare\u0027 on her Facebook status in which she added: \u0027If it wasn\u0027t for bull****, no-one in this town would have a conversation.\u0027The 7pm incident occurred on August 17 this year after Wilkinson suspected her partner had been having a fling with Miss Gelder.Mr Frances McEntee prosecuting, said: \u0027The case has a background which is long-standing. The defendant believed Miss Gelder was having a relationship with her partner.\u0027The complainant says that she heard banging on the door and she knew it would be the defendant because of their past difficulties. \u0027She opened her front door and immediately saw the defendant with her hand clenched and she was holding what the defendant described as a Swiss-Army knife.\u0027The complainant said what are you doing, you crazy b****? and the defendant is then said to have lunged at her with the knife. The complainant felt a number of blows to the face and body.  Wilkinson (pictured) was jailed at Preston Crown Court for unleashing the attack on the victim\u0027s doorstep  Jealous ex who knifed her former boyfriend and tried to cut...Jealous NHS worker accessed medical records of her...Share this article\u0027She tried to defect the blows of the defendant and then they both fell to the ground. The complainant was then top of the defendant, who still had hold of the knife.\u0027The defendant was then dragged away from the complainant. On lookers said that the complainant was bleeding heavily at this point. The complainant went back into the house and then set off on her bicycle while still bleeding heavily. A delivery man saw her pass out on the floor.\u0027She was immediately taken to the hospital and she had sustained some serious injuries. She sustained a number of cuts. Down the left side of her face, there is a long superficial cut.          The attacker admitted wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm at Preston Crown Court \u0027There\u0027s a puncture wound to her chest which has caused a zig-zag cut down the complainant\u0027s left breast. There is an injury to the underneath of her arm which is believed to have caused Pnuemothorax.\u0027This was a sustained assault with repeated blows delivered by a knife. It appears to be a Sommeliers knife, similar to a Swiss Army knife.\u0027When the defendant was arrested, her account was that the complainant had come at her with a knife. When the defendant was interviewed, she provided a statement which said that Yvonne Gelder came at her with a knife, but made no comment throughout.\u0027This is a high culpability offence because of the use of a knife and the puncture of the chest.\u0027In mitigation defence lawyer Christopher Evans, said: \u0027There were various falling outs and she is remorseful with what happened - the remorse is complete, it\u0027s extensive and it\u0027s genuine. She had a difficult childhood, particularly in her teenage years.\u0027But sentencing Judge Andrew Woolman told Wilkinsond: \u0027Make no mistake, this could have been a lot worse - the consequences could have been fatal.\u0027You have long-standing problems with the victim, maybe to do with your suspicions that she was having sexual relations with your partner. On August 17, you went to the complainant\u0027s house with what I suspect was the first sharp object you found, which was this Swiss Army Knife.\u0027You banged on the door and when she answered, you attacked her with it. She sustained injuries to her head and body and, fortunately, the slash on her face appeared to miss her eye.\u0027There were a number of other wounds one to her chest and one to the side of her chest which has caused Pnuemothorax which could have been fatal. Initially, you tried to say that she attacked you, which wasn\u0027t true, but you did plead guilty on the second occasion.\u0027I have read your letter, which is thoughtful and articulate and I accept that you say you are remorseful.\u0027 "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/31/05/51D2A71B00000578-0-image-a-56_1540965314504.jpg","title":"Tom Hanks childhood houseboat goes sale 600 000 Bay Area","story":"    On the market: Tom Hanks\u0027 childhood houseboat in Alameda, California is on sale for $600,000 (£472,000)          Small and cosy: The Forrest Gump star lived in the quaint abode previously owned by his father Amos from 1973 to 1976          Quaint abode: The 1,152sq-ft home has two bedrooms, one bathrooms, and a top floor living room and kitchen   Hanks (pictured in the 1980s), 62, was born in Concord, California on July 9, 1956.

And if you want to join in with your own woolly tribute, our knitting pattern shows the way.How easy is it? Please don’t look too closely at my petals, which look like they have caught some kind of deadly blight. And my leaf has somehow ended up looking more like a coral reef than a poppy leaf, but I was knitting at speed. Once my poppy takes its place, hopefully in a beautiful cascade in my local church, no one will notice the occasional dropped or knotted stitch.The poppy is knitted on small 2mm needles, which does make it rather fiddly. Woman’s Weekly, which supplied the pattern, recommends that you use a particular type of wool made with cotton, especially if you want to wear it on your lapel. That would definitely add a bit of structure and class to your poppy, but I just used what I had at home: John Lewis Knit in 902 Red and Rowan Alpaca Soft in 00215 Green, both double knit. The black centre was knitted with a scrap of old wool. There is nothing too complicated here, give or take the leaves.A competent knitter could finish the poppy in a couple of hours. It took me seven hours, I don’t even know why.  Jan Moir: A competent knitter could finish the poppy in a couple of hours. It took me seven hours, I don’t even know why  STEP ONE — THE FLOWER : Start with the petals, which are knitted inidually. You will need four of them and have to master simple techniques such as ‘wrapping’ stitches, knitting twice into each stitch and casting off purl wise          STEP TWO — THE CENTRE: Easy! Four rows plus casting off. Even I managed this without error          STEP THREE — The STEM: If you can cast on eight stitches and knit 26 rows in stocking stitch, then you are home and dry          STEP FOUR — THE LEAVES: I had to rip back my leaves twice, but it is worth it in the end. You have to cast on and cast off multiple times, then slip, knit and slipover repeatedly. Just when you think, how on earth can this woolly spaghetti possibly look like a plant, a sheaf of leaves unfolds like a magic trick  STEP FIVE — THE STITCH UP: Stitching it all together is the fun part. Sew along the edges of the stem. Then assemble the petals, with the cast-on ends in the centre. Add the black centre, attach the dastardly leaf and voila, your own knitted poppy tribute!Don’t forget to make a donation!To support this year’s Poppy Appeal, call the British Legion on 0845 845 1945 or text POPPY to 70020* to donate £3.*Cost £3 plus standard network charges (typically £2.97 goes to the Poppy Appeal)"},{"url":null,"title":"Secret plan make Charles Prince Regent three years","story":"    The Queen (left) knows that even she cannot go on for ever. A handover of royal power is taking place right before our eyes with Prince Charles (right) into a position of powerThat job will fall to the Queen’s private secretary, Sir Edward Young, who will go to a secure telephone line and tell the PM: ‘London Bridge is down.’Then, from the Foreign Office’s Global Response Centre in London, the news will go directly to the respective prime ministers of the 15 governments outside the UK where the Queen is also the head of state, and the 36 other nations of the Commonwealth for whom she has served as a figurehead.For a time, her subjects will not know she is dead and that the throne has passed to her eldest son. Governors general, ambassadors and prime ministers will learn first. But in the world of 24-hour news it will not stay secret for long.Prince William clashed with Charles over whether Buckingham...Share this articleAll this, however, is jumping the gun. Given the Queen’s history of robust health, perhaps a far more likely scenario is that her great age will mean she herself will trigger a period of regency, thus ensuring safe stewardship of the great office she has held and worked so hard to secure.Senior former members of her household believe the Queen will grant her eldest son the full power to reign while she still lives because of the respect she holds for the institution of monarchy.Abdication, however, is not even a consideration. One senior aide admitted to me the ‘dusting off’ of the Regency Act. My understanding is that senior figures, with the Queen’s blessing, have been examining various scenarios.      Practical and unsentimental about her advancing years, the Queen, who is known around Whitehall as Reader No 1, has had Charles added to the distribution list of despatch boxes that she is sent. In the event of her death or inability to continue through illness, the Queen has ensured that her heir is fully primed and ready to take over.Some close to the monarch say that, if she reaches the age of 95, she will make a monumental decision and choose to officially allow Charles to take over the stewardship of her reign.She will, they say, officially transfer all executive powers to him as Prince Regent until her death, when he will become king. This would enable her to fudge the issue of her not fulfilling her Coronation Oath to God and her people to serve as queen regnant until her death.          Prince Charles (pictured) is effectively already our \u0027Prince Regent\u0027, a king in all but name Others, who claim to be equally well informed, say that such a move or use of the ‘Regent’ title is not really necessary. After all, as the Queen made clear to the unassuming 103rd Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr George Carey, when he went to see her on the occasion of his resignation in her Golden Jubilee year of 2002: ‘That’s something I can’t do.’Times, however, do change. In truth, with the Queen now well into her tenth decade, senior officials within the Royal Household confirm that Prince Charles is effectively already our ‘Prince Regent’, a king in all but name.Granted, Her Majesty is a consecrated monarch who pledged in her coronation oath to serve throughout her life. But can she seriously remain as head of state if she lives to be a centenarian like her mother?The last time the Regency Act was invoked was in 1810 during the reign of George III, when the monarch became permanently deranged. It meant his eldest son assumed the title Prince Regent for ten years until, on his father’s death, he became George IV.Queen Elizabeth II has enjoyed remarkably good health, both mental and physical, and there is nothing to suggest that Regency would be necessary in the way that it was for George III.Behind palace gates, however, preparations have been made in recent months for all eventualities, with Her Majesty’s blessing.Strangely, until 1937, our constitutional law had no permanent provision for a regent to cover the situation of a monarch being incapable of performing his or her duties.It was the debilitating illness of the Queen’s grandfather, George V — who suffered from chronic bronchitis from 1935 until his death — that led to the reformed Regency Act including the intriguing possibility of a Regency if ‘the Sovereign is for some definite cause not available for the performance of those functions’. It is not clear what situations this covers.Perhaps it is vague enough to allow the monarch simply to pass the baton to her heir and effectively retire — thus effecting the smoothest of successions with the minimum of fuss.The Queen is au courant with the passage of time, and how her age impacts on the institution she serves. She has, impeccable sources have told me, already drawn a line in the sand, a date when, like Prince Philip, she will effectively retire from public life.          The Queen doesn\u0027t seem to be slowing down on her royal engagements. Earlier this month she met with Queen MaximaNobody has a crystal ball. But my knowledge of the monarchal system leads me to believe that, whatever happens, it will unfold naturally. It is clear, however, that Charles’s position as the driving force of the institution in the second decade of the 21st century, as he approaches his 70th birthday, is indisputable. He, not the Queen, is the firm hand on the tiller.In the aftermath of the death of Princess Diana, many long-serving staff at Buckingham Palace believed the public would never tolerate Charles becoming king.Since then, however, anger against Charles has subsided.Through hard work and consistency, and perhaps the popularity of his sons and their wives — and the goodwill they have generated — such fears have all but disappeared.He may still be blamed for Diana’s misery over his infidelity with Camilla Parker Bowles, but there’s no longer a groundswell of support for skipping a generation.It was the Queen herself who eventually urged him to resolve the ‘Camilla problem’ by marrying his lover. Mindful of his duty, Charles complied.This was a smoothing of the way forward to the next generation, not simply the glorious resolution of Charles and Camilla’s enduring grand romance.It was made clear to Charles that he had to fit in with the bigger picture and accept the shifting shape of the monarchy as envisaged by the Queen. It was a calculated risk and it appears to have paid off. The warm receptions given to Charles and Camilla when on tour, and the more positive Press coverage of Camilla, is increasingly gentle but never effusive.More recently, on her 90th birthday, the Queen took the key decision to elevate Camilla to her most senior advisory body, the Privy Council. As ever, this was all done very quietly. And, as ever, the Queen had her reasons.          Camilla is set to be Queen. Queen Elizabeth had urged Charles to marry herShe wanted her daughter-in-law to be at Charles’s side at the precise moment that he formally becomes King.This will now happen: as a privy councillor, Camilla can now attend the ceremony, normally held within 24 hours of a sovereign’s death.This leads to a more contentious question: will Camilla become Queen? Ever since the Prince of Wales married the Duchess of Cornwall in April 2005, the Royal Family have gone to great lengths to avoid any public uprising over the prospect of ‘Queen Camilla’.Indeed, the official wedding announcement stated: ‘It is intended that Mrs Parker Bowles should use the title HRH the Princess Consort when the Prince of Wales accedes to the throne.’The critical word in this statement, of course, was ‘intended’. What Clarence House was doing was buying time — time for a hostile public to warm to Camilla.Prince Charles, however, has always intended her to become his queen consort.According to an inside source, he’d already decided that before their wedding.‘There was no doubt in his mind at the time about that, and I honestly don’t think anything has changed,’ said the source.‘In fact, I think he has hardened his resolve.‘For there to be any other outcome would, in his view, be to lessen his role as king.‘His marriage to Camilla is legal. She happens to be his second wife. That is it. Did any of Henry VIII’s wives not get the title?’Although Camilla has worked hard and proved a great support to her husband over the years, there is no escaping the lingering feeling that Charles’s greatest asset is also his greatest weakness.Camilla, as consort and Duchess of Cornwall, is a constant reminder of his personal failings of the past. However, more than a decade of marriage, and the fact that his second wife undoubtedly gives strength from their mutual and obvious love, should be taken only as a positive.But no matter how optimistic the palace try to be, the reality is that Charles and Camilla have both brought far too much baggage to the relationship, particularly that they committed adultery — which at the very least contributed to the breakdown of his marriage to Diana — for it to be presented as anything approaching love’s young dream.I am told that Camilla will be named ‘Queen Consort’ on Charles’s ascension.There would have to be a change in the law in Britain and several other realms before Charles becomes king for her not to be. There is little or no appetite for that.To alter her status would be a PR own goal, like insisting a president’s wife should not be allowed the role and title of ‘First Lady’ — especially when the Government plans to use the royals to bolster our status on the world stage.The Duchess, 71 at the time of writing, is said to have told friends previously that she would be ‘happy’ to use the lesser title when her husband ascends to the throne.The title issue will be decided in the court of public opinion and by the Prime Minister at the time.Clarence House has always claimed that the constitutional issue surrounding the title would be ‘a matter for the government of the day’.However, all previous wives of British kings have been known as queens.Camilla has assuaged Charles’s loneliness, but knows when to leave him alone.When on the public stage, their togetherness makes them a redoubtable couple.He is the most prepared heir to the throne the country has ever had — wise, funny, intelligent and connected to his people in so many ways.She rarely puts a foot wrong on tour while representing the Queen or when supporting her husband. The Queen acknowledged this in 2012 when she awarded her daughter-in-law her highest personal honour, Dame Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order, to mark the seventh anniversary of her wedding to Prince Charles.Camilla has earned her stripes through the love and loyalty she has shown to her husband and by devotion to duty to the Crown.She will, I am told, be deservedly given the correct rank when the time comes. Charles will rightly insist on it. ADAPTED from Charles At Seventy: Thoughts, Hopes And Dreams by Robert Jobson, published by John Blake on November 1 at £20. © Robert Jobson 2018.To order a copy for £16 (offer valid until November 4, 2018 P\u0026ampP free), visit mailshop.co.ukbooks or call 0844 571 0640.How he will be defender of the faith   Queen Elizabeth II, as we all know, is a devout High Church Anglican. Charles, on the other hand, has taken a great interest in other religions, studying both the Koran and Judaism in depth.In 1993, for instance, he said: ‘Islam can teach us today a way of understanding and living in the world which Christianity itself is poorer for having lost.’This was widely quoted as proof that he had abandoned Christianity, though he remains a practising Anglican. Clearly, however, our next Supreme Governor of the Church of England plans to do the job a little differently.‘He is an inidual who wants to chart new territory, and that will be very interesting indeed,’ says Lord Carey, the former Archbishop of Canterbury. ‘He is very outspoken.’The Prince certainly caused a furore when he told Jonathan Dimbleby that he wants to be seen as a ‘Defender of Faith’ when he ascends the throne, rather than ‘Defender of the Faith’.Since then, Charles’s position on the wording to be used at his coronation has categorically changed. It has been made clear to me that Charles will ‘absolutely 100 per cent’ be named as ‘Defender of the Faith’ when he is crowned king.But he will also demonstrate in his reign that he believes wholeheartedly in the importance of his connecting with all faiths of the subjects he will reign over.  "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/31/02/51D07DD900000578-6335433-image-a-27_1540951285390.jpg","title":"Meghan Markles reaction spots Instagrammer used follow New Zealand","story":"Take on the trench coat like Meghan wearing BurberryShop the current collection at NET-A-PORTERThe Duchess of Sussex has already proven her versatility when it comes fashion during the royal tour.

But as this wipes out half of the gain for higher earners, he should have come clean and mentioned this in the Budget speech rather than leave it in the Budget small print.’However a rise in the basic rate income tax threshold to £12,500, which gives a £130 saving, will still leave top earners with a total reduction to their tax bill worth £495.The Conservative Party had pledged to increase the personal allowance to £12,500 and the higher-rate threshold to £50,000 by 2020. But these increases will now come into effect 12 months ahead of schedule at the start of the next tax year on April 6, 2019.The £4bn stamp duty farce: That’s how much higher rate has...Hammond\u0027s raid on Scots: Stealth hike to National Insurance...Labour revolt after John McDonnell says he WON\u0027T try to...Share this articleCritics have claimed the change benefits the wealthy more than the worse-off. But Mr Hammond told ITV’s Good Morning Britain that many middle-income workers in schools, hospitals and police services had been dragged into the higher rate of tax, adding: ‘It’s important to raise all of these thresholds.

Agca was eventually released in 2010.Another theory suggested that Emanuela had been abducted at the behest of American archbishop, Paul Marcinkus, a former president of the Vatican bank who was linked to a major scandal and died in 2006.  Protesters in St Peter\u0027s Square, in the Vatican hold posters with Emanuela Orlandi\u0027s image calling for \u0027truth and justice for Emanuela Orlandi\u0027, during then-Pope Benedict\u0027s Regina Coeli prayer in May 2012. Emanuela Orlandi (left) was the daughter of a Vatican employee, whose June 1983 disappearance has been linked to anything from Cold War rivalries to an assassination attempt on Pope John Paul IIThe last major twist in the case came in 2012, when forensic police exhumed the body of a reputed mobster from the crypt of a Roman basilica in hopes of finding Emanuela\u0027s remains too. However, that search turned up no link.More recently, a leading Italian investigative journalist caused a sensation when he published a five-page document last year that had been stolen from a locked Vatican cabinet that suggested the Holy See had been involved in Orlandi\u0027s disappearance. The Vatican immediately branded the document a fake, though it never explained what it was doing in the Vatican cabinet.The document was purportedly written by a cardinal and listed supposed expenses used for Orlandi\u0027s upkeep after she disappeared. The Vatican has repeatedly maintained that it has co-operated fully with police investigating the Orlandi case."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/07/15/4FD3DF3C00000578-0-image-a-33_1536329043258.jpg","title":"Jealous lover slashed face innocent woman wrongly suspected sleeping boyfriend","story":"    Wilkinson slashed her victim\u0027s face because she believed her to be sleeping with her boyfriend A jealous blonde who slashed the face of a woman she wrongly suspected of sleeping with her boyfriend has been jailed for six years.Nicole Wilkinson, 39, who publicly boasted of being \u0027Your worst nightmare wrapped in a bow\u0027, ambushed Yvonne Gelder on her own doorstep in the belief the victim was having an illicit affair.Miss Gelder, 36, answered the door to Wilkinson only for the attacker to lunge at her with a knife traditionally used by sommeliers to open bottles of wine.Wilkinson left the victim with a long cut to the face and two stab wounds to the chest before being pulled away by neighbours.Miss Gelder fled for her life on a bicycle but collapsed further up the street. She later had to be treated in hospital for serious injuries including a collapsed lung and a zig-zag cut down her left breast.Wilkinson of Lancaster was arrested later on suspicion of attempted murder but claimed the victim had come at her with the blade.At Preston Crown Court, she admitted wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm after she initially denied wrongdoing. She made her boast of being \u0027your worst nightmare\u0027 on her Facebook status in which she added: \u0027If it wasn\u0027t for bull****, no-one in this town would have a conversation.\u0027The 7pm incident occurred on August 17 this year after Wilkinson suspected her partner had been having a fling with Miss Gelder.Mr Frances McEntee prosecuting, said: \u0027The case has a background which is long-standing. The defendant believed Miss Gelder was having a relationship with her partner.\u0027The complainant says that she heard banging on the door and she knew it would be the defendant because of their past difficulties. \u0027She opened her front door and immediately saw the defendant with her hand clenched and she was holding what the defendant described as a Swiss-Army knife.\u0027The complainant said what are you doing, you crazy b****? and the defendant is then said to have lunged at her with the knife.

The complainant was then top of the defendant, who still had hold of the knife.\u0027The defendant was then dragged away from the complainant. On lookers said that the complainant was bleeding heavily at this point. The complainant went back into the house and then set off on her bicycle while still bleeding heavily. A delivery man saw her pass out on the floor.\u0027She was immediately taken to the hospital and she had sustained some serious injuries. She sustained a number of cuts. Down the left side of her face, there is a long superficial cut.          The attacker admitted wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm at Preston Crown Court \u0027There\u0027s a puncture wound to her chest which has caused a zig-zag cut down the complainant\u0027s left breast. There is an injury to the underneath of her arm which is believed to have caused Pnuemothorax.\u0027This was a sustained assault with repeated blows delivered by a knife. It appears to be a Sommeliers knife, similar to a Swiss Army knife.\u0027When the defendant was arrested, her account was that the complainant had come at her with a knife. When the defendant was interviewed, she provided a statement which said that Yvonne Gelder came at her with a knife, but made no comment throughout.\u0027This is a high culpability offence because of the use of a knife and the puncture of the chest.\u0027In mitigation defence lawyer Christopher Evans, said: \u0027There were various falling outs and she is remorseful with what happened - the remorse is complete, it\u0027s extensive and it\u0027s genuine. She had a difficult childhood, particularly in her teenage years.\u0027But sentencing Judge Andrew Woolman told Wilkinsond: \u0027Make no mistake, this could have been a lot worse - the consequences could have been fatal.\u0027You have long-standing problems with the victim, maybe to do with your suspicions that she was having sexual relations with your partner. On August 17, you went to the complainant\u0027s house with what I suspect was the first sharp object you found, which was this Swiss Army Knife.\u0027You banged on the door and when she answered, you attacked her with it. She sustained injuries to her head and body and, fortunately, the slash on her face appeared to miss her eye.\u0027There were a number of other wounds one to her chest and one to the side of her chest which has caused Pnuemothorax which could have been fatal. Initially, you tried to say that she attacked you, which wasn\u0027t true, but you did plead guilty on the second occasion.\u0027I have read your letter, which is thoughtful and articulate and I accept that you say you are remorseful.\u0027 "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/31/11/15A5DAED00000514-6336713-Other_ghost_towers_in_London_include_the_Shard_where_10_apartmen-a-20_1540985625793.jpg","title":"Centre Point Londons ghost towers","story":"    London\u0027s Centre Point tower, pictured, has sold only half of its luxury flats and property firm Almacantar said it was halting any future deals after receiving too many offers \u0027well below\u0027 the asking price          Luxury apartments in the building, pictured, range from £1.8m to £55m and around half of the 82 flats have been sold, but Almacantar\u0027s chief executive Mike Hussey said recent offers were \u0027detached from reality\u0027 and said uncertainty around Brexit was affecting the market          The tower, pictured, which is near Tottenham Court Road, was formerly an office block that was converted into homes in 2015.

Meanwhile, The Riverwalk in Westminster (right) was finished in 2016 but still has six per cent of its apartments up for saleCentre Point has struggled to sell space before when it was an office block, and stood empty for around a decade after it was completed in 1966, becoming known as the city\u0027s \u0027empty tower\u0027.It even inspired the CentrePoint homeless charity name after campaigners occupied the tower over a weekend in 1974 to highlight the issue.

Denny decided to explore what it means to be a witch today and took portraits of women across the country who identify as witches. Maja (pictured), who was dubbed the ‘white witch of LA,’ stands next to a tree in a park in her namesake city. Denny said she felt it was very appropriate Maja \u0027showed up in head to toe white.’ Image: © Frances F. Denny, \u0027Maja (Los Angeles, CA),\u0027 2017, archival pigment print, courtesy of the artist and ClampArt, New York City          Denny started photographing in early 2016 and discovered that there were many different ways to practice and to inhabit the witch identity. Dia Dynasty (pictured), is an ‘alpha witch,’ ‘shamanatrix,’ and ‘female supremacist,’ according to her Twitter bio, and she brought crystals and whips to the photo shoot. Dia Dynasty and her partner Lucy Sweetkill run La Maison du Rouge, ‘focused on expanding the BDSM experience by discussing, educating, and informing our audiences about the intersections of kink, wellness, sexuality, spirituality, and social activism,’ according to their website. Image: © Frances F. Denny, \u0027Dia (New York, NY),\u0027 2017, archival pigment print, courtesy of the artist and ClampArt, New York City          Before each shoot, Denny asked participants to choose where they wanted to be photographed – and many selected the outdoors as a setting. Each woman dressed themselves and Denny asked them to bring along an object that felt relevant to their identity as a witch or to their practice. For her photo, Meredith brought a staff, which has been layered over time with material found or given to her, such as a snakeskin and a bear claw, Denny said. Image: © Frances F. Denny, \u0027Meredith (Moretown, VT),\u0027 2017, archival pigment print, courtesy of the artist and ClampArt, New York CityGrossman said she appreciated how Denny approached the project - some of the portraits are now being exhibited at ClampArt through November 24 - from an anthropological standpoint and that it reflects the ersity of the modern witchcraft community.‘For so long people have thought that witches could only look a certain a way or behave a certain a way, but, in fact, there is such a vast multiplicity of backgrounds and approaches to witchcraft,’ said Grossman, an author who also launched the podcast ‘The Witch Wave\u0027 and WitchEmoji. ‘I was delighted that there really was not only ersity in backgrounds but also ersity in styles, certainly a lot of us do wear black,’ she laughed, ‘but that’s not the only way to move in the world as a witch… we have every kind of job you can imagine, being a witch is one facet, albeit a bright facet… and so I really appreciated the fact that you get different people’s personalities (shining) through.’  Photographer Denny told DailyMail.com that the seed for the project was planted four years ago when she looked into her family’s ancestry – a project that ended up becoming the book called ‘Let Virtue Be Your Guide.’While going through documents, Denny discovered that her tenth great-grandfather was one of the central judges in the Salem witch trials and her eighth great-great grandmother was an accused witch about 20 years prior to the trials.Meet generation hex... Why millennials in search of...Share this article‘But this coincidence stuck with me and at the moment I remember kind of filing it away in my brain to sort of come back to at another point,’ she recalled.Denny, who grew up in Massachusetts not far from Salem, said she then started reading Stacy Schiff’s book ‘The Witches: Salem, 1692.’‘I just started thinking about that time and thinking about what that word witch meant back then and then started thinking about, well, you know, I had some vague awareness that there people who practiced so-called witchcraft and saw themselves as witches. So I started thinking, well, what does that word mean now, who is a witch, who claims that word as part of their identity now.’‘And that was my jumping off point,’ she said.Denny next faced the task of finding subjects and started asking around - talking to people about the idea of doing portraits of people who identify as witches. She said she found a ‘small but critical mass of five to ten people,’ and through them networked and found more practitioners.‘It’s kind of surprising. I was sort of prepared to have people to be like, ‘who the hell do you think you are and absolutely not.’ Nothing like that,’ she said.          A seminal book for many witches is ‘Women Who Run with the Wolves’ by Clarissa Pinkola Estes. That was the case for Wolf (pictured) who told Denny books were her entrée into witchcraft and that she began identifying as a witch at a young age. Wolf   is an eclectic witch and does not adhere to one label for her beliefs, Denny said. Image: © Frances F. Denny, \u0027Wolf (Brooklyn, NY),\u0027 2017, archival pigment print, courtesy of the artist and ClampArt, New York City          For Deborah (pictured), witch work is about including and embracing the dark sides of ourselves, Denny said. A filmmaker and master acting instructor, Deborah works with actors that she is directing to integrate those emotions and aspects, such as grief, rage or sexuality, Denny said. Image: © Frances F. Denny, \u0027Deborah (Nyack, NY),\u0027 2017, archival pigment print, courtesy of the artist and ClampArt, New York City           ‘The witch is a figure of subversion and rebellion,’ Pam Grossman, who identifies as a Pagan witch, told DailyMail.com. Grossman said she has been doing magic since she was a child, and after discovering spell books as a teenager, started experimenting with them. Grossman, who  launched the podcast ‘The Witch Wave\u0027 and WitchEmoji, is the author of \u0027Waking the Witch,\u0027 which will be out next year. She said talking about witches is complex because there is no one set of dogma or specific leader, and it is very open to interpretation. Image: © Frances F. Denny, \u0027Pam (Brooklyn, NY),\u0027 2017, archival pigment print, courtesy of the artist and ClampArt, New York City          Judika Illes, a well-known metaphysical author who told DailyMail.com she gets recognized on the subway, said she was grateful to see the ersity and not just \u0027stereotypical witches’ in Denny’s portrait project. Illes, whose books include the ‘Encyclopedia of Witchcraft,’ said that terms people use to describe what type of witch they are, such as a green witch, are not written in stone and that people\u0027s definition of the craft is often \u0027fluid\u0027 and \u0027personal.\u0027 Image: © Frances F. Denny, \u0027Judika (Brooklyn, NY),\u0027 2017, archival pigment print, courtesy of the artist and ClampArt, New York CityDenny noted that she is grateful that people agreed to be photographed because even now there is something at stake for people to be publicly identified as a witch.‘In parts of this country and parts of the world… you can get in really hot water for claiming to be a witch,’ she said.‘One of my subjects told me that she had been scared for a long time to do what she called and what is commonly in the witchcraft community called ‘coming out of the broom closet.’ She had been afraid to because she was scared that her ex-husband would try to take her kids away.’Denny said it is something that could be an accusation leveled against someone, and she decided to include people’s first names only and the place where she photographed them for the project. (DailyMail.com asked each woman interviewed to use their full name for this article.)Author Lilith Dorsey said that she wanted to participate in Denny’s project because it is important for her to have positive images of witches, particularly those that are women of color.‘It’s really nice that we can do these things now literally in the light of day and show people who we are and that we’re not scary or ugly or any of that,’ she told DailyMail.com.When Dorsey’s daughter, now 28, was a child, she said there was a real danger ‘that we might have been investigated by people for our practices and what we were doing.’Dorsey said she considers herself a Pagan ‘in the sense of I practice an Earth-centered religion.’Denny photographed around 70 people for the project, and there are 20 portraits and six found still lives in the exhibition at ClampArt. Before each photo shoot, Denny asked participants to choose where they wanted to be photographed – and many selected the outdoors as a setting. Each woman dressed themselves and Denny asked them to bring along an object that felt relevant to their identity as a witch or to their practice.For instance, Dorsey explained in her photograph, which is not part of the exhibition, she is wearing elekes, which are the ritual necklaces in Regla Lucumi, more commonly known as Santeria.‘It’s one of the first levels of initiation that you get in that practice and it basically means that you carry the gods and goddess… with you, as represented in the necklaces,’ she said.           When Denny first started the project, she faced the task of finding subjects, and said she is grateful that people agreed to be photographed because even now there is something at stake for people to be publicly identified as a witch. Shine (pictured) told Denny she come to witchcraft at an early age and that she sees herself as a witch shaman, infusing Yoruba, Egyptian, and shamanic drumming and trance into her practice. She is not part of a coven, but rather practices alone, Denny said. Image: © Frances F.

She has practiced herbalism, which she calls her religion, for 20 years and believes that integrated holistic healing isn’t just physical, but it’s also emotional and psychological symptoms that people have, according to Denny. Karen, who owns and operates an apothecary, told Denny local healers were integral to her community in Guyana, where she grew up. Image: © Frances F.

The letter was written on October 24, but has just been published by the committee.Downing Street also tried to pour cold water on speculation about dramatic movement in the talks.    Theresa May (pictured in the House of Commons today) has been struggling to thrash out a orce deal with the EU          Aides have tried to play down speculation about a breakthrough, and the letter was dated October 24Mrs May’s official spokesman said: ‘We want to get a deal as soon as possible.’He would not confirm whether Mrs May had presented her promised new proposals on the Irish backstop, but added the PM had told MPs the EU was ‘engaging’ with Britain’s ideas. Ministers are engaged in a desperate scramble to reach a settlement with the EU, as the clock ticks down to Brexit day.If there is no movement next month the government needs to trigger large-scale contingency plans to try to reduce the impact of a no-deal outcome. In a glimmer of light for Theresa May, David Davis has admitted that he expectsMPs to approve any Brexit deal she does secure because they are \u0027terrified\u0027 of crashing out of the EU.            Almost as many applications for Irish passports were received in the first half of 2018 as in the whole year before the referendumDemand for Irish passports has surged amid mounting fears over the prospect of a no-deal Brexit, it emerged today.Almost as many applications were received in the first half of 2018 as in the whole year before the referendum.According to figures released to the Brexit committee in the Irish senate, almost 45,000 passport applications were lodged with the Republic\u0027s UK embassy in the first half of 2018.Fine Gael\u0027s Neale Richmond suggested that the \u0027looming disaster of Brexit\u0027 was prompting eligible Britons to reconnect with their Irish heritage.He said: \u0027Since the people of the UK voted, narrowly, to leave the EU in 2016, we have seen a continuing rise in the number of applications for Irish passports in the UK.\u0027Current rules entitle those born to Irish parents or grandparents to apply for an Irish passport through a claim to citizenship.\u0027At least 10 per cent of the UK\u0027s population, not including Northern Ireland, are estimated to qualify for an Irish passport and in light of Brexit, many including a number of my own family members are staking their claim to an Irish passport.                                                    The former Brexit secretary said \u0027irrational fear\u0027 would win out in Parliament if the PM manages to get any kind of agreement with Brussels.Mr Davis tried to backpedal today by insisting no package based on Mrs May\u0027s Chequers plan would get passed.But the comments, from a vehement critic of Mrs May\u0027s stance, will encourage Downing Street. Negotiating teams are working in Brussels as the clocks tick down and concerns mount about the consequences of Britain crashing out of the bloc. If there is a settlement, No10 is planning to force a crunch vote in the Commons within weeks - and effectively dare MPs to risk a no-deal outcome.But the outcome could be on a knife edge, as Labour has vowed that it will not back any proposals that do not pass its six tests.The Opposition could form an alliance with Tory Brexiteers who have promised to try to kill off the PM\u0027s Chequers blueprint for future trade with the EU. Mr Davis, along with Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg , are among the senior Conservatives leading the push for the UK to seek a looser Canada-style pact with Brussels.But speaking at a discussion event in Westminister last night, Mr Davis conceded that he thought Downing Street would eventually be able to force its will through Parliament.\u0027Terror will win, the fear of no deal,\u0027 he said. \u0027I think the irrational fear of no deal, a WTO deal – that will win and there will be a deal. \u0027It may take two passes – it may be a deal that\u0027s agreed in Brussels and fails in Westminster and comes back again, it may take two passes.\u0027       "},{"url":null,"title":"Startling moment cunning leopard pounces tree takes impala","story":"    This sneaky leopard hid silently in a tree before jumping on its unsuspecting prey from aboveWould YOU be able to spot a snow leopard about to pounce on...The cat who climbed a MOUNTAIN: Adventurer finds a ginger...Share this article    After leaping from the tree it quickly took the down impala grazing happily underneathThe leopard is then seen suffocating the antelope by latching its jaws over the animal\u0027s mouth.Phil Hankinson filmed the spectacle during a game drive in Ruaha National Park, Tanzania.He said: \u0027He was incredibly difficult to see but we had a few pairs of binoculars which helped tremendously.\u0027I\u0027m still in awe really of the spectacle which unfolded.

For nearly a month, record breaking levels of PM2.5 – the harmful, breathable particles which affect human health – swamped more than 800 million people.Since then, the government’s clean air action plan has included such measures as placing a quota on new vehicles, trying to reduce coal consumption down from 23m tonnes to a target of 5m tonnes by 2020, and creating five urban forests, 21 small green spaces, 10 leisure parks and 100km of healthy greenways in 2018 alone.The number of “blue sky days” (days of good air quality) in Beijing has increased from just 176 in 2013 to 226 last year, and yet the issue remains critical.These recent images, shot around the CBD and looking into the Forbidden City, show the difference between clear and polluted skies in Beijing a month apart (5 September and 15 October respectively)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/538b6c45a1a764c6dd252583e2c272980bbe8417/0_522_1080_648/master/1080.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ede4f2cd3f24602d3a5f048f02e7b202","title":"tips links and suggestions what are you reading this week","story":"Your space to discuss the books you are reading and what you think of themWelcome to this week’s blogpost. Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week:Halloween approaches and tiojo has been doing some appropriate reading:I’ve just put down Andrew Michael Hurley’s second novel based in the countryside of the Bowland Fells and the Fylde, Devil’s Day. It follows on well from his first, The Loney. The countryside, which I know well enough, inspires him. But he sees things in it not many of us would. What to us are rolling moors, green valleys, sparkling streams, picturesque farmsteads, signify something else to Mr Hurley. He sees another world. Spiritual, demonic, folkloric, who knows. An unsettling mixture of real and imagined geography gives us the horror version of Le Grande Meaulnes. His novels are psychogeography in action. The moors will look different next time I walk across them.On the same theme, Veufveuve has enjoyed Mary Shelley’s Transformation:A slim collection of short stories (comprising the title story, The Mortal Immortal, and The Evil Eye). All three stories are in some way supernatural or uncanny and the writing, though obviously touched by the gothic and thus sometimes a little overblown, is often very good – she knew what she was doing. All three stories, like Frankenstein, explore what it means to be human and how we might live. For me, by the far the most effective was The Mortal Immortal (I probably don’t need to explain the subject matter), bringing home its great existential crisis very powerfully.A different kind of monster has entertained Kevin Dawson in Craig Brown’s Ma’am Darling: 99 Glimpses of Princess Margaret:That rare thing, a genuinely unputdownablelaugh out loud book. Difficult to tell who was the less appealing, Princess Margaret herself or the people who (as Brown notes) happily accepted invites to events at which she would be present, knowing how awful it (and she) would be. They attended seemingly only so they could then skip off home to describe how awful the event was. Increased my respect for George Harrison, though (who, on being told he couldn’t eat before she left a “do” simply went up to her and asked her to leave).This Thing of Darkness by Harry Thompson has impressed 17Luftballons:It’s about the captain of the Beagle and Darwin. Echoes of Patrick O’Brian’s naval novels but it’s the detail and description that really bring it to life, so vivid and well-described I almost feel like I’m watching a film, or that I’ve visited all these places I’ve never seen. The characters are fascinatingly nuanced and human. And their debates over theology versus their scientific discoveries are really bringing home to me the significance and impact of evolutionary theory at the time. Nice and long, too - I don’t want it to end any time soon!A forensic and very readable analysis of The Iliad and the different strands that informed its creation. Utterly fascinating and totally recommended for armchair Homer fans and general readers alike.Here’s a teaser from casaleiro:About 10 days ago the  carried an interview with a Spanish writer who recommended A High Wind in Jamaica by Richard Hughes. Never heard of it! So down the town I went and found a copy in a charity shop. It was a fabulous discovery, and I am currently following it by re-reading William Golding’s Lord of the Flies. What the two have in common is their view of childhood as a wild and potentially violent state of being. I guess most readers are familiar with Golding. Concerning the older novel by Hughes (1929), I will say nothing, I simply urge people to read it, preferably without knowing anything about it beforehand.I’m intrigued. Talking of suspense, franhunny has been reading Agatha Christie’s Mrs McGinty’s Dead:While I usually loathe Poirot because of his smugness, it was not as bad as in other Poirot novels so I could live with it as a quirk.Which made the book quite enjoyable. Oh, I knew the murderer after the second murder, but I did not know why yet and how the two murders were connected.A classic whodunnit, with the classic “all suspects into the same room” finale where Mr Poirot explains his thoughts.A few hours well spent.(I’m glad it felt like a good investment of time, because we’re going to be looking at Agatha Christie on the reading group next month.)Finally, Tropic of Capricorn by Henry Miller has done the trick for judgeDAmNationIII:I’m about halfway through rereading and my God is it the tonic I need at the moment. I remember being relatively unimpressed with it the first time around (at least compared to the Rosy Crucifixion trilogy and Black Spring, which I read first), and although there are parts that go on a bit, the rest of it just feels like it’s screaming directly into my soul.That sounds pretty good to me.If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

The “Marie-Antoinette inspired” gems and gold bottle produced by the French jeweller Mellerio dits Meller help lift the price.Camus said the wine “turned out to be a masterful stroke of intricate finesse”. He said it has “a rare depth and complexity, with a lively citrus attack and a serene minerality”. The champagne house said the wine has such “sophisticated finesse” that they decided to approach Mellerio to create special bottles.“Marie Antoinette is a natural link between our maisons,” Laure-Isabelle Mellerio, the creative director of the 400-year-old jewellers and a direct descendant of its founding family, said. “The refined world of rare champagne instantly guided my hand.”Once drunk, the buyer of the bottle will be taken to Maison Mellerio in Paris, where “jewellers will transform the bottle’s beautiful adornment into a brooch, bracelet or pendant, depending on the owner’s wishes”.

Almost certainly, but the proposal has been included for consideration in the FCA’s study of how to shake up the general insurance market and one can understand why. As the regulator rightly says, there are “a number of areas of potential consumer harm”. One is insurers’ common practice of whacking up renewal quotes in the hope that bored or unwary punters will tick the box without noticing they’re being gouged.In the regulatory jargon, this is “inertia pricing”. The current remedy for policyholders is to get on the phone and protest, which usually produces a lower quote. But the FCA would not be alone in thinking the carry-on is farcical. Its formal worry is that vulnerable customers – or even those who fondly imagine an insurer would reward loyalty as a matter of course – are losing out. Thus the radical idea of holding a mass annual purchase of insurance to promote greater transparency and competition.The FCA says it’s how Hungary arranged its car insurance market until 2014. Companies could only change their prices in one week of the year and did so with a marketing blitz that concentrated minds. Hungarian regulators report that insurance prices went up after the statutory campaigning period was abandoned.One strongly suspects the FCA won’t dare to be so radical. Even its discussion document worries that the most inert consumers (not to mention those who are on holiday or ill) wouldn’t be reached anyway. That’s before insurers pitch their inevitable grumbles about administrative burdens and the need to manage risks via flexible pricing. It’s more likely the regulator will opt for a relative price cap or various “nudge” strategies, or do nothing.Yet there’s a germ of a good idea in the mass-renewal approach. Insurers have punished loyalty for too long. A one-day or one-week window is clearly a non-starter, but an intense auction for business sounds an excellent way to deliver lower premiums and clearer pricing. The FCA should be imaginative – see if the model can be adapted.The country’s second largest clothing retailer will have more negotiating clout than most, but the statistic shows how power now lies with tenants. Retail-heavy property companies, attempting to whistle cheerfully, tend to argue that the long list of retail failures this year has only chipped a percentage point or two off their rent rolls. But it’s the solvent retailers that are their bigger long-term worry. The adjustment in the property market has a long way to run.Greg Fitzgerald, boss of Bovis Homes, put it eloquently a few weeks ago. If Help to Buy, the government’s support scheme for homebuyers, were to be extended, ministers would insist on new rules “to stop you bastard chief executives earning all this money from government subsidies”.In other words, surely even dozy ministers wouldn’t risk creating another Jeff Fairburn, the man from Persimmon who was lost for words recently when asked to explain his £75m bonus.But, no, Help to Buy was extended to 2023 in Monday’s budget but the government did not request, let alone impose, a cap on executive bonuses. The personal prizes for housebuilders probably won’t be as lucrative in Help to Buy’s final years, but you know who to blame if they are."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d70dfb82987648762e06d52b42fe854daee1e6e/0_130_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a7601c2258a02d7e40c536394813fd0b","title":"arron banks brexit disinformation","story":"This letter has certainly provoked a strong response. One constituent has contacted me saying it is, “the most despicable piece of slander and defamation I have seen”. Another wrote calling his letter, “a libellous and ridiculous attack on your character as a member of parliament. Regardless of our political persuasions, I utterly deplore such bully-boy tactics and reject his garbled nonsense.”It is clear that Banks’s main complaint against me is that I, and the other members of the digital, culture, media and sport select committee that I chair, have called on him to give evidence to our inquiry into disinformation and fake news. He is angry that we asked him about his links to Russia, secret meetings with that country’s ambassador, connections to Cambridge Analytica, and where he found the funds to become the biggest donor in British political history, when so many of his businesses seem to lose money. Like so many would-be bullies, Banks likes to have a go at other people, but hates being questioned about his own affairs.As an MP and chair of a select committee, it’s my responsibility to make sure we pursue our inquiries without fear or favour. Banks’s strategy is one of intimidation, and when asked recently whether by sending these letters he was trying to put the frighteners on MPs, he said, “there is an element of that.” Well no matter how many letters he writes, I won’t be stopped by him from doing my job.Banks also complained that in the summer I “shared a platform … with  journalists.” This is true: I spoke at the Byline festival in August with the Orwell prize-winning journalist Carole Cadwalladr – someone who receives abusive messages on social media from Banks and his cronies. Cadwalladr and I were both invited to speak about our respective investigations into disinformation, including the role of Russia in promoting it, and social media in allowing it to spread. Banks hates us talking about this. For those of you who aren’t familiar with the Byline festival, it is an independent summer event that promotes free speech and independent journalism: Banks hates Byline as well.In criticising me for the platforms I’ve spoken on, Banks seems to be suggesting that we should only speak to people who share all our political opinions. Such an approach reduces politics to mere silos where people shut themselves off from other people, opinions and ideas. I can’t think of anything that would be more damaging to our democracy at this time. The issue of state-sponsored disinformation, organised from countries like Russia and Iran, is a major challenge, and we need to work together to confront that threat, and make the social media companies do more to act against the known sources of these campaigns.The unelected Banks is now displaying a consistent pattern of behaviour where he constantly seeks to abuse and intimidate politicians and journalists – and he is not the only one. This is partly just attention seeking, but it also has a more sinister edge. Unchecked, this is the kind of behaviour that allows the virus of fascism to seep into democracy.• Damian Collins is Conservative MP for Folkestone and Hythe and chair of the Commons digital, culture, media and sport committee"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/253dcce32e9150eaf5d1e4c5af3efa40566ee0ba/0_179_4608_2765/master/4608.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b4c6fd5f8e71c872c4fc05b696828229","title":"britain new singapore brexit democracy","story":"Soaring above Singapore’s central business district, the seven towers of The Pinnacle@Duxton have a distinctive silhouette. The blocks are linked at the 26th and 50th storeys by bridges, each of which is home to half a kilometre of garden.In many other countries, iconic residential housing in the heart of the city would be reserved for the super-rich. But this is a public housing project.As we enter Brexit’s endgame, the “Singapore model” remains a favoured strategy for those who believe lower taxes, lower public spending and less regulation would clear the way for a more competitive and entrepreneurial Britain. The Pinnacle@Duxton offers a reminder that the social bargain Singaporeans have accepted is very different from the British way of life.The Pinnacle’s seven blocks are finished to a high standard, with amenities including a food court, childcare centre and jogging track but it is also super-dense, housing 1,848 apartment units on just six acres of land. If Britain truly wanted to become a Singapore of the north Atlantic, the change would have to go far deeper than taxation: there would have to be radical changes to the British way of life.For decades, Singapore has been run by a far-sighted elite that governs for the long term and buffers itself from democratic pressures by dealing ruthlessly with sources of political opposition. Leftwing leaders have been detained without trial, critics of the government ruined in libel actions. The country’s citizens value the stability this political setup has reated, but many of them justifiably chafe at the deplorable constraints on their freedom.The People’s Action party, which has governed since independence, is flexible about ideology. While Singapore’s rulers have declined to build a broad, western-style welfare state, the government plays a big role in the economy. It has prioritised making the Asian city a hub for hi-tech manufacturing, with companies benefiting from a strong logistics network, excellent infrastructure and a pool of engineering graduates as well as tax breaks. Singapore scored a victory with Dyson’s recent decision to manufacture electric cars there.There is plenty to admire. While there is inequality in Singapore, there is also a strong sense of loyalty and shared sacrifice. Young men required to do compulsory military service form friendships across social boundaries. State schools attended by all strata of society are among the world’s best for maths and science. At lunch hour, rich and poor mingle in hawker centres, tucking in to the same mouthwatering plates of laksa, popiah and chicken satay.Forging this consensus required a leader with singular determination and vision – Singapore’s founding father, Lee Kuan Yew, who declared: “We decide what is right. Never mind what the people think.” He was surrounded by a gifted group of politicians, backed by an efficient civil service, and showed a willingness to sweep away nearly any impediment. In other countries, ancestral languages are cherished. In Singapore, the traditional southern Chinese dialects were ditched to make way for Mandarin.Replicating the Singapore model would be a challenge in a western country with stronger democratic safeguards, a less vigorous political class, and a cynical distrust of experts.It would also require deeper sacrifices than Britons are accustomed to. Ordinary people in Singapore put up with modest living space and know they will never earn enough to afford a car. Singapore is already one of the world’s most expensive places to own a vehicle because of the exorbitant cost of car ownership permits, and has this year capped the number of cars on the road.Britain is turning to Singapore at a time when the Asian city-state’s own consensus is fraying. There is much to like about Singapore, but it is also a stressed and often unhappy place, from the schoolchildren shuttling between tutors to the office workers reporting low job satisfaction while working some of the longest hours in the world. A Singaporean campaign to encourage fathers to “eat with your family” starts from a low base: dads are urged to make it back for mealtimes just four times a year.Some of the forces that have driven its success to date mean Singaporeans sometimes struggle to find the passion or flexibility required in a modern economy. Singapore emphasizes material prosperity – this is a society in which sports cars ride elevators and designer handbags take up seats in restaurants – and hierarchy, from its exam-based pecking orders for children to its rigidly stratified workplaces. This is not a mindset that adapts easily to working at a tech startup. Singapore’s rulers are conscious of these challenges, and have begun trying to address them.Singapore is an unreliable guide to the UK’s post-Brexit future. Even if we had the capacity to emulate them, few Britons would enjoy living in a north Atlantic Singapore. And many Singaporeans think it is high time their society changed.• Jeevan Vasagar worked in Singapore as the Financial Times’ correspondent between 2015 and 2017."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f54e023bb5e1bec03dca7a0dbe6f3de717102ed8/0_109_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3bc57daef1b1ef2aaf7dfff7a9b89d23","title":"channel 4 leeds tv northern hq","story":"This is a good time for Yorkshire culture. The new star of Doctor Who, Jodie Whittaker, comes from Huddersfield, birthplace also of Simon Armitage, a frontrunner for next year’s announcement of the next UK poet laureate. Leeds United – one of the world’s greatest teams when I was growing up in the city – are showing tantalising signs, after 14 years outside the highest league and 14 managers in six years, of returning to the Premier League to celebrate the club’s centenary in 2019.And now Leeds, the county’s de facto capital, is to be the site of Channel 4’s new northern HQ, as part of a government-encouraged drive to counter the often-alleged “metropolitanism” (by which is meant London-centricity) of British TV.For locals, there’s an extra pleasure in the victory, as a cross-Pennine rival, Salford, was seen as likelier winner. Wayne Garvie, president of Sony Television, argued in the Observer last Sunday that adding Channel 4 to the canalside encampment that already holds the BBC’s and ITV’s northern power bases would help create a sort of Hollywood of the British north-west.However, setting aside local pride, even an objective assessment would see Leeds as the sensible choice. In terms of TV clout, the area was one of the biggest losers from the replacement of the original ITV system – in which regional companies, such as Yorkshire TV, had huge power – by a Network Commissioning Centre in London. Yorkshire’s Manchester-based rival, Granada, helped by Coronation Street, won the televisual wars of the roses, maintaining a power within ITV that Leeds, despite having Emmerdale, largely lost.Channel 4’s commitment to the city (along with smaller new production hubs in Bristol and Glasgow) should restore televisual impact, and create jobs. There is a risk, though, of simply ending up with the same TV people washing up their latte cups in a different sink.Discussing the Channel 4 announcement, from a BBC 5 Live studio in Salford on Wednesday afternoon, presenter Nihal Arthanayake warned, in comments unlikely to delight BBC managers, that the corporation’s northern outpost did not yet reflect the racial and social makeup of the building’s surrounds. If so, this might be because, when the BBC went to Salford, many people at Broadcasting House and Television Centre simply moved, encouraged by generous relocation expenses, north.So, if Channel 4’s promise to “relocate 200 jobs” to Leeds simply means London staff getting a Tuesday-to-Thursday flat in Headingley, or shuttling in and out of Leeds Bradford airport, then the geographical initiative will be pointless. But, even if the result is local employment, the question of what regional representation in TV should mean is more complicated than merely planting flags on a map. Although Yorkshire TV produced many ITV hits set on its own doorstep (such as The Beiderbecke Trilogy and In Loving Memory), it also made The Darling Buds of May, set in Kent, and Harry’s Game, a Belfast yarn.Similarly, though Channel 4 has suffered criticism for being too southern English, one of its biggest recent hits, Derry Girls, is a Northern Irish sitcom. And The Great British Bake Off, since moving to Channel 4, has more than ever lived up to the third word of its title, while becoming the most effortlessly erse show on UK TV. As Channel 4 is a “publisher broadcaster” (buying in all its shows from independent producers), it matters less where the commissioning desks are, but where the ideas come from, which, far more easily than for the BBC with its large in-house production facilities, can be anywhere.If Channel 4’s new HQ leads to a future schedule including a 24-part history of Leeds United and a major biographical drama about Geoffrey Boycott, then I will, selfishly, be thrilled. But, for it to benefit everyone else, the success of the venture could also involve a commissioner in Leeds, Bristol or Glasgow buying a story from Belfast, or even London.The reason that British networks have always broadcast what are called “regional opt-out programming” (especially in news and sport) is that there is a difference between local and national stories. The best TV has national – or, increasingly, international – relevance. Yorkshire can celebrate the spread of TV power but Channel 4 needs to aim to find there shows that have a leading, rather than merely a Leeds, edge.• Mark Lawson is a  writer and broadcaster"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/142de876de7810787470329977f262d9f1de142d/0_0_6690_4134/master/6690.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=99af43d48c496a573db0cb2882426c38 700w","title":"ontario what to see when to visit and why you should go","story":"It’s the most populous province in the country, home of the Great Lakes and Niagara Falls, and an outdoor adventurer’s dream. Here’s the lowdown on Ontario – Canada’s natural playgroundCanadians don’t like to boast, but Ontario is bigger than Texas. Most of the province’s 14 million inhabitants live in its cities, so vast swathes of land, particularly in the north, remain a natural playground. World-class centres such as Toronto, Canada’s largest metropolis, and Ottawa, the country’s capital, make a great base to explore Ontario’s awe-inspiring destinations, including Niagara Falls, the many national parks, or the majestic Great Lakes …Wine lovers should head for the Niagara peninsula, to enjoy tastings amid the rolling vineyards on its scenic Wine Routes (there are approximately 95 vineyards that offer tastings). Few come away without at least a bottle of the region’s famous German-style ice wine from the likes of Peller Estates. Ontario also has cideries, distilleries and a lots of craft breweries. Pair local wines and beers with fresh local produce in “farm to fork” restaurants. Some of the best are in the Niagara region, around busy Niagara Falls and the historic town of Niagara-on-the-Lake try Treadwell Cuisine for dishes that use simple, tasty ingredients such as heirloom tomatoes and microgreens. Prince Edward County, another wine-growing area on Lake Ontario, is known locally as Ontario’s Gastronomic Capital embark on the region’s Taste Trail, which links restaurants, artisanal producers, and wine and spirits retailers. Mennonite farmers still bring their produce to market in St Jacobs by horse and buggy around the town of Elora, whose pretty, traditional main street is lined with restaurants. Local specialities include the maple syrup or cheeses of Ontario, German-style sausages in the Kitchener-Waterloo region, or fresh pickerel and smoked trout from one of the many lakes of the north. Northern Ontario can feel like a place apart, and it has its own delicacies. These include spruce tips, harvested in spring and added to salad or pesto for a citrus flavour, and birch syrup (yep, the local version of maple syrup). You may also like spruce beer the taste of pine works for Greek retsina so why not beer? Try it at Full Beard Brewing, in Timmins.The ethnic ersity of immigrants to Ontario has left its mark on the province’s culture, seen in local festivities such as the Scottish Highland Games in Fergus and Kitchener-Waterloo’s Oktoberfest. There are even deeper roots in the many Pow-Wows celebrating the music, dance and traditional culture of the Indigenous People. The Pow-Wow on Manitoulin Island is one of the most authentic, while the annual Canadian Aboriginal festival in Hamilton attracts thousands of dancers from all over North America. The Toronto Caribbean Carnival is regularly enjoyed by about 1 million revellers. Music festivals cover the range from classical to modern but jazz sounds a dominant note, with annual festivals throughout the province, from Orillia and Guelph, to Ottawa and Prince Edward County, as well as Toronto and its notable Beaches Jazz festival. Quaint Elora showcases classical, folk, pop and jazz music in its annual festival, while Ottawa also puts on a Bluesfest. Northern Ontario, around Thunder Bay and Sault Ste Marie, is host to Culture Days every September, highlighting local talent in the arts. Sault Ste Marie’s WTF festival in June also brings the best of Canadian comedy to the region. For theatre, lovely Stratford is (obviously) the home of a Shakespeare festival, and Niagara-on-the-Lake celebrates the work of George Bernard Shaw and his contemporaries. Ottawa’s National Arts Centre is Canada’s largest centre for the performing arts, with theatre as well as opera, ballet and contemporary dance. You’ll also find Canada’s impressive National Gallery in the capital, which features masterpieces of Canadian and Indigenous art.Much of Northern Ontario is a playground for lovers of the great outdoors, a place where bears, wolves and moose still roam wild. This great Canadian Shield landscape of endless forest is best explored by floatplanes. Fishermen, hikers, canoeists and campers are dropped off at remote lodges, such as Lodge 88, to experience nights around the campfire under epic night skies as part of a “fly-in” wilderness experience. More sedate visitors simply rent a houseboat and enjoy fishing in some of the 70,000 lakes of “Sunset Country” in the north-west. Nearer to Toronto are provincial parks such as Algonquin, 7,800 square miles of lakes and forests, with 1,000 miles of canoe trails. In winter, it’s time to break out cross-country skis, snowshoes, dog sleds and snowmobiles. Niagara Falls is a complete contrast, with its casinos and thrill rides. Ride a helicopter over the falls, get soaked by its thundering spray on a jetboat, or brave the MistRider zipline.Ontario’s hot summer and cold winter are the best times to explore the outdoors, with the spring ideal for enjoying its cities – autumn, with its magnificent colours, offers the best of both. In summer, locals escape the city heat for weekend cottages along the shores of the Great Lakes or by the water in Northern Ontario. This is when resort towns come alive with music and arts festivals, and vineyards and restaurants thrive. In winter, the first essential is to take in an ice-hockey game. If that inspires you, the Rideau canal outside Ottawa is the place to try ice-skating yourself. Be warned: pretty much every Canadian can skate backwards.

So should we stop enriching billionaires accused of bullying?I guess I should stop shopping at Topman. Those allegations against Sir Philip Green are completely shocking! Daniel, by emailUm, are they? That’s sweet, Daniel. For the rest of us, learning that the businessman at the centre of allegations of sexual harassment and racism is none other than Sir Philip Green – the Penguin from Batman Returns made flesh – was only mildly less surprising than hearing about the toilet habits of bears. (Blah blah, Green denies all allegations, says he’s done nothing more than “banter” and he’s sorry for causing any offence and yadda yadda yadda, which is official Jewish legal language.)Come with me, dear readers, as I take you back – back to the future! No, sorry, wrong direction: reverse DeLorean because we are going back to the past! Back to a year when I was a young, plucky reporter, and was packed off to Oxford Street to interview Green in his office, only to find him in full fury when I arrived.“Get her out of here, she’s an antisemite, she works for the fucking !” Green shouted from behind his desk before I’d said a word. Now, in case it is not clear from how I write, literally the only person who has ever looked and sounded more Jewish than me is Janice from Friends, so Green’s claim that I am an antisemite was a bit of a surprise, but in retrospect it should not have been. I have an exciting – and timely! – revelation to make to my readers: as well as being Jewish, I am a witch.Yes, I doubted this initially, too, mainly because I am very much a dog person, and there is not enough hair product in the world to deal with what flying on a broom would do to my Jewfro. But once it was confirmed that Green was the businessman at the centre of the allegations I knew my witchiness was undeniable, and that is because nearly every person who has ever been horrible to me has suffered terrible repercussions. There is Sir Phil, as we know. Then there was Harvey Weinstein, who threw me out of several parties in LA because someone once wrote something in the  he didn’t like. And then I wrote something he really didn’t like – that his parties are boring – and he was so outraged that he wrote an op-ed in THIS PAPER in which he described going through the  comments section to find disparaging remarks about me, which sounds like totally normal, sane and balanced behaviour. (He found only one seriously, try harder, Harvey. You have time on your hands now.) All I need now is some comeuppance for the A-list actor who walked out of my interview with him “because I don’t talk to the work-experience kid” (I was 27) and the celebrity chef who literally spat in my face (“Who do you work for?” “.” “I fucking hate the ! Pah!” Handy hint: it wasn’t Delia), and vindication will be mine, all mine. And, given how strong I think we can all see my witch powers are, that day is clearly nigh. So live in fear, Nigella (legal notice: it was not Nigella).Anyway, back to Green. What I find interesting about this saga is – after the many allegations that have come out this week – how few people (except you, Daniel) were surprised when the story broke. Indeed, the only surprise was at the prospect that Green might suffer repercussions. In that way, the public reaction was reminiscent of when the whole #MeToo movement erupted. Yes, many of those cases are very different from Green’s (yadda yadda yadda), but the point is, beforehand, rumours of Weinstein’s and so on’s behaviour were just kind of tacitly accepted because people didn’t think anything could change. #MeToo changed that: allegations of bullying and sexual abuse are now seen not as inidual cases but reflections of a serious, systemic problem. It is therefore a public obligation to speak out and to support the people who take it on.As for Sir Phil, then: yes, I think you should stop giving him your money. Whatever the allegations, whether he’s guilty or not, none of us should help enrich billionaires who slap their employees with NDAs and whack injunctions on the press. Also, let’s be honest, we all know he’s a schmuck. The British establishment may never be able to wrest his knighthood from his pudgy hands but your money deserves better than that. Anyway, Topshop and Topman are rubbish these days. Come at me, Phil.

Seriously, I just had to check that he didn’t have the word paradox somewhere in his Twitter bio. Because paradox means complicated, doesn’t it. It means contradictory and illogical, doesn’t it. And Jared Leto is all of those things, because he keeps making films and then being the worst thing in all of them.It’s hard to figure out the saddest part of this. Is it the overt juvenilia of the name? The fact that nobody has ever been able to say it out loud without rolling their eyes? Or is it the Ninjas Runnin’ Wild Twitter account, which in March 2011 posted a forlorn “What’s up, guys? Everyone’s still running wild?” before disappearing forever? It’s probably all of them, isn’t it. This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

In 1974 the men downed tools, refusing to repair jet engines for the Chilean air force in protest against the bloody military coup that had toppled the government of Salvador Allende. Bob Fulton, a quick-witted shop steward, spotted that the engines were Chilean and “blacked” them, meaning that they were in dispute and couldn’t be touched. “He was a guy who was difficult for the management to handle,” a colleague chuckles.The workers didn’t know it at the time, but the engines rusting in crates outside their factory in East Kilbride were from the planes that dropped bombs on the presidential palace a year earlier. Sierra is the son of a Chilean exile living in Belgium. He grew up in the 80s hearing the story of these mythical Scottish factory workers. Here he brings them together for a reunion over a pint and their modesty is enormously touching. In the 1970s, the unions had the power to halt work on the engines. As one of the men points out, today they would be handed a P45 and shown the door.Tougher to watch are the interviews filmed with Chileans jailed and tortured after the coup. News of the Scottish act of solidarity reached some of the political prisoners and it gave them great strength to know they weren’t forgotten by the outside world. Sierra skilfully compiles archive footage of the coup and its aftermath, but doesn’t fully explain how strategically important it was to ground the jets. The film ends triumphantly, with the boycotters finally receiving recognition – not that they ever asked for a pat on the back. You can imagine Ken Loach directing this as drama, with Robert Carlyle or Peter Mullan as Fulton the late Pete Postlethwaite would have been wonderful."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b2d3ff6c110474f7e31db4bc8d4e63196bc2ab39/0_931_8242_4944/master/8242.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f158c2ee065c4e0d26d10e944cdb107c","title":"how to cook the perfect game stew and pie felicity cloake","story":"It’s the height of game season, so it’s cheap, plentiful and the ideal choice for a warming autumn stew – just top with pastry to turn it into pieIt’s that time of year when the British countryside echoes with the sound of shotguns and scolded iels, when almost everything furred and feathered that has a season is in season, and can be picked up, often surprisingly cheaply, from farm shops, markets and game dealers. Though the game industry is certainly not perfect, as an omnivore my preference is to eat a wild or semi-wild animal from a sustainable, environmentally responsible source – not always a given with game – than one that’s spent its entire life in captivity. Feel free to tell me I’m wrong below the line.Thankfully, the days of birds being hung so long that they turned green are largely a thing of the past, but game’s full flavour is still infinitely more interesting than most intensively farmed meat. This free-range lifestyle does mean that cooking it can be a bit of a culinary Russian roulette. A pheasant is a fine thing to roast, but if you have your suspicions that it might not be in the first flush of youth, you’re better off opting for low and slow in a stew that can, on high days and holidays, be easily turned into a pie. Perfect for autumnal dinners, with a side of root veg and bitter brassicas – and some sloe gin for pudding.The nature of game season means you’re more likely to end up with whatever’s been unfortunate enough to find itself in front of the guns that weekend than to pick and choose as if you’re in a supermarket. So though I try recipes using pheasant, wood pigeon, partridge and rabbit, it doesn’t seem to make sense to dictate the specifics. I will, nevertheless, pass on the advice from the west London butcher C Lidgate to use equal parts “dark meat, such as venison leg or shoulder, mallard duck and wild boar, along with paler game (pheasant, rabbit and suchlike)” if possible – it’s just more interesting.If you start with whole birds, as Gary Rhodes suggests in his underrated New British Classics, you will need to take the breasts off the bone, though I wouldn’t bother boning the legs: life’s too short, so chuck them all into the pot. This method allows you to make a game stock with the carcasses, which can be used in the gravy, so it has its benefits despite the extra work involved. That said, most game dealers sell bags of mixed game that are ideal for the purpose.Rhodes marinates the meat for 24 hours in a heady mixture of reduced red wine, port, brandy and aromatics, but I’m not sure it’s a coincidence that much of the breast meat becomes mealy and dry: Harold McGee says that after about two hours, the acid in such marinades starts to adversely affect the texture of the meat, which I suspect is what happened here.Lidgate’s also says that “the other trick is to use the best smoked bacon you can buy – the stronger the smoke, the better. As it cooks, it combines with the other ingredients to release a magical, wintry aroma.” I reckon they’re right, but that’s as much for the fat it releases as for the smoky flavour, which goes so well with game – a notoriously lean ingredient that can do with all the help it can get. I’d recommend frying the bacon to render the fat, then scooping it out and adding it to the pot towards the end of cooking, so it doesn’t end up flabby and sad. Grigson recommends serving it in “little rolls”, which feel festive and have the benefit of being big enough to pack a real punch.This is arguably even more important than the meat – a stew without gravy is, well, if not a tragedy, then certainly not a stew. All the recipes I try make liberal use of red wine and stock, for either game or chicken, with the exception of Grigson’s, which uses pheasant poaching liquid and leaves out the booze altogether for a white sauce that, though delicious, reminds me and my testers of a chicken and mushroom pie. Game seems to demand something richer and fuller bodied.That said, Dickson Wright’s 15th century-inspired recipe packs almost too much of a punch: the sauce is so thick that it’s more like a relish than a gravy. Rhodes goes slightly too far the other way: having marinated the meat in an entire bottle of claret and other alcohols overnight, he cooks it in this marinade and homemade game stock – which also includes a bottle of red. It’s delicious, but “more like a coq au vin”, apparently. Certainly it lacks the meaty depth of Macdonald’s and Lidgate’s sauces, which contain more modest amounts of wine and stock.They also both thicken their sauces with flour, which I think is essential for a proper gravy: a jus, the kind of thing liable to run off your plate while you’re helping yourself to mash, is not satisfactory here. If you’d prefer to keep it gluten-free, use arrowroot or cornflour instead.Meat stews need vegetables like a martini needs a garnish – you can do without in extremis, but it’s a bit dull. Mushrooms are popular with game, possibly for reasons of seasonal synergy, which pleases me more than the fungi – though I can see they offer textural interest, so I allow myself to be overruled by my more mushroom-tolerant testers. Carrots are always a good addition to give sweetness to meaty things. The same goes for onions, and, against my better judgment, having spent 15 minutes peeling the tricksy little things, I’m going to use the whole small ones specified by Rhodes. Macdonald’s shallots will probably be easier to find and work just as well. Leaving the onions intact prevents them disappearing into the sauce during cooking.I don’t think the sauce needs garlic, and Rhodes’ celery feels more savoury than the stew needs – most game is emphatically savoury (as opposed to the sweetness of, say, lamb or pork), so I’d prefer to keep the gravy a little softer.Dickson Wright’s medieval recipe is packed with glorious spices: cloves, cinnamon, ginger, white pepper and saffron, plus a teaspoon of sugar – not exactly what my testers are expecting from a game stew, admittedly (“Is this a tagine?”), but a happy reminder of what passed for British food before boiled beef and cabbage. Instead, I’ll be opting for the more usual combination of juniper berries, for their faintly foresty notes, thyme and bay – all herbaceous flavours that seem fitting with game.I’ll also be adding Rhodes’ redcurrant jelly, though Macdonald’s bramble jelly or Lidgate’s cranberry sauce would also supply the requisite fruity notes. It shouldn’t need his red wine vinegar, however, or Macdonald’s Worcestershire sauce (“only Lea \u0026amp Perrins will do, because it contains the vital ingredient of anchovy”, she explains): too tangy for my liking, though if you think it tastes a bit flat, either might well come to the rescue.Dickson Wright’s birds are gently braised in a relatively small amount of liquid, but everyone else simmers their meat in more copious amounts of gravy, which suits my plans just fine. Though it’s perfectly possible to get a good result on the hob, I always prefer, like Rhodes and Macdonald, to cook stews in a moderate oven: it’s easier to keep the temperature constant that way and harder to overcook the meat and dry it out.If you’d like to turn the stew into a pie, allow it to cool completely, then cover it with pastry. Grigson reckons that “many people prefer a good shortcrust with meat”, but my testers disagree. Macdonald’s puff pastry proves much more popular in this instance, though Rhodes’ rough puff would be just as delicious, if you have a yen to make your own.Prep 35 minCook 75 min (115 min + cooling if making a pie)Serves 625g butter100g smoked streaky bacon rashers, rolled up8 small onions or shallots, trimmed and peeled2 sprigs fresh thyme1 bay leaf6 juniper berries, roughly crushed1kg boned game, cut into 4cm chunks – ideally a mix of dark and light game2 tbsp flourSalt and black pepper200ml full-bodied red wine400ml good chicken or game stock75g redcurrant jelly2 carrots, cut into 1cm chunks150g small mushroomsTo make it into a pie (optional)500g puff pastry1 egg, beatenHeat the oven to 150C300Fgas 2.

Bring to a simmer, then return the onions, herbs and game to the pot. Cover and put in the oven for 45 minutes, then stir in the carrots and mushrooms, and return to the oven, covered, for 15 minutes. Arrange the bacon on top, leave the lid ajar and bake for another 30 minutes.Test the meat – it should be tender – season to taste and serve with root veg and mash.If you want to turn the stew into a pie, leave the meat to cool completely, then tip into a pie dish. Roll out the pastry on a lightly floured surface, then cover the pie, pressing it down on to the rim of the dish to seal. Snip a few small holes in the pastry to allow steam to escape, brush all over with the beaten egg and bake at 200C390Fgas 6 for 30-40 minutes, until golden.• Game: love it or hate it?

He was accompanied by his wife and a small retinue, but none of his troops.Many analysts and aid groups fear the agreement, though backed by regional powers, will not halt ongoing violence.“It’s the same model that spectacularly failed before, without the reasons for that failure being addressed,” said Alan Boswell, senior analyst at the International Crisis Group.Peter Martell, a journalist and author of a recently published book on South Sudan, said there was “every reason to expect this to collapse like past agreements” but that the country was “often surprising”.Machar, who under the terms of the peace deal is to be reinstated as vice president, fled Juba two years ago pursued by helicopter gunships when an earlier peace accord collapsed amid allegations of a coup attempt.Hundreds died in battles between troops loyal to the two rivals, and tens of thousands more were killed in the offensives that followed. A vast proportion of the casualties were civilians.“We really pray that this peace agreement holds this time,” said Juma Khamis, 27, who was in the crowd watching the ceremony near the mausoleum of national hero John Garang - the same spot where the country celebrated its independence from Sudan in 2011 after decades of north-south war fuelled by oil, ethnicity and religion.Sunday Rose, 20, was selling tea at the event and called upon leaders to commit themselves to peace.“Let our leaders see our suffering. We have suffered a lot as citizens but, with peace signed, we will be able to recover all the things we have lost,” she said.It was not immediately clear if Machar, 65, will remain in Juba, as his aides have expressed concerns over his safety in the city.“We are worried for his security in Juba, but the truth is here: we are for peace, and what we are trying to do is build trust. So that is why he is able to leave his forces behind and just go with politicians,” said Lam Paul Gabriel, a spokesman for Machar’s SPLM-IO rebel group, said.Kiir said he had ordered the release of an imprisoned South African adviser to Machar and a rebel group spokesman as part of the deal.The peace agreement was signed in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa in September. However, though it has regional support, there has been little backing from major international powers.Any workable deal will require significant external funding for monitoring and investment, and so that powerbrokers can be given incentives to lay down arms. A lack of trust has prevented this, Boswell said.South Sudan gained its independence with significant support from senior officials and celebrities such as George Clooney. The Trump administration has shown little interest in the country’s worsening plight.The fighting and atrocities have exacerbated ethnic isions and caused one of the world’s deepest humanitarian crises.Experts say the conflict has now degenerated into chaos, with different factions, militia and self-defence groups battling for a share of what is left of South Sudan’s resources.“The deal has got the backing of Uganda and Sudan, who have long been the puppet-string pullers, and that is some reason for optimism,” said Martell. “But the level of carnage has been on a scale that has exceeded even the worst nightmares, and pulling people back together will take decades. The level of hatred and anger mean a war that no one has any control of, let along men in suits in Juba.”Fighting has been continuing in the western Bahr el Ghazal and Central Equatoria regions, the UN said last week.The UN has previously accused government forces and allied militias of potential “war crimes”.According to the UN human rights office, at least 232 civilians were killed and 120 women and girls raped during an offensive between 16 April and 24 May in the country’s Unity state, with three commanders identified as bearing the “greatest responsibility” in the violence.Among the victims was a six-year-old who, said investigators, was gang-raped by soldiers, and elderly and disabled villagers who were burned alive in their huts.A spokesman for the South Sudanese army said it would respond once the military leadership had received the report.A third of the population has been displaced and two-and-a-half million people forced into exile as refugees. Those remaining have endured repeated bouts of deadly famine."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58eca0c36f70c545928cd37e6667d16355a3b5e1/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7bd1efe4647317bf83b517b91458171a","title":"ghosting busters why tech companies trying stop blanking each other","story":"We’ve all had to deal with the person who starts a friendly chat then just … vanishes. Dating apps, Facebook and Google think they have the answers. But why do they care?This Halloween, ghosts aren’t welcome. Two dating apps have announced plans to use the season to crack down on the rudest of social media villains, the ghoster: the person who enthusiastically replies to your messages, starts a friendly chat and then, one day, just … stops.Earlier this week, Bumble, the woman-friendly dating service, announced it had created the post of “ghosting specialist”, bringing the journalist and author Kate Leaver in to hear confessions, dispense advice and be a shoulder to cry on for those whose attempts to find love ended with messages echoing in the void.Another dating service, Badoo, has gone one step further, announcing plans to prompt would-be ghosts to reply to their ghostees, with a series of suggested responses, such as: “Hey, sorry for the late reply. When are you free to meet?” or “Hey, I think you’re great, but I don’t see us as a match. Take care!”They may be seasonally appropriate, but it’s hard not to view the proposals with an air of cynicism. After all, the last thing a dating app wants is its users giving up on dating – or, God forbid, continuing to date, but without using dating apps.Leaver insists such suspicions are misplaced. Her role, building on the expertise she developed writing her book The Friendship Cure, is firmly focused on pushing for “a revival of kindness and respect”, she says. “There are a lot of broken hearts and confused people these days. People are ghosting everyone all over the place.“I think people are too frightened, or too lazy, or too cowardly to have the difficult conversations that need to be had,” Leaver adds. “There has been some pretty extreme psychological damage for people who are living without any explanation as to why they’ve been ghosted because we tend to fill in the silence with our own insecurity.”Badoo emphasises the positives of its app’s feature: “Badoo has 60 million monthly active users. The feature itself simply intercepts the ‘ghosting’ process by encouraging users to reply. It also prompts those who are actually interested in their match to get the ball rolling and meet in real life.”Cynical or not, dating apps are only the latest companies to nudge users to participate more, under the guise of helping them “connect” with each other. Google, for instance, recently updated Gmail to introduce a feature called “nudges”. The service, which is on by default, prompts users to reply to emails that they “might have forgotten to respond to” and to “follow up” on emails they sent that never received a reply.While it can occasionally be useful (who among us hasn’t closed a message intending to reply to it in five minutes, only to leave it for five days?), the feature is attempting to fight a symptom of information overload by simply adding more information to the pile. It’s not enough to ignore an email. We now have to ignore it twice. In the meantime, the message is there , in bright orange, reminding you that it was “received five days ago. Reply?”Then, when you do click to reply, there are yet more nudges, from Google’s “smart compose” and “smart reply” features. The company is so eager to get users to communicate that it is now more than capable of hosting a conversation with neither person participating at all – just an endless stream of algorithmically composed “Thanks!”, “OK then!”, “See you later!” and “Ha ha, yes!” going back and forth, until one or both crack and resort to actually typing.Could nudging ghosters in the dating world simply add to the overload of the modern era? After all, as the psychologist Maya Borgueta has written in HuffPost, “ghosting is avoidance and often stems from fear of conflict. Which means that, at its heart, ghosting is about wanting to avoid confrontation, avoid difficult conversations and avoid hurting someone’s feelings.”If that is the case, Badoo’s pushy attempts to restart conversations could have the opposite effect to that intended: if you ghost because of a fear of confrontation, then it’s not much help when your dating app begins confronting you.At least Google’s nudges can be legitimately defended as productivity tools and Badoo’s as helping get the ball rolling on real dates – presumably the goal of everyone using a dating app. For the really thirsty nudges, you simply need to look at the largest social network of them all: Facebook.For a company with almost 2 billion users, an advertising platform that prints money, and no natural predator in sight, Facebook operates with an almost pathological paranoia. The company is constantly panicking about potential threats to its lead, switching wildly between various priorities for its apps, algorithms and users. First, video was the future, then live video, then groups and now “meaningful connections”.What that leads to in practice is bizarre inventions such as “Friends Day”, the anniversary of Facebook’s founding in February 2004, when the company tries to encourage users to post messages to each other. This year, that involved encouraging people to give each other “friend awards”, such as “my favourite weirdo” or “always has my back”.In the industry, these nudges have a name: “growth hacking”, sending little notifications to persuade users to open the app, boosting figures such as DAU (daily active users) just in time for the quarterly earnings calls. And they owe the intellectual framework to the behavioural economics school of nudge theory, which argues that mild changes in information presentation can have large effects on inidual behaviour.But there is a growing movement against such mild nudges. In theory, they allow governments and companies to shape behaviour for the better, while still preserving the freedom to opt out if the inidual so desires in practice, some argue, they are a far deeper attack on agency than simply forcing people to comply, as people who don’t know they’re being coerced are denied the freedom to object.Steven Ledbetter is the CEO of Habitry, which, yes, teaches companies how to apply “motivation science” to “make their products more engaging”. But, he argues, far too many people fail to treat users like human beings. “We think these bullshit behaviour-change technologies almost always have the feature of thinking human beings would just ‘be happier’ if we were more predictable. Had less autonomy. Were more like robots.

About 200 staff will relocate to the city from the London headquarters by the end of next year. The move will also include the establishment of a new TV studio and Channel 4 News bureau, enabling the nightly news programme to be co-anchored from West Yorkshire.The decision was made after a meeting of the Channel 4 board on Wednesday, with the competing cities kept in the dark until the announcement was made.Candidates for Channel 4’s regional base – which the broadcaster is calling its national headquarters – were required to have a population of more than 200,000, a travel time to London of less than three hours and high-quality physical and digital infrastructure.Birmingham and Greater Manchester had been seen as the frontrunners on the shortlist of three, with the West Midlands mayor, Andy Street, repeatedly saying he was confident of winning the contest and Greater Manchester able to point to the growing media industry centred on the BBC and ITV’s presence in Salford Quays.However, it was the West Yorkshire city that ultimately triumphed. “Leeds put forward a compelling and ambitious strategy for how they could work alongside Channel 4 to further build the strong independent production sector in the city and develop new erse talent from across the region,” said the Channel 4 chief executive, Alex Mahon.The broadcaster also announced that Bristol and Glasgow had been chosen to house two smaller creative hubs, with Cardiff missing out. This will take the total number of Channel 4 workers moving out of London to about 300.The majority of staff, including Mahon, will remain in the capital but the chief executive said she expected to spend a significant proportion of her time in Yorkshire and the other regional bases.She said the decision to choose Leeds was influenced by the ability to establish a presence close to independent production companies in Yorkshire and the north-east, which were underserved by other broadcasters.Mahon said: “It’s a vibrant and growing city. It has a really, really strong production sector … they were very strong in terms of their partnerships and they have a erse community across the Leeds-Bradford region.”She accepted that the move would be a big change for staff but said it would allow Channel 4 to live up to its mission of ersity and inclusion.She said the broadcaster, which does not make its own programmes and instead commissions shows from external production companies, would ultimately benefit from being more in touch with the rest of the UK population and therefore become more creatively and commercially successful.Judith Blake, the leader of Leeds city council, said: “Together with Bradford, we have one of the youngest and fastest-growing labour markets in the UK. The news of Channel 4 choosing Leeds will have a very positive impact on these generations and is a real triumph for the city and wider region.”The relocation comes after Channel 4 successfully fought against government proposals to privatise it and move its entire staff out of the capital. Although the channel is commercially funded, it is owned by the government, giving it a unique place in the British broadcasting environment.It faces many of the same issues as other public service broadcasters, including competition from streaming services, although it is celebrating after 7.5 million viewers tuned in for Tuesday night’s final of The Great British Bake Off."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/62129474e92ca698f69b2f023602c942adfc31bf/1180_626_2636_1581/master/2636.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b4ebc9f40bf9bb2bee68dc23daf12983","title":"metrocouk pays mp 20000 after false homophobia claims","story":"News website accepted none of its accusations about Labour’s Gavin Shuker was trueThe Labour MP Gavin Shuker has received £20,000 in damages from  after it falsely accused him of being homophobic and promoting abortion.The payment, disclosed in the latest register of member’s interests, related to a  opinion piece published earlier this year entitled “We need to stop attaching morals to sex work – it can be fatal” which defended sex work and criticised Shuker for his stance on the issue.The MP, the chair of the all-party parliamentary group on prostitution, has repeatedly campaigned for a change in the law that would make it illegal to pay for sex. has already issued an apology for its decision to print the article.“We included claims in the article that Mr Shuker is homophobic, had defended a charity in pushing ‘conversion therapy’ for LGBTQ people, is a misogynist and an opponent of abortion,” the website said in a correction. “The article may also have been understood to mean that Mr Shuker had failed to respond to our request for comment before publication, which was not the case.“We accept that none of these claims against Mr Shuker was true.

Ariana Grande, after a hellish year marked by a cancelled engagement, a terror attack and the death of an ex-boyfriend, has hit back at fans angry over the delay to her latest music video: “Been thru hell and back and i’m doing my best to keep going”. Selena Gomez, currently receiving mental health treatment, posted on Instagram: “I am taking a social media break. Again.” Even Rihanna, widely perceived as impervious to industry pressures, became short with an interviewer last month when asked, yet again, when she plans on releasing new music. “Who sent you?” she replied.Why now? The pop industry has never been particularly kind to its artists. Derided as the most commercial (and therefore least serious) music genre, its stars are often regarded less as human beings, more as vessels for bangers. The factory-line churn of having to release an album every two years, with a promotional cycle followed by a world tour – all while maintaining a pleasant, marketable and “always on” public persona – has always been a pressure.Take Britney Spears’ breakdown in 2007, when she shaved her head and attacked a paparazzo’s car with an umbrella: a test case for how the media used to treat a stressed pop idol. Musicians had always “behaved badly”, but for Britney, international pop sensation, this behaviour seemed like a terrible bug in the machine. While bad boys could be bad ­­­­­– that was their brand, after all – the mental breakdown of a picture-perfect young idol was a blatant deviation from the standard script of pop marketability, so reliant on the image of an emotionally uncomplicated and sexually available ingenue. Spears’ erratic behaviour was treated as round-the-clock light entertainment by tabloids, setting a darker precedent: a pop star’s entire personal life is a public commodity.Stars now have tools to fight back, however. Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat and Tumblr have become an integral part of the celebrity machine, connecting young, always-online music fans with their favourite stars, bypassing the publicist’s approval. While, to their famous users, social media offer a way out of the well-oiled respectability machine.It’s no coincidence that Ariana Grande and Selena Gomez’s breaks from public life were announced on their social media channels. They are seasoned veterans of the game. In the lead up to her latest album Sweetener, Grande was criticised for not being fully committed to the promotional cycle, with fans noting her absence from the usual roster of American talk shows. Facing mounting criticism, she tweeted that album promotion “destroyed my mental health and was horrible for me”, asking her fans to “stop coming for me and my team when I’ve never been better literally in any department.”Selena Gomez, hot off a major cover story with Elle magazine, voiced her displeasure with the journalist who wrote it on her Instagram, saying: “The older I get the more I want my voice to be mine.” She then hosted a 45-minute Instagram Live stream, in which she discussed her experience of depression, not being mentally ready for touring, and how fame decreases the “pleasure centres” in the brain. “I don’t feel like being on another magazine cover ever again”, she says in the unglamorous, DIY-style video “It just … it doesn’t matter.”While these posts may be a publicist’s nightmare – and irritate the casual observer, familiar with the immense wealth and privilege that comes with this level of celebrity – they strengthen the resolve of the audience that matters most: fans. They flood these posts with uplifting support. “We love u so so much, your happiness is the most important thing to us,” says an Ariana fan in a widely liked comment, responding to her decision to slow down her promotional cycle.“Protecting” your celebrity against public pressures is common among young fans. This curious impulse – perhaps kicked off by Chris Crocker’s exhortation to “Leave Britney alone!” in the wake of her breakdown – blends conventional celebrity fandom with awareness of the corrupting effects of fame. These well-meaning fans’ vociferous concern nevertheless adds to the cacophonous, stressful noise of fame. For pop stars who can endure it, though, this is a game changer. Failure to “work”, rather than being a career killer, has become a unique selling point: disclosing your own struggles in public, and an inability to live up to the fame game, only strengthens your appeal.It would be wrong to suggest that these young stars are fully in control of their lives. In every Instagram post or tweet that pushes back against commercial pressures, there is a naked, vulnerable plea for identification. The spectre of Britney’s breakdown lives on.But it is a start. Pop has always been an industry full of contradictions. It touts the public iconography of young women while being controlled behind the scenes by older men it courts X-rated sexiness while remaining conventionally marketable it emphasises the difference of its artists while pushing them through factory-line production processes. Now, pop is faced with its biggest contradiction yet: the sheer strength of artists’ star power has almost made the media machine behind it irrelevant. Pop stars have long been beholden to their public image, imposed on them from above now, with their social media accounts and steadfast support of their ride-or-die fans, they’re beginning to write their own scripts."},{"url":null,"title":"introducing today in focus","story":"Today in Focus is a new daily podcast that brings you closer to  journalism.

You cannot have agreement on the backstop and put the political declaration in front of them on the 16th.” Expectations in Brussels are that a deal is more likely to be struck in December, or even later, given the distance between the prime minister’s red-lines on the backstop and that of the European commission and 27 member states."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ebf34541dbd5e5a84635d30f5d7dafe2a48a417/42_0_2797_1679/master/2797.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8e4a0c17783c618db9f52812107851c","title":"corbyn and the maybot the love story as revealed in peculiar interpretive dance","story":"Labour leader commits ultimate act of self-sacrifice by lowering himself to beleaguered PM’s levelWestminster’s most unlikely love affair grows stronger by the day. Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn may have their ideological differences, but they have become emotionally inseparable. Their failings mirror one another’s perfectly and they have both come to realise their survival depends on the other’s weakness. Her need is his need. A co-dependent couple locked in a death spiral. Without the other, they are both exposed. A match made in dysfunction.You’d have thought May’s claims that austerity was coming to an end would have presented Corbyn with an easy target at prime minister’s questions after the chancellor’s budget had delivered no extra money for schools or prisons. And initially it looked as if the Labour leader had read the runes as he went on the attack.“We are ending austerity,” May said. There was going to be more money for the little extras in schools. Things like heating, salary increases, desks, white boards, pens and toilet paper. It’s amazing what £10,000 can buy a school. She didn’t feel the need to mention anything about prisons because, when you thought about it, prisons were really a bit like schools. Corbyn looked doubtful and moved on to the lack of any extra money for community policing.“We are ending austerity,” the prime minister continued. “We have put more money into counter-terrorism.” Ah yes, the friendly neighbourhood armed response unit that stops to nick a shoplifter and help a few old people to cross the road before breaking up an Isis network. All in a day’s work. Sensing she was losing her audience in the Commons, May couldn’t prevent herself from repeating yet again that austerity was coming to an end. The Maybot loop demanded nothing else.At which point, Corbyn became nonplussed. None of this had been in the script. What had been agreed was that he would be a bit rubbish and so would she. He’d kept his side of the bargain, doing no more than the bare minimum in highlighting the more obvious inconsistencies in the Conservative position at a fairly gentle plod. But May had gone totally off message. She hadn’t been been a bit rubbish. She’d been hopeless.So the Labour leader committed an act of ultimate self-sacrifice by lowering himself to her level. Corbyn gave a coy smile, blew May a kiss and wrote “kick me” on his forehead. Under ordinary circumstances even he wouldn’t have been dim enough to draw attention to the fact that he and his shadow chancellor disagreed over tax cuts for the well-off, but needs must. Theresa was in distress and only he could rescue her.May’s eyes glowed with gratitude. After once more repeating that austerity was coming to an end, she accepted Corbyn’s gift by rubbing his nose in the dirt over John McDonnell’s backing for the budget. Corbyn looked wounded. He had expected some push back but this was turning into a punishment beating. The prime minister guiltily realised she had overstepped the mark. To show her remorse, she happily volunteered to make a fool of herself by saying how much the freeze in fuel duty was going to help the poorest members of society who didn’t own a car.Parity restored, Corbyn and May happily bumped along at the bottom level of even their own expectations. He failed to ask a killer question and she could barely remember her name as they stumbled their way to a close. PMQs as a peculiar form of interpretive dance where the only interpretation is incoherence.The responses from both sets of backbenchers were rather more telling. Labour MPs have long since given up on Corbyn. There were plenty of empty green spaces on the opposition benches even before the session had got under way and even more by the time it had ended. Those who did stay remained almost entirely silent. PMQs as Trappist initiation.Tories, though, were a great deal more rowdy. Philip Hammond’s previous two budgets had unravelled within hours and to have one that had survived more or less intact into a third day was worthy of celebration. They had come out in force to enjoy themselves and were hellbent on having a good time regardless of the performance.So May found herself in the strange position of having every weak and contradictory response cheered as if it was a killer line. At first she looked bewildered, unsure if her party was taking the piss out of her, but then she chose to roll with it. Beggars can’t be choosers and by the end she was leading her MPs in a mindless call and response of “Debt? UP. Benefits DOWN.” There’s nothing the Conservatives enjoy more than a bit of collective stupidity.“I love you, Jeremy,” May mouthed across the dispatch box as the Speaker brought PMQs to a close."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/53ecdeedc42b93bf074416eb5179810e8e90865e/197_626_1723_1034/master/1723.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=20729798a37f427141b7a359083e0267","title":"eu prepares for a no deal brexit amid lack of progress on talks","story":"EU seminars will cover citizens’ rights, transport, border controls and financial servicesThe European Union is pressing ahead with plans for a no-deal Brexit, amid uncertainty about when high-level negotiations will resume.With 149 days until Brexit day, time is running out to secure a deal that the British government wants to nail down this autumn, to allow time for the agreement to gain assent from parliament and the European parliament.EU diplomats meeting on Tuesday agreed to hold a series of no-deal planning seminars in November, covering citizens’ rights, aviation, ground transport, customs, border controls and financial services.Senior British and EU officials are in constant contact and neither side has given up on holding a special Brexit summit in mid-November to strike a deal. With British politics focused on the budget, EU diplomats do not expect talks between the EU chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, and the Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab, to resume this week.Some European officials see a growing risk of sliding into an accidental no-deal, if the British parliament votes down any agreement the embattled prime minister strikes with the EU.EU leaders decided they would not come to a November summit unless there was substantial progress in talks, which are deadlocked over a solution to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. Barnier told EU leaders earlier this month not to expect progress until December, which leaves very little time for UK parliamentary ratification.A UK government spokesperson said: “We want to get a deal as soon as possible and agreed in the autumn. We will continue to work with the EU to make this happen.”Talks remain stuck over the Irish backstop, an insurance plan that would keep Northern Ireland in the EU customs union and subject to many single market rules. May has said no prime minister could accept it and the government is searching for alternatives. While EU negotiators have been discussing an all-UK customs union and extension of the transition, EU diplomats insist these cannot be alternatives to an open-ended guarantee on the backstop.Senior EU sources say little progress has been made since March on Ireland, with the British rejecting Barnier’s efforts to “de-dramatise” the issue by moving most customs checks away from the border, into company premises.EU leaders are said to be confident of a deal, but some officials are less sanguine. Several sources have rubbished claims that the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, will ride to the rescue of the British by watering down the EU position. “Germany has not budged one inch,” a senior EU diplomat said. “The UK has been misreading the German position for years,” the source added, a reference to David Cameron’s misplaced hopes in Berlin on a series of issues.Merkel’s decision to step down as leader of the CDU party, which is seen as weakening her authority, is unlikely to have any impact on Brexit. “The Germans are pretty laid back,” said one diplomat, who predicted it would not change anything.British politicians campaigning for a second referendum, including the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, and the Liberal Democrat leader, Vince Cable, urged Barnier last week to start planning for an extension of the two-year negotiating period, article 50. Khan said whatever deal May brings back would definitely be rejected by parliament.Diplomatic sources say the EU has made no plans for prolonging article 50, while any extension beyond the European elections on 23 May 2019 is deemed legally impossible, unless the UK takes part in the vote.The UK will automatically leave the EU on 29 March 2019 unless all 27 member states agree unanimously to a British request to extend article 50.Lamberts argues that British remainers should accept leaving the EU and campaign for re-entry during the 21-month transition period.He voiced confidence the EU would fast-track the UK’s re-admission. “This is a special case, where you cannot as EU27 demand full re-application,” he said. “If during the transition a popular majority or a political majority in the House of Commons or House of Lords come to the conclusion that the UK should exit the transition by stepping back into the EU I really do not see how, politically, the EU27 could say ‘no thanks’.”Many remain campaigners staunchly oppose this strategy because the UK would lose the rebate and have to renegotiate existing special privileges, such as opt-outs on joining the euro and justice and home affairs."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dcf4a5bdc6b5d02afe3fd6f82bd26b58c841f95e/0_380_7952_4771/master/7952.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1744e794acc4430ea14dbf00e0277055","title":"its important to feel connected companies share their co working experiences","story":"Achieving a true work-life balance is notoriously difficult, whether you’re a working parent, first-time entrepreneur or a senior business leader.

We don’t have have enough affordable housing that homeless people can access.”Homeless Link’s chief executive, Rick Henderson, said: “It is alarming to see such a dramatic rise in the number of people sleeping rough in London … We need to ask ourselves some tough questions about why so many are finding themselves with little choice but to bed down on the streets.”Research by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism found more than 440 homeless people died on streets or in temporary accommodation in the UK in the past year. Among those who died since October 2017 was a former solider, an astrophysicist and a Big Issue seller.Charities have called the deaths a national disgrace and blamed soaring homelessness on austerity, expensive private rents and a lack of social housing. They said local authorities should investigate every death.The figures are likely to be a substantial underestimate as no official organisation counts the deaths of homeless people in Britain. Data shows there were at least 449 deaths in a year – more than one per day.An investigation by the  in April found that at least 230 deaths of homeless people were recorded by local authorities in the UK between 2013 and 2017."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0fefb38ca382efc915adb770d6fd6ee32f8e488a/0_154_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=92f433740eac38e19971117ceafbb536","title":"chris froome declines to commit to defending giro d italia title in 2019 team sky cycling","story":"The Giro d’Italia champion Chris Froome said he is still undecided about riding in next year’s edition but added that the start of the 102nd route, announced on Wednesday, looked explosive.The Team Sky rider became the first Briton to win the century-old race in May, and was briefly the first cyclist in 35 years to hold all three Grand Tour titles at the same time.He relinquished that when he finished behind his Sky teammate Geraint Thomas in the 2018 Tour de France and then did not race in the Vuelta a España which was won by compatriot Simon Yates, who had led most of the Giro before Froome’s win.Froome was one of the main guests at the 2019 Giro route presentation in Milan on Wednesday. But he was unsure about whether he would be on the start line in Bologna on 11 May where a short and sharp 8.2km time trial kicks off the race.“I still don’t know. It’s a decision that we’ll have to take with the team,” Froome said. “With a hard start like that it’s going to be very explosive, very interesting.”After the time trial, stage two takes the riders from Bologna to Fucecchio. The riders will then head to the west coast from Vinci to Orbetello, before twisting through the shallow inclines of central Italy.Italy’s Elia Viviani, who won the points classification in this year’s race, predicted a fast opening week in 2019. “A sprinter who arrives in good shape could get a good haul of stage wins from that first week,” he said.There will also be another inidual time trial on stage nine over an ever-rising 34.7km from Riccione to San Marino. Riders get a respite on stage 10’s flat 147km route from Ravenna to Modena, with the next day starting from Carpi.The race winner will probably be decided on one of the three Dolomite climbs on stage 20, before the final stage in Verona, a 15.6km time trial. The winner will be crowned inside the city’s Roman amphitheatre.Team Sky will have a decision to make on who they send to the 3,518km event in Italy with Thomas considering returning to the race which he crashed out of in 2017. “The Giro really excites me.

An official statement, posted on Twitter, read: “Rafael Nadal has withdrawn and will be replaced by Malek Jaziri, who will face Fernando Verdasco in the last match of the daytime session.”Speaking at a press conference the same day, Nadal said: “I arrived here a couple of days ago, as everyone knows I have been outside of the competition since the US Open. I took time off, I came back and it was great to be in Paris for a couple of days and practise with the guys.“I enjoyed it, I feel, in terms of tennis, better than what I thought one week ago, but in the last few days I started to feel a little bit abdominal pain, especially when serving.

DeLappe wonders if, “plucked from its native habitat, this deeply American portrait will feel even more so”. She’s right: her team of nine high-schoolers might as well have played basketball instead.But in Ellen McDougall’s production, the primary focus is not sport but the nature of the group itself and the way the girls speak to each other in this female-only space. They talk at once, in multiple conversations. One player comments on the limits of freedom in China: “They don’t have Twitter there.” At the same time, another speaks about the benefits of tampons over sanitary pads. They laugh, bitch, gossip and fight, the dialogue reflecting a certain kind of young female sensibility and experience.In their most tender moments, they capture the awkwardness of adolescence in its vacillations between childlike innocence and adult knowing. The latter comes with jock-like swearing, sexual swaggering and macho banter with a twist (“Suck my tampon, bitches”).Rosie Elnile’s stage design of an empty green space (as the pitch) is arresting in its simplicity. The players enter in silhouette and a soundtrack of a stadium crowd adds to the atmosphere, though bursts of dramatic music and sudden drops to darkness feel rather too thriller-ish.Characterisation is less successful DeLappe has said she deliberately used “the language of archetypes” to create a strong sense of the team (players are referred to by team numbers and not names) but this inhibits their development. They have a few basic traits, but are not coloured in beyond these. The captain is bossy (“hustle, ladies!”) the goalie has anxiety one has a secret eating disorder another may have had an abortion and the new girl is the outsider.The play is structured around the team’s preparation – the real drama of their lives happens off stage, reported to us during these training sessions. It is a neat concept yet almost every scene shows the team in repetitive warm-up movements, stretching or jogging, so that the strength of the drama almost entirely depends on their repartee and debate.While this is funny and perceptive, there is no sense of an overarching journey or enough emotional traction. Ultimately, the production feels static – a rather long 90-minute game."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ed1f099e30b889cf01d8d38bd0973c4fff43d4c/0_0_4123_2474/master/4123.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b5d40d7b187babe2a945baff82f9ae0a","title":"iphone xr review apple big bezels battery face id screen","story":"With Face ID and a decent screen, this phone attempts a happy medium between quality and price – but £750 still isn’t a bargainThe iPhone XR looks to offer most of what made the iPhone XS a knockout for £250 less – but with a colourful body and a slightly larger screen is this the iPhone to buy?With the iPhone XS and XS Max starting at £999 and £1,099 respectively, Apple has room to shoehorn a slightly lower cost, but still expensive, model in underneath.The iPhone XR is that model, but with a slightly larger screen than the 5.8in iPhone XS that’s also a little smaller than the 6.5in iPhone XS Max, it offers something subtly different too.The 6.1in LCD is colourful and relatively crisp with excellent viewing angles, but just not quite as brilliant as the OLED displays on the top iPhones or rivals of a similar price.The bezels are also noticeably larger than the other iPhones, making it look a little like an iPhone XS permanently in a case. The body is aluminium and glass, rather than having stainless steel sides, which makes it a little less slippery and easier to grip.Despite being well made, it feels less luxurious than the iPhone XS or previous all-metal iPhones, but given most will put it in a case I suspect it won’t make much difference. It’s worth noting that Apple is not making cases for the iPhone XR, meaning third-party manufacturers are your only option.The iPhone XR comes in a large range of colours. It looks stunning in the red or white colours, but a little cheap in the yellow option. The increased screen size and larger bezels makes it 4.5mm wider than the iPhone XS, but 1.7mm narrower than the iPhone XS Max, which with its rounded edges makes the iPhone XR right on the limit of what I am able to use one-handed. Those with smaller hands will struggle. The iPhone XR is also wider than rivals such as the 6.1in Huawei P20 Pro, 6.2in Samsung Galaxy S9+ or the 6.4in Huawei Mate 20 Pro.The iPhone XR has the same A12 Bionic chip as the iPhone XS and XS Max, but has only 3GB of RAM compared to 4GB for the more expensive models.Day-to-day performance is indistinguishable between the new iPhones: iOS feels snappy and fluid, while gaming performance was similar too. There will be times where the iPhone XR will have worse performance because of the smaller amount of RAM, perhaps during heavy multitasking, but I couldn’t find any in real world usage.Battery life on the other hand is all-round better than both the iPhone XS and XS Max, which lasted 24 and 27 hours respectively. The iPhone XR lasted over 32 hours between charges, matching last year’s iPhone X, meaning it would make it from a 7am wake up alarm until around 3pm the next day.That was while using it as my primary device, sending and receiving hundreds of emails, messages and push notifications, listening to five hours of music on Bluetooth headphones, watching an hour of Netflix, and shooting about 10 photos a day.The iPhone XR also technically has a slower 4G modem than the iPhone XS, but given that in real-world usage the limit on speed is not with the phone but the 4G provider, it is unlikely to make any difference.The iPhone XR runs iOS 12 and is identical to the iPhone XS, complete with grouped notification handling and integrated wellbeing tools so you can keep an eye on your smartphone usage.The lack of 3D touch means some of it works a little differently. To quick reply to a notification from lock screen you have to swipe left on it, select view, then reply, rather than just press harder on it.Other tasks such as launching the camera from the lock screen are now activated by long-presses rather than hard-presses, but shortcuts from apps such as direct access to the selfie camera or a quick preview of the next event in your calendar are not supported.The truth is I’ve never really used 3D touch gestures apart from the one to clear all notifications or for quick replies, so I didn’t miss them.The iPhone XR has one-half of the iPhone XS’s camera, having the same 12-megapixel wide angle camera but not the 2x telephoto camera.The result is a camera that captures very similar-looking standard photos to the excellent iPhone XS, with excellent dynamic range, colour and detail, and good low-light performance. In fact it’s not until you try to zoom in that you can really tell the difference. The 5x digital zoom is still surprisingly good, but it isn’t a patch on the hybrid zoom produced by the dual-camera system.Likewise, portrait shots of people are good with a much wider angle than that produced by the iPhone XS, but you have to get closer to your target for the face detection to work properly and produce the effect. You’re also limited to shooting people and it lacks some of the more advanced lighting effects.The selfie camera is identical to that on the iPhone XS, producing good but not overly detail-rich selfies.Overall, the cameras on the iPhone XR are really good and a massive step up on the iPhone 7 or older, but not the best available on a smartphone.The iPhone XR is available in black, white, blue, yellow, coral and red, costing £749 with 64GB of storage, £799 with 128GB and £899 with 256GB.The iPhone XR is an odd proposition. For many it will be the most attractive iPhone just because it is £250 cheaper than the iPhone XS, but it’s important to note that at £749 it is in no way cheap.Many top-end rivals cost around the £750 mark while offering better screens, better cameras and more capabilities – and some even undercut it by as much as £250.But for the Apple-only buyer, what you get with the iPhone XR is most of what makes the iPhone XS good, just not the bits that make it truly great. It doesn’t feel as luxurious, the bezels are larger and the screen isn’t as nice, the camera isn’t quite as capable and it isn’t the best iPhone you can buy, which undoubtedly is some of the appeal of a £999 smartphone.The iPhone XR does last longer than the other 2018 iPhones, and it comes in some stunning colour options. If you must buy an iPhone but can’t or won’t spend £999 or more, the iPhone XR is the smartphone for you.Cons: no headphone socket, no fingerprint scanner, glass will break if dropped, expensive, no fast charger or USB-C cable in the box, no headphones adapter in the box This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

Anybody can do it,” Mandal told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Wednesday after his victory was announced.“Baking is science. It’s a mixture of physics, chemistry and engineering.”The series was filmed over the summer but the results were kept secret until the final aired on Channel 4 on Tuesday. Mandal’s colleague David Anson revealed he stopped bringing cakes into work when he was accepted on to the show because he did not want to “give the game away”.“He’s been carrying on with his job. He’s doing first rate research using lasers, it’s really complex. He’s just a league above ... He’s a bright spark,” Anson told the Press Association.Mandal first brought a cake into work in June 2016, but his Victoria sponge did not impress the office.“He said it was his second ever cake that he’d iced. It was very over the top in colour and thickness. That wasn’t brilliant. I couldn’t eat the icing. It was 50-50 cake and icing,” Anson said.“After that he kept bringing more and more bakes into work for people to try. He always bakes for someone’s birthday, he wants the excuse to bake a cake. After a while he was thinking of applying for Bake Off. He did apply last year and got a telephone interview but that was all.“He spent the next year improving and improving and improving, and taking photographs of his stuff. More esoteric stuff started coming in.”Mandal overcame a major setback in the final when a jar shattered, spraying shards of glass across his workbench.Leith and Hollywood granted him extra time at the end of challenge to make up for the 15 minutes he lost. Some fans of the show were upset by the decision and said Kim-Joy should have been crowned champion.Anson said of his colleague’s showstopper: “The sludge tasted beautiful. I ate most of it. But at the end of the day it really was very close.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f021d5d158195249562ab3c772c6589da6d2c44e/0_316_3813_2287/master/3813.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eecc7105eae582260c524015220b42b6","title":"armistice day 100 years on share your letters stories and photographs","story":"Whether your family members or friends were in active service, or in some supporting role at home or abroad, we’d like to hear their storiesSunday 11 November this year will mark 100 years since the armistice treaty was signed between first world war allies and Germany, bringing to an end four years of war in western Europe.On that day people in Britain celebrated by pouring out onto the streets and gathering in large places. Church bells were rung in towns and villages across the UK, for the first time since the war began, both as a symbolic gesture and to let people know the war was over.Though this was a joyous moment for the allies at least, the devastating loss of life affected many families and communities in Britain and across the world.

She said it was unacceptable that no cause had been found.An investigation by Santé Publique France, the national health agency, published at the beginning of October, suggested the number of babies born with these abnormalities in the Loire-Atlantique and Brittany regions constituted worrying clusters.But it insisted the number of cases in Ain was not above average and declared any further investigation closed, suggesting the incidences were probably down to chance.Scientists and researchers disputed this conclusion, claiming there had been 58 times the expected level of these abnormalities in Ain.Full research into the scale of the problem and possible causes has been hampered by the lack of a national register of infant deformities.News of the national investigation has vindicated the work of Remera, the publicly funded organisation that has documented and researched cases in the Rhône-Alpes region, including Ain. It had ruled out genetic malformations as well as drug- or alcohol-related causes after speaking to the affected parents and their doctors.Emmanuelle Amar, the director of Remera, said the chance of the abnormalities being coincidental was “more than infinitesimal” and criticised the lack of action by the authorities as a “health scandal”.Researchers say the only common factor in the cases was that the infants’ parents lived in rural areas, throwing suspicion on pesticides and environmental factors.“These malformations are very rare, but also very specific. There is something, some product, that is cutting the limbs at the time the embryo is developing. We must search for it,” Amar told the .Amar – who raised the alarm over the abnormality cluster – and her team have since had their funding removed and received redundancy letters."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae22f68a9d592a26aa932434c8395e26d819179d/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=69e782f3fc31e10b4e989d2fec57348b","title":"rightwinger leads race to succeed angela merkel as party chair","story":"Socially conservative Friedrich Merz is longstanding opponent of German chancellorTwo separate polls have suggested that Friedrich Merz, a rightwinger with a longstanding grudge against Angela Merkel, is emerging as the frontrunner to succeed her as party leader, potentially accelerating her departure as chancellor.Merkel said on Monday she would stand down in December after 18 years at the helm of the ruling Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and not run again as chancellor in the federal elections due in 2021, unleashing a fierce battle for her succession.Economically liberal but socially conservative, Merz, one of many once-powerful CDU men to have been outmanoeuvred by Merkel during her long career, threw his hat into the ring straight after her announcement and is widely seen as offering the party a return to its roots after her leftwards push.He denied on Wednesday that personal tensions would prevent him working with the outgoing chancellor, whom he said he respected but did not always agree with. “I’m convinced that under these changed circumstances, we will get along,” he said.The party needed “change and renewal, but not revolution”, Merz added, but had to sharpen its profile and present a clearer message. “National identity and traditional values must have have a firm place in our thinking and actions,” he said.CDU party delegates will choose their new leader at a congress in early December, with many observers suggesting that Merkel’s ability to see out the remaining three years of her fourth term as chancellor will depend on their decision.Commentators suggested Merz’s unlikely comeback – the 62-year-old abandoned politics for business more than a decade ago – has a real chance of succeeding, a likelihood that most believe would see Merkel forced out before her planned exit date.Paul-Jasper Dittrich of the Jacques Delors Institute in Berlin said that while the upper echelons of the CDU had become much more liberal in Merz’s absence, large parts of the party’s base remained deeply conservative and would be drawn to his candidacy.“In coming back in from the cold now as a principled ‘outsider’ who hasn’t much changed, Merz will be able to cater for the needs of the base much more authentically than his competitors,” Dittrich said.That, combined with continued bad polling as the party heads towards its end-of-year congress, could trigger a “revolutionary situation”, he tweeted – meaning Merz’s chances of taking over from Merkel were greater than many had believed.The Süddeutsche Zeitung daily paper said Merz’s candidacy had “electrified the CDU because in Merz, it is the anti-Merkel reaching out for the seat of party chair”. It added: “His election would be a political turnaround in the party.”If Merz succeeds, it would be a remarkable return. A talented and provocative former member of the CDU youth wing, he rose to become the party’s parliamentary leader in 2000 but was dislodged by Merkel two years later after the party lost federal elections to Gerhard Schröder’s Social Democrats.Seeking to consolidate her power base, the future chancellor rallied a majority to oust Merz, whose caustic and often entertaining rhetoric and socially conservative, pro-business views are in marked contrast to her more sober style and social liberalism.Former colleagues say he has resented her ever since. “This woman should never have been allowed to become chancellor,” he once said privately, according to Der Spiegel. “If I have to blame myself for something, then it would be the failure to have understood her character. She is not capable of loyalty.”Frustrated, Merz returned to corporate law, leaving the Bundestag altogether in 2009, and in 2016 was appointed head of the supervisory board at the German arm of BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager.Unsurprisingly, Merz, a low-tax and light-touch regulation advocate who also holds top supervisory positions at Axa, Deutsche Börse and HSBC, has the support of many in Germany’s business community.“There is strong backing,” Oskar Niedermayer, a political analyst, told the Rhein-Neckar Zeitung. “His economically liberal, socially conservative positions make him the clear antithesis to Merkel.”To the German public, Merz is best known for his 2004 demand that German’s hugely complex tax system should be made simple enough for the average family to fill out their tax return on the back of a beermat – and for his contentious appeal for what he called a Leitkultur, or a guiding or dominant national culture.Long before immigration and integration dominated political debate, Merz insisted anyone wanting to live in Germany should “conform to Germany’s prevailing liberal culture”, sparking a furious national debate in which he was accused of illiberalism and racism.That record may well prove appealing to a party increasingly alarmed by the way it haemorrhaged votes in last year’s federal election, and in state polls this month in Hesse and Bavaria, to the far-right, anti-immigration AfD."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eada770826d0265827da9823ec047a27cbb8f3b2/0_365_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=163083e564ab9777a110c502e52d2cae","title":"un criticises rohingya deal between myanmar and bangladesh","story":"Conditions in Rakhine state ‘not yet conducive’ for return of refugees, says UNHCRUN officials have condemned a deal struck between Myanmar and Bangladesh to start repatriating Rohingya refugees, with the UN refugee agency confirming they have not been consulted about the plan.Bangladesh and Myanmar government officials announced this week they had struck a “very concrete” repatriation deal for the return of the 720,000 Rohingya refugees who fled a brutal military crackdown in August 2017, which would begin by “mid-November”.Myanmar officials said on Wednesday they had verified 5,000 Rohingya refugees so far, with the “first batch” of 2,000 to be repatriated in the next month.However, Stéphane Dujarric, a spokesman for the UN secretary general, António Guterres, said the deal had taken the UN high commissioner for refugees (UNHCR) by surprise.“To be clear … UNHCR, which is in lead on the issues of refugees, was not consulted on this matter,” said Dujarric at the daily press briefing given by the secretary general’s office.Chris Melzer, the UNHCR’s senior external officer based in Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh, reiterated this, saying: “UNHCR was not a party to that agreement.“We would advise against imposing any timetable or target figures for repatriation in respect of the voluntary nature and sustainability of return,” added Melzer. “It is unclear if refugees know their names are on this list that has been cleared by Myanmar. They need to be informed. They also need to be consulted if they are willing to return ... It is critical that returns are not rushed or premature.”Hundreds of thousands of Rohingya have been living in cramped refugee camps in Cox’s Bazar for more than a year after fleeing rape, murder and arson in Rakhine state at the hands of the Myanmar military.The Myanmar government signed an agreement with the UNHCR in June that they would work with the UN to create “safe and dignified” conditions for the return of the Rohingya to Rakhine, including guaranteeing security, freedom of movement and pathway to citizenship. None of these assurances have been made by the Myanmar government so far and the UNHCR has only been given restricted access to Rakhine state.Bangladesh has handed Myanmar a list of 24,342 refugees whom they have cleared for repatriation, but details of the logistics and precise date of the repatriation are unclear. The issue of consent and possible forced repatriation has also been raised, with Rohingya in Cox’s Bazar saying they were fearful of going back and had never been asked whether they wanted to return.Myanmar officials, including Myint Thu, the permanent secretary at Myanmar’s ministry of foreign affairs, visited the camps in Cox’s Bazar on Wednesday and were greeted by hundreds of Rohingya protestors who held placards demanding citizenship and security. “We are here to meet with the people from the camps so that I can explain what we have prepared for their return and then I can listen to their voices,” said Myint Thu.Safiullah, who like many other Rohingya uses one name, was among the refugees who met the Burmese members of the Bangladesh-Myanmar joint working group at Kutupalong refugee camp on Wednesday.“The Burmese officials said to us that around 4,600 Rohingya refugees would be taken to Myanmar,” said Safiullah. “The first bunch, around 2,300, would be allowed to return now. The remaining half would return at a later stage, they told me. The returnees have to spend three days in a transit camp inside Rakhine before they are taken to another camp which will be their new home.”He had asked whether the Rohingya would be able to return to their own villages and get back their confiscated land and other properties but “the Burmese officials did not give me an answer”.“I will not return to Myanmar even if the authorities enlist me for repatriation. I am sure this is the view of almost all Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh,” he said.Some observers have described the announcement as politically motivated by the prime minister of Bangladesh, Sheikh Hasina, ahead of the general election which will be held at the end of December. While Bangladesh initially welcomed the refugees fleeing the military crackdown, a year on their presence has become a politically contentious issue, and there is increasing pressure on Hasina to start their repatriation as soon as possible.Suktara Begum, a Rohingya refugee woman who spoke to Myint Thu on his visit to the camps, said: “They came to meet us today simply because of pressure from the international community. They have not taken one step to meet our demands in so many months. They are not serious about our return to our homes. We do not trust them.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Whistleblower faced considerable animosity within the Garda forceThe fire brigade and its ambulance service urge caution as they prepare for busy nightEllen O\u0026rsquoMalley Dunlop chosen as second Fine Gael candidate in Dublin South WestMinister for Sport criticises World Anti-Doping Agency at White House meeting\u0026lsquoI\u0026rsquom not afraid of ye . . .

File photograph: Alan Betson  The Fine Gael’s decision to nominate Ellen O’Malley Dunlop as its second candidate in Dublin South West will be seen as the party targeting the seat of Minister for Children Katherine Zappone.Ms O’Malley Dunlop is chair of the National Women’s Council of Ireland and previously spent ten years as CEO of the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre.She was added to the constituency ticket on Tuesday night at a meeting of Fine Gael’s Executive Council. Her running mate is sitting TD Colm Brophy.Ms Zappone, who is an Independent Deputy, won the last seat in the five-seat constituency by a margin of only 148 votes in the 2016 election, beating the second Fine Gael candidate Anne-Marie Dermody in the 16th count.While Ms Dermody received 1,750 more first preferences than Ms Zappone, the then senator attracted far more lower preferences in subsequent counts, overtaking the Fine Gael candidate in the final count.Besides Mr Brophy and Ms Zappone, the other three sitting TDs are Paul Murphy of Solidarity (Socialist Party) John Lahart of Fianna Fáil and Sean Crowe of Sinn Féin.Fine Gael strategists believe if they are to gain a second seat in the constituency Ms Zappone, as a Government minister, might not attract the same volume of transfers she did in 2016. However, against that her national profile has increased substantially and she is well regarded in her portfolio.Ms O’Malley Dunlop has very strong credentials as a campaigner against sexual, and gender-based, violence. She has also been on the boards of the Legal Aid Board and with Gaisce (the President’s youth awards).She said if elected she would continue to work for legislative reform for women’s and victims’ rights.“I also want Ireland to have a robust 21st century mental health service and I have a range of suggestions to improve services including the expansion of counselling and psychotherapy services.“I look forward to getting out and about in the constituency to meet the people of Dublin South West and discuss my proposals with them.”Mr Brophy said: “I am delighted to have Ellen on board as my running mate in Dublin South West. I know she will add a lot to the Fine Gael ticket here with her immense experience of public service.“Securing two seats in Dublin South West will enable us to further that work so that we can continue to improve people’s standards of living and access to new opportunities. We will be working together with that goal and objective clearly in mind.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3681819.1541005740!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ross tells us forum wada has been soft on russian doping","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Sport Shane Ross has criticised the decision of the World Anti-Doping Agency to readmit Russia to the organisation. Photograph: Alan Betson  The Minister for Sport Shane Ross has criticised the decision of the World Anti-Doping Agency to readmit Russia to the organisation, as he attended an anti-doping forum in the White House on Tuesday.Mr Ross, who was accompanied by the head of Sport Ireland, John Treacy, said that several “big-hitting countries” like Britain, the United States, Australia and New Zealand were aligned with Ireland on the issue and “are absolutely determined that this abuse, this misuse of drugs, this systemized use of drugs should not go on.”Ireland was invited to attend the forum organised by the White House on reforming the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), which was established in 1999 to promote drug-free sport.It follows the controversial decision last month by the agency to lift a three-year ban on Russia’s anti-doping agency which had been imposed after a scandal involving state-sponsored doping.Asked if he was concerned about Ireland’s own reputation on the world stage following doping scandals, Mr Ross replied: “No.”“We’re very very proud of the fact of what Ireland has done in terms of anti-doping — unashamedly and with a great deal of bravery found people guilty of taking drugs and have taken the requisite action. There are lots of high profile cases in Ireland on this and I think we’re very proud of that and we’d like other nations to follow our example.”But he harshly criticised Wada for readmitting Russia.“We’re here to make sure that we make it clear that the Irish Government is disappointed as is Sport Ireland with the decision to readmit Russia to the nations which are accepted as being against drugs,” he said.“Wada has been soft on readmitting Russia and has betrayed its own principles on this.”In particular, Mr Ross said that athletes in Ireland and across the world had been “completely let down” and he criticised the absence of athletes on the board of the agency.“The Wada board is compromised in a way that we find totally unacceptable. It contains far too few independent people who can make independent judgment on the Russian position, and all the independent judgments that have been made are that the Russians will have to comply fully and they should not be admitted unless they do comply.”In a joint statement issued after Tuesday’s White House forum the group of eight countries called for widespread reform of the agency. Noting that confidence in clean sport was at an “all-time low,” it said that there was “widespread disillusionment” with how the Russian doping scandal was handled.“Athletes and sports fans across the globe have lost confidence in the commitment, resolve and willingness of Wada to stand up for the ideals on which it was founded.”The statement called on Wada to run an “open and transparent process” regarding the anti-doping samples that are being collected from Russia and must be submitted before December 31st.Tuesday’s forum in Washington is the latest international effort to stand up to the World Anti-Doping Agency amid widespread unease about the way it handled the Russian doping scandal.Earlier this week in Paris the head of 18 anti-doping agencies, including Ireland’s John Treacy, held an emergency summit and condemned the recent Wada decision to readmit Russia. They also endorsed suggestions that the Wada’s executive board should be overhauled.Russia was found guilty of a massive system of state-backed doping activity in 2015, leading to its suspension from the agency. Russia’s own anti-doping agency based in Moscow was decertified. The IAAF, the world athletics’ governing body, also banned Russia’s track and field athletes from competing in international competitions following the scandal."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3681402.1540978921!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"george osborne we made mistakes before brexit vote","story":"Appearing on BBC’s Newsnight, former Conservative UK chancellor George Osborne said that mistakes were made by his party in the run-up to the Brexit vote. Video: BBCNewsnight Former UK chancellor George Osborne has said mistakes by the British government during his time in office “opened up the door” in the EU referendum.Appearing on BBC’s Newsnight on Tuesday, Mr Osborne admitted the Conservative Party “did get things wrong” in the lead-up to the Brexit vote.Remain supporters had been “too late in the day” in explaining the benefits of EU membership, he said, while not enough had been made of the value of immigration.He told the programme: “I think we were wrong to play into the debate that everything that Brussels did was a challenge and a battle and was wrong.“On immigration we were promising targets that we couldn’t deliver and that then led to a debate about how you might deliver those targets . . . we definitely contributed to that argument.”He added: “It opened up the door in the referendum . . . essentially it allowed in the referendum, a minority of people who were interested in rather esoteric issues of sort of constitutional sovereignty.“We allowed that kind of minority concern of constitutional sovereignty to be linked to immigration control and that was pretty lethal in that referendum debate.”But Mr Osborne, who is now the editor of the London Evening Standard newspaper, said he had worked hard “in the national interest” during his time in office in the face of a hung parliament and faced with the “gigantic financial crash”.“Ultimately the country grew and jobs were created and we avoided the calamitous situation that a lot of European countries found themselves in this period,” he said. –

us champions trade aid race invest africa","story":"The new US embassy in LondonAmerica looks set to unveil a new trade-oriented Africa policy which will champion US corporate investment over conventional development aid.The move reflects concern in Washington that the west risks being outgunned by China in terms of direct investment on the rapidly developing continent.While the US remains the single biggest investor in Africa by some margin, China is catching up fast has become dominant in the area of large scale infrastructure.London and Paris, with which Washington is working closely, have both said they will increase direct investment in Africa in recent months.Speaking in London, Mr Tibor Nagy, the newly appointed US assistant secretary of state for African affairs, said he had become frustrated with the way some African countries had become dependent on aid and that US policy would now seek to promote a “journey to self reliance”.“There is not enough development money in the world to lead Africa to development but there is certainly enough foreign direct investment to do the same thing”, he said.President Donald Trump recently approved the Better Utilisation of Investments Leading to Development Act (Build), legislation that will double, to $60 billion, funds for promoting US corporate investment in Africa.Following China\u0027s lead, the Act will also enable a newly created US government agency to take a direct equity stake of its own in development projects in Africa for the first time.Defusing the \u0026#039demographic timebomb\u0026#039 | Global population issuesCritics say that while the move is welcome the sums involved are not enough and are still dwarfed by new Chinese investment planned for Africa.Mr Nagy, an old Africa hand whose triplets were the first to be born in Zimbabwe after its independence in 1980, said the next 30 years would be pivotal for Africa as its population was set to nearly double to 2.5 billion by 2050.“There will be millions and millions of young people”, he said.Addressing the challenge posed by China in Africa, Mr Nagy said it would be wrong to cast it in the same good-guy-bad-guy light that characterised much western investment there during the cold war investment that fueled conflict and sowed the seeds of continent’s later debt crisis.“I certainly can’t blame African states that there are so many Chinese companies involved there”, he said. “When there was a knock on the door and they opened it, it was only the Chinese that were standing there.“I’d like to make sure that the next time there is a knock on the door it is more than the Chinese standing there… I would like to see US companies standing there.”Nevertheless, Mr Nagy said China’s lending to Africa could threaten a new debt trap one that could result in countries having to surrender strategic assets such as ports and airports to China unless they were able to keep up repayments.He also made clear the US would not hide its light under a bushel when it came to promoting the merits of US corporate investment over Chinese competition in Africa.“Our companies maintain different standards”, he said, “different labour standards, different environmental standards.“The trees don\u0027t disappear. The wildlife does not disappear. And everybody beyond the rank of turning a shovel doesn\u0027t come from the US to do that job... Oh, and by the way, we don\u0027t leave the country billions of dollars in debt.”Newsletter promotion - global health security - end of article Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Essex seaside village outraged after being used in pro-Trump campaign advertRelatives of Saudi Arabian sisters found in New York City river reject suicide suggestionPatients left at risk of blindness amid NHS waiting list backlogs British aid being taken for granted in Africa, suggests Jeremy HuntComment: Asia Bibi is free -

And in that respect at least the Royal Family were no different to everyone else.As if to emphasise how the war devastated so many households across the British Isles the Duchess of Cambridge on Wednesday heard in detail for the first time how three of her great-great-uncles met the same tragic fate which befell millions of young men between 1914-1918.During a visit to the Imperial War Museum she learnt how Francis, Maurice and Lionel Lupton were killed on the Western Front within two years of each other, reading for herself some of the letters and postcards the three sent home before their deaths.Among the documents was also one of the official telegrams breaking the news that one of them had been killed.“It’s so strange to see them,” she said.The Duchess of Cambridge, visits the Imperial War Museum to view letters relating to the three brothers of her great-grandmother, all of whom fought and died in the First World WarOne of the letters she spent time reading was that written by Maurice on May 24, 1915, less than a month before he was killed. In it, with a typical serviceman’s humour, he asks his father to send him supplements to his meagre rations.“Weekly China tea would be acceptable, as the govt. Tea is the limit - very bitter - though it be treason to say so,” he wrote.Her great-great-uncle’s words clearly left the Duchess deeply moved.“What really struck me was the positivity - they are writing home with such positivity,” she said. “It is a side you don’t really see reflected.”The three brothers were the sons of her great-great-grandfather Francis Lupton. Their sister Olive, the Duchess’s great-grandmother, worked with the Voluntary Aid Detachment of the British Red Cross.Left: Lieutenant Lionel Martineau Lupton, killed by shellfire in 1916 at the Battle of the Somme, at the age of 24.

Bottom right: Captain Maurice Lupton, one of the Duchess of Cambridge\u0026#39s three great-great-uncles killed in WWI In recognition that the family had suffered a particularly terrible blow in losing three of its sons, the Keeper of the Privy Purse wrote on behalf of King George V to their parents, Harriett and Francis Lupton, from Buckingham Palace.As the director-general of the museum, Diane Lees, showed her the palace missive, she said to the Duchess: “You might recognise the address.”The letter, an unusual honour even at a time when so many families were suffering multiple casualties, stated: “I am commanded by the King to convey to you His Majesty’s deep feeling of sympathy with you in the fresh bereavement which has befallen you by the death in battle of your gallant son Major F.A. Lupton.“The King realises that this is the third beloved son you have given in your Country’s cause, and His Majesty trusts that you may be granted strength and comfort in the further sorrow which you have been called upon to bear.”The Duchess looks at a huge poppy installation outside the Imperial War MuseumThe first of the three brothers to be killed was Captain Maurice Lupton, who served with the 7th Bn West Yorkshire Regiment. He was shot by a sniper ion June 19, 1915, aged 28.Major Francis Lupton, the eldest brother, served with the 8th Bn West Yorkshire Regiment and was killed by shellfire on February 19, 1917, aged 31. He had only been married to his wife Dorothy Winifred Davison for three years.Lieutenant Lionel Lupton, who served with the 28th Brigade Royal Field Artillery, was killed by shellfire in 1916 at the Battle of the Somme, at the age of 24.The Duchess of Cambridge views letters relating to the three brothers of her great-grandmotherAnthony Richards, the museum’s head of documents, who showed the Duchess the letters and cards, said she had been deeply touched by seeing the originals of the documents.“It was the combination of seeing the actual letters and the portrait photographs of them. It sort of brings it home to you,” he said.“She had heard about the letters before, and had read the content, but she was handling the letters themselves and she found that a very special moment.

I think Friedrich Merz is the most likely to do this,” Wolfgang Bosbach, a prominent former CDU MP said.“He has the potential to give the party a clear profile again,” said Alexander Mitsch, the head of a conservative group within the CDU said.But with the party’s powerful regional associations yet to decide who they will support, and other possible candidates still to declare whether they will stand, the race remains open.Please review our commenting policyEssex seaside village outraged after being used in pro-Trump campaign advertRelatives of Saudi Arabian sisters found in New York City river reject suicide suggestionPatients left at risk of blindness amid NHS waiting list backlogs British aid being taken for granted in Africa, suggests Jeremy HuntComment: Asia Bibi is free - but the battle to wrest Pakistan from the extremists has only just begunItaly\u0026#39s populist government plans to reward fertile families with state land in bid to boost birth rateJeremy Corbyn says he will \u0026#39claw back\u0026#39 income tax cuts from better off amid mounting rebellionUS charges 10 Chinese spies with hacking aerospace firms to steal engineering secretsDutch police return to pavement-pounding in fight against terrorism Comment: We could all take a lesson from the Neanderthal school of correct posture and deportmentBrexit latest: Ireland warns UK must compromise by next week for a deal to be doneCatherine, Duchess of Cambridge reads first hand her family\u0026#39s poignant WWI storyComment: We police are at crisis point, and Sajid Javid\u0026#39s solutions are disappointingly sub-optimalAustria rejects UN migration pact to \u0026#39defend national sovereignty\u0026#39Chunky chips falling off the menu after summer weather produces small potato cropEight in 10 eligible couples taking £1,190 marriage allowance despite rocky launch17-year-old killed in suicide attack on regional headquarters of Russia\u0026#39s FSBBaby-faced criminal who bragged about joyriding in Rolls Royce photo and terrorised community is jailedBritain will face \u0026#39retaliatory\u0026#39 action from US over its new \u0026#39Amazon tax\u0026#39, senior Republican warnsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000140439032_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"parliament accused conflict interest rejects nda debate","story":"John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, refused to allow Maria Miller to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerfulHouse of CommonsMaria Miller, the Tory MP, last night accused Parliament of a conflict of interest over Britain\u0027s MeToo scandal after it emerged she had been blocked from questioning the Government over it.The Daily  can reveal John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, yesterday refused to allow Ms Miller, who chairs the women \u0026amp equalities Commons select committee, to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerful, including the Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green.Helen Jones, chairman of the petitions select committee, also rejected calls to allow a parliamentary debate on non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) after two separate petitions demanding a change to the law between them secured 250,000 signatures. It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

It came less than a year after the pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto detailed the cryptocurrency in a paper titled \u0027Bitcoin: A peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System\u002728 Bitcoin is used as a currency for the first timeOn 22 May, 2010, the first ever real-world bitcoin transaction took place. Lazlo Hanyecz bought two pizzas for 10,000 bitcoins – the equivalent of $90 million at today\u0027s prices 38 Silk Road opens for businessBitcoin soon gained notoriety for its use on the dark web. The Silk Road marketplace, established in 2011, was the first of hundreds of sites to offer illegal drugs and services in exchange for bitcoin48 The first bitcoin ATM appearsOn 29 October, 2013, the first ever bitcoin ATM was installed in a coffee shop in Vancouver, Canada. The machine allowed people to exchange bitcoins for cash58 The fall of MtGoxThe world\u0027s biggest bitcoin exchange, MtGox, filed for bankruptcy in February 2014 after losing almost 750,000 of its customers bitcoins. At the time, this was around 7 per cent of all bitcoins and the market inevitably crashed68 Would the real Satoshi Nakamoto please stand upIn 2015, Australian police raided the home of Craig Wright after the entrepreneur claimed he was Satoshi Nakamoto. He later rescinded the claimOn 1 August, 2017, an unresolvable dispute within the bitcoin community saw the network split. The fork of bitcoin\u0027s underlying blockchain technology spawned a new cryptocurrency: Bitcoin cashTowards the end of 2017, the price of bitcoin surged to almost $20,000. This represented a 1,300 per cent increase from its price at the start of the yearWhile bitcoin has taken off and is seen as the leader of the cryptocurrency market, it’s been adopted by the few not the many, said Chakib Bouda, chief technology officer at US-based payments firm Rambus.Confusion amongst users has played a part, but arguably the biggest failings for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies over the past years lies with security, in the first six months of 2018 alone over $761 million bitcoin was stolen, with experts predicting that the amount stolen from exchanges will top $1.5 billion by the end of the year.The key to overcoming this issues, Bouda\u0026nbspsuggested, is keeping the private keys needed to access and use cryptocurrency funds both secure and easy-to-use.\u0026nbsp One way of doing this would be adopting technology used within the traditional financial sector to bring cryptocurrencies up to the levels of security and usability that people expect of a modern currency.Once this secure ecosystem is in place, it’s going to transform how many sceptics view bitcoin transactions, Bouda said. So whilst cryptocurrencies like bitcoin have been described as the ‘Wild West’ by the UK treasury, we expect in 10 years’ time, bitcoin will become mainstream and have a remarkably different reputation.If bitcoin is able to transform its reputation in this way, bitcoin could find its way into everyone\u0027s pockets through mobile wallets –achieving\u0026nbspmainstream adoption\u0026nbspin time for bitcoin\u0027s next\u0026nbspbirthday.It\u0027s a view shared by Iqbal Gandham, the UK managing director of the online trading platform eToro. The next decade could see bitcoin being accepted as the norm when it comes to money transfer and payments, he said. As with any startup idea, early days are always risky, but I feel these are now few and far between.Alternatively, if another cryptocurrency is able to become a safe and\u0026nbspconvenient payment method\u0026nbspbefore bitcoin developers implement the necessary technology, bitcoin\u0027s place as the world\u0027s most popular cryptocurrency could be usurped.This is the view of Nigel Green, founder and CEO of the deVere\u0026nbspGroup, a financial consultancy firm based in London. Mr Green suggested that bitcoin\u0027s influence will drastically reduce in the cryptocurrency sector, however the overall crypto market will expand by at least 5,000 per cent.“Bitcoin is what kickstarted the crypto revolution and it has changed the way the world handles money, makes transactions, does business, and manages assets, amongst other things, forever.\u0026nbsp It all began with bitcoin, Mr Green said.\u0026nbsp“However, whilst I don’t wish to rain on anyone’s parade, I believe that\u0026nbspbitcoin’s influence and dominance of the cryptocurrency sector will drastically reduce in its second decade.\u0026nbspThis is because as mass adoption of cryptocurrency grows, more and more digital assets will be launched – by organisations in both the private and the public sectors. This will increase competition for bitcoin and dent its market share.He continued: “In addition, it is likely that bitcoin will be hit by the superior technology, features, and problem-solutions, offered by existing and yet-to-be-released cryptocurrencies.”If the deVere\u0026nbspCEO\u0027s forecast is correct, the boost from\u0026nbspmajor institutional and retail investors will see the cryptocurrency market rocket towards\u0026nbspthe $20 trillion mark by 2028.Financial institutions and regulators, amongst others, understand that cryptocurrencies are the future of money, he concluded.\u0026nbsp“As such, the market will have grown beyond recognition when bitcoin celebrates its 20th anniversary.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

There’s nothing up my sleeve,” he told journalists.“Goldman Sachs came to see me about Brexit. I met people like\u0026nbspSchroders, because of their influence on shareholders. I’ve been meeting with some pension funds themselves – a whole range of people.”“For me a lot of it is listening to their ideas and long term plans. I say, ‘come in and advise us.

If there’s another way that’s more pragmatic we’ll do it.’”Mr McDonnell, who once listed one of his interests as “generally fermenting the overthrow of capitalism”, argued that Labour was offering more certainty to businesses than the Conservatives, whose policy of leaving the single market and customs union and countenancing of a “no-deal”\u0026nbspoutcome is a source of profound concern for business.“What they’re not getting back from the Government is certainty about Brexit – but also certainty about where the Government is going on a number of inidual domestic policies as well,” he said.Despite Mr McDonnell’s attempts to build bridges, Labour\u0026nbsphas had an extremely\u0026nbspfractious relationship with business.Last year the CBI’s director general said that the party’s nationalisation agenda and suggestion that existing PFI contrasts could be simply torn up would “send investors running for the hills”.And the party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, took pride 12 months ago when an analyst at the Wall Street bank, Morgan Stanley, said a Labour government was a risk to investors.“When they say we’re a threat, they’re right. We’re a threat to a damaging and failing system that’s rigged for the few,” Mr Corbyn said in a social media video message.Earlier that year, Mr McDonnell said Labour had a “scenario plan” for a run on the pound in the immediate wake of a Labour election victory, although he added that he did not think a currency collapse was likely.Asked about the possibility of Labour supporting a second referendum on Wednesday, Mr McDonnell said that Labour would push first for a general election.\u0026nbsp“If they won’t give us a general election, yes, there’s a potential for another vote and Parliament will decide what’s on that ballot paper. But there’s a lot of stages to go before that. We think there’s a deal to be had if the Government sensibly negotiates.”Mr McDonnell’s meeting took place at the headquarters of the global media group Bloomberg, close to the Bank of England.

The Financial Conduct Authority said it is concerned that general insurance pricing practices “have the potential to cause harm to consumers, particularly those who are vulnerable”.The watchdog said supervisory work on home insurance had uncovered a number of issues that “could cause harm to customers”, including\u0026nbspfirms failing to have appropriate or clear pricing strategies, governance and controls.Banks and insurers must plan for climate change risks, says BoEStudents targeted by ‘ghost brokers’ selling fake car insuranceInsurers criticised for failing mental health sufferersAndrew Bailey, the FCA’s chief executive, said: “Our initial work has identified a number of areas of potential consumer harm. We want to make sure that general insurance markets deliver competitive and fair prices for all consumers. “This market study will help us examine the outcomes from general insurance pricing practices and inform how, if necessary, we should intervene to improve the market.“If change is needed to make the market work well for consumers, we will consider all possible remedies to achieve this.”Gareth Shaw,\u0026nbspmoney expert at Which?, said: “This review is long overdue. For years, loyal policyholders have been exploited by insurance providers, punished by excessive premiums, and have had to battle with unclear pricing that makes it difficult for people to understand whether or not they’re getting a fair deal. “Customers who prefer to stay with one provider are at risk of being hit with vastly overpriced premiums when little has changed in the service they receive. It’s right that the regulator tackles this sector to ensure customers aren’t punished for their loyalty and that pricing is clear and transparent across the industry.”Georgie Frost, consumer advocate at GoCompare, said the investigation was welcome “because clearly something isn’t right and people feel they are being ripped off”. \u0026nbsp“Clearer rules and regulations will be better for everyone because we can’t have a system where it is the most vulnerable that are the hardest hit,” she said.“Equally, some people who can switch aren’t doing so and we need to find out why and make sure they are fully engaged.“The ‘tease and squeeze’ approach to pricing is the go-to tactic in many industries, including car and home insurance. New customers are enticed with a competitive price and then, if they don’t shop around and switch, they face often stealthy – sometimes blatant – premium increases in subsequent years.“It’s imperative that people keep shopping around and switching to avoid getting ripped off, but more also needs to be done to make it clearer how customers can switch.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The group posted an 8 per cent decline in retail sales, against a 12.7 per cent increase in online sales. In the year to date, total sales are up 3.7 per cent, Next said, with online rising by 14.8 per cent and\u0026nbspretail falling\u0026nbsp6.3 per cent. Death of the high street? Closures and cuts paint grim scene for 2018Next says post-Brexit border delays pose biggest threat to business Expectations vs reality: Women share their online shopping disastersThe company said it still expects sales growth of 3 per cent for the whole year and is forecast to report annual pre-tax profit of £727m, a 0.1 per cent increase on last year. However, shares dropped almost 5 per cent in early trading on Wednesday as sales growth slowed in the third quarter. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, put this decline down to the warmer weather in the first half of the year, which boosted trading at Next. “More recently, an Indian summer stretching into October will have pushed back the need for scarves and mittens,” he said.\u0026nbsp“Nonetheless Next still remains on track to deliver its projected profits for this year.”Mr Khalaf added: “With Christmas on the horizon we’re now approaching a crunch time for UK retailers, and in January’s trading statements we’ll get a good gauge of UK consumer appetite, and a roll call of winners and losers on the UK high street.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

She called on the government to introduce a compulsory register for children who are in home education, warning that\u0026nbspsome parents use home education as a “guise” for illegal schools.Ms Spielman also acknowledged that cuts to further education funding have affected the quality of the provision\u0026nbspand she called on the government to increase spending on the post-16 sector.However on schools funding, she wrote that while “funding is a major topic of concern in the sector ... inspectors are not seeing an impact on education standards”.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Protesters block Parliament Square in London as the environmental group Extinction Rebellion launches a mass civil disobedience campaign demanding action on climate changeBritish Prime Minister Theresa May, right, listens to Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg, center, flanked by Lithuania\u0027s Health Minister, Aurelijus Veryga at the Oslo Cancer Cluster for a summit to discuss the role of health technology.

And there have been reports that some students stopped\u0026nbspgoing to school once they secured a guaranteed place.\u0026nbspIn an\u0026nbspinterview with The Independent earlier this year, Clare Marchant, head of the universities and colleges admissions service (Ucas), called for an urgent rethink of the practise.\u0026nbspMatt\u0026nbspWaddup, head of policy and campaigns at\u0026nbspthe University and College Union (UCU), said: The decision by St Mary’s demonstrates the desperate need to overhaul our failing admissions system.We are alone in the world in persisting with a system where students are offered university places based on highly inaccurate predicted grades.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Protesters block Parliament Square in London as the environmental group Extinction Rebellion launches a mass civil disobedience campaign demanding action on climate changeBritish Prime Minister Theresa May, right, listens to Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg, center, flanked by Lithuania\u0027s Health Minister, Aurelijus Veryga at the Oslo Cancer Cluster for a summit to discuss the role of health technology.

The Financial Conduct Authority said it is concerned that general insurance pricing practices “have the potential to cause harm to consumers, particularly those who are vulnerable”.The watchdog said supervisory work on home insurance had uncovered a number of issues that “could cause harm to customers”, including\u0026nbspfirms failing to have appropriate or clear pricing strategies, governance and controls.Banks and insurers must plan for climate change risks, says BoEStudents targeted by ‘ghost brokers’ selling fake car insuranceInsurers criticised for failing mental health sufferersAndrew Bailey, the FCA’s chief executive, said: “Our initial work has identified a number of areas of potential consumer harm. We want to make sure that general insurance markets deliver competitive and fair prices for all consumers. “This market study will help us examine the outcomes from general insurance pricing practices and inform how, if necessary, we should intervene to improve the market.“If change is needed to make the market work well for consumers, we will consider all possible remedies to achieve this.”Gareth Shaw,\u0026nbspmoney expert at Which?, said: “This review is long overdue. For years, loyal policyholders have been exploited by insurance providers, punished by excessive premiums, and have had to battle with unclear pricing that makes it difficult for people to understand whether or not they’re getting a fair deal. “Customers who prefer to stay with one provider are at risk of being hit with vastly overpriced premiums when little has changed in the service they receive. It’s right that the regulator tackles this sector to ensure customers aren’t punished for their loyalty and that pricing is clear and transparent across the industry.”Georgie Frost, consumer advocate at GoCompare, said the investigation was welcome “because clearly something isn’t right and people feel they are being ripped off”. \u0026nbsp“Clearer rules and regulations will be better for everyone because we can’t have a system where it is the most vulnerable that are the hardest hit,” she said.“Equally, some people who can switch aren’t doing so and we need to find out why and make sure they are fully engaged.“The ‘tease and squeeze’ approach to pricing is the go-to tactic in many industries, including car and home insurance. New customers are enticed with a competitive price and then, if they don’t shop around and switch, they face often stealthy – sometimes blatant – premium increases in subsequent years.“It’s imperative that people keep shopping around and switching to avoid getting ripped off, but more also needs to be done to make it clearer how customers can switch.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The Pencil gets the biggest redesign, with a new shape, a button that can be used to change settings by pressing the side of the stylus, and magnets that allow it to clip onto the top of the tablet and charge as it does so.Live updates as Apple reveals whole suite of new productsThe new iPad Pro comes in two sizes. The smaller 11-inch takes up the same size as the existing 10.50-inch, using the extra space from the smaller bezels to pack in a bigger display the bigger 12.9-inch is the same screen size but has been reduced overall.Inside, it includes Apple\u0027s latest A12X bionic chip, which is an upgraded version of the processor in the iPhone XS and XR. It said that and other upgrades allow the new Pro to rival the Xbox One S for gaming performance, which it displayed by showing the latest version of the NBA 2K series.As well as those changes, Apple also swapped out the Lightning port that has traditionally been on the bottom of the iPad. In its place comes a USB-C port, which means that the tablet can be plugged into accessories like cameras or musical equipment – as well as charging the iPhone.The new iPads are available to order now, ahead of their full release on 7 November. The smaller one costs $769 or the same number of pounds, and the bigger one is $969.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The best news today that Channel4’s national HQ will be in #Leeds. THANK YOU so much to all involved in this brilliant pitch, from Bradford, York and LeedsCityRegion to screenyorkshire truenorth and allinleeds! #allinleeds #4sparks.”\u0026nbspJeremy Wright, the culture secretary, said: “The Government made clear that Channel 4 needed to do more to increase its presence in the regions to help better reflect and provide for UK audiences outside of London.“Congratulations to Leeds, Bristol and Glasgow, and I look forward to Channel 4 taking further steps to increase its impact around the UK in the years ahead.”Some 300 Channel 4 jobs, including key creative decision-makers with significant spending power, will be based in the hubs outside of the capital.It has also been decided that a major new Channel 4 News hub will be established in Leeds as the new building will include a studio with the capability to regularly co-anchor the programme.The new national HQ has been described as “a broad-based centre”, which will include commissioning, production and digital content.The creative hubs will begin with a focus on programme commissioning, but will welcome a broader talent base later on.Alex Mahon, Channel 4’s chief executive, said:\u0026nbsp”Diversity and inclusion have always been at the heart of Channel 4’s mission and the launch of our 4 All the UK plan is the biggest and most exciting change in the organisation’s 35-year history – as we open up Channel 4 to people from across the UK and supercharge the impact we have in all parts of the country.“We will be spending up to £250m more on programming produced in the Nations and Regions and to catalyse that spend I’m delighted to confirm that we will be establishing a new National HQ in Leeds and new Creative Hubs in Bristol and Glasgow.“We undertook a rigorous process over the last seven months and the high calibre of all the pitches meant those were incredibly difficult decisions to make.“However, I know that Leeds, Bristol and Glasgow will best deliver our objectives to grow the production sector across the UK, build the pipeline of creative talent outside London and support our increased investment in programming produced across the Nations and Regions.“Leeds put forward a compelling and ambitious strategy for how they could work alongside Channel 4 to further build the strong independent production sector in the city and develop new erse talent from across the region.“Locating our National HQ in Leeds enables us to capitalise on a strong and fast-growing independent production sector in cities across the North of England – and also has the potential to unlock growth in the North East and East of the country, an area without a major presence from other national broadcasters.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The group posted an 8 per cent decline in retail sales, against a 12.7 per cent increase in online sales. In the year to date, total sales are up 3.7 per cent, Next said, with online rising by 14.8 per cent and\u0026nbspretail falling\u0026nbsp6.3 per cent. Death of the high street? Closures and cuts paint grim scene for 2018Next says post-Brexit border delays pose biggest threat to business Expectations vs reality: Women share their online shopping disastersThe company said it still expects sales growth of 3 per cent for the whole year and is forecast to report annual pre-tax profit of £727m, a 0.1 per cent increase on last year. However, shares dropped almost 5 per cent in early trading on Wednesday as sales growth slowed in the third quarter. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, put this decline down to the warmer weather in the first half of the year, which boosted trading at Next. “More recently, an Indian summer stretching into October will have pushed back the need for scarves and mittens,” he said.\u0026nbsp“Nonetheless Next still remains on track to deliver its projected profits for this year.”Mr Khalaf added: “With Christmas on the horizon we’re now approaching a crunch time for UK retailers, and in January’s trading statements we’ll get a good gauge of UK consumer appetite, and a roll call of winners and losers on the UK high street.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Water ice clouds condense over the summit of the volcano, known as Asia Mons, and can be spotted spreading across the surface.Nasa Kepler Space Telescope dies after running out of fuelThe images were collected by the European Space Agency\u0027s\u0026nbspMars Express craft. They were first spotted in late September and have been tracked throughout October, allowing for hundreds of pictures.The white cloud stretches 1,500km over the surface of the planet – far bigger than the volcano itself – making it easy to see in images sent back from the spacecraft.Usually, the clouds disappear around this kind of year. Mars had its winter solstice on 16 October, and the clouds usually go before that.But a water ice cloud in this region has occurred at a similar time of year before, scientists say.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

And there are plenty of clothes offerings too, including an anorak in black and orange, T-shirts, hoodies and a bag.The collection will be available on 2 November at Vans stores and on its website.It is far from the first time that Nasa has joined up with design companies to create consumer products: earlier this year, it worked with streetwear designer Heron Preston to create a 60th anniversary collection, and even made homeware\u0026nbspwith Ikea. Numerous fashion companies have recently borrowed from Nasa\u0027s\u0026nbsphistory of design to create space-inspired clothes.Nasa Kepler Space Telescope dies after running out of fuelThe agency also makes its own clothes, which sell at the visitor centres at its facilities and online.And the space agency has even suggested that its collaborations with brands could go the other way, too. As it continues to look for sources of funding, Nasa\u0026nbspadministration Jim Bridenstine\u0026nbsphas even suggested that the agency could open itself up to product placement – a decision that some suggested could lead to rockets with brands\u0027 logos on their side, for instance.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

There has been a dramatic reduction in words like gr8, b4 and sry, while their full versions have significantly increased.Twitter says it could get rid of the Like button entirelyAnd those posts tend to be more conversational. The number of tweets with question marks have increased by 30 per cent and replies have also grown.Still, most tweets don\u0027t actually use up the full limit. Only 12 per cent of posts go longer than the previous limit of 140 characters, and only 1 per cent of them take up the full 280.Still many of the site\u0027s users disagreed with the sense that things had become better on the site. When Twitter co-founder Biz Stone tweeted out the statistics, explaining that the 140 limit was introduced by CEO Jack Dorsey\u0026nbspafter he had pointed out it was inconsistent, he was hit with a flurry of posts pointing out the problems that continue to blight the site.Cool! Now you should turn to Jack and tell him people are harassed daily on your site, TOS is unevenly enforced, and people are actually making good on threats of physical violence, wrote one user.\u0026nbspThen urge him to update the code. Please, thank you!The post has since received 1,000 other replies, largely pointing out problems with the service.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

We know the UK government has started making such plans as a result of the growing demand for such a vote, demonstrated by last weekend’s march.“The EU should do the same, because MPs who back the People’s Vote are fast forming the biggest and most cohesive bloc in Westminster.”UK-EU transport links after Brexit ‘increasingly a cause for concern’MPs ‘far more likely to reject Brexit deal’ if unable to amend itPound sterling falls to six-week low as Theresa May faces Brexit backlPlaid Cymru Westminster group leader Liz Saville Roberts, who also met with Mr Barnier, said she had used the meeting to push for an extension to the negotiation period to accommodate a referendum.“I pressed Michel Barnier on protecting Wales’s interest through the extension of Article 50 and a People’s Vote,” she said.“In Westminster, with the prime minister’s proposals amounting to nothing more than a mix of fudge and fantasy, a People’s Vote is more likely than ever.”The EU has previously reacted cooly to suggestions that the period could be extended, but has not ruled it out. An extension would require the unanimous approval of all 28 EU leaders on the European Council.\u0026nbspSadiq Khan visited Brussels on Friday\u0026nbsp(Getty)Brussels is particularly wary about extending the transition into May, when Britain would have to take part in the next European Parliament elections if it was still in the EU.Mr Khan, speaking after a separate meeting on Friday, said: “The point I made to Michel Barnier, really quite forcefully, is that there is a possibility of the British parliament rejecting the deal that Mrs May secures from the EU.Created with Sketch.Brexit march for a final say – in pictures Show all 65Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Red smoke from a canister hangs in the air as around 100,000 demonstrators march through London during a People\u0027s Vote anti-brexit demonstration savings banners and placardsMayor of London Sadiq Khan takes part in the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.MP Chuka Umunna (left) and MP Vince Cable (right) as MP Anna Soubry (centre) addresses Anti-Brexit campaigners at a rally after the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.

The 21 November was the date offered by the chair of the select committee for the secretary of state to give evidence.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Four in five visitors to London come for the culture, and they are drawn by great museums and world class exhibitions. It is also potentially damaging for British influence abroad.”Ahead of the referendum, senior Brexiteers\u0026nbspwarned that leaving the EU\u0026nbspwould not affect the creative industries.In an open letter signed by top Tories such as Boris Johnson, Michael Gove, Dominic Raab, Chris Grayling and Iain Duncan Smith, Vote Leave claimed that funding for cultural organisations would be unaffected by Brexit.Labour former culture secretary Ben Bradshaw\u0026nbspsaid: “The mess created by the Brexit elite in Westminster is now casting a long shadow over the future of our great museums.Created with Sketch.Britain before Brexit: East of England Show all 13Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A couple and their dog relax by the Cathedral’s Labyrinth.

It lasted for over 19 hoursOsborne stuck with public sector pay cap despite child poverty warningFellow guest on the show, writer\u0026nbspPolly Toynbee,\u0026nbspsaid the former Conservative MP\u0026nbspwho oversaw the government’s policy of austerity\u0026nbsphad “done such harm and damage to this country”, branding him “the most right-wing chancellor we have ever had”.The columnist tore into Mr Osborne after Newsnight presenter Evan Davis suggested the former chancellor was “closer to Polly Toynbee’s politics than you are to two-thirds of Conservative Party members”.Ms Toynbee described the\u0026nbspcomparison as “unthinkable”.“This man has done such harm and damage to this country,” she added. “He has been the most right-wing chancellor we have ever had.”The journalist said Mr Osborne had taken billions from Britain’s poorest through benefit cuts “and then abused them with that endless talk about people with their blinds down, trying to make people hate anyone on benefits, despite the fact that the great majority of them are in work, often working in two jobs”.She told the ex-MP: “Your treatment of the poorest people in this country has been despicable.”Asked by Mr Davis if he had any regrets about his time in office, the former chancellor admitted government errors had led to Brexit.“We were wrong to play into the debate that everything that Brussels did was a challenge and a battle and was wrong,” he said.The Conservative government had also set targets on\u0026nbspcutting immigration “that we couldn’t deliver and that then led to a debate about how you might deliver those targets”, he conceded.“We definitely contributed to that argument, didn’t make enough of the value of immigration.”He went on to urge Theresa May’s government not to attempt to compete with Labour on government spending.“The Conservatism I think that works is socially progressive and fiscally conservative – and we lost in the election I wasn’t\u0026nbspinvolved in 2017 because we tried to out-Ukip\u0026nbspUkip,” he said.“We aren’t going to win the next election by trying to out-Corbyn Corbyn.“The Conservatives should stand their ground for what I think still millions of people are, they want a progressive, successful country, you’ve got to live within your means... trying to outspend our political opponents won’t help the Conservatives either.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

That’s when I saw they were completely black, no iris, no white, nothing. I jumped back and grabbed my daughter. When I looked again, the child was gone. It was so strange.”Various paranormal experts have since investigated the area, with the YouTube channel Haunted Finders even managing to capture the ghost on camera in .Cemeteries are creepy places. But in the late s and early s there was an added spookiness to the decaying and decrepit Highgate Cemetery in North London, after numerous people reported sightings of a supernatural being.One was made by British Psychic and Occult Society member David Farrant, who wrote a letter to the Hampstead and Highgate Express claiming that he had seen “a grey figure” in the cemetery Christmas Eve .A handful of people claimed that they had also seen a tall, dark figure, floating behind the railings.These reports caught the interest of another local man Sean Manchester – a real-le vampire hunter – who believed that the ghostly figure was that of a Romanian ‘Vampire of the Undead’ that had been brought to England in the early s.Finally, after  years of hunting, Manchester published a book in which he claimed to have successfully staked, beheaded and burnt the vampire.But with no photo evidence, some believe the vampire could still be out there.While the ghost of the young girl in Cannock Chase ran away from people, there have been reports of ghosts who have attacked people in the UK, too.Greyfriars Cemetery in Edinburgh, Scotland, is home to a number of notable names, including Thomas Riddell – the inspiration Voldemort in JK Rowling’s Harry Potter books.But the cemetery is also home to one resident even more chilling than the Dark Lord himself.Sir George ‘Bluid’ MacKenzie was a th century lawyer who is blamed for the deaths of thousands of men during Charles II’s religious persecution of Presbyterians in Scotland - and his ghost still haunts the area to this day.MacKenzie laid undisturbed for more than  years before his spirit was reportedly first encountered in .A homeless man decided to take shelter in MacKenzie’s final resting place – the Black Mausoleum – on a dark and stormy night when something terrying happened.An ancient coffin allegedly collapsed beneath him, plunging him into a pit containing still decomposing plague victims, and the man ran from the scene covered in dust, startling a passerby that was out walking their dog.It is believed that the incident disturbed the spirit of MacKenzie,  and since then there have been more than  recorded incidents of poltergeist attacks on members of the public there.Volunteer guide Willie Telford told Edinburgh Evening News: “People have been bitten, scratched, kicked, pushed, they get burn marks, they feel sick, they feel cold.And it gets worse.Borley Rectory in Essex is widely regarded as ‘the most haunted house in England’.There have been reports of strange incidents at the Victorian house for decades, including sightings of a ghost nun and a phantom coach driven by two headless horsemen.But things really escalated in , when the resident Reverend Guy Eric Smith contacted a national newspaper to report otherworldly activity, including bells ringing and the sound of footsteps.The paper sent paranormal investigator Harry Price to carry out research, and the activity intensied, with reports including the throwing of vases and stones.The Smiths soon left the property, with the reverend’s we believing that Price had been behind it all. But the strange occurrences continued.Smith’s replacement, Reverend Lionel Algernon Foyster, also recorded incidents including bell-ringing, writing appearing on the wall and even his we, Marianne, being thrown from her bed by a poltergeist.The mystery remained unsolved and the house burnt down in  before being completely demolished five years later.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But I’m happy to tell Sun on Sunday readers that their hard work is paying off.Our jobs market has defied many of the naysayers.Near record numbers of people have a job and unemployment has fallen in every region across the country.There are more than .million additional people in work since .While this is a huge achievement, sometimes it’s easy to forget that behind these numbers are thousands of people up and down our country who are now better able to provide for their families.They can get up every morning knowing they have the security that only a job can bring.And what’s more, they are being rewarded with a pay rise — this month’s figures show the strongest wage growth in almost a decade.Contrary to myths peddled by the opposition, it’s people at the bottom of the pay scale who have benefited most.The lowest earners working full-time have seen the fastest rise in pay thanks to our National Living Wage and the proportion of low-paid jobs is at a record low.Tomorrow I will deliver my Budget, where I will show how our careful focus on fixing the economy is bearing fruit.Thanks to the balanced approach we have taken — getting our debt falling, while keeping taxes low — and the hard work of the people of the UK, I will be able to set out how we will be investing in our future.Much of the talk surrounding Budgets is often technical. Many, many experts and commentators will have their own take on how the economy is doing.While this is, of course, important, what most ordinary people really care about is how the Budget will improve their day-to-day lives.And one of the issues which I know Sun on Sunday readers care a lot about is transport. With a thousand more people moving into work every day, it’s important that we help to get them there on time.Many of you preparing to start the working week tomorrow will know the frustration of having your journey to work ruined by delays caused by poorly maintained roads. Or of having your car or van damaged by potholes.This isn’t just a bad way to start the day, it’s bad for businesses large and small, and it can be really damaging to the wider economy as well.It’s estimated that congestion costs UK households more than £billion every year. That’s why tomorrow I will announce a bumper £billion investment in our country’s transport network — including a new £.billion fund ring-fencing vehicle excise duty raised in England for spending on our roads.As a former Transport Secretary, I know that these are the arteries that keep our country alive – and they need taking care of. Thirty-two years ago tomorrow, Margaret Thatcher officially opened the final stretch of the M.While few would claim to love this motorway, it’s easy to forget what a landmark moment this was for our country’s transport infrastructure. Three decades later, I am committed to honouring that legacy.And as important as our major roads are, smaller local roads are just as vital to our everyday lives.That’s why I will also announce tomorrow £million of immediate cash for councils to maintain and improve local roads — fixing potholes, repairing damaged roads and keeping bridges safe and open.A further £million on top of that will help improve local junctions, allowing better access to workplaces, high streets and other community facilities.This is also part of our commitment to bridging the gap between our regions. Those in rural parts of the country should have the same chances to get on in le and not have poor transport connections limiting their potential.The funding will help make journeys quicker and easier, while boosting productivity and improving access.And because I know that not everyone drives, I will also invest in local transport projects which could include new bus, tram and cycling routes.And I will also look to the future by investing in next-generation methods of transport, which could potentially include self-driving shuttle services.Not only could this revolutionise our transport network, it will also help us become a global leader developing future technologies.And finally, as I earlier announced with the Prime Minister, I am happy to confirm we will also be freezing fuel duty, for the ninth year in a row.This will keep the cost of fuel down for millions of drivers across the UK — saving people around £million this year alone.These measures are only possible due to our careful management of the economy over the past few years — and the hard work of the British people.This country has a bright future ahead, and — thanks to this vital investment package — the journey there just got a bit smoother.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It shows the strength and resilience of the UK economy alongside the efforts and hard work of families and households up and down the country.In conventional times voters might rightly expect the result of this to be lower taxes , more investment in our public services or to see progress in us paying off the ever ballooning national debt.Instead the Government is preparing to blow this cash - your money - by giving into even more of the EU’s demands.Until last week, Britain expected a  month “transition” or “implementation” period after we formally leave the EU next year on March , .Then, late last week the Government shocked everyone by proposing that we stay in the EU longer than we were originally told and that we extend the so called ‘negotiating period’ to leave the EU.Worse still, on Monday in the House of Commons, we were told that this transition period might last until June  – that’s six years after the referendum result. Whatever happened to Brexit means Brexit On top of our extended membership of the EU, we can expect a bill from the EU! That’s right more of your money with an extra price tag of approximately £ billion each year in contributions to the EU.The Treasury has budgeted for this until the end of  but for each year after , the cost will be as high as £ billion because we will have lost the £. billion a year rebate which was famously secured and successfully negotiated in  by Margaret Thatcher when she demanded our money back from the EU.The British people are once again being treated like fools. What we are now witnessing is a blatant attempt to keep Britain in the EU while Brussels continues to raid the pockets of British taxpayers.This must end and the Government should invoke the great Thatcherite spirit of Fontainebleau and say No, No, No to Brussels. Because pumping our money into an undemocratic and unaccountable system two years after Britain voted to leave the EU is simply not right or acceptable. It makes a mockery of our democracy and is an insult to the British public.It is our money and that money should be handed back to the people and communities across the UK to invest in our domestic priorities.It could help people across Britain– especially the least well off – by giving them back more of the money that they earn by cutting their taxes.For example,we cut the basic rate of income tax by a penny, that would cost us £ billion.By increasing the personal allowance by a £,, many more of the poorest paid households would be taken out of tax altogether, that’d cost us £. billion. Andwe cut beer and cider duty by  pence, that would cost us £. billion.So by easing the tax burden for the lowest paid and doing our bit to save British pubs from closing, we’d have invested £ billion into longer term economic growth in our economy.And with the other £ billion  How about supporting the millions of families who want to own their own home by cutting stamp duty for homeowners, we can again help the least well off and give them a hand up and support them in their aspirations to own their home.We could also take more first time buyers out of paying stamp duty altogether  If we raised the starting threshold of £, to £,, this would cost the Treasury £. billion.Then there’s the VAT we pay on domestic gas and electricity. The  per cent VAT charge on domestic fuel and power raised around £. billion in  . If we got rid of this we would make fuel cheaper and families would have a little extra left over in their monthly pay packets.What about the VAT charged on sanitary products for women  This should end now and not when we leave the EU s the Government previously promised, especially as leaving the EU will take longer than we were previously promised. VAT receipts from the sale of sanitary products costs approximately £. billion a year but importantly this one VAT cut that would unite women across the country.I could go on. There are so many important domestic key services and priorities to invest in.To govern is to choose and the choice being made our Government is to spend your money on an expensive and everlasting EU membership.And all this comes on top of the ridiculous capitulation where we have agreed to the EU’s demands to hand over a £ billion pay cheque for absolutely nothing in .Britain needs once again to have a long term economic plan that puts our national interest first.Let’s start standing up for Britain by investing in people, businesses and communities rather than the unelected and unaccountable bureaucrats of the European Union.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This will mean that the government’s flagship welfare reform is now more generous than the benefit system that it is replacing.While today’s reforms certainly won’t end all the problems some recipients have faced with Universal Credit, they should ease the rollout in the months and years ahead.But Lib Dem MP Stephen Lloyd said it wouldnt cover all the costs of the Osborne cuts., and there were still issues with the new system.He raged: UC’s serious design flaws were also not addressed, from long waiting times that are pushing people into indebtedness, to problems in how landlords are paid housing benefit.The pain caused by the roll-out of UC is not over yet.Today we revealed how a single mum is at risk of homelessness after going on to the new system - and isnt eligible for help with her mortgage debt payments.Tina Davidson says she feels tossed aside by the system and has had to put the house shes lived in for  years up for sale to pay off debts.The new system is designed to try and get more Brits into work and less reliant on the welfare system, but its been beset with problems.Many say its pushing them into debt as the wait for the first payment is at least five weeks.Others say they were driven to payday loans and even prostitution to try and make ends meet.Ministers say they are constantly trying to fix the systems problems as they go along - and the new system is much less complicated than the old one.It was reported earlier this month that ministers are planning moves to slow down the roll out to try and fix some of the issues.They can take out emergency loans, but have to start paying them back immediately so they get deducted from their benefits.Highlights of todays Budget include:"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NINTCHDBPICT000443834272-e1540837806705.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"latest telethon shows us once and for all that c4s just a load of cake and balls","story":"You watch BBC’s Children In Need, you’re getting Clare Balding, Doctor Who and dancers, whether you like it or not.ITV  It’d take sniper fire or a dinner setting next to Sir Phillip Green before Cowell was a no-show.Channel , though Apart from a bit of a secondhand cake-baking and Gogglebox, I was drawing a blank before Friday night.So it was with a mix of fascination and dread that I tuned into Stand Up To Cancer. A seven-hour slog live from Westminster City Hall, presented by Adam Hills, Maya Jama and the network’s spare part Alan Carr, who set the tone for most of what followed interviewing Foxy from SAS: Who Dares Wins.“It’s been announced you’ve got a new Stand Up To Cancer series starting next year. Tell us about it.”“I can’t.”“Give us some names.”“I can’t.”No sooner had we written that one off than it become apparent there was no Bake Off special either — just a promo for a show that will be screened months from now. No matter, though. With its lofty public-serving hat on, Adam Hills faithfully promised Channel  would “educate, entertain and inspire” us for the remainder of the evening, which must have looked quite good written down.In practice The first thing to say about Stand Up To Cancer is that it featured some of the most beautul and affecting films you’ll see on a telethon.They needed to be, as well, ’cos you don’t have to have watched the event to know it contained a lot of feeble stunts and sketches.I also could have lived without Adam Hills carrying out a threat to have his pubic hair waxed, live, once the total reached £million, and the educational segment, with Katherine Ryan and Chris O’Dowd, which was sunk the moment he announced: “We’re goingto put the humour in tumour.”Tellingly, there was also a fair bit of non-network talent involved, including James Corden.I’ll not dwell, though, on what Channel ’s Twitter feed did to the Carpool Karaoke segment, where Michael Buble talked about his son’s illness, except to say it was one of those productions where the left hand wasn’t talking to the right.So when Chris O’Dowd was moved to tears talking about the cancer films, the studio audience was guffawing loudly at Alan Carr manoeuvring himself into background position in a Prue Leith wig.By a process of elimination and production gaffs, though, it became apparent the centre of Channel ’s entire universe now is Gogglebox, which had created an all-star version with Louis Tomlinson, Danny Dyer and daughter Dani for the occasion.They missed a trick, frankly, by not capturing Louis falling asleep to The X Factor. But it was still riotously funny watching the regulars pick apart Naked Attraction, with the choicest comment being: “That one looks like Homer Simpson’s mouth.”This was not the sound of people laughing with the channel, though. They were laughing at it.A network that was once known for being brave and innovative is now far more readily associated with a genital parade, third-rate reality shows and cakes than anything in the way of ground-breaking drama or comedy.In fact, the only two genuinely funny people on its payroll are probably Jimmy Carr and Sean Lock, who had to make way, at Stand Up To Cancer, for box-ticking randoms like Mo Gilligan, who was served this testicular curve-ball by Maya Jama.“Do you have a special name for your balls, by any chance ”He does.The Big Narstie Show.So there I was, gently drting off as Darcey Bussell went through the technical motions on Strictly. “The control in the rise and fall. Strong in the two-three.”When, unless I’m imagining it, she told Sean Walsh: “You have to smooth it out and iron it out, so it isn’t jerking off or skippy.”Suddenly I was all ears for the show’s Halloween special – an event which, for three good reasons, is usually my least favourite of the run.Firstly, Tess always expects a laugh for referring to it as a “spook-tacular”. Secondly, someone does The ****ing Timewarp. And thirdly, the worst danceris forced to jig around to The Monster Mash.We got it all, on Saturday night, of course, yet somehow it didn’t feel quite such an endurance as normal.This may have been partly down to Ashley Roberts and Faye Tozer, who both danced like dreams, but it definitely owed something to the presence of Sean, who’s added real jeopardy to proceedings andactual comedy.His snog with Katya has made sense of a dreadful line-up and the BBC should be eternally grateful to The Sun and the photographer for capturing the moment.So although the handbag-clutchers will no doubt disagree, I was genuinely sad to see him voted off and probably back to the ex-girlfriend, where, in the words of Darcey Bussell, he’ll have to “smooth it out and iron it out” or he’ll end up, you know . . . “skippy”.Sandra Oh’s performance in Killing Eve.

There were announcements on schools funding, defence, moving “from disposable to reusable cups across all beverage types” — even a tax break for public loos. More money for social care and Universal Credit.Shopkeepers will breathe a sigh of relief at a hefty cut to business rates.There were hints of more money for the police. Sun readers will also welcome the tax freezes on beer, spirits, cider and short-haul flights.But the big bucks — some £.billion of the £.billion extra the Government expects to spend come - — went to the NHS, fulfilling the Prime Minister’s summer promise to increase spending as a th birthday present to a health service creaking under the strain of an ageing population.The question, of course, was how the Chancellor was going to pay for it.Before the Budget, all sorts of grim possibilities had been floated.Extra taxes on white-van men, lower- ing the VAT threshold and tightening the rules about National Insurance contributions. Taxes on plastic cups . Taxes on pretty much anything, really.Perhaps the best thing the Chancellor did in his Budget, then, was say “No”.To almost all of it. For an hour or more, I waited for the sting in the tail — the bit where Fiscal Phil turned Hatchet Hammond.But it never came. In paying for his promises — and above all, the NHS — the Chancellor was helped by better-than-expected borrowing forecasts, which showed our economy’s remarkable record of creating jobs is still going strong.But he has also made a calculation that it is better to live with a small and manageable deficit than try to drag the finances back into surplus at the cost of higher taxes. And that voters will see through Labour’s promises to hike borrowing back to stratospheric levels in the name of a socialist transformation of the economy.He decided, in other words, people pay enough tax already.And he’s right. All too often in recent years, it has felt like the answer to every problem — at least from Whitehall’s point of view — is higher taxes and more interference.Hammond was never going to copy his tax-slashing Tory predecessor Nigel Lawson, who made it a point of principle to abolish a dferent tax with every Budget.But at least he drew a line in the sand, deciding it is better when hardworking people get to keep more of their own money.That ending austerity should not, and must not, mean higher tax bills. That hard work should mean hard cash in your pocket.Yes, Hammond — like every Chancellor since Gordon Brown — made too many fiddly little announcements.But he avoided the kind of whacking- great raid on taxpayers’ pockets so many were urging him towards.This doesn’t mean we are out of the woods. Britain’s growth prospects over the next half-decade are still extraordinarily sluggish.The outcome of the Brexit deal will drastically change the fiscal picture.In many ways, Hammond’s speech yesterday was a holding action ahead of the much bigger decisions to come.We still need much more radical action to kickstart growth and productivity. Despite the scale of the housing crisis, for example, there was only tinkering around the edges.But a large part of delivering that growth must involve making the economy more dynamic, more competitive and letting people keep more of their own money as a reward for their efforts — moving the country in the direction outlined by Philip Hammond, rather than the one sketched out by Jeremy Corbyn .The overall verdict on the Budget  The jokes were worse than expected but the numbers were better.More spending on the NHS, tax cuts for millions of voters and the worst ideas kept out of it.Yes, borrowing will be higher — but low enough to keep us out of the danger zone and far, far lower than under a Corbyn government.That is a menu Philip Hammond will be pretty happy with.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Another £.billion to iron out Universal Credit problems. A near five per cent hike in the minimum wage. A big, welcome cut in business rates for struggling firms.New ideas flowed: a levy on web giants’ UK revenues, potentially raising £million, is long overdue — though Philip Hammond must ensure the ­burden does not fall on online shoppers.There was major funding to help councils transform our hollowed-out High Streets, including turning vacant shops into homes. A huge increase in firms’ annual investment allowance will let them deduct from taxable profits up to £million spent on tools and machinery.Heathrow’s e-gates will now speed up entry for visitors from the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Japan as well as Europe — a symbol of a global Britain open for business.Some bad ideas The Sun has criticised, including the proposed “latte levy” on plastic cups, were binned. Duty was frozen again on fuel, as well as beer.Even the OBR’s normally pessimistic forecasts were on Mr Hammond’s side. Growth is predicted to rise steadily, albeit too slowly. Unemployment is set to fall to its lowest in  years.We wish the Chancellor had outlined more radical, visionary low-tax measures. He will need them should Brussels shove us into a no-deal Brexit. But that gripe aside, what was not to like The Tories must not try to ape Corbyn’s £trillion spending fantasy. But it is not “Corbyn-lite” to spend billions fixing Britain’s most pressing problems, evenwe are still running a deficit.As for Corbyn himself, it was obvious he took in barely a word of the Budget.In his “response” he merely recited his normal scripted complaints, flubbing his words and shouting randomly, as is now traditional. He somehow contrives to make even this chaotic Government look like a model of competence.Budgets often unravel when acres of small print are finally scrutinised.But for now... nice one, Chancellor.ANGELA Merkel is a once-brilliant politician scuppered by an arrogant disregard for voters.For years she was admired worldwide.

Cheyenne is really sweet about it and she doesnt really understand, thank goodness.We try to keep her away from it.But when she sees Im upset, she will come over and cuddle me and say its okay mummy. Its horrible and the people that are supposed to help just dont care.They are heartless.And she avoided going to the food bank for help because she was expecting to be paid on time.Kind strangers and neighbours have been helping her out with food in the meantime.Partner Chris was also signed off work as a chef for mental health reasons.A DWP spokesperson said: The vast majority of claimants are paid in full and on time, and are comfortable managing their money. Advance payments and budgeting support is available for anyone who needs extra help.Universal Creditreplaces an out-of-date, complex benefits system with clf edges that disincentivised work and often trapped people in unemployment.

It has since been nicknamed the ghost tube station.In the s it was rumoured that a commuter, Mr Brackett, met a grisly end there, after becoming trapped when the train stopped and he got off by mistake.No more tubes came and it was locked up, but he couldnt walk on the tracks, says Hazel. Legend has it that he died in there, and his ghost still haunts the station today as he looks for a way out.Spectrum have been conducting investigations since , going into peoples haunted homes to help them with supernatural activity and running public ghost hunting events.Weve done a lot of investigations down here, says Hazel. Weve heard mysterious footsteps, knocking and banging.One day we even made contact with the spirit of a nine-year-old girl who spoke to us, I think she may have died in an accident when the tube station was still in use.While the pro hunters naturally have state of the art equipment, there are plenty of ghost hunting apps available for mobiles.Sun Online went underground with Spectrum for a special Halloween ghost hunt, pitting three iPhone apps against their specialist toolkit.And things certainly got spooky...Could Mr Brackett still be haunting the station today  Thats what Hazel, Dean and Sun Online are hoping to find out with our technology.During previous visits to the station, they have heard what they describe as poltergeist activity, including banging and footsteps, assomebody is trying to find their way out.Theyve also had positive responses when trying out ouija boards in the station.Weve called out his name in the past and got a few replies, him moving the board or knocking says Hazel.The building does have an extremely creepy atmosphere, which is heightened when you know its history.And Dean, who describes himself as a sceptic compared to Hazel who is a full believer in the paranormal, says doing investigations down here has opened his mind to the possibilities that there is something  out there.Hazel and Dean are kitted out with a box full of equipment, such as ious sound recorders, crucixes and even a ouija board, which they have bought from specialist shops and online.Tonight, they will be using a Meterk Meter, which uses an electro-magnetic fieldto seea presence is nearby and a Mel Meter  that measures EMF and temperature:a spirit is present people will often complain of a room going cold.They also have a K meter, which that can allow for communication from spooks by them manipulating the LED lights on the meter.The theory is, your soul carries on within electromagnetic fields, which is how spirits can communicate with us through these items, says Hazel.In Sun Onlines tool box are three iPhone apps.They are: Ghost Hunter M , Ghost Detect Proand Ghost Sensor , which is supposed to imitate the K meter.On first glance, the apps dont seem particularly great. They are packed full of ads, make a lot of weird bleeping noises and seem completely incomprehensible and impossible to use.And Im sceptical as to how an iPhone can even detect ghosts in the first place.When we ask Hazel what she thinks of the apps, she says theyre not as effective for ghost hunting as the experts equipment, as they can be affected by the phones own electrical fields.Shes right: as we walk round, not very much happens with the apps. Ghost Sensor does absolutely nothing, the needle remains still even when Deans K meter starts to spike.When I try out Ghost Detect Pro, I suddenly hear random words coming out of my phone: Wild! Grant! Fish!I wonderthis is a spirit trying to communicate, but Hazel assures me these are often randomised sounds assigned to the app for fun, which is a little bit disappointing.Our final room to try is a corridor with stairs leading up to the next level at the back of it. This, Hazel says, is the place where Spectrum have had the most activity.And it doesnt disappoint: Hazel and Deans equipment starts spiking and bleeping, and even the M app shows the EMF reading is jumping.The room suddenly falls extremely cold, before we hear it: somebody coming down the stairs very slowly, followed by banging sounds.With everyone accounted for, theres surely only one explanation for who it could be...If thats you, knock twice for yes, shouts Dean. And immediately, we hear two knocks coming from the other side of the room.To be honest, its so scary I forget to check my apps, but based on earlier I cant imagine they were doing very much.We wait to heartheres any more, but the weird atmosphere that had been in the room during the knocking lts, and Hazel whispers hes gone.Whether that was Mr Brackett or not, we will never know...Although I cant fully explain the spookiness down in disused station, or the footsteps and knocking we heard, I remain on the fence about ghosts.And as for the apps  Theyre best left to the professionals.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

His nickname was thought appropriate for technology that brings devices together.Others contributed their own knowledge about the subject, one writing: Harald Gormsson, or Harald Bluetooth, lived in the th century and introduced Christianity to Denmark and ruled over what is now Denmark, northern Germany, southern Sweden and parts of Norway. His nickname came from the fact he had a dead tooth that looked bluish.Others joked about the reliability of Bluetooth: Did King Harald also have pairing problems: unable to pair when too far and pairing with random devices when too close.While one Twitter user joked about an alternative name for Brexit: And one day, through back construction, the Shambles York will be rembered as being named to commemorate Brexit."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NINTCHDBPICT0004457140541.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=720\" height=\"960","title":"can you spot the venomous snake hidden in this familys garden","story":"The person panicked and thought they saw a brown snake lurking near their garage in Queensland, Australia, so phoned for help.Christian Andersen, who works for local firm South Burnett Snake Catchers  , was called out and confirmed it was a venomous yellow faced whip snake.But he has also issued a warning after an image appeared to show the snake tucked underneath rocks and a small bridge in the garden.This particular species is dubbed the “cheetahs of the snake world” because they can move at lightning speed.They are often mistaken from brown snakes which can be deadly because of their venom.But he also highlighted how discreet they can be because he said the snake is not obvious to see with the naked eye.Christian told Yahoo: “It was a yellow faced whip snake going just by the scales alone.“Their venom isnt considered to be dangerous to humans.

As a result the officer was propelled backwards into the bonnet of the police car.Despite his head hitting the windscreen PC Haxby bravely got back to his feet and managed to open the Fiesta door and drew his Taser to detain Parkinson.The officer suffered with whiplash and back pain and has been forced to take time off work. Cost of damage to the police car, Ford Fiesta and the HGV was estimated at a total of £,.In an earlier incident Parkinson and a group of friends stole a disabled mans Renault Scenic along with his disability scooter which was in the boot.Police chased him again and blocked in the stolen car in a suburban street where children were playing but Parkinson drove up on to the pavement, narrowly missing a child, before driving off at speed and losing the officers.The Renault was found days later completely written off, and the disability scooter was also damaged to the stage it was deemed redundant.Fed-up residents reported Parkinson for repeated car and motorbike thefts and he was also arrested for drugs offences, assault, vandalism and even terrorising his own grandmother.JPs placed him on youth rehabilitation schemes and also banned him from his regular haunts and associating with other yobs.But Parkinson simply ignored a two-year Criminal Behaviour Order - even booking taxis to meet his cronies.When he was placed in a care home away from his family he threatened to shoot and stab his care workers.The young thug would also post pictures of himself smoking suspicious-looking cigarettes on social media and he even spelt his own name in cannabis leaves.Parkinson could barely see over the steering wheel of the Phantom supercar which was parked near his home - but still posed for pictures after hopping into the drivers seat.In court Parkinson yawned and stretched his arms over-dramatically as he listened to the proceedings. He admitted assault occasioning actual bodily harm, aggravated vehicle taking, dangerous driving, driving while disqualied and twice breaching a criminal behaviour.Judge Mark Savill told him: “You have shown a lack of respect for the police and a lack of remorse and you have expressed no desire to change. So I must put the protection of the public and a punishment for you first.”He added: Youre just  but have an appalling record and the footage of the pursuit I have seen is truly chilling. Many people have the good sense to lie when they say they want to change their ways, but you have no idea.“That police officer could have been killed because of your selfishness. It is a wonder how you didn’t kill or seriously injure a member of the public or a police officer.“Your pre-sentence report makes a depressing read.“I know you have dficulties in your le but you have indicated a lack of remorse and have expressed no desire to change.“You present a high risk of reoffending.“I am not going to impose a sentence that will crush any hope you have - but you cannot reoffend like this.”Parkinson was also disqualied from driving for five years. He has a large number of previous convictions starting from when he was just  for offences including vehicle crime, dishonesty, assaults on a police and public disorder offences.His lawyer Mark Fireman said in mitigation: “This is somebody who has had one of the worst starts in le.“He has been left with many dficulties. He is physically immature and emotionally extremely immature. He has been in care for many years.

They will not feel that austerity is over.”Brits going onto the new system have said they are left waiting weeks and months for payment, and are being driven into debt.This week we told how a single mum is at risk of homelessness after falling behind with her housing payments under Universal Credit.Last week a damning report claimed that almost half were in debt within nine months of going onto the new system.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Heather Pollard and her friend Ian OConnor were enjoying a winter break in the Canary Islands when they decided to visit a nearby market. That meant booking tickets from a tour shop next to their hotel in Costa Teguise, Lanzarote. While they were there some prize draw tickets were thrust into their hands. Heather won a toy camel and Ian apparently had hit the jackpot, winning a weeks holiday. To collect the prizes they had to go into the office of a business called Xfinity Sands SL. “That was a fatal mistake,” Heather, , was to say later. A sales rep called Mark Holden “began to give us the hard sell”, Heather recalls, adding: “It was so intense that I began to wonder how I could get out of there.” Xfinity Sands turned out to be a sales agent for Mtas.eu, which describes itself as “an internet-based discount club” offering “a very simple but unique holiday concept”.  It promises all sorts of cheap deals but these are dficult to very because you have to join before you can log into its website. “It just kept on and on, Ian was getting agitated,” said Heather. “Hed being seeing the memory clinic over a number of months and had become more and more forgetful and more stressed in dficult situations.” There wasnt even any respite when she asked to use the toilet, one of Holdens colleagues escorted her there and back. Eventually, she says, “I decided to sign just to get out”, paying a pound deposit by credit card to join Mtas. The prize toy camel and free holiday never materialised, though the pair were given free tickets for the market.  “We shot out of the room and breathed a sigh of relief,” said Heather. “I knew that it was a mistake. I tried to cancel after ing to the hotel but my bank said the transaction had gone through. “I ed to Mark Holdens office but it was closed. “I didnt even use the tickets to the market as I was so sick at what had happened.” When back home in Hornsea, East Yorkshire, Heather got hold of Mr Holden by telephone, only to be told that there was no cooling off period. She pointed out that Ian, , had been diagnosed with dementia. Holden replied – andthis is true it it beyond disgusting – that they could still take the holidays “just bring nappies for him”. He added thatshe didnt pay the balance of pound, for one years membership of Mtas then hed put debt collectors onto her. And he did. Last month Heather received a letter from Daniels Silverman, which boasts “We’re regarded as one of the top debt collection and credit management companies in the UK.” Daniels Silverman demanded payment within seven days “to avoid the possibility of further action being taken against you”.

As Nye Bevan once said “the language of priorities is the religion of socialism.” In his Budget on Monday Philip Hammond made clear his priorities and he definitely wasn’t praying at the altar of socialism. When presented with the choice of cutting taxes for the wealthy or helping those on the lowest incomes, he went for the former . Presented with the choice of handing high earners more than pound a year or ending the welfare freeze, he went for the former. Presented with the choice of cutting corporation tax or additional funding for education, the police and local government, he went for the former. Which made it remarkable that John McDonnell yesterday said Labour would not reverse the income tax measures in the Budget even though % of the tax cuts will benefit the top half of earners. Andy Burnham was one of many Labour figures to warn McDonnell’s position would not hold. The Greater Manchester mayor said he could not see how tax cuts for the wealthiest could be the priority when the police were so stretched and there are “people dying on British streets for want of a roof over their head.” Many Labour MPs also voiced concerns. Jess Phillips put it succinctly in a tweet this morning: “When Philip Green gets more from the budget than a midwe might I suggest we are on sh**ty ground.” The Shadow Chancellor, who is meeting business leaders today, is showing a pragmatism that comes with the challenge of seeking power. But you cannot help thinking thata previous Labour leadership had adopted this position he would have been one of the first to object. Even when Hammond made the right choice - the additional funding for the NHS - it fell short of what is required. As the IFS noted yesterday, the lt in NHS spending amounts to an increase of .% a year which is below the average increases of .% a year over the NHS’s entire history and the % a year over the period of the last Labour government."},{"url":null,"title":"labour vow end benefits freeze","story":"NewsLabour promise to end benefits freeze hit by confusion after new comments by Jeremy Corbyns spokesmanLabour WILL halt the Tories cruel four-year freeze on welfare payments - but a spokesman clashed with journalists over the detailShareCommentsByDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT NewsThe comments by Jeremy Corbyns spokesman appeared to contradict John McDonnell \"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailLabours vow to end the benefits freeze was thrown into confusion today after new comments by Jeremy Corbyns spokesman. The spokesman insisted Labour WILL halt the Tories cruel four-year freeze on welfare payments - which takes poundbillion a year from the pockets of the nations poorest. But he did NOT confirm Labour will raise benefits every year in line with inflation. Campaigners saythis doesnt happen, it will be a real-terms cut - continuing the pain for millions of families. The spokesmans comments appeared to contradict both Labours shadow chancellor and its welfare chief. UPDATE: The comments have now been claried since we published this story. A spokesman told us: Our commitment is to end the social security freeze and uprate in line with inflation.  John McDonnell told the Mirror only last week that Labour would uprate benefits with inflation. Askeduprating benefits with inflation every year was the specic policy, the Shadow Chancellor told us: Yes, that’s what we’ve said. He later added: We’re saying we’re uprating. Labours Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary has also told the Mirror she would uprate benefits with inflation. Margaret Greenwood told us last month: We would end the benefits freeze, and that would mean uprating in line with inflation every year.  But today, Mr Corbyns spokesman said raising benefits with inflation was a dferent issue to Labours confirmed policy of ending the freeze. Instead, he said the definition of ending the freeze was you start to increase benefits again. He added ending a freeze can mean turning on the temperature to dferent degrees. Asked directlya rise could be less than inflation, he said: Exactly how that will be spelt out in the next manesto and the exact commitment is part of that review [of benefits]. But that we will end the benefits freeze is a commitment.  Speaking at a briefing for Westminster journalists, he added: A freeze means you dont increase anything. If you move off it, the freeze has ended. Cruel Tories have frozen benefit rates for four years to slash pound.billion a year from the welfare bill by  . A Labour spokesman later issued a new statement clarying the partys position. He said: Our commitment is to end the social security freeze and uprate in line with inflation.  The exchange in full JOURNALIST: Just to get the meaning clear, will a Labour government uprate benefits every year in line with inflation  JEREMY CORBYNS SPOKESMAN: Thats a dferent issue, weve said we- Its not, thats exactly what ending the benefits freeze is, so is that what Labour will do  The commitment to end the freeze is to move off the freeze, that means you start to increase benefits again. It could be partially defrosted  The freeze - its a switch on or off. A freeze means off. If you turn it on, you can turn it on to dferent degrees. But anyway...  So it wouldnt necessarily be in line with inflation, it could be less than inflation  Thats the point John was referring to, exactly how that will be spelt out in the next manesto and the exact commitment is part of that review, but that we will end the benefits freeze is a commitment. I asked John McDonnell last week whether Labour would uprate benefits in line with inflation every year and he said yes. So was he wrong  Im confused, Im genuinely confused. The point Im making is the commitment to end the freeze is there, the exact form that the restructuring of the benefits system, including Universal Credit, is going to take under our policies - only some elements of that have been spelt out. And its subject to a wider review. But that we are going to move off it and end the freeze is a commitment.

Raising a point of order MrHoare said: But there is a case, as youll be aware, currently alive and alert in the media about passholders, or a passholder of this place, which is after all an honour not a right, who has been found guilty of drugs-related crime. He asked what the procedure was for examining whether the pass should be taken away.  The Speaker John Bercow told MPs that it was up to him whether staff were able to keep their passes after such an issue had been raised. But Mr Bercow reminded MPs that ideally any complaint would be raised privately. Osamor, who was elected in May to Haringey council, apologised for the unwanted attention his case had brought. He was sentenced to a two-year community order and  days rehabilitation, last Friday. According to expenses records filed with the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority website, his role as Kate Osamors communications officer paid between pound, and pound, in  . In a statement to the councils chief executive he said: It is with great regret that I am offering this as formal notice of my resignation as councillor, effective immediately. I would like to take the opportunity to apologise to the council, as I have to my ward colleagues and residents, for the unwelcome attention my case has brought to Haringey. Councillor Joseph Ejiofor, council leader, said: Councillor Osamor came to see me on Friday  October and explained about an incident that happened in September last year. I expressed my concern and disappointment by the actions that he had admitted. The Labour Party expects high standards from its elected representatives, and I know that Councillor Osamor has taken some personal time over the past four days to review whether his actions have met this expectation. Consequently, Ishmael has decided to resign from Haringey Council. We respect his decision.

Parkinson, who has an appalling record amassed since he was just eleven, also posted bragging pictures of himself smoking suspicious looking cigarettes on social media and spelt his own name in cannabis leaves.  Yesterday he began a sentence at a young offenders institution for another string of offences, including reversing a stolen Fiesta into a police officer who was trying to catch him. Parkinson stretched and yawned loudly as he was handed a four-year sentence at Manchesters Minshull Street Crown Court, Manchester Evening News reports.Describing how Parkinson had reversed into the police officer, the judge said: You tried to get past and rammed into the front of the lorry. The very brave police officer, doing what police officers do on behalf of decent members of society, got out and tried to approach you. What did you do  You reversed. The door was open and caught him, sending him flying onto the bonnet of his car. What he must have been wondering at that time one can only imagine. The court heard how the police officer could have been killed. Parkinson had amassed  previous convictions for  crimes from the age of , the court heard.This included twice assaulting police officers as well as robbery, violence, theft of vehicles and flouting court orders. His defence barrister told the court Parkinson had one of the worst starts in le I have seen and is extremely immature for his age. The judge said he accepted what the teenagers barrister said, but added that there comes a time when the public has to be protected. Parkinsons name and face were earlier published on October , , when he was made the subject of a criminal behaviour order which banned him from the Smallshaw estate in Tameside and disqualied him from driving until . The order made little effect.  On May , this year, he stole a specially-adapted Renault Scenic, which carried on board a mobility scooter and was owned by a disabled man. The owner thought he had lost the keys and had called for roadside assistance, but then saw Parkinson and his young male friends get in the car, with the keys, start the engine and drive away. The car was spotted in the Smallshaw estate that night, with residents reporting a car was screaming around the streets while children were out playing, prosecutor Jon Close told the court. Police patrols gave chase but the stolen Scenic mounted the pavement, narrowly missed a child and sped away, the judge heard. Patrols managed to stop the badly damaged car after it was spotted being driven recklessly again, but the occupants fled.  The car had to be written off and the mobility scooter was also damaged. Parkinson was arrested, charged and appeared before magistrates who released him on bail on June  - a decision described as astonishing by the judge because of his appalling criminal record. It was while on bail - and also on licence for another crime - he went on to commit more and worse crimes. Within three weeks of being released, on June , Parkinson was spotted at the wheel of a stolen Ford Fiesta which he drove at speeds topping mph around Tameside in an attempt to escape the law. The pursuit was captured by a dash camera mounted in the pursuing police car and the footage was played in court. It showed the Fiesta speeding in Ashton-under-Lyne but being forced to stop because a civic-minded HGV driver, who was coming from the opposite direction, used his vehicle to block any escape. PC Christopher Haxby is seen getting out of his patrol car to arrest the driver but Parkinson simply reverses, smashing the open door of the Fiesta into the officer, propelling the bobby onto the bonnet of his own vehicle.  The brave cop is seen to pick himself up, draw his Taser stun gun and order the occupants from the vehicle. He is heard shouting: Get out! Get on the f***ing floor now. Parkinson ran away but was arrested after a brief foot-chase, although he tried to claim during his police interview that he had not been the driver of the Fiesta. The damage caused to the police patrol car was estimated at pound,, while the stolen Fiesta required repairs costing pound,. The HGV had been damaged to the tune of pound,. PC Haxby suffered whiplash as well as injuries to his right leg and shoulder. He could have been killed, noted Judge Martin Savill. After brief details of Parkinsons criminal record were read out, the judge went on: That to me sums up this young mans approach to le. He couldnt care less. He associated with children rather than youths his own age, the court heard. The report describes him as effectively bringing himself up, said Mr Fireman.  Addressing the defendant, who appeared in court via video-link, Judge Savill said he accepted what the barrister said but added that there comes a time when the public has to be protected. This young mans record for one his age is so that it passes beyond the bounds of appalling, said Mr Fireman, while the judge noted that the defendant had unashamedly told probation workers he was unwilling to change. A judge slammed Parkinsons quite appalling criminal record. He sent Parkinson to a young offenders institution for four years and disqualied him from driving for five years. I can only hope this will offer you some cause to consider where your le is going, Judge Savill told him. But Parkinson appeared unconcerned, stretching and yawning loudly as the sentencing hearing drew to a close. How long did I get  How long gets taken off forremand and that  he asked an unseen official in the room at a detention centre where he is being held. Parkinson, of Ashton-under-Lyne, had pleaded guilty to two counts of disqualied driving, two counts of dangerous driving, twice breaching his criminal behaviour order, aggravated vehicle taking, assault causing actual bodily harm and driving without insurance.

A court heard the -year-old started a relationship with Stephanie Watkis, , after meeting her in a gym in September , but weeks later he carried out the first of a string of attacks on her. In one incident in December he found a picture on her phone of a man she had been interested in two years previously. Cooksey, from Pontypool, Gwent, repeatedly punched her while she lay in bed, leaving her with a black eye and a bruised arm before forcing her to drink a bottle of rum. He then kept her as his prisoner for a week to hide her physical injuries and used her phone to tell her employers she would be off work following a car crash.  He also controlled Miss Watkis choice of clothes and make-up, and stole her phone, cutting her off from family and friends after she moved into his flat and rendering her utterly dependent on him. Today, prosecutor Roger Grfiths read a victim impact statement from Miss Watkis, who said she has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and depression because of the violent relationship. Miss Watkis said: He always used to say this is not a game and thats what I hear in my nightmares. Hes hugely impacted my social skill and Im now very distrustful of people. Before, I was a bubbly, friendly and welcoming person. I was carefree. This is no longer the case.  Cooksey was found guilty of two counts of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, common assault and  imprisonment following a trial at Newport Crown Court. Harry Baker, defending, told the court at the sentencing hearing that Cooksey had no previous convictions, and both his client and Miss Watkis had admitted it was a bad relationship. Judge Thomas Crowther QC said Cooksey became obsessed with how many other men Miss Watkis had slept with before him. He said: It became very quickly clear that you had a fragile ego, a thin-skinned nature and a vile temper. I have no doubt you wanted Miss Watkis to be your partner, but not as a human, a woman, but rather as a canvas upon which you could project your fantasy image of a woman who had no history, no past, no family, no interest except you.  She didnt match your desire for some blank virginal sex robot. You attacked her, punching her as she lay on the floor curled into a ball, as she put it, like a dog. You isolated her within your home. You made her subject to your dominance.You enforced that by ruthless violence, using your physical power to subjugate her, and by demeaning behaviour. You have caused serious physical and enduring psychological harm. You drove her to the brink of tragedy. Cooksey was given a six-year extended sentence, meaning he will spend four in custody before he is released on licence. He was also given a -year restraining order in relation to Miss Watkis.

Jack Schumann, , suffered with depression ever since the death of his -month-old daughter in October , an inquest heard. The mechanic, from Oldham, Manchester, had been using alcohol as a coping mechanism but quickly developed a dependency, the coroner was told.An inquest into Jacks death heard he would drink up to  cans of cider a day, Manchester Evening News reports.His mother Tracy Schumann believes her son may have been able to tackle the addiction had more services been available to him. She told the coroner Jack had been offered a bed at the Drug and Alcohol Inpatient Unit at Prestwich Hospital in , but she said he missed out after he was forced to attend a meeting about Universal Credit. Have you been affected by Universal Credit  Email webnews@mirror  She added that her son was offered another bed later - which Jack accepted - but claimed he was later told the bed was no longer available. Ms Schumann claimed they never received an explanation and no further attempts were made to offer Jack a bed. Following the inquest, a spokesman for the trust in charge of Prestwich Hospital said they had not had any contact at all with Jack Schumann. The coroner was told by Jacks family he made attempts to beat the addiction by himself, but by May  his health had deteriorated. Jack was found unresponsive by his twin brother on May , this year, and was pronounced dead at the scene by paramedics.  His father, Martin Schumann, told the Heywood hearing on Tuesday: Jack lost his daughter about three years ago and suffered from depression ever since. I think he always blamed himself. He always liked a drink at home, but after her death he would tend to drink a lot. He was drinking about  cans a day. Jack got a job working with me and started to lay off a bit, but in the last  months he started to relapse again. It always got worse around the time of his daughters birthday or anniversary of her death. He adored his daughter and I dont think he ever got over her death. In the last few months he lost a lot of weight - probably about five stone. I last saw him on May  and he didnt look like himself. A postmortem conducted by Dr Abdul Gangrockwala revealed that Jack had died from an alcoholic fatty liver, due to excessive long-term alcohol consumption. He said that although Jacks liver was extensively diseased, the damage was reversible. A toxicology report did not detect any alcohol in Jacks system at the time of his death.  Ms Schumann told the hearing: Jack was offered a meeting at a local rehabilitation centre but it was just horrible. He felt very degraded even though he knew he needed help. We got a call to say that hed been offered a bed at Prestwich but on the same day he was facing eviction from his flat and had to have a meeting about Universal Credit. He was offered another place and he rung to tell me to get everything ready but just after they rang back again and said the bed had gone. We never got any explanation for it. After that there were no other attempts made to offer Jack a bed. In March he was doing really well and trying to cut down on the alcohol but a few weeks before his death his health started to deteriorate. In a statement read to the court, Jacks GP Dr Paul Richbell said the surgery were aware of his alcohol dependency. He said: Jack came to visit me in June  with an alcohol dependency problem and I spoke to him about the alcohol services and he self referred himself for support. He was seen by other doctors at the surgery who offered him advice and put him in touch with the local services.  Assistant Coroner for Manchester North Julie Robertson recorded a conclusion of natural causes. She said: It is clear that Jack used alcohol as a coping strategy. The disease to his liver was extensive and had accumulated over a number of years. I cannot speculate as to whether more available help could have prevented Jacks death. After the hearing Greater Manchester Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust, which runs Prestwich Hospital, said they had not had any contact with Jack Schumann.The Mirror is urging our readers to back our petition to stop the rollout Universal Credit which is plunging families into debt and despair and replace it with a fair system."},{"url":null,"title":"kate middleton reads letters relating","story":"NewsKate Middleton reads letters relating to great-grandmothers three brothers who all died in WWIThe Duchess of Cambridge was shown a postcard written by her great-great-uncle Lionel where he writes I am quite well before he was killed in action on the same day, age ShareCommentsByLucy Clarke-Billings:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT NewsBefore looking at the letters, the Duchess will take a short tour of the First World War Galleries \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe Duchess of Cambridge has read emotional letters relating to her great-grandmothers three brothers who all fought and died in the First World War.

Meghan looked shocked when she was handed a bunch of carrots in Sydney before excitedly telling Harry: Weve got veggies! The carrots were later pictured on the floor with other items given to the couple.  But what exactly happens next  Are they allowed to keep the gts and do they use them  Although each gt-giver would love to think Harry and Meghan will cherish their present forever, they cant possibly use them all. Any present handed to the Duke and Duchess while they are shaking hands at public engagements is classed as an official gt. Every single gt handed to any royal on an official engagement is recorded on a form in order to keep track of them. According to the royal family website, these gts do not become the private property of Meghan and Harry - or any member of royalty who receives them.  The Duke and Duchess presents fall into the official category as they are given by iniduals not personally known to the Member of The Royal Family during walkabouts. If perishable gts with a value of less than pound - like the carrots Meghan was handed in Australia - are not to be personally used by the royalMeghan isnt going to put them into a stew then they may be given to charities or third parties to avoid waste. Third parties include the royals staff, so Meghan could technically pass those carrots on to her royal aides.  Perishable gts with a value over pound which wont be used by the royal recipient should pass to charity. Non-perishable official gts, when not used by the recipient or passed to charity, are stored - and once its in storage, things get a little bit more complicated... These stored gts are reviewed annually by a  of experts from the Royal Household and Royal Collection, who consider each gt in terms of its national, historical, aesthetic or financial value. Then they decide what happens to each gt, which can be:Kept in storage Incorporated into the Royal CollectionLoaned to a reputable and appropriate organisation Donated to a registered charity Destroyedit is not to be retained, loaned or donated to charityGts falling into the first two categories are supposed to be retained for five years. Iniduals and organisations meeting the royal family on official engagements are discouraged from offering extravagant gts. It is not known what the couple will do with all the teddies and baby gts they are being given. They might choose to keep some of them, but as there are so many its likely theyll decide to give some to an appropriate charity so others can benefit from the generosity of their fans.

Many fans believed they may have been a pregnancy present from Prince Harry. Meghan bakes banana bread for community barbecue Everyone knows its rude to turn up to a barbecue empty handed, so Meghan decided to bake a loaf of banana bread to take to an event in Dubbo.

She also took along some Royal Blend tea from Londons Fortnum and Mason.

Meghan screams as she gets huge surprise from school pupilsThe couple had a chance to race the miniature racing cars during their time in Melbourne, and were given remote controllers and shown which buttons to press when the lights changed. But what staff forgot to mention is that there would be quite a bit of noise when they pressed Go.

They were gted to Harry when a disabled sports presenter and two members of the Australian Invictus Games team visited him at Admiralty House, the Governor General’s residence where the couple are staying in Sydney.

It might not have been in-keeping with royal protocol but it showed how relaxed Meghan is with her new royal responsibilities. The breach of tradition has also thrown up some new information, according to a foot expert who was keeping her eyes trained on Meghans toes. Jane Sheehan, a foot-reading expert on This Morning, revealed how Meghan has a condition called Mortons Toe, which means her big toe is shorter than her second. The condition is caused when the second metatarsal - one of the bones at the base of the toe - is longer than the first.  Sheehan, seeing the pictures, was prompted to take a look at old photos of Harrys ex-girlfriends - and made an interesting discovery. Both Cha Davy and Cressida Bonas, the princes two most famous exes, have an extra long second toe. And according to solestry experts, it has a special meaning which reveals a lot about what Harry looks for in a woman.Sheehan explained how their common feature proves Harry is attracted to natural-born leaders. The fact that Harry’s always gone for women with a longer second toe, suggests he likes women who are strong, Jane told Femail.  That doesn’t mean they are dictatorial but they lead by example. But Meghans feet apparently also show her willingness to compromise, reportedly making her a better match for Harry than Cha or Cressida. Sheehan also explained how the Duchess feet compare to her husbands - revealing Meghan is better able to delegate than Harry.  Her big toe leans towards her second toe, suggesting that she has the motivation to help him, she added. So, whilst he won’t find it easy to delegate, she will naturally want to be helpful. Meghan and Harrys feet also give away that he likes to plan ahead while she deals with whats in front of her."},{"url":null,"title":"meghan markle slammed unprofessional habit","story":"NewsMeghan Markle slammed for unprofessional habit no other royal women have - but theres a sweet reasonThe Duchess has been pictured doing it on a few occasions - most recently in New Zealand on the royal tourShareCommentsByNicola OakleyHead of Audience:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT NewsMeghan has completed her first overseas tour with husband Prince Harry \"Get Royal Family updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAll eyes have been on Prince Harry and pregnant Meghan Markle over the last  days as they took on an epic royal tour of Australia, Fiji, Tonga and New Zealand. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have now completed their trip, which included a whopping  engagements, and can safely step out of the spotlight again having made no major slip-ups. Meghan, who is thought to be around four months pregnant, has dazzled in gorgeous dresses, sparkling jewels and sweetly cradled her growing baby bump. She and Harry have also broken royal tradition by embracing adults and kids in huge hugs on the tour. But an etiquette expert has called her out on one little habit she has, calling it unprofessional and too relaxed.  It came after Meghan and Harry visited Courtenay Creative, which runs programmes for young people to get into film, and the Duchess wore a white tuxedo dress with pockets she couldnt resist putting her hands in. William Hanson told the Daily Mail: “We know that Their Royal Highnesses The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are pioneering a new, relaxed, tactile branch of monarchy but having hands in the pocket is a step too far. “There is good casual and there is bad casual. Placing hands in the pocket is too relaxed and unprofessional, however dressed down Prince Harry and his we may have been.”  Meghan shouldnt be too worried, though, as Hanson believes its just a small blip - a habit she can change next time. Will the world end  he said. No. It is just a small blip in Meghan’s usually delightful manners that can be easily corrected for future engagements.” Body language expert Judi James explained Prince Charles and Prince Harry are also fans of putting their hands in their pockets, but Meghan is the only royal woman to do it too. She also revealed the reason the Duchess has adopted the unprofessional habit.  “The classic reason for this very common gesture is that it signals a subliminal desire to hide, especially when the hands are shoved deep into the pockets, Judi told OK! “It also helps get over the common problem most of us suffer from, which is not really knowing what to do with our hands when we know people are looking at us.

The group of  people had been delayed for hours and then forced to drag their cases to their hotel in storm-hit Agadir, Morocco. It all kicked off when the exhausted travellers were dropped off at the wrong place, at which point they realised the coach had left with a sleeping child on board. The seven-year-old was ed an hour later and the group, which included elderly and disabled travellers as well as families with prams, were forced to trudge through the soaked streets to their hotel. When they finally arrived at the right hotel at .am, they found most of the rooms were not available, there was nothing to eat or drink, and bedding wasnt ready in some of the rooms that were free. One traveller had an asthma attack climbing the stairs and an ambulance was called.  An angry showdown with a TUI rep occurred the following morning and footage shows the leader of the tourists demanding they are treated like human beings, prompting a massive round of applause. The group had been due to leave Morocco on October  toto Manchester Airport. But serious technical problems with the .pm flight meant they were sent back to Agadir at .am, arriving at .am. But the coach driver dropped the passengers a mile and a half from their emergency hotel accommodation and left before the mistake was realised - taking the seven-year-old boy as well. Passenger Phil Harrison, , from Adlington, Lancashire, recorded the scenes as the tourists tramped through Agadir in a rain storm looking for their accommodation. The clip starts with the sound of thunder and lightning and cuts to Phil saying: “Still walking down the same road. Still not a bleeding rep greeted by anybody. Absolutely disgusting.” The camera then pans around to show tired children dragging suitcases with some mothers carrying their children and a angry tourist shouts while dragging her suitcase: “Women with children. They’re lucky to save this.”  Phil, who emerged as the leader of the group, then goes back to narrating the clip saying “women with children pulling cases. Absolutely disgusting. TUI you are out of order.” The clip then cuts to tourists arriving at the hotel at about .am, tired, soaking and struggling to pull their luggage up the steps. The person filming the clip can be heard panting heavily. The video cuts to the following morning and Phil is filmed addressing a TUI rep, detailing their numerous complaints. To deafening applause and clapping from the dozens of weary travellers, he passionately concludes: From every colour, including race, it doesnt matter, we are all human beings here and we all deserve an explanation! The group finally ed to Manchester at pm on October , a delay admitted by TUI of  hours and  minutes. Zuzana Mestour-Tenkova, , from Manchester, said today: My seven-year old-son was left behind asleep in the coach in that big chaos, due to misunderstanding between me and my husband.  “It was a terrible experience. I still feel sick just thinking about it. We are so disappointed with the way TUI handled this whole situation. Its just disgusting.” Michele Cutts, , from Sheffield, said: “We were traumatised, frantic with worry and let down by TUI. Our families could not get any information on our flight, nothing was announced, it caused unnecessary, in some cases necessary worry on their part. And Esther Mashana said: “I thought it disgusting how we were all denied our basic human rights like water and food. “I remember in the morning I was thirsty. I asked for water at the reception and was told to go to the shops to buy water. “Absolutely appalling. I think its safe to say I wont be using TUI again. Neither will I recommend them to anyone.” A spokeswoman for TUI UK said: “We’re sorry to hear about these customers’ experience. We’ll be looking in to the matter as a priority and will follow up appropriately.” "},{"url":null,"title":"shocked meghan markles jaw drops","story":"NewsShocked Meghan Markles jaw drops as she spots familiar face in crowd during Royal TourMeghan Markle spotted Hannah Sergel in the crowd during her walkabout at Viaduct Harbour in Auckland and rushed straight over to give her a hugShareCommentsByZoe ForseyActing Audience Editor:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT Newsthis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news world-news video moment-meghan-recognises-old-friend-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true\"\"Get Royal Family updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMeghan Markle has seen thousands of dferent faces during the past  days, with well-wishers coming out in force in Australia, Fiji, New Zealand and Tonga.

For film fans in particular, there are an abundance of Halloween-appropriate characters - from terrying villains like Freddy Krueger, to more family-friendly ones such as Minnie Mouse. With all this choice and inspiration, many make-up fans have turned it into a fine art. Seattle-based blogger and make-up artist Jody has eight years experience in the beauty industry after getting into make-up artistry after school and studying fashion. She says: My real inspiration though came on the weekends from the kids who went to the eccentric local club and drag queens who all inspired me to explore outlandish party looks. This turned Jody to sharing her looks online with other make-up enthusiasts. Incorporating some recognisable looks with more unique ones, Jody shows she is MORE than ready for Halloween with several terrying transformations. Are you dressing up for Halloween  Whether your costume is good or bad, wed love to see the photos! You can email YourMirror@mirror or fill in the form at the bottom of the article.  Of this look, Jody says: I was going for half Freddy, half unsuspecting dumb blonde slow running victim! Special effects makeup isnt an area I usually work in, but I think it turned out pretty ugly!  Describing her inspiration behind her Terminatrix look, Jody says: One of my dads favorite movies is The Terminator and hes always quoting lines from it. Its light on the gore with the Monroe Misfit Makeup glamour twist. I wanted it to look asmy face had been ripped away revealing my true form. I rarely do special effects and gore makeup, soI can give it a go, anyone can.  Not for the faint-hearted, this is one of Jodys favourite looks. This one embodies glamour, grit and pop art, and all thats weird. Based on one of my favorite artists, a London-based Street Graffiti Artist known as D*face , its a take on his work of a decayed Marilyn image titled Pop Tart.  This is another look Jody created and honed, inspired by both Marilyn herself and the punk rock band, The Misfits. Explaining how it can be perfected further, Jody says: For a more final version Id block out the brows and get more detailed with the teeth and shading. Its a bit disturbing it took half the products to look like a monster, and twice as many for the normal makeup!  Explaining this look is an oldie but a goodie!, Jody originally put together this look when she first started getting in to makeup. I still love the effect, and I was all out of ideas for what to do for a last-minute event. MAC Halloween Face Charts are a great way to get halloweeny when a costume isnt required or you dont have time to put one together, and this one is pretty easy to do!

She says she sat in a chair, where her arms and feet were fixed and a metallic tube was placed on her head.  An electric current then ran through her body, she told ApexTV in an interview.

But  days after the journalist vanished, Saudi officials admitted he had been killed inside the consulate four days after his first visit.Hatice spoke about how they have been unable to have a funeral yet because Khashoggis body has not been found.This is not usual Islamic practice as the burial normally happens as soon as is possible.The fianceacutee of Khashoggi has also criticised President Donald Trumps response to the journalists killing, urging him to set aside US trade interests in the push for truth. Hatice told an audience on a visit to London she was disappointed with Trumps approach. I am disappointed by the actions of the leadership in many countries, particularly in the US, she said. President Trump should help reveal the truth and ensure justice be served.He should not pave the way for a cover-up of my fiances murder. Lets not let money taint our conscience and compromise our values.  When asked who was ultimately responsible for the killing, Hatice told Reuters in Turkish: This took place inside a Saudi diplomatic mission... In such circumstances, the Saudi Arabian authorities are responsible for this. This incident, this assassination, took place in the Saudi consulate, she said, speaking through a translator. So the Saudi authorities probably know how such a murder took place. They need to explain what happened. She has said the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia has still not paid his condolences to her following the journalists murder. The Saudi Crown Prince has condemned the heinous killing of Jamal Khashoggi and insisted all perpetrators will be brought to justice.

The Duchess of Sussex stepped out to greet the public in a cute custom navy jumper and an elegant pleated skirt, completing the look with her signature messy bun. In certain lights, when Meghan was outdoors meeting the public on a walkabout, her skirt appeared to turn see-through where the pleats flatten out, revealing her underwear line and a flash of bare leg. The lower part of the dress has black and lighter blue stripes, giving an optical illusion that she is showing her legs the whole way down. Its not clear whether this is another wardrobe mal - Meghan was dubbed very relatable after leaving the tag on one of her outfits last week - or a totally intentional choice by the fashion-forward Duchess. Meghan is fast becoming a fashion icon, known for her bold statements, so its entirely possible she was aware the skirts material was quite sheer. It was also bespoke and not off the rack - and the choice of designer seems to be a meaningful one for Meghan.  The beautul pleated navy skirt was designed by Claire Waight Keller, for Givenchy, who also created Meghans stunning bridal gown and bridesmaid dresses for her wedding in May. Shes worn outfits from many dferent designers since first landing in Australia  days ago, but rounded off her first big trip with Harry with one close to her heart.  The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have completed their mammoth tour of Australia, Fiji, Tonga and New Zealand, which included a total of  official engagements. It was a tiring trip for the pregnant Duchess, who had to miss some events a few days in to get some rest.She quickly ed to her husbands side and has been praised for her warmth towards members of the public after being pictured cuddling young children and comforting a crying boy.

Training has been really good and I thinkyou asked any of the boys in the changing-room we’d all be the same.“It’s really gone up a level, we’re all enjoying it and I think that shows on a Saturday.“It’s been quite tough but I think we needed that. It’s been enjoyable at the same time, though, and we’re all buying into his ideas.”Off the field there seems to be an air of optimism around Tannadice but Booth knows getting results on the pitch is the only way to realise their hopes of promotion.And that means keeping their unbeaten run under the new boss going against a Dunfermline side that have already bagged a deserved win over the Tangerines.Booth added: “Four points from the first two games isn’t too bad but I think they were two good performances as well.“We feel hard done by we didn’t get the win over Inverness – I think most people there would agree with that but it wasn’t to be.“At least we put in a really positive performance and everyone is pulling in the same direction.“There is a good feel about the place and, hopefully, we can kick on now and go on a little run.“The players, coaching staff, fans all seem to be pulling in the same direction especially since the new gaffer has come in.“A thousand fans down at Partick, great backing and then same again last weekend. The fans were right with us until the last minute.“It does help, it makes a massive dference and Dunfermline isn’t too far down the road so I’d expect another good away following.“I think the fans can see the work and effort we’re putting in, evenwe didn’t get the three points last Saturday.“The fans have been great and long may it continue.”Allan Johnston’s Pars have been struggling of late after a lightning fast start to the season saw them follow up four wins from four in the Betfred Cup group stage with an impressive - victory at Tannadice.Since then, Dunfermline have only managed eight points from the following eight games and were beaten - at home last weekend despite dominating against Queen of the South.In fact, scoring goals at home has been a real problem of late with just the two Championship strikes going in.Booth  Co., however, are wary of a repeat show from the Pars.He said: “Dunfermline were really good at Tannadice the first time we played them and thoroughly deserved to win.“I think most people would be surprised they’ve not kicked on from that first game.“They played well that day and deserved the win.“I’ve not seen much of them since but it’s not worked out for them since for whatever reason.“They’ll still be a dangerous opponent, though, because they are, obviously, capable of putting in a performance but have just been a bit inconsistent recently.“If we go about it like we have done in the last two games then we’ll give ourselves a chance.“We’ll be going there in positive spirits, try to take our chances and come back up the road with the three points.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/10/5bd82bf80afb8-e1540910638812-380x564.jpg ","title":"cat returned to dundee family after an incredible five years on the run","story":"A Dundee family are over the moon after finding their pet cat in a shelter – five years after he disappeared.Christine Ritchie and her son Charlie were distraught when black and white moggie Curtis went out and never came back after they moved house.The Ritchies moved from the Blackness Road area to Stobswell five years ago, when Curtis was three and a half years old.According to Christine, however, he was not a fan of Stobbie and left to go back to the West End – not just once, but twice.She said: “We kept Curtis indoors for a while and then, when we let him out, he just disappeared.“We got him back and kept him in for a couple of weeks but then he disappeared again and that was it.”The family searched high and low, night after night, after Curtis failed to reappear, and eventually resigned themselves to the fact they might never see him again.Charlie, , was devastated, having looked after the cat since he was born.However, recently there was a surprise on Facebook’s Missing Pets Dundee and Angus page – a cat which looked just like Curtis had been found.The Facebook post read: “Do you recognise ‘Earl’  He is a big black and white boy who was found straying in the Dundee area.“We suspect Earl has been straying for some considerable time, perhaps years.“He is approachable and keen on treats.”Earl was taken in temporarily but later escaped from his foster home, before being taken in by Cats Protection Scotland, which has a shelter on Foundry Lane.Christine and Charlie went in at the weekend to seeEarl was really Curtis.Christine said: “Charlie was as happy as anything, even though Curtis hissed a bit at first, but after a while he settled.“It’s overwhelming to think he was out there for all this time.“My phone’s been ringing non-stop with people wanting to come over and see him. It’s been like finding a long-lost member of the family again.”The Ritchies believe Curtis survived thanks to the kindness of strangers and by fending for scraps but they will never know for certain.Nor will they know how Curtis travelled across Dundee without getting hurt, but the family will be keeping a very close eye on him from now on.Christine added: “Charlie’s been checking on him every  minutes to make sure he doesn’t disappear again.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/10/5bd82d8c8e8c0-821x564.jpg ","title":"dundee gaffer says belief is key if dark blues have any hope of a result against celtic","story":"‘Start like you mean to go on’ is an over-used cliche but it’s exactly what boss Jim McIntyre wants from his side against Celtic tonight – providing they begin a lot better than they did in the - loss to Hearts.Last week at Dens, the Dark Blues were behind within two minutes after conceding a sloppy free-kick and immediately gave themselves an uphill struggle. One which ended in an easy victory for the Jambos.Tonight they welcome champions Celtic fresh off a - win of their own over that same Hearts team in the Betfred Cup semi-final on Sunday.It’s fair to say the odds are not in Dundee’s favour but that won’t stop the Dens gaffer giving his team the belief they can cause an upset.To get anything, though, he knows they can’t afford another sloppy start to the game.He said: “It’s so important to give ourselves a chance at the start.“Until Hearts scored their second goal, we did a lot of things good in the game though nobody seems to be interested in that.“We got into some good positions but didn’t punish them and lost another silly goal.“You think you have all the men in place to deal with it but you don’t.“It is very important we start the game well and grow into the game, that’s always the case whenever you play the Old Firm.“That is the aim, to get off to a good start.“I was at Murrayfield on Sunday and I thought Hearts were excellent for  minutes until the penalty but that’s what Celtic do – they constantly pose you questions.“Your concentration levels have to be tip-top and I felt after they got their goal that fluency they have came back.“Celtic are starting to hit their top level and you could see that with the quality of the goals.“To be able to keep that concentration level for -plus minutes is very, very dficult.“To beat them you have to have your organisation levels spot on, you’ve got to have one to  playing out of their skin and you hope a few of them aren’t quite at their peak.“It’s like anything, the favourites don’t always win and that’s the belief you have to go into the game with.“I’ve been at other clubs where we’ve gone and got a result against them and that’s the belief you’ve got to carry against them.“Equally, having said that, you know you are going to have to do everything really well and hope a few of their players are off it.”By the time January comes around, expectations are there will be a raft of changes in the Dens squad.However, Jim insists every player at his disposal right now will get the chance to show he’s good enough to help the side get out of relegation trouble.For the new gaffer, though, it’s not just about showing you’ve the ability to play at this level, it’s about proving you have the character to do so, too.He added: “I think this squad, with no disrespect to the Ross County squad that I inherited, definitely has more ability within it overall.“Ability alone isn’t enough – you’ve got to be able to do the hard yards and carry your job out. That is so important and good teams will punish youyou don’t.“It’s so important to have a good shape about you and do your jobs well at this level.“We have seen what happens when you drop runners at set-plays and give away silly free-kicks.“I think there is plenty of character in this dressing-room but it’s about knowing what’s required of you and standing up to do it.”"},{"url":null,"title":"new midfielder could figure for dundee in celtic clash","story":"Boss Jim McIntyre could have more selection options available when his team face champions Celtic at Dens Park on Wednesday.However, he’ll still have at least a couple of men out injured.Full-back Nathan Ralph and centre-half Genseric Kusunga were not ready to face Hearts on Tuesday evening.Both, though, have been back in training this week and that could put them in contention for a place against the Hoops next midweek.Midfielder Martin Woods, who’s been training at Dens this week, could also be handed a contract in time for involvement in the next outing.However, the likes of Paul McGowan and Josh Meekings are expected to remain on the sidelines as they continue their battles to get back fit after y absences.The club are expected to announce McIntyre’s assistant later today."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/10/5bd82d743d01e-463x564.jpg ","title":"tom duthie dundee uniteds high pressing game can only click if every player is working hard","story":"A feature of Dundee United under Robbie Neilson has been the high-pressing game he’s introduced since taking over early this month.Under previous boss Csaba Laszlo, the Tangerines tended to be a side who dropped off and retreated inside their own half when they lost possession.The key to that strategy was not to give other teams the ball and, for a while, the game stats were showing Laszlo’s United were dominating it.As time passed and things started going wrong, increasingly that became a problem. Other outfits in the Championship quickly worked out while getting the ball quickly was an option,that wasn’t on they’d have time to get the ball under control and pass their way up the pitch.As Partick Thistle, Inverness Caley Thistle and now Dunfermline have discovered, it’s been all change under the new manager.When his team lose the ball they will work hard, fast and high up the pitch to get it back as quickly as possible.That brought them their goals in Robbie’s opening game at Firhill, when for both strikes home players actually had good possession in their own half but were caught out by the speed with which they were closed down.And in the draw against ICT and in Saturday’s win over the Pars, a feature of United’s play was the number of times they won the ball back in, or near, the opponent’s defensive third.Watching from the stands, what is striking about the new policy is the amount of ground it involves the attacking players covering. At the sharp end has been Pavol Safranko. Fortunately for United, as well as being a talented goalscorer, the Slovakian prides himself on his work-rate.At the weekend he almost literally ran himself into the ground – going down with cramp in injury time and being forced off.Not far behind have been the attacking midfield trio of Paul McMullan, Fraser Aird and Billy King. As well as being expected to get forward and get on the ball, there is little respite for them when the other team’s defenders have it.Delighted as he’s been with that quartet’s attitude to a side of the game creative players do not always relish, Robbie stressed the system only works and will continue to,every outfield player buys into it.One chink in the armour though and he knows it will fall apart, allowing the other team to find men with space and time to hurt United.“Pavol’s been great. I know that he’s a very good player and, as I’ve said, I knew about him before I came here because I’d seen him play at Aalborg ,” said the gaffer.“But we also have McMullan, King, Aird, the boys behind, doing a lot of running as well.“And I’m a big believer that when we go and press, even when we’re attacking, the defence have got a big role to play in it as well.“If we’re asking forward players to go and run , ,  yards to go and press people, then the midfielders and defenders have to do it as well.“There is a responsibility on them to go and do it as well. As a team we are getting better at it, but it’s early days, we’re only three games in.”That note of caution possibly stems from the fact, although he’s been pleased with the way the players have taken to the tactic, the next couple of weeks could provide sterner tests of it.Partick and the Pars have been struggling for form and while Inverness remain the only unbeaten second tier team, as five of them in a row indicates, they have become the draw specialists of the ision.Up next are Queen of the South and leaders Ross County, two sides who might just be better equipped to cope with the high press."},{"url":null,"title":"tom duthie neil mccann tried to change too much too soon at dundee","story":"When Neil McCann looks back on his time as Dundee boss he will surely learn several lessons, ones that can stand him in good steadhe s to management.Perhaps the most obvious will be that, whatever your football philosophy, it has to be tapered to suit the resources you have available when it comes to players.McCann’s mantra at Dens was to play passing football at all times and, ultimately, at all costs. That led to too many goals being lost by errors as, at high risk, the ball was played out from the back.It became increasingly clear some of his defenders in particular were not comfortable with this policy but the manager was not for budging and persevered with the style of play he was convinced would, ultimately, bring success.The number of goals it cost made it inevitable what many saw as stubbornness was what cost McCann his job.That is, perhaps, an over-simplication and, now the dust has settled on the former Scotland international’s departure, a more in-depth look throws up other factors.A look at the players he used in his eight Premiership games in charge this term highlights another couple of causes for his downfall.First off, the list of those involved looks too long. In just two-and-a-half months of league football, Dundee fielded  dferent players.Of course, injury and suspension means some of the constant stream of changes were enforced, but others suggest he was never totally sure of what his best line-up was. Given the style of play he wanted, this lack of consistency in selection had to be an issue.Arguably, an even bigger one was that he fell into the rookie manager’s trap of trying to make too many changes too quickly.The Premiership may not be one of the top leagues in Europe but it does have its own unique qualities. One of them, as most new arrivals testy, is the tempo of the play here is more frantic than in many other countries.Even players coming up from England, where the pace is higher than on the continent, usually comment on that.What that means is players from where have to be given time to adjust and, as they do, it’s important they have men around them who are already experienced campaigners in our top ision.A glance down the list of the men used this season suggests there were not enough performers who fitted into that category.Of the  he used, nine were completely new to the league, while eight others had no more than a season’s experience of it.Ironically, the most used who fell into those categories was when  started the solitary win at Hamilton last month but, in the other outings, seven or eight such players were used.That’s not saying these players are not good enough for this level but, as most experienced managers in any league will say, whatever the level of talent, having so many who are not familiar with their surroundings is a risk they wouldn’t be prepared to take.While McCann did bring in vastly-experienced Premiership performer Kenny Miller at the end of the summer transfer window, the loss through injury of Paul McGowan had to be a major blow.And it should not be seen as insignicant that, as he’s scoured the free-agent market since his arrival as manager, new boss Jim McIntyre has paid particular attention to men who know the top flight well.Martin Woods is expected to sign up once he’s proved his fitness, though Celtic on Wednesday may be too early for that. Woods’ old Ross County team-mate from when McIntyre was in charge, Paul Quinn, has also been linked."},{"url":null,"title":"wetherspoons-bans-dogs-from-all-pubs","story":"POPULAR pub chain Wetherspoons has banned dogs from all of its branches."},{"url":null,"title":"mobile-providers-charging-customers-for-phones-already-paid-off","story":"AN estimated four million UK mobile phone users have been charged pound million for handsets they already own, a charity has warned."},{"url":null,"title":"hydro-turns-five-meet-the-head-of-entertainment-who-spoke-on-anniversary","story":"OVER five million concert-goers in five years have visited the SSE Hydro...a figure which has exceeded the expectations of the woman responsible for bringing some of the worlds biggest acts to Glasgow."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-takeaway-launches-deep-fried-mars-bar-calzone","story":"A GLASGOW takeaway has launched one of the worlds unhealthiest pizzas - a deep fried MARS BAR calzone containing around , calories."},{"url":null,"title":"harry-and-meghan-expecting-first-baby","story":"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are expecting a baby in spring , Kensington Palace has announced."},{"url":null,"title":"teen-bakes-grandads-ashes-into-biscuits-and-shares-with-classmates","story":"A high school student mixed her cremated grandfatherrsquos ashes into homemade sugar biscuits and shared them with several classmates, police in Calornia said on Wednesday."},{"url":null,"title":"end-of-british-summertime-when-do-the-clocks-go-back-this-month","story":"The end of British Summertime is officially approaching, which, despite the gloom, brings one positive development ndash an extra hour in bed."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-call-it-out-campaign-hosts-public-meeting","story":"A CAMPAIGN has been launched in Glasgow to tackleanti-Irish and anti-Catholic hate crime."},{"url":null,"title":"bellahouston-park-hospice-to-be-named-in-honour-of-sir-arnold-clark","story":"A NEW state-of-the-art hospice has opened its doors in Glasgows south side for the first time today - and will be named inhonour of a famous Scot."},{"url":null,"title":"celebrity-chef-john-quigley-cooking-up-festive-treats-for-christmas-event","story":"CELEBRITY chef John Quigley is leaving his award-winning Glasgow restaurant to share festive cooking tips at a popular Christmas event."},{"url":null,"title":"world-of-preservation-as-glasgow-museum-store-opens-up-its-doors","story":"These captivating behind-the-scenes pictures show a vast collection of , taxidermy animals at a museum resource centre."},{"url":null,"title":"ryan-christie-was-too-skinny-but-now-hes-man-enough-to-be-a-celtic-player","story":"BRENDAN Rodgers feared a gust of wind would be too strong an opponent for Ryan Christie when he first saw the Highlander."},{"url":null,"title":"austin-lafferty-sisters-not-getting-a-penny-from-dads-estate-is-it-legal","story":"My Dad passed away, and among other things, my brother who dealt with the funeral and the insurance and money is saying that two of our sisters are not getting a penny of the estate.

What’s more, eventhey don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in , a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now,  years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 37","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Sir,It is always a delight when a letter awakens a landowner.James F Lithgow#s insult about ‘blow-ins’ is a typical trait. I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute. It is our country’s most pressing public health issue – one we must address now, collectively.Scotland has made a lot of progress over the past  years, including a guarantee of a year’s post-diagnostic support, better education and training for staff in health and social care and better standards of care for people with dementia in hospitals.There is still, however, an unacceptable gap between national policy and dementia care and support in our communities.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":null,"title":"ayrshire vets reveal cases sedated","story":"NewsAyrshire vets reveal cases of \"sedated\" and \"drowsy\" dogs on our beachesWidespread reports of dogs falling ill have sparked panic among pet owners in the region.ShareByPippa Smith:,  OCT NewsAyr beach \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailVets have been inundated with sick dogs on Ayrshires coastline, the Post can reveal.

Stagecoach insist they have to keep developing the Ayrshire network and fish where the passengers are. And they say: “These changes better reflect our customers travel habits. “A number of these changes will deliver improvements in reliability and frequency, while others will offer a service proportionate to demand.” The switches in service are planned to begin operating in January. The changes were discussed by the Ayrshire Bus Users Group in Troon on Saturday. Watchers are particularly interested in the failed route which served the Silverburn mall in Pollok at weekends. It was launched exactly two years ago with the now departed managing director Tom Bridge crowing: “Shopping habits are changing from traditional high streets.” Ayrshire traders, however, deemed it a slap in the face. But of the X from Ayr, Prestwick and Kilmarnock to Silverburn, they now admit: “Our plan is to remove this service due to very low passenger numbers.”  Stagecoach’s Ayr HQ is wanting passenger feedback on the plans and staged an information day at Ayr Town Hall on Monday. Travellers are now likely to get back their direct Ayr to Irvine number  route via Troon. The last change the company made was to introduce a A which will be scrapped. But this will only be every  minutes. The new  route will take in Barassie, Monkton and Loans. That means Loans will no longer get the  coaster which had erted through the Main Street off the A. Belmont would no longer get the number six which was every  minutes. Instead it will get the number seven every  minutes - andpassenger numbers dont improve it may also be culled. The number two will pull out of Dalmilling and Hayhill, with the areas served by the number one and three. Stagecoach want to sht the X to Hamilton from Ayr away from Prestwick and take it up Whitletts Road. The number  from Ayr to Muirkirk will lose some early and late night services due to some routes shting via the Cumnock depot. The busy X from Ayr to Glasgow is to get extra capacity. The company want new departures from Ayr at .am, .pm, .pm, .pm, .pm.

The former Aberdeen man has formed an impressive defensive partnership with Jamie Adams - and once again the pair were fantastic at Firhill.

Rose looks to have a bright future in the game and he deservedly gains the headlines today.

McCall made his feelings on the whistler well known after Ayrs trip to Ibrox earlier this season - and United were on the end of a string of hotly disputed calls here. Madden waved away two first half penalty shouts and angered Ayr with a number of other baffling calls which threatened to send the game past boiling point in the second half.  McCall wins battle of the bosses On a day when all eyes were on the Thistle dugout and Gary Caldwell making his home debut, Ian McCall made yet another triumphantto his old stomping ground. Ayrs wily gaffer made two big calls in starting Craig Moore and Declan McDaid and his men responded in style with another fine performance. McCall is not afraid of the big decisions and appears to be juggling his squad to perfection at the moment, as proven by this display where his team selection and tactics proved spot on.

have led to many people falling into hardship or dropping out of the benefit system altogether.The introduction of the two-child benefit cap, limiting tax credits and Universal Credit to a familys first two children has also been attacked.And the Tory list MSPs attempt to justy the two-child cap this week was met with anger and disbelief.Ms Ballantyne told Holyrood: \"The two-child limit is about fairness.\"It is fair that people on benefit cannot have as many children as they like while people who work and pay their way and dont claim benefits have to make decisions about the number of children they can have.\"Universal Credit may have its flaws, but the thinking behind the system is sound.\"It is about making it better to be in work than not to be in work.\"MSPs were debating inequality, austerity and poverty when Ms Ballantyne mounted her defence.Nationalist MSP Tom Arthur described her words as one of the most disgraceful speeches Ive ever heard.He said: \"In my two and half years in this parliament, the contribution from Michelle Ballantyne was one of the most disgraceful speeches I have ever heard.\"Six minutes of pompous Victorian moralising, that would have been

programme of main events began in the wonderful Palau De La Musica Catalana - a UNESCO World Heritage Site of extraordinary beauty, the modernistic design and decoration of which is quite unique.After a tour of the building, choir members were askedthey would like to sing on the main stage.Choir manager, Lorna Turnbull told us: ldquoThe design of the Palau is mind blowing and the acoustics are amazing.\"We were told that we could sing just one song, but having heard us, we were asked to sing another.\"This happened on the first morning of the trip, and I was afraid that everything  we had planned for the weekend would be an anti-climax. I neednrsquot have worried. Barcelona did us proud.The next major event took place in the beautul old church of Sant Gaieta in the Eixample District of the city, where the priest raises money for an African mission by staging regular quality concerts.A large, very discerning, audience took the choir to its heart, with many of them coming backstage to express their thanks.The following day InChorus travelled to Sabadell, north of Barcelona, where they were introduced to Coral Catasons, a contemporary choir of similar size.The choirs performed a joint concert to a full house, receiving a standing ovation, with some excellent hospitality from the Spanish choir and some hilarious Catalonian entertainment for afters.Friendships were formed on the back of which Coral Catasons has announced its intention to visit Peebles and the wider Scottish Borders next June.The final scheduled event was an hour-long performance on the steps of the magnicent Barcelona Cathedral.Lorna added: \"To stand in such a location singing in the sunshine to a fantastic audience was extraordinary. The choir loved it.\"On the plane to Catalonia - at the suggestion of the pilot - and at other points throughout the trip, the choir took the opportunity to sing whenever and wherever they could, especially in the beautul squares and open spaces of the Gothic Quarter around La Rambla.As the days progressed, whether singing or sight seeing, members were recognised increasingly.Men in kilts are an instant attraction, and this, combined with the gentsrsquo Catalonian coloured bright teeshirts bearing a line in Spanish from lsquoHavanarsquo, a piece from the choirrsquos repertoire, ensured a positive response everywhere.In the course of the few days they were congratulated and spoken to by people from all around the world including South America, the United States, Canada, all over Europe, Russia, India, the Middle East, the Far East and Australia.To cap this there was the warm welcome extended to the choir by the Spanish people.Accompanying the choir through all its derring-do was the InChorus mascot, Singu, a penguin given to the choir by the family of the late Celia Hayton, a much loved choir member.Musical Director, Aly Skidmore, added: ldquoInChorus decided over a year ago that Barcelona would be the perfect city in which to properly celebrate its first decade.\"The culture there embraces all the arts, but music particularly. The choir worked hard to master an extensive repertoire of both sacred and secular pieces which could be performed in any venue or outdoor space.\"The response from our audiences reflected appreciation of the achievement of this choir from the Scottish Borders."},{"url":null,"title":"mps-praise-galashiels-tot-bens-fundraising-efforts","story":"MPs have praised the fundraising efforts of

We agree on the principle of a UK-wide customs backstop. An agreement on the details of that backstop should be possible.ldquoBoth sides agree that this backstop cannot provide for a permanent UK EU relationship and are committed to a future relationship that works for the whole of the UK, including Northern Ireland.ldquoWe are open to talking about ways to achieve this and committed to continuing discussions in order to reach an agreement.ldquoThe end is now firmly in sight and, while obstacles remain, it cannot be beyond us to navigate them.

The rampant home side completely outplayed the visitors who looked out of sorts and overwhelmed by the occasion.For those who witnessed the second half, what followed was one of the finest and most unlikely comebacks they will ever experience.Claremont blitzed the unsuspecting Pupils from the outset, scoring in their first attack of the match.Before a breath was drawn, a surging run and cross by Claremont’s tall centre-forward was promptly dispatched into the back of the net at the back post.It was a case of backs to the wall for the visitors who, after a number of close shaves, found themselves two behind midway through the first half.This time the damage was self-inflicted, when an innocuous cross from the left was palmed into the path of the incoming striker who scored with ease from close range.The alarm bells now ringing loudly, with  minutes of the half remaining the visitors somehow conjured a goal against the run of play.A breakout by Ryan Deans ended with a fine pass to set up Sary Rhama, whose pace and parting shot almost took the net away.The home side, however, were unrelenting in their efforts and deservedly restored a two-goal cushion with a goal just before the break.A reading of the riot act at half time appeared to have the desired effect as, after a number of changes, both positional and to personnel, the second period produced a whole new ball game.Leading the line from the front, the introduction of Cameron Wylie was the key to the comeback, his unrelenting efforts to close space soon rewarded as his team responded in kind.A quick interchange of passes between Deans and Grumoli brought its reward, leaving the latter free to curl a wonderful shot into the top corner of the net. The comeback was on.Liam Renton joined the act in the th minute of a strange match after a headed clearance met with a flush volley as a superbly struck shot thundered into the net for the equaliser.There was time aplenty for the Pupils to shoot themselves in the foot again, and Claremont regained the initiative when Fraser Wylie mistimed a clearance to send the ball into his own net.At the opposite end – possibly goal of the match.Astothe gesture, a deep free kick from Renton produced another equaliser, the home defence’s attempted clearance rebounding off a fellow team mate and into the net.So came the final moments of the game, with Cameron Wylie again involved.A crunching challenge on Wylie seemed to be an obvious free kick, but the referee waved play on.Gary Grumoli sent an inch perfect pass to the back post, for Ross Brown to score his first team goal and the Pupils# eventual, but by now, deserved winner.In a clf-hanging finish to a game that had everything, Alastair Ferguson produced a wonderful one-handed save to deflect a perfectly struck free kick to safety.Campbeltown Pupils are at home tomorrow with a pm kick off against second-placed Neilston.See posters and social media for further information.A previous celebration for Gary Grumoli and Liam Renton two stars of Saturday#s match. _cpupils_celebration"},{"url":null,"title":"letter perfect bus service","story":"Last week I went to Glasgow, travelling on the .am bus and arrived only  minutes behind schedule despite the Rest and Be Thankful road closure.I was very impressed with West Coast Motors# handling of the situation which must cause transport companies huge logistical problems.Margaret Mathieson,Campbeltown."},{"url":null,"title":"seniors sway at tea dance soiree","story":"Senior citizens and friends were serenaded at the last tea dance of the year.Singer Robert McCallum#s golden oldies got almost everyone dancing at Saturday#s event in Campbeltown#s Lodge St John’s No .At the event organised by the Monday Social Club, guests were also treated to traditional tunes courtesy of Carradale#s Alex MacKinnon and his accordion.It wasn#t just seniors who enjoyed the afternoon, as ten-year-old Hannah Conley, who attended with her granny, Isabel, who turned  on Tuesday, was rarely off the dance floor.The icing on the cake was the copious amounts of home-baking and tea and coffee on offer, making sure everyone who danced the afternoon away remained hydrated.The event raised £ for Monday Social Club funds.For more photographs, see next week#s Courier.Ten-year-old Hannah Conley, right, danced the afternoon away with her granny#s friend Anna Viola. _cteadance"},{"url":null,"title":"down memory lane october 26 2018","story":"In the Courier, of November  ,  years on from Armistice Day, the Remembrance services were reported with six paragraphs on the front page and no pictures.Perhaps this was because the world seemed a more dangerous place.The Vietnam War was at roughly its mid-point and was to continue for another seven years.Horric pictures, shot war photographers such as Don McCuillin and Tim Page, filled #s daily papers and television news.In the UK The Troubles had just begun in Northern Ireland after a civil rights march, on October , led to widespread rioting.That  report states: #Highland Parish Church was the venue for the main service with contingents of ious armed forces and youth organisations parading there.#Unfortunately, the annual service at the War Memorial on the Esplanade had to be cancelled because of inclement weather and the service was held indoor at Victoria Hall.#Representatives of the RAF, the Royal Navy, the TA, Sea Cadets, Boy Scouts, Girl Guides and Army Cadets marched to the Highland Parish Church where Reverend C.

The use of recycling boxes rather than bins and the introduction of food waste caddies has helped the county produce high-quality waste with fewer contaminants, meaning less has to be sent for treatment.Now Mr Reid wants to bring a similar approach to travel in the county as East Lothian prepares for an influx of new residents due to a plethora of new housing developments.And he revealed talks were under way to try and replace the councilrsquos refuse collection vehicles with electric versions as it looks to lead by example.He said: ldquoThe public bought into recycling because we gave them options such as the food waste bins and also because they knew it was the right thing to do.ldquoActive travel will be an evolution but we need to give people access to it. We need to provide cycle paths and safe walkways we need train services to be on time. If we can develop plans to provide these services then people will automatically select not to take the car, just as they will select electric vehicles as they become cheaper too.ldquoIt is about getting the message out and empowering people to be able to do it.The introduction of electric bin lorries would be a huge step towards improving the environment and changing public perception.Some such lorries are being trialled in England by waste recycling firms, with one company in Sheffield introducing two vehicles which are powered by burning non-recyclable rubbish as they collect it.

The remains of the castle are ancient and the oldest part is called Goblin Ha. It is partly underground, and its name means Goblin Hall.According to legend, a wizard named Hugh de Gford made a deal with the Devil nearly  years ago, and inan army of goblins swarmed up from hell and built Yester Castle for him. Goblin Ha is the part of the castle dating from that time and thatrsquos how it got its name.It is said goblins lurk in the shadows of the ruins, and especially in Goblin Ha itself. At sunset, when night falls, they come out of their hiding places and crawl about in the darkness.One autumn day quite recently a dad decided to take his two children on a trip to find Yester Castle. He worked long hours during the week so he kept weekends for his children.His daughter Suzie had just turned  and his son Jake was eight. Jake was mad about Harry Potter and wizards, and when he discovered there was a castle nearby made by goblins for a wizard he begged his dad to take him. Suzie was given the choice to stay at home with her mum, but at the last minute she decided to come.It was sunny when they set off. ldquoA perfect day to explore a castle made by goblins, said the dad jokingly. They parked at the golf course and walked towards the woods.ldquoMaybe the goblins play golf, Suzie joked to her wee brother.ldquoYou shouldnrsquot make fun, they might hear you, he said.They finally reached the edge of the wood and peered into it. Suzie found the bridge over the ravine that led to the ruins but then Jake ran ahead very excited, looking for goblins.It was dficult to imagine what the castle had originally looked like because it was so ruined. Jake said it reminded him of the ancient ruined temple in The Jungle Book movie. But one thing was for sure: it had an eerie atmosphere. As they explored, the dad walked under an archway and suddenly felt a shiver down his spine. He turned round and saw something move in the shadows.For a moment they stood absolutely still. Then a bird flew out, giving them a fright. The dad and Suzie burst into laughter.ldquoJust a stupid bird! said Jake, disappointed.After a careful search they found the entrance to Goblin Ha. It was a small entrance leading to a low, dark passageway. Jake bravely led the way, with his sister and dad close behind.A cold and damp atmosphere hit them as soon as they entered the chamber. Although it was dark, two windows above gave just enough light to see.ldquoSo all this was supposed to have been made by goblins  asked Suzie.ldquoYeah, said Jake, who was still getting over the excitement that he was actually in Goblin Ha, ldquoand they came from hell up that stairway. He pointed to the dark steps in the corner.All three stood peering into the dark stairway which plunged deep into the ground.ldquoAccording to the legend, this stairway was made by the Devil after he had done a deal with the wizard and it leads to hell. But itrsquos blocked up now, explained Jake. He looked at his father: ldquoCan we go down dad, please!ldquoSeems a bit dangerous to me son.ldquoAw, come on dad, said Suzie, ldquowe canrsquot come all this way and then not go down the stairway to hell.ldquoVery well, but Irsquoll go first and wersquoll use the torches on our phones, said the dad.Slowly they began to climb down the stairs. The light from their mobiles lit up the old walls and ancient worn steps as they descended. Suzie took photos in the darkness, although the flash wasnrsquot powerful enough to light up everything.Eventually they reached a point where great stones blocked the way so they couldnrsquot go any further. ldquoThey were put there to keep out the goblins, said Jake. His sister was now feeling a bit uneasy: ldquoCan we go now, dad  Itrsquos too spooky down here.ldquoScared of the goblins are we  her wee brother mocked.ldquoYes, letrsquos go back up, said the dad. Jake led the way up to Goblin Ha. ldquoItrsquos time we should be going, wersquove found the place so mission accomplished. Itrsquoll be dark soon, letrsquos go now while therersquos still good day light.So they left the ruins and walked back across the golf course, laughing and talking and admiring the beginnings of a sunset and a full moon in the darkening sky. They were at the car when Suzie realised she didnrsquot have her mobile phone.ldquoIt was in my back pocket, it mustrsquove fallen out, she insisted.ldquoAw no Suzie, it could be anywhere, her dad said, annoyed.ldquoDad, we have to go back to get it, please. I know I had it in Goblin Ha, it might have even fallen out there. The dad wasnrsquot happy but the mobile was expensive and so reluctantly he agreed.They retraced their steps all the way back to the castle. It had only been  minutes since they had left the ruins but the atmosphere in the dim twilight was very dferent.Finally they reached the entrance to Goblin Ha.ldquoYou go first, dad, said both children at the same time.And so the dad put on his torch and entered. His children followed close behind.When they emerged into Goblin Ha it was dark so the dad shone his torch on the ground, searching. ldquoWhere could you have left it  he asked Suzie.ldquoAnywhere, she replied, shrugging her shoulders.They couldnrsquot phone it as there was no reception, so they kept searching.It was Jake who heard it first: a faint sound coming from the dark stairway. He lted his head and looked in its direction but it was too dark to see anything. There it was again, it sounded like breathing.Jake froze in real terror. ldquoDadhellip he whispered, ldquodad, therersquos something there.ldquoStop it you wee bam, said his sister, ldquoyoursquore just trying to spook us. But then she heard it too. It was louder this time, a strange breathing sound. It was definitely coming from the stairway.Intrigued, the dad shone his light down the steps, although the mobilersquos torch wasnrsquot strong enough to completely light up the dark.Then suddenly a pair of red eyes appeared, staring back at him.The dad screamed, making his two children scream as well, and they instinctively ran for the exit. But it was dark and they couldnrsquot see the way.ldquoDad, for Godrsquos sake shine it over here, cried Suzie, now completely terried.The dad shone the torch and they ran through the passageway in a total panic. Once outside there was more light, from the full moon.ldquoWhy did you scream, you scared the hell out of me! Suzie shouted angrily at her dad.ldquoIrsquom sorry Suzie, it just gave me a fright, I didnrsquot mean to scare you, he said.ldquoWhat gave you a fright, what did you see dad  asked Jake, who was now scared himself despite his earlier bravado.ldquoNot sure really, I thought I saw, erhellipldquoYes, yes what  asked Suzie stretching out her arms impatiently.The dad hesitated, then said: ldquoWell it looked like eyes.ldquoI am now officially freaked out, said Suzie, ldquoplease letrsquos just get out of here, never mind the sodding phone.ldquoIrsquom sure it was some kind of animal, maybe a fox or even an owl, said her dad, trying to reassure her, ldquobut yes itrsquos too dark now, we should go back to the car and maybe we can come back tomorrow in the light to look for your mobile.Jake was suddenly distracted. He saw something in the passageway.ldquoDadhellip dad, whatever it is, itrsquos coming after us, look!The shadow of some creature was in the passageway, moving towards them.Both Suzie and Jake were now in a state of complete terror and they ran.ldquoNo, no, itrsquos dangerous, therersquos a steep fall there, donrsquot run! called out the dad.The kids stopped just in time. In the moonlight they could see they were standing on the edge of a steep fall. Their dad caught up with them and took their hands. They walked together carefully with hearts racing through the trees towards the bridge that led to the golf course.Behind them, a dark shadow came out of the entrance and crawled into the wood.They were just past the arched wall when they saw the dark shadow move in front of them, blocking the way. The dad shone his torch directly at it, and for a split second he saw it before it vanished into the darkness. He looked shocked.ldquoWhat the hell was that, dad  shrieked Suzie.ldquoI honestly donrsquot know, he saidWhatever it was, it was still in the woods, moving in the darkness. Then it came towards them once again, this time making strange noises.Jake suddenly yelled out: ldquoOur father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come thy will be done, in heaven as it is on earthhellip Whatever it was made a sound like a scream and retreated back into the dark wood towards Goblin Ha. Jake continued the prayer and finished with a loud ldquoamen.ldquoLetrsquos get out of here, said the dad. All three ran in the moonlight out of the shadows of the wood onto the golf course. They kept running until they reached the car park, legs aching and completely breathless.The dad fumbled for his keys while the children stared at the golf course, looking for a moving shadow.Finally the dad found his keys and they were in the car and away as fast as possible.Suzie was the first to speak: ldquoI ask again, what was it ldquoI think the dark was playing tricks on us, said her dad, ldquoit was an animal of some sort.ldquoBut what about that horrible scream  she asked.ldquoFoxes can make a strange screeching noise at night, Suzie, thatrsquos what I think it was, said her dad, trying to reassure her.ldquoIt was a goblin, wasnrsquot it dad  asked Jake.ldquoAye right, replied his sister sarcastically, ldquoyou read too much Harry Potter. And what was all that praying about  That was just weird.ldquoIt was a redcap goblin, said Jake, ldquoyou canrsquot outrun them and the Lordrsquos Prayer is the only thing that will stop them. I had memorised it before our visit, just in case.ldquoHowrsquod you know that  asked SuzieldquoI read about it, said Jake.Suzie was just about to say something when her dad winked at her and interrupted: ldquoWellit was a redcap then the prayer seemed to work. He hoped this would stop them arguing. And it did. Jake smiled and put on his earphones.ldquoIrsquom sure it was a fox, whispered the dad to his daughter, ldquoor maybe a big rat, but just let Jake think it was a goblin.They got home with a story to tell their mum!In a quiet moment, when the children were busy, she asked the dad: ldquoSo what was it you saw He hesitated to answer the question, ashe wouldnrsquot be believed.ldquoTo be honest, I donrsquot know, he said. ldquoI told the kids it was a fox because I didnrsquot want to spook them, but I really canrsquot say.Who knows the truth of it all  If Suziersquos phone is ever found, the photos she took in the dark stairway might reveal what was really hiding in the darkness on that day."},{"url":null,"title":"be-prepared-for-next-beast-from-the-east-says-council-emergency-planner","story":"Severe weather is the biggest risk to people living in East Lothian, according to Sandy Baptie.And he has issued advice ahead of a one-day workshop to help communities prepare for any future emergencies.It includes going back to old-fashioned handsets in a time when more people rely on mobile phones.Mr Baptie, East Lothian Councilrsquos emergency planning, risk and resilience manager, has been visiting community councils and groups in the wake of the lsquoBeast from the Eastrsquo snowstorm, which brought much of the country to a standstill in February and March this year.Heavy snowfalls and strong winds caused chaos on the roads and left many people stranded in their homes.It also saw a surge in community spirit, with tales of people helping neighbours and looking after the more vulnerable people.Now Mr Baptie is hoping that spirit will help all communities prepare a Community Resilience Plan which they can use in case another severe weather front hits the county.And he has issued some advice for people to prepare in their own home for what could happen.He said: ldquoSevere weather is the biggest risk to East Lothian.ldquoBeing prepared for it is important and people can do things themselves, such as keeping an old-fashioned phone in their house in case mobile signal is lost, having a torch to hand in case power goes.ldquoIt is also important to stock up on food when warnings that severe weather is on its way are issued.More than  people are expected to attend the community resilience workshop at The Brunton, Musselburgh, on Saturday.The one-day event, which is being funded by EDF Energy and the Scottish Government, will bring together representatives from community councils, groups and schools.Advice on a range of aspects of drawing up community resilience plans will be available, including ensuring groups who take on responsibility are covered by insurance.It will also inform people of services they can sign up to with energy companies to ensure they receive a phone callpower goes out.North Berwick Community Council, which already has a plan and implemented it successfully during the Beast from the East, will be there to talk about how they did it and what worked.Mr Baptie hopes the event will result in community plans from across the county, with each one appointing a Single Person of Contact or SPOC.He said: ldquoThe idea of a SPOC is that there is one point of contact between each community and the council so we can get information to them and they can let us know what is happening, for examplepower has gone out in one area.ldquoThe plans are about drawing up lists of vulnerable people in the community, finding out who has a x and can get medicine to people or take them to hospital or the doctor.ldquoIt is about being prepared.

This is a very concerning piece of news, especially given the fact that the Tesco bus also serves the health centre.ldquoIt comes at a time when we are being told that we need to use public transport more because of dire warnings about the impact of climate change and when massive house building will lead to gridlock unless newcomers can be persuaded onto buses.Mr Turner added: ldquoEast Lothian generally, and Musselburgh in particular, is now renowned for its excellent bus services so this announcement comes as a blow and runs counter to all that has been achieved on the public transport front in the last few of years.ldquoLetrsquos hope that the council, working with the operators, can come up with a proposal to replace the extremely useful Tesco bus, and in doing so letrsquos try to serve some places that are currently remote from buses ndash Edenhall Road and the Muckletts, for example, both had buses until a few years ago and theirwould, I am sure, be welcomed by elderly residents.ldquoI think the Tesco bus should be replaced by something very similar, perhaps marketed as the Musselburgh community bus.

He had major announcements to make, on the abolition of PFI and a tax on digital companies to name but two, but these could have been delivered at any time.As a result, he sounded less like a Chancellor delivering a coherent Budget than a politician filling time before the main event. For once, we do not mean the next Tory leadership contest. The main event, the only event, last month, next month, and for the foreseeable future, is Brexit.When he did refer to the UK exiting the EU on March  next year it was to say he was putting slightly more money into the pot to deal with contingencies. The only nod to the enormity of what will soon be taking place was when he referred to the possibility of upgrading next yearrsquos Spring Statement to a ldquofull fiscal eventnecessary.In other words, should the UK look like it will crash out of the EU without a deal ndash good, bad, or middling ndash Mr Hammond may have to revise his plans entirely. How he squares this with promises that the spending increases announced yesterday will go ahead regardless of the Brexit deal is dficult to see. A no deal Brexit will change everything, utterly.Why, then, was Mr Hammond, and before him Theresa May, the Prime Minister, so keen to frame this as an end of austerity Budget  Mrs May had shown the way in her party conference speech when she said austerity ldquois over. Mr Hammond preferred to cast things slightly further into the future, saying austerity was coming to an end. Beginning of the end, or the end of the beginning, both were sending a message that after a decade of thorny times, a rosier era lay ahead.For those living with the consequences of austerity, all this talk of consigning the policy to history will seem like a joke in the poorest of taste. Such has been the extent of the cuts in public spending and the lack of real, consistent growth in wages, that it could take a generation at least until people are back to the position they were in ten years ago. Those at the sharp end of benefit changes and public spending cuts, happening here and now, have every right to wonder why anyone should be talking about an end to austerity when they are living with its effects day in, day out.Looked at from a dferent angle, this Budget did have clear aim. Its first, and least important purpose, was to show the Chancellor was still alive and well. For Mr Hammond, who has had more of a no profile lately than a low one, this was his chance to show that he remains a force to be reckoned with should the party war between hard Brexiters and Remainers take a turn for the even nastier. This weekrsquos Budget has allowed Mr Hammond to present himself as a man with a plan and this Government as an administration working towards an orderly and successful Brexit. The message to Conservative MPs is clear: do not wreck this. Stop fighting for a deal that is not there to be had, work with us on Brexit, and all of this economic bounty can be ours. More spending with no need for tax rises, the impossible made possible due to healthy economic growth, the kind that only a soft landing Brexit can achieve.Much rests on Mr Hammondrsquos growth hopes. Yet even with forecasts revised slightly upwards, UK growth remains modest. The Chancellor spoke yesterday of a ldquojobs miracle. What he really needs is a productivity miracle and this Budget does nothing to bring that about.But that is long-term thinking, andthis Budget was anything it was a short-term fix, one designed to keep the warring Tory tribes together for fear that something worse will come along: a Labour Government. Mr Hammond had a lot to offer there too, however. He spoke of the Prime Minister stealing a couple of rabbits out of his hat by announcing money for the NHS and a continued freeze on fuel duty. Just as she had ldquoborrowed from him, so Mr Hammond reached into Labourrsquos policy pocket and helped himself to a pledge to abolish the Private Finance Initiative and introduce a tax on digital behemoths. The most daring theft of all was declaring an end to austerity. If the Conservatives can do all that and maintain fiscal discipline, why would anyone want to take a chance of Labour getting into power Mr Hammond sat down yesterday with the cheers of Tory backbenchers ringing in his ears. He clearly does not believe the old saw about Budgets that are received well initially becoming the ones that soon fall apart. He is right to be confident, because in the cold light of day this will seem like a Budget written on the air, a statement laced with promises and predictions that might come true, and might not. If they do not, Mr Hammond will escape blame. It is enough, from his point of view, to point the way to the sunlit uplands. How the country gets there is down to others. He has done his bit.He passes the parcel back to Mrs May and the music plays on, a little tinnier than before."},{"url":null,"title":"historic-images-of-leith-reveal-the-port-in-its-heyday","story":"THEY show Edinburghrsquos historic Port of Leith as it once was hardworking and bustling with ships on their way to the four corners of the globe.And for campaigners currently arguing against the increasing redevelopment of the area, they will bring a pang of regret for a once buoyant industrial age and tight-knit community that has gradually disappeared.Hundreds of fascinating images of a lost way of le in the capitalrsquos increasingly gentried and redeveloped quarter of Leith were discovered in Edinburghrsquos Central and Leith libraries, tucked inside more than a dozen painstakingly compiled volumes spanning decades.They had been gathered by local historian, Dr James Scott Marshall, who displayed remarkable foresight by saving dozens of photographs, postcards and newspaper cuttings depicting daily le in what was once Edinburghrsquos gateway to the globe.The forgotten images include grainy black and white photographs showing clusters of steamers and sailing ships at berth on The Shore - today a tourist hotspot and home to Michelin star restaurants, shops and galleries.Many capture the people of the port going about their business, either working in the once thriving shipyards, enjoying a game of golf on Leith Links, proudly showing off their Clydesdale horses or outside their shops.Some will remind Leithers of what once was ndash and what is on the way: images include workers laying tram tracks to link the port with the city centre.Others provide a captivating glimpse of long-lost buildings and once packed sugar and whisky bond warehouses which once defined the historic port and are now either upmarket homes or offices.The eclectic assortment of images and ephemera provides a snapshot of social history thatrsquos a world away from the portrsquos modern hipster image, with its trendy cafes, Michelin star restaurants and tourist attractions.The collection has now been repaired and digitised to create Leith Miscellany, an online exhibition currently featuring on Edinburgh Libraries, Museums and Galleriesrsquo Capital Collections website.Clare Padgett, a library development leader who worked on the  plus images, said that while some are familiar images from the likes of pioneering photographer David Octavius Hill, others havenrsquot been previously seen and there are no details of where they came from or who took them.ldquoThe collection is really quite erse, she says. ldquoSome images had some information written alongside, but in others we really have had nothing to go on.ldquoThey were kept in shop-bought photograph albums, almost like a scrapbook, with postcards and photographs alongside press cuttings.ldquoDr Marshall was well known in Leith and had written many books about the portrsquos history.

Weve now turned a corner and we are able to give Britain a bit of good news.\"The Chancellor suggested that a good Brexit deal could trigger more tax cuts and increased public service spending.\"Because there will be a benefit to the economy from getting that deal, I hope we will be able to do a little bit better still than I set out yesterday, with a bit more money for public services when we have our spending review next year, and perhaps a bit more available going forward for some more tax cuts.\"His Labour Shadow John McDonnell claimed the Budget could indeed signal a general election ahead.He told ITVs Good Morning Britain: \"The Tories usually do this.

He has abandoned any idea of getting to budget balance by the mid-s.\"Mr Johnson said there were big increases in NHS spending over the coming years but \"he hasnt found any money\" for other public services.Mr Hammond responded by noting how the budget deficit would decline in every year of the forecast period and declared: \"We retain an ambition to balance the budget.\"He dismissed suggestions that he had chopped down the \"magic money tree\" and burnt the lot.The Chancellor told Today: \"You are painting a picture here that is designed to show that Im abandoning fiscal rectitude. Im not.\"He defended his decision to increase income-tax thresholds in a way which benefited the wealthy more than the worse-off.Many middle-income workers in schools, hospitals and police services had been dragged into the higher rate of tax, noted Mr Hammond, adding: \"Its important to raise all of these thresholds.One effect of raising the p higher rate of tax threshold from next year to pound, for middle earners south of the border means the tax dferentials between England and Scotland are growing as the Scottish Government introduces its own rates and bands.Derek Mackay, the Scottish Finance Secretary, is due to give his Budget in December. He argued that his changes earlier this year to the Scottish tax system, including introducing a new p starter rate, made income tax north of the border more progressive.But his Conservative opponents complained that Scotland was already the ldquohighest taxed part of the UK and insisted the case for more SNP tax rises in the Scottish Government forthcoming Budget was unsustainable.Asked about the widening gap on income tax between Scotland and England, the PMrsquos spokeswoman simply referred reporters to the Treasury.Askedthere was any concern that the dfering tax systems across the border were weakening the Union, she pointed to a range of measures in the Budget, which benefited all corners of the UK.The policies announced in Mr Hammonds third economic statement amounted to a poundbn loosening of the purse-strings over a six-year period.But the spectre of a no-deal Brexit hung over the -minute speech with the Office for Budget Responsibility warning that failure to reach agreement with Brussels would hit the economy hard.A disorderly Brexit \"could have severe short-term implications for the economy, the exchange rate, asset prices and the public finances\", warned the Governments independent forecaster. The scale would be very hard to predict, it noted, given the lack of precedent.\"Setting out his income tax cuts, the Chancellor not only mentioned the threshold rise for the higher rate of income tax but also said the personal allowance would rise to pound, from April .

They have been addressed.A Whitbread spokesman said yesterday that the company is working with Highland Council to ensure \"all the relevant data and supporting information\" is made available.\"We understand the application will go before the planning committee in November,\" he said.The proposed hotel has attracted  representations from the public ndash both in favour and against.Local hoteliers and other accommodation providers claim a Premier Inn would affect trade and result in local job losses, while supporters say it would boost tourism and greatly improve the site which has been described as an eyesore.Earlier this year, Caithness Chamber of Commerce warned that the project would have \"a signicant negative impact\" on other businesses and the town centre.But retired local businessman Andy Bruce, who ran Far North Aviation at Wick airport for  years, supports the proposed development at the former mart site in Ormlie Road.Caithness is \"screaming out\" for more hotel accommodation, he said.Mike Potts, chairman of Thurso Community Council, also backed the plan. \"It will utilise the site properly, provide further amenities and will tidy up an area which desperately needs it,\" he said.\"I know theres opposition from other hoteliers and accommodation providers but Premier offers a very basic service which is cost-effective and would be accessible by rail.\"However, Mr Potts said the hotel plan could \"compound the existing traffic problem\" in that part of Thurso and says planners should address this.Whitbread has applied for a three-storey hotel with landscaping and car parking.If approved, it would be the most northerly Premier Inn in the UK.The development would represent a multimillion-pound investment and create around  jobs.The site was owned by Tesco, which planned to build a new supermarket, but the project was later scrapped.

We all love it.\"Gill Arrowsmith and Shirley Sinclair both thought the painting was \"fantastic\" while Annemarie Simpson thought that a similar venture in Wick would help tackle the \"towns eyesore\" buildings.While on that subject, one dissenting voice condemned the piece and said there was a \"masterpiece eyesore now in Wilson Street thanks to Caithness Horizons\".Beauty is, of course, in the eye of the beholder.The mural depicts a portrait of Thursos renowned botanist and geologist Robert Dick surrounded by a kaleidoscopic representation of the CHMAG facade and the scientists specimen collection.The bold use of line and colour based on modern urban graffiti cannot fail to be noticed just like the mural on nearby Tollemache House but is sited in a much less conspicuous space ndash the gallerys car park.CHMAGs curator Merran Gunn, who was instrumental in commissioning Delaye to create the work, said the artist had also spray painted a wall within the building as part of a show running called Graffito.His earlier piece has an explosive anime style figure punching out of the wall toward the viewer.\"Marcs work is bold and vibrant, electric colours jostle for dominance, and the new outside mural is no exception with tangerine skies set behind the historic Thurso of Robert Dick,\" said Gunn.Thursos illustrious scientist had his herbarium collection feature in an earlier work by the artist Joanne Carr which in turn is featured within Delayes mural ndash a clear case of one artist paying homage to another.\"Graffiti and street art is more relevant than ever whether it be in the art world ndash with the recent record sale of Banksys girl with a balloon ndash or here in the Highlands where graffiti has made its way onto the syllabus at Farr High School through art teacher Tracy Wilkinson,\" she said.After garnering great positive feedback from the current show Merran decided to \"have a moment of spontaneity\" and raised funds through a crowdfunding website and the Dounreay Communities Fund to commission Marc Delaye to breath some le into a fairly drab corner of the town.Tracy Dodson, commercial manager of CHMAG, said that the gallery was \"breaking boundaries\" with Graffito.\"It questions what actually constitutes art and what gets shown in a gallery. Graffito is an exhibition that celebrates artwork that is available to everyone.\"Traditionally graffiti has been seen as anti-social, fringe or even as criminal vandalism, but with an emphasis on social inclusion, we are celebrating street, pop, comic and zine work as mainstream art for hanging in our gallery.\"Tracy unabashedly declares that Graffito is \"aimed at young people and the young at heart, as a way of inviting new and future audiences to a museum and gallery experience\".\"This is a multicoloured on-the-wall exhibition devoted to all manner of graphic mark-making and breaking the boundaries of what art is all about,\" she said. \"We have also hosted street painting and comic workshops, guided gallery tours, and collaborating with our local schools and council.\"Marc Delaye is an established community projects artist with Freshpaint.org which is based on the Black Isle.\"Murals are as alive now as ever before and an excellent way to introduce art to internal and external spaces, giving iniduals and communities something that they can be proud of and enjoy each and every day,\" said Marc.The murals can be privately commissioned and can be an \"ideal means of advertising products, services, messages and campaigns\".Other exhibitors at Graffito include Andy Strachan, of Comic Creations Studios Dundee, David Robertson of Fred Egg Comics and Zu Dominak, all of whom work at the University of Dundee within the Masters degrees in Comics and Graphic Novels ndash the only course of its kind in the UK.Other exhibitors include Victor Nobis and his series Fallen Giants ndash a fantasy dream space where cities like Edinburgh rise and twist through the torso of neon lit giant figures.Graffito finishes on Saturday with a day of childrens workshops, guided tours and a colouring competition.Wednesday  Oct  : PM"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"October ,  at : pmAn animated film commissioned to help mark the centenary of the armistice is set to be projected onto the St Magnus Cathedral for the first time.

This is not some dry, academic debate. The potential health consequences of ministers failing to heed the advice of their own experts are serious.“I hope the Health Secretary will use her influence, therefore, to persuade her colleague, the Housing Minister, to accept the case for using a Rural Minimum Income Standard to help define fuel poverty in rural and island areas.  This is the only way of ensuring those who need help get the support they need.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Now in its seventh consecutive season, the Sanday Sealcam is online once again.A camera has been set up overlooking two small coves in a part of the island that is rarely visited — except by seals, otters, rabbits and birds.Set up with the kind permission of local landowners, the Towrie family, the camera is linked to a radio dish that transmits the signal, by line of sight, to a distant receiving dish, and the apparatus is powered by solar batteries — and this year for the first time, a supplementary wind-generator # at the site.Here, the live action is streamed to the internet and can be watched by anyone who logs on to the sealcam website.Sandra Towrie, Chair of Sanday Development Trust said: “Sanday Development Trust is delighted to work with Triscom as it is a hard task to stream the camera using remote, rural broadband and get high-quality live footage successfully being streamed onto the web. The Sanday sealcam allows visitors a unique opportunity to see Orkney’s amazing wildle up close and personal, and follow the highs and lows of an Orkney seal colony during pupping season from the comfort of their armchair — perfect for those unable to visit the island in person.”In recent years, Northlink Ferries have part-sponsored the Sealcam, while Sanday Development Trust continues to fund repairs, replacements and maintenance of the equipment and the time involved in camera control.Thousands of people, from all over the world, have looked at Sanday Sealcam.

At the moment I am in touch with an old colleague who has done work like this in the past.\"It would be good to see the bridge reinstated, as it is a worthwhile amenity and opens up the walk around the town giving access to the bird le on the mud flats.\"Every week, the question is asked by somebody, lsquowhen will the bridge be reopenedrsquo and we would love to give them a date but for now all we can do is open a crowdfunding page to seewe can try and make it happen ourselves.\"Similarly, we need to raise funds for a survey on the MacDonald Monument. In order to try and open the to satisfy the Highland Councilrsquos many conditions for safe access.\"These are both long-running issues, whichthey came to fruition, would be assets to the town.\"The community council remains committed to seeing both of these projects through to completion and with the help of Highland Council and the local population we see no reason why this cannot be achieved.\"According to Mr Shepherd the plans are to replace a large part of the bridge with \"old recycled crane boom sections and hopefully, my contact can find some more to help out with the project to replace the old bridge over the canal.\"Fellow member of Dingwall Community Council, George Murray, said: \"There have been so many complaints regarding the bridge being closed that the issue has been constantly on the community council agenda.\"Itrsquos an important feature of the lsquoRound Dingwall walkrsquo and needs to be repaired and reopened.\"We have an area of scenic beauty that the public cannot access without walking along and crossing over the railway tracks.He added: \"Whilst I appreciate that the Highland Council seem to be having trouble funding anything outside of Inverness, this should not be a lsquobridge too farrsquo and we will be looking at all ways to fund the repair which could be helped by the Dingwall Common Good Fundpossible.\"Wednesday  Oct  : PMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The Highland Council appreciate the work by Network Rail to introduce this innovative solution.\"Despite the reducedof daytime closure windows the road will remain shut each night from pm to am.

The move is believed to be a first in Scotland.“They refused to teach them because they’d been assaulted so many times”, said a school source. “There’s just no control.”The eight students are understood to have spent last week in a class together with seven pupil support assistants.“The headteacher told the teachers on Monday morning they weren’t allowed in the school. This is the first time this has ever happened in Scotland. A teacher has refused to teach one kid before but never eight,” added the school source.But an Edinburgh City Council source said the issue was a red line that was “discriminating against disabled children”. They added: “You cannot pick and choose which disabled children you provide a service for”.Union bosses are set to meet with education secretary John Swinney tomorrow about the situation, after negotiations with the council broke down.Chris Keates, NASUWT general secretary, labelled the council’s action as “one of the most disturbing cases I have ever experienced of an employer failing in its duty of care”.She said: “The teachers, and indeed other pupils at the school have, month after month, faced violent physical assaults, a constant stream of verbal abuse and threats and malicious allegations. Equipment has been smashed and classrooms trashed.“Rather than supporting the teachers to deal with these pupils, Edinburgh City Council instead has embarked on a campaign of aggressive and punitive actions towards the teachers, simply because they have dared to stand up for what is right.”Staff experienced with working with children with special needs have been brought in to cover the absentees. The council is appealing for the union to come back to the negotiation table and has written to parents to update them on the situation.A council spokesman said: “As a local authority, we have a duty to provide education to all children in Edinburgh. We are also committed to ensuring our teachers and other staff are fully supported to deliver the excellent level of education children and young people have a right to expect.“We continually review how we can support our teachers in what at times can be challenging places to work. An improvement action plan for Kaimes School has been developed in consultation with staff and subject to external expert scrutiny. This is in the very early stages of being implemented and would urge everyone to work with us as we take this plan forward. “The council has been trying to engage with NASUWT at all levels to discuss any concerns they have and we are disappointed that they have failed to respond positively to date and decided on this course of action. We cannot have a situation where staff decide who they are and who they are not willing to teach as this would be contrary to their terms of employment.“We remain committed to working with staff to ensure we improve attainment and wellbeing while also delivering a positive working environment for both teachers and pupils. This is part of the council’s commitment to put inclusion at the heart of everything we do and we want the staff involved and the NASUWT to sit down with us as soon as possible to resolve this situation.”©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4822542.1541002244!/image/image.jpg","title":"nicola sturgeon announced 700k investment for circular economy","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...More than #, will be invested by the Scottish Government to help boost the country#s circular economy.First Minister Nicola Sturgeon made the announcement in an address to the Circular Economy Hotspot event in Glasgow on Wednesday.Businesses in the circular economy aim to reduce waste and invest in keeping materials in circulation for as long as possible.Three businesses - Total Homes and Revive Eco, located in Glasgow, and Angus D, based in Tayside - will receive funding.Total Homes deliver house clearances for Housing Associations in Glasgow and ensure household appliances, furniture and other goods are re-used.They will be given £, worth of funding.Revive Eco, which collects used coffee grounds and recycles them to create high value bio-oils, will receive £,.Angus D, which aims to bring the latest metal D printing technology to Scotland, will be given a total of £,.Scotland has four circular economy regions: Circular Glasgow, Circular Edinburgh, Circular Tayside and Circular North East - with each working on projects tailored to local opportunities. - Tests carried out on four cows culled at farm with BSE caseAnalysis suggests that a circular approach by businesses could be worth a potential £ billion to the north-east and Tayside economies.Reports were produced with the assistance of the local chambers of commerce to evaluate the impact it could have in each area of Scotland.The First Minister said: “Moving to a circular economy -and this I think is true of many issues relating to the environment and climate change - is, first and foremost, an overwhelming moral imperative. However as these reports very powerfully demonstrate it is also a massive economic opportunity.“And it also, in my view, speaks to Scotland’s history, to our sense of our identity.”Iain Gulland, the chief executive of Zero Waste Scotland, said: “It’s fantastic to be able to profile the work that’s being done in Scotland to kickstart the circular economy to a global audience.“Businesses like Revive Eco, Angus D and Total Homes are already doing great things, and I hope this event will be an impetus for even more ambition”.Glasgow City Council leader Susan Aitken welcomed the investment and highlighted her ambition for Glasgow to become Scotland’s first circular city.She said: “The opportunity for Scotland in embracing the circular economy runs into the billions of pounds. I want Glasgow to be at the forefront of seizing that opportunity.“The work done by the Chamber of Commerce and Zero Waste Scotland in Circular Glasgow has already put us far ahead of most of our competitors but the opportunities really are limitless. - ‘Tory-free’ wish banned from Edinburgh  word cloud after party complaint“Our Route Map will point a way to building better homes and communities, reducing food insecurity and playing our part in dealing with the world’s addiction to single use plastic.“Increasing the number of homes powered by renewable or circular energy to % by  is an ambitious target but we will need to be ambitious in the coming years.”©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4821833.1540908786!/image/image.jpg","title":"cameron wyllie teachers now are better than the past s real characters","story":"Modern teachers are, for the most part, much better than their counterparts  years ago despite the rose-tinted memories of many in middle age about their school days.According to our age, and thus our distance from the reality, our school days are viewed through lenses both distorted and coloured, often of a rosy tint. In particular, we memorialise our teachers, and we can end up eulogising people who we didn’t actually like very much at the time. Or, indeed, learn much from – the eccentric the easily erted the overly strict the ‘real character’. Time and time again, we hear people in middle age talking about how great their teachers were. I do it too – I became an English teacher because I was taught by a great English teacher, James Caw, now sadly gone – a clever, humane andwitty man, who indisputably changed the whole direction of my le and led me to a career that I loved .The truth of the matter, though, is that for all this sentiment, those of us who haven’t been schoolchildren for a while have to face the fact – teachers are a great deal better today than they were , ,  years ago. There are exceptions on both sides, but today’s teaching profession is just that – professional: better trained, better scrutinised and better organised. It’s much more dficult to get into teaching these days. In  when I graduated, I just walked into Moray House College to train – one application form did the trick. These days it’s a tough day’s interviewing, group work, assessments and you have to be better qualied to start with. In the later stages of my career, I watched lots of young teachers teach, just turning up in their classrooms unannounced to save them from buying fireworks. Almost without exception their lessons were painstakingly prepared, ied and thought through, and entirely relevant. : Cameron Wyllie: Face the facts, some kids are just smarter than othersI remember telling one young maths teacher thatshe had taught me, I would have been a maths teacher . Someone like me – dependent on telling lots of jokes, slapdash with my diary and not exactly up to speed with IT – wouldn’t cut the mustard these days, for all my passion and confidence. Nowhere is this truer than in the area now called the ‘expressive arts’. When, years ago, the powers that be decided that there were too many heads of department in schools, they invented a faculty system to save money which absolutely nobody liked. So the scientists, for example, were all lumped together, which to the layman might seem fine, but try telling a physicist that a biologist is now in charge! So art, music and drama were pushed into a boat and again that might seem sensible enough, but they had to put PE somewhere and so the PE teachers all climbed aboard So please think about the people who taught you these subjects years back. In my case, I was in a boys’ school, so while we got to do plays, there was no professional drama teaching, presumably on the grounds that drama was considered, in essence, an effeminate pursuit . However, in art, in music and in PE, there was, at least as I understand the word, not really any ‘teaching’ at all. In the art class of my youth we tried to draw things, and, to misquote Macbeth, “ we failed, we failed’. My art teacher in S was a young guy and he, sensing my hopelessness, used to sit and talk to me about pop music indeed he sold me some albums cheap. It might have been better, all things considered,he had explained why the people in my pictures all looked like balloons. : Cameron Wyllie: SNP seems to think school is like a Coke advertI could sing, so music was better, where the kindly but ancient teacher went round the class of -year-olds saying “you can sing”, and “please stop singing” until he had the choir picked – those who couldn’t sing just sat and read. And, most parlous of all was PEwhere great kindness was shown towards me in my capacity as a skinny wee uncoordinated ... oh I don’t know what the word is. I remember once Mr Hastie, a very fine man, becoming exasperated during a game of rounders and shouting, “Wyllie, you don’t throw a ball like that!”, marching over and showing me how to hold the bloody thing which I then, of course, could throw from that point on. It was a rare momentof ... teaching.How times have changed. A few years ago in my capacity as a senior manager I was selected to “quality assure” the work of the PE department. I have no idea why. Anyway I found myself one brisk November day watching a group ofgirls being taught in the school playground. I was, I’m sure, unobserved in my observation, while they started off on a run, and then watched while the teacher, rather than standing smoking a fag like the teachers of my youth, ran beside the slowest girl, and encouraged her along, stopping with her to take a break, then took them inside and started coaching them in volleyball skills. What dferent days it could have been for those of us, as Janis Ian puts it, “whose names were never called, when choosing sides for basketball”. The same is true in art and in music, where the warm kindness of the teachers flows through the room while they teach the necessary skills to write a mazurka, or make a pot or design a dress or play a xylophone where talent is recognised and appreciated, but where the talentless at least learn something. And everyone does drama too! So today I take my hat offto teachers of the “expressive arts” – thank you for letting the children of Scotland express themselves.

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds.

The - scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.Molloy’s introduction  minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubtanyone  in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.But the damage had been done in the first half – at - down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.Some have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.I felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.Two years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a - defeat in Kirkwall.There is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s th birthday.It’s just a pity we have to wait a whole  months until a chance of revenge.: : : : : : : :A couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.There are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.A score of - was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.The Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.A few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.I would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.: : : : : : : :Orkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening#s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John CouttsThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over  guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.Unfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.The speeches which followed,anyone could hear what was being said, were on the y side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.It was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.Sinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous  game when he hit the back of the net five times in the - victory.: : : : : : : :And finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.On Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.Helped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.Robert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did -odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.The others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.The final score was a - win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate - football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"no shortage of goals in action packed weekend ","story":"There was loads of football action on Saturday with LK Galaxy claiming a convincing win against Tizers to win the Association Cup.Final score was an incredible -, with no fewer than five goals coming from Jordan Thomason.Meanwhile, the contest for the County Shield was won by Ness at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick.

The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"whalsays new research arrives in lerwick for first time ","story":"The Research leaves Symbister with bunting flying as she heads for Lerwick on Saturday.

It is good news which is tempered by the fact that this busy, bustling route is now served only by whatever ships CalMac can spare, when the tide permits them, while its purpose-built vessel, the MV #Coruisk#, which can dock at Armadale in all tidal conditions, is ploughing between Mull and Oban  nautical miles away.If CalMac had the ships, Mallaig Armadale would be dependable and therefore even busier, Mull would have a vessel of its own and almost everybody would be happy.CalMac do not have the ships in large part because two new deep-sea vessels which were commissioned in  from Ferguson Marine Engineering at Port Glasgow show no sign of turning up for duty.One of them is due to operate on CalMac#s busiest passenger route between Ardrossan and Arran. The other is to work between Uig, Tarbert and Lochmaddy, which last year carried almost , people.The delivery date for those two ships has been put back twice. On each occasion, the £ million contract to Ferguson Marine — which is the property of one of the Scottish Government#s friends, advisors and allies, the billionaire tax exile Jim McColl — was topped up by a multi-million-pound handout from the public purse.If all was on schedule at least one of those ships would now be in service, and CalMac would have substantially more leeway in manoeuvring its fleet from one part of the west coast to another. They might even be able to keep the #Coruisk# on the Sound of Sleat.They are very far from on schedule. The new Ardrossan Arran ferry is now supposed to be delivered next summer, and the new Uig Tarbert Lochmaddy ship in spring .Will they be delivered  Or will we experience a third delay, which would certainly plunge CalMac into even greater chaos as its ageing fleet breaks down or requires routine maintenance somewhere in the Baltic Those are important questions. As we reported last week, the chief executive of Outer Hebrides Tourism, Rob MacKinnon, has criticised the Scottish Government for a lack of any #tangible action# to address the islands# ferry problems.The Scottish transport ministry, said Mr MacKinnon, must #pursue all feasible options to increase ferry capacity in both the long and the short term for the benefit of both visitors and islanders#.As we report this week, Labour#s Western Isles# candidate Alison MacCorquodale has added her voice to the many demanding to know the precise terms of the private finance initiative deal which has bound the Scottish Government into using just one ferry for all passengers and freight between Ullapool and Stornoway, with unacceptable consequences.Ullapool Stornoway may not yet carry as many tourists as Mallaig Armadale. But it is the definition of a leline service, with , passengers last year, many of whom found themselves unable to squeeze onto an overbooked #Loch Seaforth#.We should be told how and why one of our biggest and most important ferries came to be owned by Lloyds Bank.We should be toldJim McColl is going to deliver two badly-needed ships at the third time of asking.It is not enough to say, as does transport minister Michael Matheson, that building CalMac#s ferries is #providing vital support to our shipbuilding industry#The way things are going, building and rebuilding CalMac#s ferries will keep Scottish shipbuilding alive well into the next decade. Their higher purpose, and Mr Matheson#s job is to provide vital support to the Hebridean ferry service. That support is urgently required."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/2018-mod-gold-medals-e1539885405814.jpg","title":"thursday at the mod skye and lochalsh gold medal","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThere was a Skye and Lochalsh double in the premier singing competition at this year’s National Mòd in Dunoon.In Wednesday night’s final Ceitidh Campbell from Kyle of Lochalsh won the women’s Gold Medal, while the men’s medal went to Ruairidh Cormack from Portree.Both singers are following in family footsteps in landing the prestigious honour, which is presented by Mòd organisers An Comunn Gàidhealach.Ceitidh’s mother, Barbara Smith, won the Gold Medal when the Mòd was held in Skye in .

Published by LilliputPress, Dublin. Price hardback €. Like Fenianism itself, this book hadmodest beginnings but grew to cover all of Ireland, a good part ofthe globe and half a century. Eva Ó Cathaoir began a study ofFenians in Tipperary which has evolved into one of the mostcomprehensive and important scholarly works on the Irish RepublicanBrotherhood yet published. If the film ‘Black ’ is a storyof revenge set during the Great Hunger, the phenomenon of Fenianismarose to a great extent as a political response to that colossalcrime against the Irish people by the landlord system and the Britishregime. But there was far more involved than simple vengeance.Fenianism was a democratic movement, consciously in the tradition ofthe United Irish leaders of the s, and rejecting privilege andclass distinction. In  the IRB staged the funeral of TerenceBellew McManus and brought many thousands of people onto the streets.The working-class character of the movement was clear from thisdemonstration and the author quotes the following from the haughtysnobs of the ‘KilkennyModerator’, lamenting the absence of the‘great and the good’ from the procession:“When we look back to the O’Connellgatherings or even the Young Ireland ‘Confederation’ assemblies,and remember the array of names, of borough magistrates, professionalmen and traders, accustomed to put forward as representing Kilkennyon such occasions, we cannot but view in the most ludicrous light,this miserable farce of an ‘imposing demonstration.’” The recent visit of the Pope reviveddebate among Irish republicans about the role of the Roman CatholicChurch in Irish politics. This book shows again that, with very fewexceptions, the hierarchy abhorred the IRB for its democratic andrepublican principles and the ‘princes of the Church’ fearedFenian inculcation of their ‘flocks’ with a sense ofindependence, no longer reliant on clerical and aristocratic leadersto guide them. Such guidance had led to catastrophe during the GreatHunger as the passivity preached by Daniel O’Connell and thebishops facilitated the peaceful passage of food out of a starvingcountry.Students of Irish history will befamiliar with the story of the Fenian leadership on both sides of theAtlantic, abortive rebellion and invasion, the internecine disputesand personality clashes. This book recounts all that but it goes muchdeeper. For example it tells of the Fenian women, whose storiessurely need to be rediscovered. They were treated as subordinates bymost of their male comrades but many played important roles. It was atime of deep chauvinism with even otherwise progressive Fenians suchas John Boyle O’Reilly opposing votes for women. The book covers all aspects ofFenianism and a great part of its value is in its first Appendix‘Biographies of Munster and Kilkenny Fenians’ which providesbrief profiles of , rank and file Fenians. I have never beforeseen any ‘Roll of Honour’ of the IRB but this is now providedwith a list of ‘Fenian Casualties -’ while the book closes,appropriately, with a list of Fenian monuments in Ireland andManchester. This is a beautully produced book anda credit to the publishers Lilliput Press and of course to theauthor.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27481  ","story":"• Mícheál Mac Donncha and Robert Ballagh Mícheál Mac Donnchaby Robert Ballagh published by Head of Zeus. back in the late s. For anartist of his stature this was courageous, dependent as he was, tosome extent, on commissions from people who, to say the least, wouldnot be subscribers to our paper. But this was an artist who went hisown way in art and who acted as a citizen with a conscience in anIreland where State-imposed censorship distorted not only politicaldebate but also national self-image. For Robert Ballaghcreative work and active citizenship have gone hand in hand all hisle. This is depicted in his double self-portrait ‘Upstairs No.’,one of the many illustrations of his work in this superbly writtenand beautully presented book. It is not a standard autobiographywith chapters set out in chronological order beginning with genealogyand ending with this week’s news. As you would expect from Ballagh,he takes a dferent approach, starting towards the later years andcircling through his days in no particular order before coming backto the present. More than that, he weaves narrative, anecdote andreflection together seamlessly and conversationally showing a skillwith words akin to his skill with brushes. He has a story to tell ofa very ied le, from his unusual family background to his time asa showband guitar player, through his unorthodox beginning as apainter and his development as an artist and an activist. Withfrankness and clarity he tells us how he learned and matured as anartist and his brief commentaries on many of his works areilluminating both of how they were made and the concepts behind them.It makes the reader want to look again and more intensely at thepictures. The Prologue isessentially a dedication to Robert’s late we Betty, his lelonginspiration, mentor and most important critic. The first chaptertells the harrowing story of how Betty, in her serious illness, wasdisgracefully let down by a healthcare system which basically allowedher to die through neglect, as was admitted in legal proceedings. Butthis does not cast a shadow over the book, as her positive presenceis felt throughout, and is celebrated by the author. These days I rarely getthat urge immediately to re-read a book when I reach the end, but Idid with this one. Thankfully the chapters are so well defined thatthey can be read as stand-alone essays or stories. Take just twoexamples: ‘Who Fears to Speak ofEaster Week’ recounts the tremendous people’s commemoration ofthe  Centenary in which Robert played a central part, aculmination of his activism which has included campaigning againstapartheid, for the Birmingham Six, for artists’ rights, with theIrish National Congress opening border roads, in solidarity withPalestine and as an enthusiastic participant in Féile an Pobail inWest Belfast from its commencement.‘Dining at McDonald’s’is a brilliant critique of the dominant and stultying modernistideology and practise in art and an appeal for an opening up. Ballaghattacks “the notion that the artists’ choice imbues a givenobject with special properties which are tantamount to a metaphysicaltransformation of the object that it ceases to be a pedestrianartefactand becomes,by virtue of the artist’s choice, art”. This ideology leads tothe absurdity of much of the ‘installation’ stuff in galleriesthat baffles all but elitist insiders and, as Ballagh recounts, theclaim by loyalist killer Michael Stone that his attack on Stormontwas a piece of performance art. He argues that the bureaucracies mustset aside this ideology and make galleries more open and democratic .For these views and forhis artistic method and, among some I suspect, for his politics,Ballagh has been frowned upon by certain elites. One prominent figurein the Irish art world said of him with dripping condescension thathe is “not a real artist, he is a mere illustrator”. Typically,Ballagh responded with humour and defiance in a self-portrait wearinga t-shirt saying ‘Fuck the Begrudgers’. I cannot recommend thisbook highly enough. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27482  ","story":"Pearse Doherty: The Interview  Ruairí Doyle“Society is organised in the wrong way - we should not have a housing crisis - what is happening with our children in emergency accommodation is immoral. It is a scandal that we will look back at in twenty years with shame.” - Pearse Doherty TDSinn Féin TD and Finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty has spoken of his origins, his le and how they influence and inform both his political ideology in an extended online interview. He also outlined his vison for a New Ireland that provides achance for people to live, to work and to raise their families without thechronic levels of deprivation and inequality facing so many today. Speaking ahead of Sinn Féin’s Alternative Budget launch nextweek Deputy Doherty laid out his party’s vision “for a new economy for a NewIreland”.The Donegal TD was born in Glasgow and lived with hisparents and five siblings in a one-bedroom flat in Ibrox before the familyed home to Gweedore in Donegal in the ’s. This informed his belief that no matter when someone leftIreland, evenit were  or  years ago, they still have a great sense ofbelonging, of that tangible bond with home “that’s home - you know - Níl aontinteán mar do thinteán féin - that’s their home”, commented Teachta Doherty.Pearse, who has been a TD since , talked about his drivehome when the Dáil wraps up at the week’s end, crossing the border twice on hisway up the winding road to Donegal to his we and four boys. He also gave aninsight into the dficulty of the balance between work and home le, and theunique challenges of being a public representative. The Gaoth Dobhair resident added that it is not solely challengesthat come with being a Teachta Dala. He said: “It is what shapes you and your values. It’s yourexperience - it’s your past experience - it’s your family experience and it’swhat shapes you in Irish society, the people that are around you. The peoplewho influence you and that help shape you and that’s the values that I bring tomy job today as Finance spokesperson for the lead opposition party. It’s thevalues I will bring to the job as Minister for Finance,I am in thatposition.”Sinn Féin regularly faces accusations of employing “fairy-taleeconomics” or “economic illiteracy”.Pearse dismisses these comments as cheap throw-away remarks,designed to stunt political debate. This is a debate that Pearse opines that the establishmentparties do not want because “any fair minded person would see clearly thatthere is a need to build houses, to bring our children out of emergencyaccommodation instead of cutting taxes for the wealthiest in society.”He continued: “Where despite the fact that the three main banks aremaking €. billion in profits every year, they don’t pay any Corporation Taxand some of them won’t pay for the next twenty years.  That’s the debate they don’t want to have.”As Pearse puts it, the Budget is not just about numbers -it’s about our values and ensuring we create a new economy with strong publicservices and shared prosperity where no one is left behind and no child goeswithout.Deputy Doherty said: “Society is organised in the wrong way. We shouldnot have a housing crisis. What is happening with our children in emergencyaccommodation is immoral and it is a scandal that we will look back at intwenty years with shame.  “What is happening in our hospitals is outrageous, in a country thathas the wealth that it does.  “It is just not shared properly and it is not allocated properly andthat isn’t the fault of citizens. That is fault of politicians that decided onBudget day that the resources created by the Irish people are going to beallocated in this way.”Touching on the spectre of Brexit, as a TD for a borderconstituency, Pearse argues that the North of Ireland remaining in the EU andgiven a Special Designated status is the only way to protect people on bothsides, particularly Donegal which is isolated from the rest of the  Counties.Pearse also remarks that “the debate about Irish Unity needs to go toanother level”. He continued: “We are moving, in my view, to a position where we willhave a border poll. Where a majority of people will vote for Irish unity.  “And that will come about because of demographic changes. It will comeabout because Sinn Féin is agitating for it, and other people are recognisingthat it is in their interests that we have an end to the Irish border.”Sinn Féin is not interested in maintaining the status quoand not content to merely “tinker along the edges - where you might get anincrease in public services, an extra few gardaí, an extra few public sectorworkers, a little tax cut here” Pearse Doherty said. This Budget, and every Sinn Féin Budget, would be about our vision fora new Ireland and that vision of an equal and fair society. We would also focuson the political choices that have always been available to create that society one is prepared to make them. Teachta Doherty states in the conclusion of his interview: “Our job isto provide opportunities so that people can live and work at home.

However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.- Mary Lou McDonaldDUP Leader Arlene Foster has called for fundamental changeto the Good Friday Agreement to facilitate Brexit. In other words an agreement endorsed by the majority of people north and south must make way for Brexit, a proposition rejected by a majority in the north. The latest position of the DUP leader lays bare the root of thecrisis in the north. Remember, the DUP opposed the Good Friday Agreement, campaigned for a No vote in that historic referendum and they continue to oppose the Agreement. An Agreement that has underpinned peace for over two decades.They oppose the all Ireland nature of the Agreement, they oppose the rights and safeguards of the agreement and they oppose power-sharing.   to be in them.” The institutions in the north could no-longer bear the weight of this contradiction and collapsed. This was brought to ahead by the continual refusal to implement agreements, opposition to marriage equality, rights to an inquest, an Irish language Act and the financial scandal that is the RHI Cash for Ash scheme.Add to the mix a British Government that has no understanding of Ireland, our economy or our agreements. The Tories are at war with themselves over Brexit and seem intent to bring their own country down with them. This same Tory Government entered into a toxic deal with the DUP to stay in power. That is why there are no institutions in the north, and why the DUP leadership walked away from the deal they had made with Sinn Féin in February this year to get the Assembly up and running.These latest comments by Arlene Foster are a desperate throw of the dice by an increasingly marginalised Unionist leadership. The deal with the Tories will end. Its only legacy will be Brexit. Meanwhile Ireland north and south is changing and a New Ireland is emerging. The joyous revolution of Marriage Equality and Repeal of the Eighth has resonated with a new generation in the north. The largest political demonstration in Belfast is Pride. A magnicent event that celebrates the ersity of identities that make up our communities.Similarly there is a growing demand for access to abortion services. As a placard proudly announced in Dublin Castle when the Repeal result came through, “The North is Next”.Brexit has also unied those who voted to remain within the EU. Brexit will be a disaster for the economy in the north, particularly for agriculture. A community that values prosperity and access to the EU is looking beyond Brexit and Westminster and instead towards Irish Unity. We are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.As for Arlene Foster and the DUP - the game is up. If their leadership want the institutions in the north up and working then they must support real power sharing, respect, equality and the rights of others. When this happens Sinn Féin will be a willing partner. Now is the time for political courage, to look forward in the interests of all communities. Meanwhile the debate on Irish unity and a unity referendum grows. I am confident that we can build a New United Ireland, a home for all that share this island. That is the big challenge for our generation. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27484  ","story":"• RUC unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons Mícheál Mac DonnchaCivil Rights campaigners in Derry had been pressing for a march in their city which had long been a byword for unionist sectarianism and discrimination.Using gerrymandered electoral boundaries and a corrupt voting system which allowed wealthier citizens to have multiple votes in local elections, the unionists maintained a majority of members on the council in a city with a nationalist majority.Nationalists lived in very poor housing conditions and were affected disproportionately by the % unemployment rate in the city.Unionists had long regarded the old walled town as a citadel that could never be surrendered and their dominance was symbolised by the walls towering over the crumbling th century terraced streets of the nationalist Bogside. The last time nationalists had attempted to hold a parade inside the walls was on St Patrick’s Day  – when they were batoned by the RUC.Housing was a massive issue in Derry and the Derry Housing Action Committeeprovided the focus for leadership as the Civil Rights campaign took off. The DHAC had organised a James Connolly commemoration in the city in July  which was banned by the unionist government.The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Associationagreed to hold a march in Derry on  October. The loyalist Apprentice Boys organisation immediately announced a counter-demonstration with the purpose of forcing the unionist government’s hand to ban the Civil Rights march. But the regime at Stormont did not require forcing because the Home Affairs Minister was ultra-unionist William Craig, who promptly imposed the ban.NICRA held an emergency meeting with the DHAC. Many on the NICRA Executive and some Derry nationalist figures, including John Hume, wanted to cancel the march, but the majority of Derry activists were determined to defy the ban. They won out and the march was to proceed as planned.It was a relatively small march, beginning on Craigavon Bridge with several hundred people. The objective was the Diamond in the city centre.The march was stopped in Duke Street by the RUC. A meeting was held with speakers including Gerry Fitt, Betty Sinclair, Eddie McAteer, Ivan Cooper, Austin Currie and Eamonn McCann. Three Westminster Labour MPs were also present.After the meeting, the marchers found themselves hemmed in on all sides by the RUC. They could not disperse and after a tense stand-off the RUC, oblivious to the presence of TV cameras and photographers, unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons, boots and fists. Water cannons were then used.Bernadette Devlin McAliskey, then a young People’s Democracy activist, recalled:“Quite deliberately, they hosed in the upstairs windows and shopfronts, and they went right across Craigavon Bridge, hosing all the onlookers. The police just went mad.”The RUC attack in Duke Street brought the Civil Rights struggle in Ireland to a world audience for the first time. It was a complete eye-opener to many people in the  Counties and in Britain. But most profound was its effect on young nationalists.Derry man Mickey Devine , the last of the ten Hunger Strikers to die in the H-Blocks of Long Kesh in , recalled:“Like every young person in Derry, my whole way of thinking was tossed upside down by the events of  October . I didn’t even know there was a Civil Rights march I saw it on television.“But that night I was down the town smashing shop windows and stoning the RUC. I developed an intense hatred of the RUC. As a child I had always known not to talk to them or to have anything to do with them, but this was dferent.The RUC attacked the Civil Rights march in Duke Street, Derry, on  October .test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27485  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering and pain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contested narratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.- Declan KearneyThis week the NIO consultation on dealing with the legacy of thepast in the north of Ireland closed.It will inform a legislative process and bringforward future legacy legislation.Failure to deal with the past remains one of the most signicantimpediments to political progress here.It is a barrier to the development of a comprehensivereconciliation and healing process in this society.British state policy has been the primary factor in preventinglegacy issues from being addressed or resolved.Powerful sections of the British military and intelligence systemhave never embraced the peace process. They remain psychologically andpolitically locked into a conflict mind-set even twenty years after the GoodFriday Agreement was signed.The role of British State forces and their agents, a refusal toacknowledge and be accountable for their actions, combined with a disregard forsuccessive binding court rulings, has defined the British state’s approach tolegacy matters.That has been reinforced in recent times by a cynical and narrative, including interventions by the British Prime Minister Theresa May,and British Secretary of State in the north, Karen Bradley, to suggest thatonly state forces were being made subject to legacy investigations.These statements are offensive and wrong, and are an egregiousdemonstration of the partisan nature of British policy towards dealing with thepast.They are consistent with the British practice of denying wrongdoing, concealing the truth, and preventing accountability.This poses a major challenge to ensuring that a robust,independent, and impartial facilitation of the legislative process will emergefrom this consultation on addressing the legacy of the past.All sides suffered, and caused suffering to each other during theconflict.There are multiple narratives regarding our tragic past. There isno single narrative despite the attempts of the British state and politicalunionism to assert otherwise.The past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering andpain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contestednarratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.The Stormont House Agreement, , , set out an agreedframework of legacy mechanisms which provided an unprecedented opportunity tocomprehensively deal with the past in all its aspects.Subsequent draft legislation reneged on the British government’sobligations under the SHA by introducing a national security veto, which hadthe effect of blocking a way forward on the issue of legacy.Full implementation of the SHA on a human rights compliant basispresents the best opportunity to deal with the legacy of our past and guaranteea framework which is victim centred.Facilitation of any future legislative process will require thatthe British government must ensure all victims are treated with equality,respect and dignity that the legislation reflects the policy intent of theAgreement and, that the legacy architecture is fully independent, human rightscompliant, and properly resourced and funded.The following key principles should be central to the operation offuture legacy legislation and mechanisms.-          Allprocesses should be victim centred-          Allprocesses must secure the co-operation of all relevant parties to ensuresuccess-          Allprocesses should be based upon equality, respect, and dignity-          Allprocesses must be free from political interference and be absolutelyindependent-         Acknowledgement should be central to the operation of the legacy framework-          The aim ofthat framework should be to enable reconciliation and healing within widersocietyIf there is to be a collective and comprehensive engagement withthe past in a human rights compliant manner, there can be no hierarchy ofvictimhood or humanity.There must be no change to the definition of a victim.High-quality services should be provided to all victims at thepoint of need.This should extend to the immediate provision of a pension for allseriously and psychologically injured during the conflict.The British Government should also immediately release therequired funding to resource the Lord Chief Justice’s inquest plan, as aseparate distinct process from any new legacy mechanisms.The Office of the Police Ombudsman should be adequately andimmediately resourced.Any attempt by the British state to introduce a statute oflimitations to protect its forces and agents would be a violation of the SHA and must be opposed.Full participation and unfettered disclosure by British stateforces and its agents with the legacy mechanisms will be essential to achievefull public confidence in their ability to deliver on behalf of all society.Periodic reviews should be carried out to inform the extent offunding requirements and necessary timeframe, for all legacy mechanisms.Legacy processes should not be limited or impeded by closedmaterial proceedings. In addition, for future legacy mechanisms toasintended, it is essential families are given full access to legal aid.The legacy legislation which ultimately emerges from theconsultation must comply with the policy intent of the SHA by:-          Promotingreconciliation-          Upholdingthe rule of law-         Acknowledging and addressing the suffering of all victims and survivors-         Facilitating the pursuit of justice and information recovery-          Beinghuman rights compliant-          Beingbalanced, proportionate, transparent, accountable, fair, and equalThe full implementation of that Agreement representsthe best potential and opportunity to address the legacy of our politicalconflict and the suffering experienced by everyone during the conflict inIreland, Britain and beyond. So, it is now time to finally deal with the past.  It is time tobuild for the future. It is time to lay the foundations for reconciliation andhealing, and to open up a new phase of the peace process. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27486  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National Chairperson“The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office”Ive been wondering lately whether anyone in Democratic Unionist Partyleadership circles actually try to reflect upon what republicans, nationalists, and other progressive minded citizens think about the current political situation.Do they even care what others think The evidence suggests not.Several days ago the DUP leader pronounced that her party could and would change the Good Friday Agreementat a whim. There was no hint of irony in her claim – the DUP has spent the last  years opposing the GFA, ever since it was signed.In another extraordinary, but not untypical, outburst she declared her blood red line position on Brexit and, that in the same week as the consultation on dealing with the past was concluding!Of course the DUP leader, and other key figures have form in making offensive and provocative political interventions.Her dehumanising description of republicans as \"crocodiles\" in  comes to mind.Notably, she previously called republican and nationalist Ministers in a ing Executive ‘rogues and renegades.Only the DUP knows whether this leader is naturally predisposed to being rhetorically gaffe prone, or is being deliberately offensive.Perhaps some figures in the DUP do think about wider opinion: the DUP is not a monolith after all.But, those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power sharing.  They oppose equality and rights, and reject reconciliation.Instead they have chosen to join forces with the extremists in the British Tory party to help steer the Brexit train wreck.The DUP leadership is living in a delusional bubble.Meanwhile, the party brand has become indistinguishable from the financial scandals of recent years such as Red Sky, NAMA, Brexit dark money, and financial relationships with Sri Lanka.The ongoing RHI inquiry exposé of how the DUP behaved in government makes a complete mockery of its purported adherence to good governance’.The party MPs have become power drunk through their pact with the Tories, and a serious misconception that they are king makers in Westminster.  Edward Carsons cautionary words have clearly been forgotten or disregarded.  He warnedWhat a fool I was.  I was only a puppet, and so was Ulster… in the political game that was to get the Conservative party into power.’ The DUP has a tactical approach towards everything including maintaining the status quo on its own terms, slowing down and frustrating progressive societal change, and maintaining sectarian dominance within the unionist constituency.The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office.  Its inability and refusal to embrace dference or celebrate ersity is reflected in an institutionalised bigotry against, and intolerance towards the Irish national identity and cultural traditions, and LGBT rights.The partys contempt and sharp practice in government has destroyed wider public confidence in the political institutions, and led to the decisive tipping point of RHI and withdrawal of the Líofa grant scheme in the winter of .As a result of its ingrained arrogance and lack of political humility the DUP leadership is constantly in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarianism, homophobia, and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists, and many others, including sections of civic unionism, do not believe the DUP is serious about restoring genuine power sharing. These citizens want the institutions to be restored, but not at the risk of allowing the DUP to continue practicing discrimination, disrespect, intimidation, bigotry, and sharp practice. They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power on that basis.  And, neither will Sinn Féin.The DUPs behaviour, and the onslaught of Brexit have together brought back graphically into focus the denial of rights which resulted in the Civil Rights Movement fty years ago.A generational realignment has occurred within northern nationalism.Acht Gaeilge, marriage equality, womens reproductive health rights, legacy justice rights, and the demand for a Bill of Rights are the modern day acid test equivalents of one person, one vote.  The current crisis in the north of Ireland is the visceral culmination of  years of DUP push back against the GFA.Intoxicated with its imaginary power at Westminster, the DUP leadership has finally over played its hand. The political institutions could have been re-established by the th February last, but the DUP leaders walked out of negotiations.Instead of selling the deal which they negotiated in February with Sinn Féin, the DUP leader, deputy leader, party chief executive, and its senior talks team bottled out.Since then the party has been convulsed with the resultant internal fall out.  There has been no meaningful contact with Sinn Féin, and absolutely no willingness demonstrated to resume negotiations.Any advocacy of blood red lines is a total anathema to democracy.The wider nationalist constituency is fed up to the back teeth with the subversion of the political process by the DUP, the British Tory government and others in political unionism.It is more impatient than ever for equality, rights and parity of esteem.  The history of  is being replayed. Thousands marching from Duke Street in Derry city on Saturday th October to mark the iconic civil rights march  years before is the latest example of that.  An exciting momentum for change is taking place across Ireland, north and south.  Old orthodoxies are being eclipsed by discussions about new, modern, all-Ireland constitutional and political arrangements. The permanent unionist electoral majority is gone and demographic changes are irreversible.All of this puts the onus back upon both governments to act decisively to address the denial of rights.The Irish government needs to take the lead because for now the DUP has this British government over a barrel.  But thats a short-term situation.  A British general election in the immediate to mid term cannot be ruled out.A new political discourse has begun about the future. All sections of society need to be involved in this and the unionist is critical in all of this.Brexit, the GFA, citizens rights, and an Irish unity referendum are central to that. Progressives should explore common ground and alliances for change.Republicans and unionists need to start to face the same way.  We have to begin looking at each other through eyes of the future.The benchmarks of a rights-based society guaranteeing civil and religious liberties and equality for all, are set.  These are not negotiable.So, whoever is actually in charge of the DUP for the time being has a lot of serious thinking to do...Who now leads the DUP  Do they have the authority to negotiate and stick to an agreement Are they committed to a shared future with republicans, nationalists, and others in the north Unless, and until the DUP can clearly answer these questions for the rest of society, it will remain exactly where it is now – out of power, and facing the inevitable fate about which Carson warned: getting dumped by the British Tories.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27487  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe Liberal Party was in government in Britain and had introduced the Home Rule Bill with the support of the Irish nationalist MPs in Westminster. They had abolished the veto of the House of Lords and Home Rule was due to be implemented in . The Tories seized on the issue of Home Rule as the most effective weapon to bring down the Liberals. Leading members of the British landed aristocracy, capitalists and senior military figures jumped on the bandwagon and backed up Unionist leader Edward Carson with threats of civil warHome Rule was brought in.Amidst the political frenzy there were very few Protestants in Ulster who were prepared to oppose Carsonism. But there were some and among them was the Reverend J.B. Armour of Ballymoney, County Antrim. A minister of the Presbyterian Church, Armour stood out from most of his co-religionists in advocating self-government for Ireland. In , he opposed a resolution at the Presbyterian General Assembly condemning Gladstone’s second Home Rule Bill. He was also a strong critic of landlordism.In , he again opposed a resolution against Home Rule at the Presbyterian General Assembly.Calling for freedom of conscience for Protestants to support or oppose Home Rule, Armour slammed the intolerance of Carsonism when he told the assembly:“If you deny the right of private judgment and of free speech, how much do you have of Protestantism worth keeping  Nothing at all.”Armour organised a public meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney to support Home Rule and oppose Carsonism. Banners in the hall proclaimed “No provisional or provincial government for us” and “Ulster for Ireland and Ireland for us”.The resolution stated that the meeting of Protestants of Ballymoney and the protests in The Route“against the claim of Sir Edward Carson and the self-constituted Provisional Government of Ulster to represent the Protestant community of north-east Ulster” and “disputes the narrow claim that dferences of creed necessarily separate Irishmen and women into hostile camps”. Among the speakers at the Ballymoney meeting were JB Armour himself, historian Alice Stopford Green, Jack White, son of a British Army general and later a leading figure in the Irish Citizen Army, and Roger Casement, who was executed in . This was Casement’s first appearance on a political . With his Antrim family background, Casement regarded the occasion as hugely signicant and in his speech he denounced any notion of partitioning Ireland. The meeting was a once-off and failed to turn the tide of Carsonism but it did show that a signicant minority of Protestants in the North-East were still prepared to stand up for Irish unity and self-government. The meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney in support of Irish self-government was held on  October ,  years ago this week. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27490  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.- Declan KearneyLast weekend the Irish Congress of Trades Unionsand Irish Labour History Society organised a conference to commemorate William Walker in Belfast.Walker was an anti-Home Rule unionist who was a leader in the Belfast Independent Labour Partyin the early twentieth century.When James Connolly, Irelands most signicant historical, socialist republican leader called on the ILPs membership to support socialist unity in Ireland, his appeal provoked a rebuke from Walker.This led to a robust debate between both figures in the pages of Forward between May and July .Their debate came to be known as the Connolly Walker controversy and later became an historical reference point for the anti-imperialist struggle in Ireland.I participated in a  alongside veteran trade unionist Joe Bowers, Ulster Unionist councillor Chris Mc Gimpsey, and ICTU Assistant General Secretary, Owen Reidy, to discuss the post Walker years and the current situation in the north.Not surprisingly we delivered four very dferent perspectives on Walker and his legacy as well as, Brexit the north strategy and politics on the Left and, future prospects.A very challenging but fraternal debate ensued between the lists and the audience.I opened my comments by saying that any consideration today of William Walker’s legacy needs to be within the historic and contemporary reality that the advancement of socialist and Labour politics has been held back due to the effects of British colonial policy in Ireland.He was a product of his native Belfast and directly influenced by the communal environment within which he grew up.He was a protestant in a largely protestant workforce. Sectarianism in the late s and early s stalked Belfast.While Walker was severely limited in his political analysis he was committed to improving the conditions of his fellow workers.He is an integral part of Belfast’s industrial history and his contribution to the city’s labour heritage deserves recognition.British policy in Ireland and its consequences for Irish society has ided Irish workers along communal lines. It has paralysed the labour movement from effectively challenging partition and championing the strategic aim of Irish unity.Partition is the central fault line at the heart of Irish society and politics.Sectarianism remains a visceral blight in this state.Following partition, it was used by the ruling unionist elite to cement the foundation of the state and prevent unity among citizens on issues of common concern.The fact is Labour was indeed told to wait as the resurgent struggle for national independence grew in momentum just over  years ago.The counter revolution which took place post partition represented a strategic setback for labour and working-class interests in the new free state.It eclipsed the seminal influence which socialist republicanism had on the  Proclamation and the Democratic Programme of the First Dáil.The rights of workers became subservient to the conservative elites, north and south.However, sections of the labour movement were compliant with British policy in Ireland and the imposition of partition.That was personied in the political thinking of Walker and others pre partition.This tendency opposed Connollys core position that \"the two currents of revolutionary thought in Ireland, the socialist and the national, were not antagonistic but complementary\".Walkers debate with Connolly reflected a key contradiction inherent in the Irish labour movement and its relationship with the Irish national liberation struggle, and anti-imperialism generally.That contradiction has existed ever since.Walkers brand of ‘Municipal Socialism’ was in reality a euphemism for self-imposed strategic and political limitations which went on to define the Trade Union movement in the north.As a result, the Irish labour movement, particularly in the north has failed to challenge partition and modern British political policy towards Ireland.Partition has been an abject failure. It was never designed to make the northern state a political or economic success.From the beginning this state has carried within it the conditions of inherent instability.It was built upon institutionalised and structural sectarianism which ensured that a substantial minority was destined never to be treated as equals.The Civil Rights Movement fty years ago exposed the inability of the unionist state to treat the minority as equals.That belligerent opposition from powerful sections within political unionism against reform of the northern state persists today in the form of political unionism, and specically DUP hostility towards implementation of the Good Friday Agreementsince .Refusal by the DUP to embrace a rights-based society and equality, culminated in the collapse of the GFA political institutions in January , and our associated political crisis which has continued since then. Those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power-sharing.The party brand is now indistinguishable from financial scandal and sharp practice in government.As a party, the DUP is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic reforms, social modernity, and standards in public office.Its project is negative and tactical, and entirely focused upon slowing down and blocking progressive change, while maintaining a sectarian hegemony within the unionist constituency.The DUP is in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarian, homophobic and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists and many others, including sections of civic unionism, have concluded that the DUP has had its chance and cannot now be trusted in government.They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power at the risk of allowing it to continue practicing discrimination, intimidation, bigotry, or sharp practice.The enduring political crisis is accentuated by systemic structural weaknesses in the regional economy.The required investment in local public services and protection of workers’ rights are confronted with a combination of Tory austerity and Brexit.Pressures on public services are intensying.The regional block grant, or public expenditure settlement, has been reduced by .%.Real term cuts to public funding are now factored into future budget profiles alongside ·         Actual net cuts in take home pay for public and private sector workers·         Welfare cuts and the universal social charge·         Higher inflation and living costs, adults in working families live in relative povertyAverage wages in the north remain lower than ten years ago.Precarious working conditions, zero hours’ contracts, and the scam of bogus self-employment used by some employers are in common practice.Workers’ rights and protections are being systematically reversed.The onset of Brexit will be a catastrophe for the regional and island economiesIt will deepen an existing race to the bottom by further undermining the potential for economic growth, and new investment.The Brexit agenda, twinned with Tory austerity threaten jobs across all economic sectors, workers’ terms and conditions, and, any potential for sustainable public services in the north.The dawning political and economic reality is that Brexit has changed everything.It has exposed the negative role that partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentally anti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.  The British state has been pushed into an unprecedented, existential political crisis.Brexit is a train wreck being jointly steered by the DUP and extremists in the British Tory party.But it also has become a defining moment for these islands.A new generation is questioning partition.There has been a seismic sht in the ambitions and expectations of citizens in the north.A new political discourse has begun about the future of Ireland north and south, and our relationships with Britain and EuropeThe debate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have moved centre stage.The time has come for a fundamental paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.The Irish government needs to begin preparing constitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish Unity.It should facilitate an open, inclusive national conversation involving all citizens, political parties, social partners, and civic society.That is a dialogue about our collective future on this island which addresses all the concerns, accommodations and compromises relevant to negotiating a new, all Ireland, constitutional, pluralist democracy.Today this new focus upon Irish unity provides Irish trade unionists and workers with an opportunity to influence the debate about future constitutional and political change.Previous moments of political change have required that labour should wait.The emerging challenge for the Irish labour movement north and south is to engage with this emerging discussion.To paraphrase Connolly in his opening contributions to the Connolly Walker debate\"Constitutional change then is almost a certainty of the future.”The labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.I said to the Belfast conference this reality will require Irish trade unionists to take strategic positions on supporting an Irish unity referendum and then to campaign positively for constitutional change.On Monday of this week I reiterated that opinion when I met Patricia King, General Secretary of ICTU in Dublin.Of course, this will be a challenging discussion for the Irish labour movement, as comrades noted both during and after the plenary discussion. But it should not be feared or avoided.Today in modern Ireland there is a battle for hearts and minds about how society is organisedThe status quo has failed us all.Connolly’s vision of a united Ireland which serves the interests of the many instead of the few will not be wished into existence.Labour should not wait again.The Irish labour movement needs to assert itself on the Irish unity debate by introducing a progressive labour agenda to the unfolding discourse on future constitutional and political change.test"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8685096.1540801538!/image/image.jpg","title":"super savings on discount day","story":"Forget Halloween and Christmas, there#s only date that needs to be in your diary this year and it#s the biggest and best shopping day in Ballymena.

My parents told me I was just going to speak to someone about my fear of dogs but I didnt fully understand the enormity of it.Nicola continued: The psychiatrist would give me tasks to carry out each week but none of it worked and as I got older my fear just got worse.One day I went to Crawfordsburn with my fianceacute and a dog came right up beside me and I totally freaked out.After years of torment Nicola decided to get in contact with Alan Gichrist who holds hypnotherapy sessions in the Adair Arms every Thursday evening.In my head I didnt think it would work. If I am honest I didnt think anything would ever work but I went along to the session anyway.After only three sessions Nicola said she was able to walk past a dog in the street which wasnt on a lead.I didnt even think about it. It didnt bother me at all, Nicola explained.I have lived with this phobia all my le and hypnotherapy has totally changed my le.People who know me knew the extent of my fear and they are shocked at the outcome.Another woman who has benefited from hypnotherapy is Karen McCullough.Karens fear of cats started  years ago when one came in through her window.I couldnt get the cat back out of the house and from that moment I was petried of them, Karen explained.It stopped me going places with my children because they were everywhere.The decision to do something about her fear came this Summer after a holiday in Mexico.My holidays were ruined because the cats were all around the hotel.

EasyJet pilot Alex Hawthorne who is originally from Waringstown Now the proud pilot of an Easyjet airbus , Alex, , graduated from Oxford Aviation Academy earlier this year and is based in Venice.She lives with her Italian boyfriend Edgar, whom she met during her pilot training.It has been  years since Alex left her home in Waringstown at the age of  to start a new le in Canada.The move came about after her mum Alison – a flight attendant for many years – married a Canadian pilot whom she met on her travels.    Alex began to pursue a career as a pilot when she moved to Canada They married in  and the family now live in Kitchener, Ontario, roughly an hour outside Toronto. Inspired by her step-dad Doug Glussich, Alex gained her full private pilot’s licence, her first step towards her dream of becoming a commercial pilot.She said: “Mum was a flight attendant so I was kind of exposed to flying from an early age, but it was when I met my step-dad that I first thought that maybe I could be a pilot.”She admitted that having realised her dream, it was not all plain sailing given that her profession is male-dominated: “I’m based in Venice with EasyJet. I’m the only female first officer and there’s also a female captain.    Alex with her grandparents in the cockpit “There’s just the two females out of -strong flight crew.” She said: “I do think things are going in the right direction, especially with EasyJet. They have a scholarship called the Amy Johnson initiative which offers fully paid flight training to females who they pick. “They are trying to drive more females into it, but it is a slow process.”Eddie lts gym trophy\"  \"  Northern Irelands best fish and chip shop has been revealed Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"She added: “It can sometimes be challenging. You feel you have to prove your worth.   Alex giving her valedictorian speech at Oxford “A lot of the males, the captains, are very good. They take the sex out of it. If you’re a good pilot, your a good pilot – end of story.“Through training I felt that I had to be a little bit better than the boys because I’m a girl.“I have unfortunately encountered a few negative comments, not from any co-workers, but from passengers. It’s been especially from older male passengers when they see a female pilot sitting in the cockpit they things like, ‘maybe I’d be safer getting a dferent flight’. It’s said in jokey way, they’re from a dferent time, but I don’t like hearing it because to me being a pilot is not a joke.“I’ve only had two or three of those comments, it’s not a regular thing.”Talking about the longevity of a career as a pilot, Alex said: “Pilot retirement age is  simply for medical reasons. You have medicals once a year until you get to over , then your medicals come once every six months.”She said: “I’m very settled where I am for now. EasyJet is a fantactic company, they really look after their employees, the money is good, the benefits are good. “To start your career flying an Airbus  is fabulous – it’s one of the best jets around.“However I’ve always had my sights on going long haul. I’d love to try the Boeing ‘triple sevens’, or the s or even the Airbus s, because the bigger the better, right “Before my career ends I would definitely like to try a bigger jet.”She continued@ “The longest flight I’m doing now is from Venice to Edinburgh. It’s two and half hours but from October we’ll be doing Lanzarote and Tel Aviv – those will be three and half hours each.“The Airbus that I fly now simply wouldn’t have the mileage to do more than seven hours. To do that I’d have to go to a bigger airbus – a , or to the Boeing .”Going back to her first time on board an airplane, Alex said: “The first time I was on a commercial aircraft was when I was four years old. I was going to Lanzarote with my parents and brother. “I was really excited. The noise was a bit frightening, but I loved the speed of the take off. “Back in those days you were still allowed to visit the pilots in the flight deck, so my brother and I went up with a flight attendant and I remember wondering what all the buttons were for.”Alex is now pleased to offer the same opportunities to children: “After we land we’ll have young boys and girls coming in to the cockpit. They give you so much respect, and are so interested. “If I could give any advice to the girls out there thinking of becoming a pilot, I’d say go for it.”The reassuring tone of a pilot is something that goes hand-in-hand with air travel, but are the men and women in the cockpit putting on a special voice to talk to passengers or is it their actual demeanour Alex explained: “They say everybody has a PA voice, they just want to sound as professional as they can. When I speak on board, I don’t want to come on with a really thick Northern Irish accent because nobody will understand me. It’s about clarity and getting the message across.”She added: “Pilots don’t only do medical testing. We do psychoanalysis testing. Pilots are calm. It’s in our nature. If a bad situation occurs we need to be able to handle it quickly and efficiently.“They’re not faking the voice, that’s their personality and how they are. That’s why they’re pilots.”Of her own journey she said: “Training was loads of hard work. My programme with Oxford was  months. It’s non-stop.“You have to say goodbye to your social le, but what’s  months in the grand scheme of things.“As a pilot, I’m quite happy to be a passenger. We work hard so it’s nice for me to let someone  fly. I’m completely as ease because I know the training the pilots have been through.”Talking of the most challenging manoeuvres she has had to carry out, Alex said: “When we went to Oxford we had to do upset recovery training. “We went into an aerobatic aircraft which is designed to be able to do all sorts of manoeuvres. “They put us into barrel rolls, spiral es. “Because we’re flying the big jets it’s very unlikely they will be able to get into a spiral e because computer systems have protection it wouldn’t let you. “However we always have to think of worst case scenariothese protections failed.”She commented: “In high school my strong subjects were maths and physics, when it comes to the theory behind flying I didn’t find it too overwhelming.“To get to spin an aircraft is a lot of fun. I feel like I’m in the red arrows.“I’ve been in planes from a young age. “It’s second nature to me, I don’t even flinch at it.”But what of those people who more than flinch at the prospect of air travel Alex said: “EasyJet actually do have a programme from Luton once a year where they take nervous fliers up on a free flight. “They have two pilots up front and two pilots in the cabin with the passengers explaining to them step-by-step from the take off to the landing what is happening and what are the noises you hear.“I can promise you this,it was completely dangerous I wouldn’t be doing it every day. “I think it’s fear of the unknown that makes people afraid.”Askedthere was training in place to deal with terrorist attacks, Alex said: “We do hijack training. We’re trainedanything were to happen we’re able to send out a squawk code which sends a message directly to Air Traffic Control.“Even everyday stuff – before we push back for the taxi until we get to the gate – the cockpit door is closed and will only be open for examplewe need to go to the bathroom. “We need to call cabin crew and they need to come to guard the doorwe have to leave the cockpit. “We take measures to ensure the cockpit door will not be breached. It’s also bulletproof. They’ve changed everything since  .”She explained how she came to be stationed in Italy: “The reason why I’m in Venice is because I met an Italian called Edgar during the training.”Alex and Edgar, , who is from Milan, soon became an item.She said: “Towards the end of our course we were able to say where we wanted to go. Edgar and I said we don’t mind where we’re placed but we’d like to be together. They put us both in Venice.“I’m still struggling a bit with the language – Italian has a lot of grammar in it. To get by I know the basics. It’s great to have an Italian speaker with me, in Italy a lot of places are remote and they don’t speak English.”Asked how much they see of each other, Alex said: “For the first year with EasyJet you’re on a flexi-roster so you can be working for three days then have two days off. “Sometimes we’re on completely opposite shts. He could be starting at am and I can be on lates working pm to midnight. Sometimes we’ll just see each other in the crew room, say hello and that’s it. “Some weeks you pass each other but others we get time off together when we can do whatever we want. It’s part of the job.”Alex said she also tried to go back to Waringstown as much as possible to visit relatives."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8684387.1540633447!/image/image.jpg","title":"competition win up to 10 tickets for this week s calor ni leisure show","story":"Win tickets to the second annual NI Leisure Show which kicks off this Friday, November  and runs until Sunday, November .

It is rare to see so much detail and well written legible letters which gives us a fantastic insight into the Dixon family and Patrick’s le at the front.“Within these letters we see Patrick discuss Irish political developments such as the  conscription crisis, the impact of the Spanish flu pandemic in Ireland and the torpedoing of the RMS Leinsteroff the Irish coast.He also describes his excitement at the signing of the Armistice, in a letter dated th November , and the long wait for demobilisation.Highlights from the collection include a soldiers’pantomime programme for January , emergency issue Francs, a German Disabled War Veteran Fund ticket picked up at the front, and never before published photographs of the front, taken by Patrick himself. Speaking about the origin of the material, Paula added: “We believe Patrick’s sister, Margaret, who became a GP in the Dunmurry area, married a Mr Wynne, who was involved with the Belfast Charitable Society and thus the material deposited in the Society#s attic for safekeeping. This is all very timely as Clton House is hosting an autumn series of historical lectures, including a symposium on th November  to mark the ending of the Great War. Philip Orr, the playwright and historian, and Dr Éamon Phoenix, the historian and broadcaster, will deal with the Irish contribution to the war and its impact on this island. This event will now include an exhibition of the Dixon War Letters, unveiled to the public for the first time. We’d also like to find the descendants of Patrick Dixon and we would like help in tracing members of the Dixon or Wynne families who may be able to shed light on this incredible collection of war letters.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screen-Shot-2018-10-29-at-11.21.21.png","title":"swifts and newington await their fate after abandoned cup tie","story":"THERE were chaotic scenes at Donegal Celtic Park on Saturday afternoon as the Steel # Sons Cup quarter-final tie between St James’ Swts and Newington was abandoned on  minutes.Referee Mark Milligan said his reason for the abandonment was that players had left the field of play to engage in a flare up between Newington’s Joe McDonnell and some Swts fans after the player had been sent-off for a second yellow card.At the time Swts were leading the game - in what had been an entertaining affair.Eugene Gallagher had given the hosts an th minute lead with an excellent strike from the right of the box and despite Swts going down to  men after Mark Clarke had received a second yellow on  minutes for a clumsy challenge, they went - ahead when Brendan Glackin turned Gallagher’s cross home.However, things were to quickly unravel on the stroke of half-time as McDonnell – cautioned on  minutes for his reaction to a challenge – was shown a second yellow and therefore red. As he was going off, McDonnell reacted to taunts and a plastic water bottle was thrown towards him.This led to punches thrown with several Newington players following him off the pitch as scuffles ensued. Things appeared to have calmed down with the players ing to the field, but the incident then sparked off again as McDonnell was being led to the dressing rooms. Again, players left the pitch, some it seemed were trying to calm the situation rather than join in, but the referee had seen enough, saying afterwards the chaotic scenes were out of control and he had no choice but to abandon the game.What happens now is up to the Co. Antrim FA. The draw for the semi-finals were made on Saturday with East Belfast awaiting the winner of Saturday’s gamethat is to be replayed or not.The Co. Antrim secretary was unavailable for comment this morning, but a decision is expected in the coming days.Click here to watch short Facebook video of the St James Swts v Newington game at https:www.facebook AndytownNews videos  "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"tiocfaidh a la carte","story":"LONG Quiche, Come Out You Rack Of Lambs, The Frying Column and Turkey Ár Lá – these were just some of the frontrunners for the name of the new cookbook by former Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams, who finally settled on The Negotiators Cookbook – Best Kept Secret of the Peace Process.The Negotiators Cookbook is the latest offering from Adams and it gives an insight into a part of the peace process that up until now has had little light shone upon it.The book details the efforts of two of the insiders, Ted Howell and Pádraic Wilson, to sustain the stamina and energy of the Sinn Féin negotiating team during years of high level negotiations with the British government and includes many of their recipes.Speaking at the launch in An Chultúrlann on Monday, Mr Adams said: “I’m here to tell you about one of the best kept secrets of the Irish peace process.

We agree on the principle of a UK-wide customs backstop. An agreement on the details of that backstop should be possible.“Both sides agree that this backstop cannot provide for a permanent UK EU relationship and are committed to a future relationship that works for the whole of the UK, including Northern Ireland.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  “We are open to talking about ways to achieve this and committed to continuing discussions in order to reach an agreement.“The end is now firmly in sight and, while obstacles remain, it cannot be beyond us to navigate them.

My children have one goal, and my politicians are playing pathetic games, and I say to them, now is the time to be brave, to stand up and make some dficult decisions. Step up for our children.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Dr Graham Gault, principal of Maghaberry Primary School, Co Antrim said the funding situation in schools in Northern Ireland is “ridiculous”. “I don’t mind what issues people are arguing about, but the past is not relevant to the children in my school who are dealing with complex learning needs and facing a system now which is almost Victorian in terms of the level of financial provision.“There is no more time for our politicians to play pathetic games, my children need their help right now.”Mr Gault said his school performs well in all of the six sustainable school priorities, apart from its financial position.He said its deficit at the end of this financial year will be around £,.“My school isn’t financially sustainable and I have actually found myself in the humiliating position of begging my parents to support the wellbeing of their children by providing Pritt Stick, reading books, tissues and soap,” he said.“This isn’t a joke, I actually have parents who are donating toilet roll to my school. It’s a disgrace”.Jo McColgan, principal of Ashfield Boys’ High School in east Belfast, said the educational outcomes at his school have improved signicantly, but the financial position has worsened.“We have gone from a £, surplus to a minus £, deficit,” he said.Mr McColgan argued there are other ways savings could be made, querying the central procurement system that controlled schools must go through.He said he could source ink cartridges for £, less outside the system.Deirdre Gillespie, principal of St Mary’s Grammar in Magherafelt, Co Londonderry, said there are no more cuts the school can make, other than to staff.“We need a transformation of the system which will release money back into the system to schools,” she said.Nigel Frith, principal of Drumragh Integrated College in Omagh, Co Tyrone, said he does not want the “old Stormont” back.“I want a new Stormont with a new will and a new vision to work together in the ways that they didn’t,” he told the committee.“I didn’t see a power-sharing executive, I saw a power-grabbing executive, and I’m sorryI have offended anyone listening, but I think that is the reality.“Nowthey can’t agree to power-sharing properly, I would rather that the civil servants at the head of our government departments were given greater powers to make decisions for themselves and I daresay without any political bias.“I don’t think what we had before the executive collapsed was anywhere near good enough.”"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed how many gp practices have closed in northern ireland","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHomes  InteriorsSeptember CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

But they are not just about geology and include sites that are of interest for their history, archaeology, bioersity, folklore, cultural and local heritage.Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos current focus is on firming up the boundaries of the proposed geopark with those involved in compiling the designation confident it has the potential to deliver high quality tourism in the area, increasing the number of international visitors.Officials believe geoparks have a signicant role to play in empowering local communities and giving them the opportunities to develop cohesive partnerships with the common goal of promoting the arearsquos signicant geological and other heritage.There are currently  geoparks found in  countries across the world, all of which have been developed using a bottom-up approach with local communities playing a signicant role in this process. But the global geopark brand does not impose any restrictions on farming practices, planning or development.Further information on the geopark proposal is available via Facebook on Geotourism in Mourne, Gullion and Strangford or for specic queries email geopark@nmandd.org..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Gold for James at cyclo cross race in Belfast  ","story":"A LARGE number of Dromara riders competed in round five of the Ulster Cyclo-Cross series in Musgrave park on Sunday, the event organised by VC Glendale.It was a rainy start to the day, but it did not dampen the spirits of Dromararsquos young riders.Hugh Hetherington, Tom Cowan and Anna Armstrong were the first to take to the course in the U- race.

She loved her dress and having everyone there and danced the whole night. She loved her cake and all the party food.ldquoIt was great to be able to share some of the positive aspects of Meganrsquos le with our family, friends and supporters as there has been so much dficulty along the way.It was very much a family affair attended by Meganrsquos siblings, Hannah, Lily and Stuart, great grandmother Mrs Rosaleen Traynor and her aunt Kelly, who provides a lot of her care.Megan will never have the le that she should have had because of her condition.In many ways, even though the Traynors went on to have three other children who donrsquot have the condition, they were robbed of their hopes and dreams for their first-born.But Megan and her parents felt that it was only right that they should include people at the party who have helped them along their journey so far.In  more than pound, was raised to help Megan become one of the first children from the UK to have pioneering stem cell treatment in China.Unlike some other children who benefited from the controversial treatment, it did not cure or help Meganrsquos blindness.But the Traynors believe that it did help Megan in her mental development at the time, although that has now halted.When her epilepsy and major seizures began to impact on her already compromised quality of le, the local community again rallied around in  to help the Traynors create a safe back garden with sensory equipment, complete with a small hydrotherapy pool to help calm her.Leanne knows that they have been blessed with a lot of help, support and generosity from the local community.ldquoAll I know is that there are a lot of very good people in the Downpatrick area who really pull together when people need help, said Leanne.ldquoThey are people who have helped us and raised money, or who helped get us equipment or whatever, every time we needed it. We canrsquot thank them enough.She said that there were too many to name but she would like to make a special mention of local landscape architect Matthew Morrison, who helped with the sensory garden, the charities RNIB, Angel Eyes, and Murphyrsquos Bar who consistently fund-raised, and Downpatrick Lions Club who organised for a gazebo to be used in the garden for Megan.ldquoIn the early days with Megan, we really didnrsquot know what to expect for her.

It is vitally important the St Dillonrsquos Avenue site is used for the benefit of the community,he continued.ldquoAny future planning applications will involve a consultation process that enables the public to have their say on the future development.The Downpatrick councillor suggested that given the current parking and traffic flow issues at Edward Street, there was a need for an ultra-modern primary school in the town to continue to provide a high standard of childrenrsquos education.He declared: ldquoI believe the St Dillonrsquos Avenue site would be ideal for a new school development and will be writing to the Education Authority to ask that they investigate the sitersquos potential for such a development.ldquoI will also be asking Newry, Mourne and Down Council to review options for this site as it could also be ideal for other community facilities.A spokesman for the diocese of Down and Connor confirmed on Monday that the former St Patrickrsquos Boys Primary School site will be placed on the market for sale.He added: ldquoThe diocesan Trustees are legally bound to act in the best interests of the charity and to consider all offers made through the public market process.ldquoIn the case of sales of former school sites, the diocesan Trustees are required toa substantial percentage of the sale price to the Department of Education in Northern Ireland.A number of people have taken to social media in the wake of news that the former school site is to be sold and expressed concern about the impact its redevelopment could have on an already heavily congested part of the town.Several have suggested a new school should be built on the site, while others believe its redevelopment could have problems securing planning permission given the topography of this part of the town and traffic congestion in nearby Edward Street.A number of people said they would not be in favour of any form of retail development at the former school site..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Staff being followed home by unruly teenagers  ","story":"BUSINESS owners in Downpatrick have revealed that some members of staff have been followed home by unruly teenagers who are terrorising the town centre with their behaviour.The worrying revelation came during a meeting held last week to discuss mounting concern about increasing anti-social behaviour in St Patrickrsquos Square, the Grove shopping centre area and other parts of the town.Within  hours of last weekrsquos meeting concluding, a firework was thrown at a customer as he left a hot food bar in St Patrickrsquos Square, narrowly missing him.Business owners fear someone is going to have to be seriously injured or worse before the ongoing trouble is addressed.They say the anti-social behaviour cannot be allowed to continue in the area, or in any other part of Downpatrick, and insist there must be immediate action to be bring the trouble to an end.Last weekrsquos meeting between local police, business owners and elected representatives was organised by Downpatrick councillor Cadogan Enright, who has revealed there were a number of frank exchanges, with all those in attendance describing the talks as ldquoworthwhile.He also confirmed another session involving the parties is due to be held in mid-November.A businessman said it was ldquoentirely unsatisfactory that people who were trying to do a dayrsquos work should be terrorised by  and  year-old children operating outside the control of their parents and the police.ldquoIt is now getting dficult to recruit staff in Downpatrick town centre, he revealed.ldquoWe do not have these problems in Newcastle or Ardglass. Self-employed retailers pay tax and rates in an expectation that the government and Newry, Mourne and Down Council will ensure that the environment in our town centres is suitable for business and attractive to customers. We expect this situation to be turned around rapidly and not deteriorate further.During the meeting, business owners complained about having their staff harassed and having to close early, losing trade due to anti-social behaviour.Vehicles in the car park at the rear of the Grove shopping centre have been damaged, with business owners and local residentsrsquo group representatives expressing concern that police were not doing more to help bring about prosecutions.Residentsrsquo group members complained that they could no longer let their children play near the Grove or St Patrickrsquos Square, an area which they argued should be a major attraction in the town for adults and children alike.Fears were also expressed that this part of Downpatrick was now becoming ldquoout of bounds for the decent people in the town in the evenings.Cllr Enright said local police welcomed the opportunity to listen first-hand to what businesses and residentsrsquo associations had to say and agreed to meet met with them again next month to track progress in dealing with these issues.He also thanked South Down MLA Colin McGrath for attending the meeting and fellow MLA Emma Rogan for sending her apologies and confirming she will be at the November meeting.ldquoIt was clear that senior police officers were not aware of the scale of the problems in the town over the past nine months, Cllr Enright said.ldquoStatistics of reported crime did not reflect what was going on, with business owners surprised at the low number of prosecutions.ldquoThere appears to be a systemic problem in dealing with youth offending in the Public Prosecutions Service which insists on up to five repetitions of so-called lsquoyouth engagementrsquo by the police before considering bringing forward a prosecution.Cllr Enright suggested this left some of the worst culprits with little respect for or fear of the police.He confirmed that MLAs have been asked to raise this particular issue with the PPS, alongside concerns of people waiting up to  minutes to get through on the PSNIrsquos  number to report incidents.He said concern was also expressed about how reports of assaults, vandalism and intimidation were followed though, with some business owners keen for police to search young people whom they suspect of carrying fireworks.He added: ldquoThere was also criticism of the lsquoinvisibilityrsquo of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos community safety wardens, with some suggestions that robust action against anti-social behaviour issues at the Model Farm area may have been partly responsible for transferring the trouble to the town centre..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Traffic ‘worse than ever’ amid calls for filter lane  ","story":"ROADS officials have been asked to address mounting concern about traffic snarl-ups at a busy junction on the outskirts of Downpatrick.Local people and politicians have been campaigning for a new filter lane at the Ballynoe Road junction with the Killough Road which is dealing with a signicant increase in traffic at peak periods.Vehicles can be queued from the junction as far back as Bishops Brae in the morning with the upsurge attributed to the number of organisations now based at the Downshire Civic Centre.The public sector campus is home to Newry, Mourne and Down Council, the PSNI, Housing Executive and Fire and Rescue Service. The Downe Hospital is also part of the sprawling estate.Mrs Olwyn McColl, who lives at Vianstown Heights, says there has been a major increase in traffic using the junction over the past year and is urging roads officials to address the problem.She says there is available land to provide a filter lane which has the potential to signicantly reduce tailbacks.ldquoThe problem is getting worse and sitting in a tailback, especially in the mornings when parents are taking children to school and people are heading to work, can be very frustrating, she said.ldquoDue to the current layout of the junction, drivers wishing to turn left at the junction have to wait until the traffic in front of them clears. A new filter lane would help reduce waiting times.Mrs McColl said it would appear that an increasing number of drivers heading from the Newcastle direction in the morning were now using the Ballynoe and Bishops Brae roads, which was contributing to the congestion.ldquoThe problem is  times worse than it ever was, there is no doubt about that, she continued. ldquoThings are bad now and they could get worse when the nearby new civic amenity site opens early next year.ldquoMany of my neighbours share my concern and it would be greatroads officials could use the land which is available to provide a new filter lane. It would make such a dference.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran said he shared the frustration of those campaigning for the filter lane which has not yet been delivered.ldquoIn addition to the nearby Downshire Civic Centre, we have a large shopping centre, a nursery and primary school, leisure facility and very busy MOT centre which is all adding to the build-up of traffic at peak periods, he said.ldquoWhile I am delighted Downpatrick has a major public sector campus, we need to ensure the roads system can cope with the additional volume of traffic its provision has generated. An important step would be upgrading the Ballynoe Road junction with the Killough Road.Cllr Curran believes a filter lane would not cost a signicant amount of money to provide and would go some way towards easing the current problem.ldquoThis particular junction is extremely busy in the morning, with a long tail back of vehicles a common occurrence. The creation of a filter lane allowing drivers wishing to turn left out of the Ballynoe Road would help reduce congestion, he said. lsquoThe provision of a new filter lane is a no brainer.Cllr Curran said that while roads officials previously identied a scheme to provide a new filter lane, they subsequently decided that, due to the close proximity of the Glebetown Drive housing area, a new slip road would cause ldquoroad safety issues.He added: ldquoI firmly believe that the time has come to revisit this particular proposal.

It was a conflict in which his uncle, Charlie Dunbar had been persuaded to volunteer for ldquoto fight for his religion.But the experience of what Charlie saw left a deep scar and changed him forever.Adrian was the focus of the ldquoWho Do You Think You Are  on RTE on Sunday evening, and it was a fascinating watch.As we all get a little older, many of us seem to have an increasing interest in our own past, especially our own family history. In Ireland, family is still a powerfully symbolic and emotive part of our DNA, and the programme often reveals some interesting context for inidual celebrities.As Adrian said: ldquoAll of us are interested in our backgrounds where we come from and what yoursquore born into. Those things shape who you are.Therersquos no doubt that we will have been particularly interested in Dunbarrsquos journey into his background after all hersquos one of our own.But the interest in the programme went much deeper and much more meaningful. With several little vignettes showing the complexity of identity in Ireland.A word used frequently these days in all sorts of context is binary, meaning only two parts or ision into two groups. Itrsquos particularly apt to the world view of Northern Ireland. Protestant equals Unionist British, Catholic equals Nationalist Irish, would be the perception.It isnrsquot the case, of course, and shouldnrsquot be. But the troubled th century in Ireland, particularly the last quarter of it, saw both groups driven further into a silo mentality.Irsquove always felt that there was a certain irony in the fact that a violent Republican campaign to achieve Irish unity did, actually, create more ision.Now, the current circumstance of changing demographics in the north combined with the Brexit crisis are focusing on identity as we go forward.Adrian Dunbar is a clever inidual and, indeed, a perceptive one and the story of his family background in the programme was punctuated with comments which should evoke some thought about the past, present and future.Adrian was brought up in Enniskillen in a mainly Nationalist area, though for a few years the family moved to Portadown, Garvaghey Road in fact, where he recalls loyalist paramilitaries parading close by in a show of strength to people in Nationalist areas to know their place. The memory of two communities living apart is eloquently described by Adrian as ldquosocial engineering to suit sectarianism. While Enniskillen was much less hostile, the time, the place and the neighbourhood environment where he and his siblings grew up were far from ideal recruiting ground for the British military.And yet, on his mother Pauline Camplingrsquos side, there is an incredibly strong link and a history of service going back three generations.Adrian visited St. Michaelrsquos Church where Frankie Roofe was able to give him intriguing detail of his great-great-grandfather coming to Enniskillen as a soldier from England and converting from Church of England to Catholicism.Recounting some of the history of the Inniskilling Fusiliers, when the regiment ldquoheld the line for Wellington at Waterloo about half of the  men were killed, Adrian himself pointed out that about a third of the men spoke only in Irish. Itrsquos a quirk of how history develops that hundreds of years later the native tongue of men who died serving the British Army is somehow portrayed controversially as anti-British.Adrianrsquos grandfather, Walter Campling served in the Inniskillings, and three of his sonshad distinguished service in the British military in world war.The programme shows Adrian coming home to Enniskillen to discuss this with his brother Liam.Interestingly, though, Liam said that because they were brought up in Nationalist areas they didnrsquot go round talking about their ancestorsrsquo British military service. And Adrian himself said that the idea that he and his siblings would have followed the tradition of their three previous generations had gone.Such service to the British military by Catholic Nationalist families was common, as a look at the names of both communities on the Enniskillen War Memorial show.Yet, it was a feature not talked about in recent history and illustrates the complexities of identity that weave their way through our communities.Conversely, of course, the perception suggests that all Protestants consider themselves ldquoas British as Finchley and thatrsquos just as much an oversimplication. Surely the two identities donrsquot slot handily into their own homogeneous monolith There were a couple of telling moments, I thought, in the Dunbar programme.His uncle Charlie, whom Adrian remembers fondly dishing out sixpences, had been convinced in the late s to join the Irish brigade fighting for the fascist Franco in the Spanish Civil War under the guise of fighting to preserve the Catholic religion against the evils of Communism.On hearing some of the shocking atrocities that his uncle witnessed, Adrian reflected: ldquoPeople do a lot of things in the name of religion, donrsquot they  Sadly, as we know only too well in the north.And he added: ldquoThe combination of religion and politics is not a good one.And there was another line which struck me. Adrian was shown a photo of Queen Victoriarsquos state visit to Dublin in  when the city was still under British rule.He was shown the regimental band, including his grandfather, and considering the protest and fight for independence in Ireland which was about to change everything, Adrian referred to his grandfather and other comrades as being ldquoon the wrong side of history.A century on from that Royal visit, the country saw a war of independence, a civil war, decades of conflict in this part of the island and more recently more Royal visits by the current Queen both north and south of the Border.And now itrsquos a pertinent question to ask what side of history the ious identities are on now.The confusion and uncertainty over future membership of the European Union has thrown the subject of identity to the forefront, and there is the suggestionthat the issue of Irish unity is firmly on the agenda.To be honest, I donrsquot think evena Border poll was held that it would result in unity just now.But herersquos a thing. On Sky News last week, journalist Adam Boulton was interviewing Scottish Deputy First Minister, John Swiney and his opening question was: ldquoWhat do you think is more likely to happen first, a united Ireland or an independent Scotland The fact that he asked it seriously is telling, as is Swineyrsquos serious reply which began, ldquoItrsquos a close run thinghellip.In the current political climate, the DUP say they are engaged in a ldquobattle for the Union. Aside from the fact that all politics here seems to boil down to that, in this case the DUP may well be right.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I have been moved to tears by so many honest and heart-wrenching accounts.I canrsquot even begin to imagine the pain of losing a child at any stage of le it is inconceivable for those who have never suffered such a loss. But sadly, itrsquos more common that we imagine.It is estimated that one in four pregnancies in the UK ends in miscarriage, defined as a loss of pregnancy up to a gestation of  weeks and  days. A loss after that is considered stillbirth and in  there were , stillbirths ndash thatrsquos nine babies stillborn every day ndash and , neonatal deaths.As part of baby loss awareness week, bereaved parents, along with their families and friends have been coming together, joining with others across the world, to commemorate their babiesrsquo lives.The campaign was started  years ago and yet the fact remains that in our society, it is really only in the last couple of years that we have started to talk openly about baby loss.Indeed it remains a subject that few of us feel completely comfortable navigating. I will admit that before I became a mother three years ago, I had conversations with women who lost their baby during pregnancy and I know I didnrsquot handle those conversations very well.Maybe there isnrsquot a right thing to say, but I recognise now that that I, like so many of us do, shied away from much,any, conversation. Despite knowing that the phrase ldquoIrsquom so sorry was lacking, I refrained from empathising any further or asking questions because I felt I didnrsquot have the right words, I was afraid of saying too much, of saying the wrong thing, of being insensitive, and most of all I was afraid of upsetting that mother.But what I have learned since is that many women ndash and men ndash who have said goodbye to a child in pregnancy or during birth, want to talk about the loss. They donrsquot want you to cross the street to avoid them. Many want you to askthat baby had a name, or when his or her birthday would have been. Of course, itrsquos hard to know any of this unless we have the opportunity to have open and transparent conversations about such a sensitive and dficult issue.Talking about the subject of death is still quite taboo in our society, particularly when it is the death of a baby. But we shouldnrsquot underestimate the importance of talking about baby loss. Not only does it help those who are grieving, helping them to process what has happened, to stop blaming themselves and feel less alone in what can be an emotional and physical rollercoaster, it also gives us all the opportunity to develop the tools and language to discuss this emotive subject with greater understanding, helping to normalise something that is common - and indeed normal - but not talked about enough.Itrsquos ironic and perhaps a cruel reality of social norms that women are encouraged not to tell people about pregnancy until after the first trimester when sickness abates and the risk of miscarriage is greatly reduced. Surely the early stage is when pregnant women need compassion and understanding. The expectation to remain silent during the first  weeks of pregnancy means many couples faced with loss are left to grieve without the support that they need. After all, it doesnrsquot matter whether the loss of a baby is at eight weeks gestation or  weeks, the trauma felt by those who loved and wanted each child are the same. They had imagined their new family they had probably considered whether that baby was a boy or a girl and all sorts of other exciting plans.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This campaign is aided and supported by a number of the Prime Ministerrsquos own Conservative Party members.Sadly, what we are witnessing from many sections is an anti-British position rather than a debate based on any sound principles as to why there are not more pragmatic positions on providing a good deal for everyone involved.As someone who voted to remain within the EU I am extremely disturbed at the antagonistic stance being displayed by the European Union towards the democratic wish of the majority of the citizens of the United KingdomThis has brought me to thinking thatthis is their attitude in general to the UK, then we are better out of this vastly over regulated group. What is even more surprising is the attitude of the Irish Government. They are our near neighbours and have signicant trade with the UK, but are certainly making no attempt to have a conciliatory attitude to finding a positive deal.Given the potential economic loss to the Republic of Ireland, Irsquom curious as to why they are not attempting to use their influence, by their public utterances and in discussions with other EU members, to provide a more assuaging attitude to the situation. This I feel would be more conducive to sustaining beneficial trading relations between the two nations post Brexit.Thankfully the United Kingdom has a strong economy which has supported and assisted many smaller nations, including the Republic of Ireland in the EU for many years.It is hugely positive that Northern Ireland is part of the UK, the fth largest economy in the world. Moreover the UK is a signicant influencer throughout the world and a society that is a leader in freedom of democracy.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

But late yesterday it seemed certain to pass without a deal on the UKrsquos withdrawal.Speaking after being briefed by the EUrsquos chief negotiator Michel Barnier, Mr. Tusksaid he saw ldquono grounds for optimism ahead of the European Council summit.ldquoAs I see it, the only source of hope for a deal for now is the goodwill and determination on both sides, Mr. Tusk told a Brussels press conference.ldquoHowever, for a breakthrough to take place, besides goodwill we need new facts.Mr. Tusk said he would ask Mrs. May whether she had concrete proposals on how to break the impasse saying that only such proposals can determinea breakthrough is possible.Reports from Brussels suggested senior European Commission officials were casting doubt on the prospect of a special Brexit summit being declared for Novemberthere is no movement on the key issue of the Border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.Mrs. May won strong support from Cabinet colleagues on Tuesday as she set out two key ldquosticking points preventing the conclusion of a withdrawal agreement.The issues relate to the ldquobackstop agreement demanded by the EU to avoid a hard Border by keeping Northern Ireland within the European customs area.Mrs. May has countered by offering to keep the whole UK in a customs union, but only for a temporary period.She issued a plea for unity as she said she remained determined to secure a Brexit that would respect the result of the  referendum, protect jobs and security and preserve the Union.ldquoIrsquom convinced thatwe as a Government stand together and stand firm, we can achieve this, she said.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Projected as three-screens, the film was cleverly edited to juxtapose the ying yellow line constructions, from the scouts lining up their yellow kayaks to the farmers forming their line of yellow bales.With the use of dramatic aerial shots, the formation of the yellow lines could be seen clearly as they cut through the landscape, representing both the Border and itrsquos people. The film received great response from the audience participants as they witnessed the powerful result of their involvement.With lsquoAcross and In-Between,rsquo Suzanne Lacy highlights the wit and cleverness of Border le in the face of political pressures, focusing on the power of play in creatively responding to complex issues.Suzanne commented: ldquoOur project draws those who live along the often-invisible boundaries between countries into a conversationmdashmetaphoric and literal ndash on personal and symbolic meanings of this border and by extension all such borders drawn by political forces.ldquoThe artwork explores inverse paradigms: visible and invisible, official and unofficial, rural and urban, the real border and imagined ones. For a brief time, we suggest there is a unique in-between identity for those situated between two countries ndash a Border people ndash and through playful acts we explore this liminal identity.lsquoAcross and In-Betweenrsquo was co-commissioned by - NOW, the UKrsquos arts programme for the First World War centenary, and Belfast International Arts Festival, with the support of the Government of Irelandrsquos Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade .Across and In Between was co-created with Cian Smyth, Helen Sharp, Mark Thomas of Soup Co, Pedro Rebelo, Conan McIvor, Helen Sloan, Eva Grosman, Garrett Carr and people in Pettigo, Tullyhommon, Castlesaunderson, Magheraveely, Newtownbutler, Cuilcagh Mountain, Counties Fermanagh, Cavan, Monaghan and Donegal.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Knowing this, John gave up his teaching course and took a full time job at the boatyardhellipand the rest is history.Mr Freemantle moved from Penarth and started his own boat building workshop in South Clive Street in  with British Road Services ndash now National Freight Consortium.In , the business was expanded and relocated to a greenfield site within Cardf Marina, which is now the exact location of Bayscape.The boat yard at the time stored around - boats. Long before the Cardf Bay Barrage was built, the water was tidal and boats moored in the middle of the river.As there was no road to the marina, Mr Freemantlebuilt a track to enable him to get to and from the boat yard. In  he put pontoons for the boats and laid the first cement for the slipway which was all created by Mr Freemantles own hands.In  the Freemantlesset their sights on retiring and sold the boat yard - which had grown to storing more than  boats - to a family friend of their business partner who used to visit the boat yard as a child. And so Bayscape began.One day the couple were walking along the waterrsquos edge and looked across to see the unique development taking shape in the exact spot of Mr Freemantles beloved boat yard, where  years previously they brought in the original electrics, telephone line and water. The couple decided to move back to where they had spent many happy years.Mrs Freemantlesaid: ldquoWe love living here, it feels really safe and therersquos a great sense of community. I look forward to coming home.To find out more about Bayscape, visit www.bayscape , call    or email info@bayscape. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

As well as being a memorable occasion for the Accelerators, we believe it is important to help MPs understand the vital role that our company and the wider pub and bar industry play in offering, not just jobs, but worthwhile progressive careers, with arguably the best opportunity out of any industry to go from the bottom rung right to the very top. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community. Itrsquos been le-enhancing for us, and wersquove made all sorts of friends.ldquoPenarth town is a really good place to train a guide dog puppy, with a small arcade and local shops. People are very amenable and love being part of Gemrsquos education. We have the Esplanade, beaches and country parks, and wersquove even taken her to Ikea.\"People are very interested in the puppy and we rarely go on a walk without someone enquiring about what we are doing. Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day. Their yard or garden will also need to be securely fenced so that the puppy remains safely within its confines.Guide Dogs supplies basic equipment, covers all veterinary and feeding expenses, and provides a network of support and advice.To find out more about becoming a puppy raiser for Guide Dogs, ring Steve Kersley on   and leave a message, or email Steve.Kersley@guidedogs.org.uk article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

Birches Primary School Eco Team A new Eco Team launched the special video entitled ‘Our Footpath Dilemma’ which highlighted the dangers pupils face.In a delightful storytelling format, the pupils have been photographed at ious parts of the road leading up to the school.Clever graphics and simple story telling gets across the dficulties faced by pupils, young and very young as well as their parents and staff.It portrays how the footpath starts to disappear not far from the school building. And their simple demand is to have a proper footpath to make it safe for everyone to walk to school.A private development had recently built a short footpath along part of the route. This made it safer for part of the route.Unfortunately it wasn’t long until the new footpath stopped. This was the unsafe route left for the children.The pupils had to walk in single file on the road and had to be supervised by an adult.Now the Eco Team are spearheading a campaign. They asked: “Can the government turn their frowns upside down and give them the footpath they so desperately need ”Backing their campaign is Lord Mayor Julie Flaherty who spent the morning with her Ulster Unionist colleague MLA Doug Beattie at the school to hear their desperate plea for a foopath.She said: “I feel very proud of the pupils who have a strong community spirit and great campaigners!“They have shown a great deal of determination and perseverance.

I have been told I will receive a reply mid November.“I will keep writing to them, and have invited them to come with me out to the Birches. If they won’t come to us at the Birches, we will bring a delegation from school to them.”A Department for Infrastructure spokesperson said:“We are aware of the excellent work done by the Eco team at the Birches primary school in raising awareness of their request for a new footway. In addition to the social media work I can advise that the Department has received a number of letters in the past week from public representatives in the area backing the request for a footway.

Ulster Business speaks to Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI and some of those burgeoning firms it has developed strong relationships with over the decades Long-term support is very much at the heart of the decades of partnership between Bank of Ireland and its business customers.And whether it’s offering a wide range of financial assistance, growth support or general advice, the bank has formed le-long partnerships with companies from right across the sectors, and from the large to the very small.It’s been there for three of its longest-running customers – with a combined almost -year history – from the start, and played a key role as a partner in each of their own growth stories.Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI at Bank of Ireland UK, told Ulster Business:“We base our business on a relationship management model – we spend a lot of time with the businesses, we know the owners and their management teams, their growth objectives and ambitions and understand the businesses.“That enables us to provide the right suite of products – challenging business plans, providing funding and help. There’s also the chance to introduce them to potential customers, signpost to expert advice, and become a partner to that customer, rather than just be a funder. It’s very much a partnership approach.“We provide lending facilities to business from the very small micro firm, right through their le-cycle, their growth phase, and scaling up to small and medium-sized businesses.”And for Gavin, it’s all about offering a range of services and assistance “under one roof”.“We have the ability to lend up to £m for business customers. There is the consistency to our approach, and that’s really important in the Northern Ireland market.”Partnership is a phrase that continues to raise its head in Bank of Ireland, regarding both its relationships with business customers, and the longevity and generational nature of the companies it’s developed long-term relationships with.“We would have many instances where a mother and father have built a business, and now the second generation is taking on the management,” Gavin said. “We are involved across both generations, and we are very privileged to be part of that family and business development.”“It’s in our interest that the company continues to grow and thrive and we have been very important in that role.”Nowhere is that more evident than with the hugely successful family-owned McKeever Hotel Group.What started out as a family restaurant business in Randalstown, Co Antrim back in , has blossomed into a burgeoning food and hospitality business boasting five hotels across Northern Ireland and Donegal.And the McKeever Hotel Group is still very much a family affair. In the last  years, the breadth of the business has grown to include Corrs Corner in Newtownabbey, the Dunsilly Hotel in Antrim, Ballymena’s the Adair Arms, Dillons in Letterkenny, and its latest hotel, the Dunadry in Antrim.Today, Eugene McKeever, along with his we Catherine, daughter Bridgene and son Eddie, run the thriving hotel empire which employs around  part-time and full-time staff.“The family business started in  when my parents opened the first restaurant in Randalstown – my dad was a chef and mum was teaching,” Bridgene, who is marketing director, said.“They then bought Corrs Corner. That’s when Bank of Ireland really become involved in the company and helped us out.“We have been supported by Bank of Ireland in a number of ways.”That includes the multi-million pound funding for the refurbishment of the Dunadry Hotel, in addition to funding support provided for the acquisition in .“Bank of Ireland has been with the company during its entire history. In , with the Adair Arms, we were one of the few people back then who were buying, due to the recession,” she said.“There has always been trust and the faith with the bank. My dad has always said – speak to your bank manager, and be honest with them.”The McKeever Hotel Group’s single biggest investment has been with the -bedroom Dunadry.Gavin says that one of Bank of Ireland’s core objectives is to help “customers to thrive”.“In doing that, it covers a lot of dferent things, and it’s not just about being profitable,” he said.“We specically tailor our packages to the customer needs. Their success, is our success and we are very privileged to be part of that growth story.”Eamon McCay started his cooking oil business at a small Strabane premises. He’s now grown Frylite from a small family operation to an Ireland-wide firm with more than  staff, boasting a turnover of £m.And he’s been helped along the way by Bank of Ireland amid ongoing expansion and growth. It’s a relationship which has so far lasted more than  years, and shows no signs of slowing down.“I started Frylite in , delivering fresh oil and collecting used oil. I combined all of the areas in one,” Eamon says.And that initial  sq ft building has grown to five depots across Ireland, with a further site on the cards for yet more expansion. “We supply our vegetable oils to hotels, fast food outlets, commercial businesses, bakeries, industrial food service sector… it’s been gradual growth.”A depot in Galway in  was followed by another two years later in Dublin, with Coleraine and Cork following a short time later. And its Strabane base is now a , sq ft building on a four-acre site.Since , Bank of Ireland has provided facilities to the business including invoice discounting, asset finance and term and cash flow ending, and also previously used stockline facility.Speaking about his strong relationship with Bank of Ireland, Eamon says a commercial finance package ensured the businesses growth.“The bank have gotten to know the business. I felt like I have had a partner, which is invested in the business. Building good relationships is one of the values,” he said.But it’s not just about providing help and finance to customers. Bank of Ireland is sponsor of Catalyst Inc’s Invent competition and is also working with organisations such as the NI Chamber and CBI to showcase and help companies improve skills, digital prowess and scale exports.Another business with a more than two-decade relationship with Bank of Ireland is Pinnacle.And just some of the Sage Platinum Reseller’s top customers include everyone from the Irish Football Associationand Ulster Rugby to Titanic Belfast and Mash Direct.The software partner, which was set up in Belfast in , now boasts a team of more than  experienced providers of Sage business management software solutions, IT services and support.“Going from humble beginnings, the company has grown into a £m business,” Fran McKee, Pinnacle’s marketing director said.The firm, which is headed by founder Ken Montgomery, has been supported by Bank of Ireland through its stages of growth, which has included organic expansion and acquisition. “We have a solid partnership with Bank of Ireland, which has nurtured our business since its inception in .”The firm offers businesses solutions from simple to more complex business needs with Sage. It now has  offices across the UK and Ireland, but according to Fran, there is “massive growth on the agenda”.“We want to be a £m business within the next few years and as well as growing our Sage ision we want to also grow our IT services offering and with the bank’s support we’ll achieve our growth ambitions.  You can come to us as a one-stop-shop for IT and software requirements.“Customers today are very focused on providing a good service as well as achieving their growth ambitions, so they want to have the software in place to help them make decisions and run their businesses effectively.”And Gavin says the key message is that Bank of Ireland is a “proven and consistent funding partner for businesses over a long period of time.”“We work hard to build a great rapport and great trust with our clients and these long term relationships are testament to that. It is exciting to share the journey of young and small businesses to growth and expansion and we’re keen to help the next generation seize new opportunities for their businesses.” ■View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"pinnacle marks  years with huge bash in portugal","story":"Posted on Thursday October  by Ulster Business Belfast firm Pinnacle – a leading provider of Sage software and IT solutions – has celebrated  years in business by taking more than  of its staff to Portugal for an an all-expenses paid trip.The company, which has branches throughout the UK and Republic of Ireland, flew its workers to a five-star resort in Vilamoura, to mark the occasion.The five-star celebrations included welcome lunch overlooking the Vilamoura Marina, followed by spa treatments and water sports.

It’s through getting to know our clients and their business that we can best share our knowledge and advice around the type of financial support they need.“At First Trust Bank, having listened to what our customers wanted, we invested in six new business centres across Northern Ireland to support fast, local decision making. We also established a Small Business Centre to meet the needs of our smaller customers. Now firmly embedded in their respective communities, these centres – coupled with our expert sectoral advisors – are on hand to help business owners identy opportunity and risks and how best to mitigate or capitalise upon them.”Richard Donnan, head of Northern Ireland at Ulster Bank, says it “is strongly committed to supporting businesses of all sizes, from micro firms right through to large corporates”.“Our latest results show a % in small business drawdowns, and we continue to work hard through initiatives such as our Boost initiative and our Entrepreneur Accelerator to build mutually beneficial relationships with firms across Northern Ireland. “A key focus for the bank is the development of digital services that make it simpler, easier and safer for customers to bank with us. “Our digitally active customer base grew by % year-on-year and we are continuing to respond to that change, for example, by introducing our Business Growth Enablers and through the development of our digital s such as our mobile app.”But it’s not all bank financing. The Growth Loan Fund offers assistance to Northern Ireland-based companies who demonstrate growth, and tend to work within the manufacturing, engineering or tradable services sectors. “Loans will be typically unsecured and personal guarantees will not be sought. The loans provided are expected to be complementary to existing sources of finance, including banks, trade finance sources and equity investors.”Some of the companies availing of the finance include Belfast-based BLK BOX Fitness, which secured £, to grow its online  and boost exports, along with Fermanagh gin-maker Boatyard Distillery.Meanwhile, the BGF was set up in  with £.bn and has since backed close to  companies. Last year, BGF was the UK’s top institutional investor and ranked the seventh most active private investor in the world by number of investments. Upstream is a Belfast-based alternative finance company specialising in SME funding, and has also now introduced a trade finance option for clients. The market-first solution unlocks the ability for businesses to finance their working capital needs end to end, from supplier to buyer.Niall Harkin is director of customer journeys at Danske Bank. He says “personal engagement is still really important” when dealing with small and medium-sized firms looking at expansion.“That’s why last year we introduced a team of  dedicated small business advisers back in to key branches across Northern Ireland, giving customers access to expertise in their local area to discuss business plans and explore funding options,” he said.“Meanwhile, teams of experienced relationship managers supported by specialists in areas such as cash management, markets and trade finance, support our larger SME customers.“At the same time, we’re investing heavily in our digital offering, and recently added the capability for SMEs to get lending decisions in a matter of minutes in ious situations. ‘future financing’ makes the whole credit process much easier for our customers. For an overdraft, we’ve seen approvals in four minutes and access to money well within  hours. “In the future, customers should be able to go online and request an overdraft increase on a smartphone at home.”But aside from the financial support, businesses here can also turn to the support from hubs. That includes Ormeau Baths’s Barclays Eagle Labs – which is located at the south Belfast listed building – and the Ignite NI Propel Pre-Accelerator. The options are out there and available for companies wishing to take that next step, whether traditional banking or alternative streams are the way to go.

The Northern Ireland Hotels Federation said a \"shudder\" was going through the industry, which comprises  hotels and , bedrooms. In Belfast, , rooms were added over the past year, thanks to new construction of six new venues, including the Hampton by Hilton and the Grand Central, and extensions to two existing hotels. The federation said the market was going through a \"stutter\" with occupancy and room rates going down. \"It is important to note that demand for hotel rooms has grown over the last year, but it hasnt kept pace with the increase in supply,\" it added. A separate report by PwC put the cost of an overnight stay in a Belfast hotel at £.

Overall analysis shows a reduction in occupancy levels and a decline in rate.\" She said Northern Ireland needed a new tourism selling point - suggesting something like Failte Irelands Wild Atlantic Way promotion, but for the north west and west coast. \"Demand is growing, but this needs to be accelerated with a number of interventions, including increased promotion, a bigger marketing budget and a proposition of scale for Northern Ireland along the lines of the Wild Atlantic Way,\" she added. \"Measures like this will allow the market to adapt to and absorb new supply. There has been a seismic change and a response of equal measure is required to create new business.\" Ms Gault said challenges for the sector included skills and staff, as well as Brexit, which had led to \"considerable uncertainty\". \"Added to this are the issues around tax, in particular VAT, access constraints and capacity at key attractions,\" she said. \"You can see why the market is experiencing a shudder as we come to the end of an era of exceptional trading.\" And while  would be quiet in comparison to the flurry of openings in , it was \"far from dormant\", the federation said. There are to be new openings in Londonderry and Newry and Mourne, while ventures on the north coast are now \"dependent on what has become a protracted planning process\". But Ms Gault said that despite some problems, the hotel sector \"has strong prospects\". However, drawing in more visitors was paramount. \"We need to increase the size of the tourism cake to ensure that each hotel gets a good slice of business,\" she said. \"Having spent in the region of £m, the hotel sector is keen to see aon this investment and a realisation of the industrys potential.\" A full briefing on the forecast takes place this morning at a business breakfast at Hospitality Exchange, which is taking place at the Crowne Plaza, Belfast.

Belfast City Council’s planning committee approved Primark’s listed building consent application for the Bank Buildings. It means the conservation-led works to take down the top two floors of Bank Buildings can now begin. “Once these unstable elements are removed, works can take place to install a facade retention scheme,” the council said. “It will also make it possible to reduce the cordon and restore pedestrian access between Royal Avenue and Donegall Place, subject to health and safety considerations as work takes place.” It also means Primark will be able to open up once again, at the building’s new extension. Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium , said: \"This is terric news for Primark and for the retail hub of Belfast City Centre. Now that planning has been granted they can start the work to bring down the facade and put up the protection that will allow the cordon to reduce and for stores within the cordon to open. “This will be a le line for those traders in the cordon and those without who have seen their footfall drop by over %.
