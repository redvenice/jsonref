But grown-up politicians and BBC chiefs knew the score.A later chair of the BBC, Marmaduke Hussey, shrugged away such squalls: \u0027The BBC will always have an antagonistic relationship with the government of the day — that is in the nature of its independence.\u0027But all that has changed. Within weeks of being told that the Johnson Government intends to decriminalise non-payment of the licence fee — thereby (in the worst fears of BBC supporters) making it a voluntary payment — we were told that the licence fee itself would be abolished.         There was some rowing back on that incendiary revelation this week when it was suggested that Boris Johnson and his consigliere Dominic Cummings are at odds on the issue\u0027We will whack it,\u0027 was the mob-style threat attributed to a senior Government source. I think we can all guess who. There was some rowing back on that incendiary revelation this week when it was suggested that Boris Johnson and his consigliere Dominic Cummings are at odds on the issue but, if such a bold step were to be taken, it would spell the end of the BBC as we know it.Until recently, the BBC\u0027s affable director-general, Tony Hall, imagined that he would retire in 2022 after celebrating 100 years of Auntie broadcasting to the nation and the wider world.But in the space of barely a month all that has changed. Not only will Hall be gone long before 2022, it\u0027s not clear that there will be much to celebrate by then — or even if the BBC itself will survive.How did it come to this? Boris Johnson is — sorry, Boris — just one more transient politician. Cummings will one day be an expanded footnote in British history.So how come these two here-today-gone-tomorrow figures are in with a good chance of wrecking an institution which, like the Royal Family and the NHS, is loved and admired around the world?         Until recently, the BBC\u0027s affable director-general, Tony Hall (pictured), imagined that he would retire in 2022 after celebrating 100 years of Auntie broadcasting to the nation and the wider worldWe should concede that lots of people are currently very cross with the BBC. Given three polarised years of Brexit-fulled anger it\u0027s hardly surprising that both sides ended up blaming the messenger.Remainers will go to their graves cursing the Brexit Broadcasting Corporation. Leavers will forever believe the BBC is run by out-of-touch metropolitan elite pinkoes. This is not the place to arbitrate between these two camps. But the bitterness on both sides will — let\u0027s hope — soon pass and we will tune in to a much more urgent problem which society is belatedly waking up to: no one knows what to believe any more.That\u0027s a slight exaggeration. Two-thirds of us, according to a recent poll, can no longer distinguish between a good source of information and a dodgy one.The crisis over fake news is one of the biggest threats to democratic societies — bigger, on some views, than terrorism. If citizens can no longer distinguish between fact and fiction, they become easy meat for populist politicians who can play on their ignorance.Donald Trump is a genius at speaking directly to the 72 million who follow him on Twitter. A team at the Washington Post calculates that, since becoming President, he has made more than 16,000 false or misleading statements.         Donald Trump is a genius at speaking directly to the 72 million who follow him on TwitterBut who cares what real journalists find? Trump has made it his business to discredit and delegitimise the work of decent reporters. His brand of politics — like Russia\u0027s Vladimir Putin and Turkey\u0027s Recep Tayyip Erdogan — depends on creating a fog of uncertainty in which his facts are as good as anyone else\u0027s.America has no BBC, or anything like it. Its citizens make do, for their information, with dying newspapers, opinionated talk radio, a swamp of social media and the shrill partisanship of channels such as Fox News. Into that cacophony steps the master manipulator of truth.Whatever the current failings of BBC journalism, it is at least some kind of universally available tent peg in the ground. It does not always succeed in being impartial or fair to all sides.Indeed, it makes its fair share of clumsy mistakes.There was that over-enthusiastic tweet from its political editor Laura Kuenssberg claiming that one of Health Secretary Matt Hancock\u0027s advisers had been punched in the face by a Labour activist, something that turned out to be untrue.And newsreader Huw Edwards liked a tweeted video that said \u0027Vote Labour for the National Health Service\u0027, a lapse he excused on the basis that he hadn\u0027t watched the clip right to the end.Matters were not helped by the fact that both incidents occurred during a highly charged General Election campaign. But the BBC behaves — by and large — extremely ethically and responsibly. It is to my eyes — as someone who edited a national newspaper for more than 20 years — as good a news organisation as any on the planet.It is out there reporting on the world, as well as spread out across our nation in a way that no other news organisation could even dream of.It is accountable and transparent in the way that few newspapers are: see the furore and multi-million pound inquiries that can follow on from mistakes that would pass unnoticed in Fleet Street.         But the BBC behaves — by and large — extremely ethically and responsibly. It is to my eyes — as someone who edited a national newspaper for more than 20 years — as good a news organisation as any on the planet (stock photo)It funds 150 reporters to sit in courts and councils to be watchdogs on our behalf.That doesn\u0027t make it perfect. We all have our gripes. I wish for it to be braver in its investigative journalism. I, too, shout at the Today programme and cringe at Question Time.But the appropriate response to under-performance is reform. The NHS has badly performing hospitals, the strain of severe winters and crises over rogue consultants. The answer is constant improvement, not abolition.Some say the BBC is doomed long term because millennials are not only switching to streaming services, such as Netflix and HBO, but also increasingly failing to pay the licence fee. There is some truth in this, but there is nothing to stop us following the example of Norway, which is in the process of phasing out its licence fee model in favour of one based on a general public service tax.To those who argue that we should get rid of the licence fee and turn the BBC into a privatised subscription service for people who want to pay to be informed, I say prepare to watch a decline in trust and an inevitable parallel rise in information inequality.Such an approach is not technically feasible in any case. As Culture minister John Whittingdale (a former Culture Secretary) has pointed out, Freeview — Britain\u0027s largest television platform — is incapable of switching off certain stations for non-subscribers.Scrapping Freeview and putting all BBC channels online is not an option either, as a large number of viewers do not have access to broadband or are unwilling to pay for it.The inescapable truth is that without a public-sector broadcaster, we will — like America — see the growth of a gap between an informed elite and the rest. We\u0027ll lose the glue that binds us and become more polarised and doubtful about whom to believe.You don\u0027t have to imagine the informational chaos that will follow: it\u0027s happening in too many countries around the world right now.So don\u0027t allow two transient figures to dismember the BBC. If Brexit was about anything, it was about taking back control — including our own narrative.

Its provocative power springs from the same source as its total, crushing banality: in telling the story of Kim Jiyoung – whose name is the Korean equivalent of “Jane Doe” – Cho Nam-joo’s third novel has been hailed as giving voice to the unheard everywoman.When we meet Jiyoung, she is 33, with a one-year-old child. Her life is unremarkable, except that she has begun to take on the personalities of other people. During a visit to her in-laws, Jiyoung slips into her mother’s identity and speaks in a manner deemed inappropriate for her place in the age-based hierarchy of Korean society. Her father-in-law is outraged, thundering: “Is this how you behave in front of your elders?”Jiyoung agrees to visit a psychiatrist, and his record of their conversations about her life makes up most of this slim novel. She was born when “checking the sex of the foetus and aborting females was common practice, as if ‘daughter’ was a medical problem”. We see that though she has always played by the rules, she cannot win. “Jiyoung was standing in the middle of a labyrinth. Conscientiously and calmly, she was searching for a way out that didn’t exist.” The clinical, dispassionate third-person account, annotated by reports from newspapers and official demographic data, catalogues the systemic oppression she has faced. At school, boys eat first, and she suffers sexual harassment and victim blaming. In the workplace, she has first-hand experience of the gender pay gap (“women working in Korea earn only 63 per cent of what men earn”). And while performing the uncompensated, costly work of motherhood, she is horrified to hear herself denigrated as a parasitic “mum-roach”.What does it mean to narrate a life in a strictly chronological fashion? The linearity of the account feels claustrophobic, with the case-study style objectifying Jiyoung and stripping her of her interiority. Cho’s formal excision of any sense of imaginative possibility is highly effective in creating an airless, unbearably dull world in which Jiyoung’s madness makes complete sense. Her derangement is the only way out of the cramped paradox of gender-based roles.As time passes, the novel shows how attitudes towards gender are entwined with socioeconomic issues. Cho spotlights the Korean financial crisis of 1997, after which increases in wage inequality and barriers to social mobility contributed to a sense of despair, fuelling misogynistic sentiments. Jiyoung’s life is also set against more positive developments, such as new legislation against gender discrimination – but the path to progress is serpentine. “The world had changed a great deal, but the little rules, contracts and customs had not, which meant the world hadn’t actually changed at all.”“When you girls grow up, maybe we’ll even have a female president!”, speculated Jiyoung’s mother to her young daughter. And indeed, when Kim Jiyoung was published in Korea in 2016, there was a female president: Park Geun-hye, the daughter of military dictator Park Chung-hee. But Park Geun-hye adopted her father’s method of patriarchal authoritarianism. Under her leadership, gender inequality worsened, women took a disproportionate hit from the growing wealth gap and the number of sex crimes rose.Park Geun-hye was eventually brought down by a huge corruption scandal that erupted in 2016, causing millions of Koreans to take to the streets calling for her impeachment. In May that year, a 34-year-old man murdered a random woman in a Seoul subway, stating that he did so because he felt “ignored” and “belittled” by women. The public outcry that followed this attack fused the widespread energy of change with a nascent popular feminist consciousness, taking root in the Korean version of #MeToo.Kim Jiyoung’s publication during this seachange in mood could not have been more perfectly timed. The first Korean novel in nearly a decade to sell more than 1m copies, it has become both a touchstone for a conversation around feminism and gender and a lightning rod for anti-feminists who view the book as inciting misandry (there was a crowdfunding campaign for a book called Kim Ji‑hoon, Born 1990, showing the “reverse discrimination” faced by men). The book has also touched a nerve globally: a bestseller in China, Taiwan and Japan, it has been translated into 18 languages, in English by Jamie Chang, and adapted for film.The character of Kim Jiyoung can be seen as a sort of sacrifice: a protagonist who is broken in order to open up a channel for collective rage. Along with other socially critical narratives to come out of Korea, such as Bong Joon-ho’s Oscar-winning film Parasite, her story could change the bigger one.• Kim Jiyoung, Born 1982 by Cho Nam-joo, translated by Jamie Chang, is published by Scribner (£12.99).

Melanie Baker, senior economist at Royal London Asset Management, said:Inflation rose closer to the Bank of England’s target, but underneath the noise of the headline figures, domestically-driven inflation still looks weak.Business sentiment and the follow-through to activity data will, however, be the more important determinant of whether the Bank of England cut rates or not in coming months.Jing Teow, an economist at PwC, said there could be risks of increasing inflation on the horizon – suggesting that the Bank would hesitate before a cut to interest rates.A prolonged shutdown in production activity as a result of Covid-19 could exert a drag on industrial production and disrupt global supply chains, which could lead to further inflationary pressures as the shortage of inputs and key components start to bite. Looking towards the medium-term, a modest recovery this year that spurs further business activity, combined with continued upward pressure on wages due to a tight labour market could also give rise to inflationary pressures.For a view on just how unusual the past decade has been in monetary policy terms, take a look at this graph from a speech by the Bank of England’s chief economist Andy Haldane (with its impressive range of sources included). Central bankers are desperate to push interest rates back up, but fears over the slowing global economy have for the most part stymied those efforts. Some more reactions on the slight-surprise inflation reading – first of all from a man who a week ago would not have been expected to be in the spotlight, and his opposition, who is likely to leave the spotlight in April.Families across the country are better off as a result of the strong wage growth and low inflation over the last 18 months.We want to go further to help with the cost of living – that’s why we’ve cut taxes for 31m people and given nearly 2.4m a pay rise through our record increase to the National Living Wage.John McDonnell, Labour’s shadow chancellor, focused on the jump in prices. He said:The Tories’ poor economic management has contributed to an unstable economy, with prices rising sharply for people already suffering from ten years of vicious cuts.Successive Conservative governments have repeatedly blamed anyone but themselves for an under-performing economy.It’s time for this chaotic government to take responsibility for these failings, and to reverse the decade of decline the Tories have brought to this economy.The figures were in line with the Bank’s January monetary policy report forecast, according to Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, a consultancy. She said:While CPI inflation rose for the first time in six months, the inflation figures were in line with the Bank of England’s expectations, so they are unlikely to move the dial on the outlook for interest rates. House prices rose across the UK in December – the first time that has happened since February 2018. Although the ONS did not give a specific reason for the increase, many economists have ascribed the rise in prices to the Conservative party’s majority won in the general election of 12 December.The ONS’s head of inflation, Mike Hardie, said:Annual house prices grew across all regions of the UK, the first time this has happened in nearly two years, with London seeing its strongest growth since October 2017.The consumer price index (CPI) of inflation (still the measure used by the Bank of England, despite the ONS’s best efforts) has faded over the past few years as the effects of the post-Brexit-vote devaluation of sterling have passed through.The ONS’s head of inflation, Mike Hardie, said: The rise in inflation is largely the result of higher prices at the pump and airfares falling by less than a year ago. In addition, gas and electricity prices were unchanged this month, but fell this time last year due to the introduction of the energy price cap. Traders are ascribing the positivity to a slight dip in the number of new cases of the Covid-19 coronavirus. The World Health Organisation reported 73,332 cases worldwide on Tuesday, the vast majority of which are in China.AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould credited a small fall in the number of new coronavirus cases and apparent hopes that central banks will intervene to prop up the global economy for the stock market gains. He said:It feels like markets are looking for any excuse to feel positive at the moment. Apple’s coronavirus-linked iPhone sales warning earlier this week may have spooked investors briefly. However, markets have soon shifted their attention elsewhere. An interesting update on the trade relationship between the UK and the EU: German exports to the UK fell to their lowest level since 2013 last year.German exports to Britain fell for the fourth year running in 2019, according to Statistical Office data seen by Reuters, as the weak pound dampened demand and uncertainty over post-Brexit trade regulations disrupted existing supply chains. Exports of cars, aircraft and aircraft parts, electronic equipment and pharmaceutical products had fallen, the data showedMartin Braml, a trade expert at the Ifo research institute, said: The main cause is the continuing uncertainty over the trade relationship after 2020, when the transition phase is over.Here’s the torrid tale of the 737 Max’s almost three years since launching.Troubles first emerged on 29 October 2018, when 189 people aboard a Lion Air flight from Jakarta crashed. In March Boeing’s fleet was grounded.The first Boeing 737 Max begins commercial operations with Malindo Air. Norwegian Air is also an early adopter of the new model, operating transatlantic flights. The model promises fuel efficiencies attractive to carriers.Lion Air flight JT610 crashes after making a sudden, sharp e into the Java Sea 13 minutes after departing from Jakarta, Indonesia.

In a note published on Monday its analysts said:Boeing’s decision to temporarily halt the production of the 737 Max will weigh on Q1 GDP, subtracting as much as 0.5 percentage points, because of the effect on manufacturers down the supply chain.Here’s Boeing’s full statement on the debris discovery, from a spokesman:That finding led to a robust internal investigation and immediate corrective actions in our production system. We are also inspecting all stored 737 Max airplanes at Boeing to ensure there is no FOD. We have already recommended to our customers with airplanes in active storage for more than one year to inspect the fuel tank for FOD as part of their procedures. We continue to have conversations with our customers about the best approach for inspections of their stored airplanes prior to return to service.Some more on Boeing, a company so big that its travails have caused an appreciable dent in US manufacturing figures.Boeing lost its crown as the world’s largest producer of planes in 2019 to fierce European rival Airbus – for the first time since 2011. Boeing produced only 380 planes last year, compared to Airbus’s 863.The decision to ground the 737 Max planes was taken by regulators, but the follow-on effect of Boeing halting production of its most popular plane is hitting smaller suppliers around the US, according to this informative report in the FT (£).The drop has affected everyone from toilet parts suppliers to major listed companies such as Spirit Aerosystems, which laid off 2,800 people as demand for its fuselage dropped.The threat for Boeing is that the longer it idles its own machines and workers, the greater the risk of long-term damage to the supply chain. Bank has appointed a new chief executive – or rather, it has removed the word “interim” from his title.The struggling lender on Wednesday said that Dan Frumkin would be the man to lead the bank permanently, after an accounting scandal that has so far cost it the jobs of its colourful founding chairman and its chief executive.Frumkin joined the bank in September as chief transformation officer, taking charge of changing systems, and stepped into the breach as interim chief executive after Craig Donaldson quit.It’s quite a change in a few months for Frumkin: the 55-year-old most recently spent eight years as global chief operating officer at the Bank of N.T. Butterfield \u0026amp Son, a community bank based in Bermuda. He has previously held roles at Royal Bank of Scotland and Northern Rock.Beyond the investigations into the accounting error, which saw loans misclassified, Frumkin will also have the task of turning around the bank’s share price. It’s worth less than a 20th of its price in March 2018.Good morning, and welcome to our live coverage of the world of business, economics and markets.Boeing has ordered inspections of its entire fleet of grounded 737 Max planes after it found debris in the fuel tanks of some, in the latest setback for the US planemaker.It is still less than a year since the second fatal crash of a Boeing 737 Max that grounded the model’s entire global fleet, and the company is racing to recertify with regulators that the planes can fly safely.The fuel tanks are unrelated to the flaws to sensors thought to have contributed towards the two crashes.Boeing built about 400 of the planes which it could not deliver to customers, and its orders have suffered after it was forced to cut back production at its factory near Seattle.Specialist aviation blog Leeham News, which first reported the discovery of the “foreign object debris” (FOD), said the inspections would likely not delay the recertification.

From automated systems that monitor cashflow, to software that sends out emails, there’s a plethora of online tools available to help small firms growSelf-driving cars, surgery carried out by robots, facial recognition software – the transformative potential of artificial intelligence (AI) and its implications for the world of work have rarely been out of the headlines in recent years. “Everything we assume about work, jobs, training and education – and being human – is being challenged by exponential scientific and technological progress,” futurist author Gerd Leonhard says. “Humanity will change more in the next 20 years than in the previous 300.”Considering the magnitude and scale of this fourth industrial revolution, it’s understandable that many small business owners feel left behind. Few will have the teams of data scientists, money and know-how to create their own bespoke solutions, unless they’re operating in the AI sector themselves. Yet many will be using platforms and tools that already incorporate AI – anyone doing a Google search, for example, is experiencing it in action. “You can be sure there isn’t a human sitting in a cubicle, sifting by hand through the entire internet to decide which search result to serve you,” says Cassie Kozyrkov, chief decision scientist at Google.This technology is most often used by businesses in three different ways: automating processes (such as timed newsletter sends, or bank account reconciliation), data analysis to gain insights (and then performing tasks such as recommending products to customers), and engaging with the public (via customer service chatbots, for example). Much of this has been made possible by cloud computing (a way of storing data remotely), which has given smart platforms powered by the cloud millions of anonymised users’ data to learn from and adapt accordingly. It’s rapidly accelerated the development of tools that are simple for small business owners to use but highly effective in terms of eliminating repetitive tasks, streamlining operations, and enabling sustainable growth.‘It’s important to have a clear mind’“What beekeepers really like is the 88-million-year-old technology that bees use to do all sorts of smart things, like organise their hives, and produce wax and royal jelly from their bodies,” Dale Gibson, co-founder of Bermondsey Street Bees, says about introducing the art of beekeeping to technology. “The last real technological discovery in beekeeping was in America in 1852.”While respecting that heritage, Gibson has been able to incorporate technological development into his business in a number of ways, since installing his first hives on his London roof in 2007. “I do start off with a proper, gummed up, sticky with honey notebook, where the data is gathered in the field,” he says. “But when I come home, I enter that information into a system on the cloud where my associate beekeeper can look it up.” He’s also working on a pilot programme with the World Bee Project to test remote monitors that track the health of hives, such as their weight. That data is then fed back into a central system, shared by 32,000 beekeepers across more than 150 countries. The project hopes this information will help to create more sustainable ecosystems and improve global food security.Gibson is also exploring the potential of tracking his honey via a blockchain system, first trialled by the technology company Oracle at the 2019 OpenWorld show in Dubai. “Anything that can help us distinguish between real, raw local honey and the manufactured commodity that’s come from halfway around the world and been blended, heated and mashed up, then that’s a good thing,” says Gibson, adding that honey is the third most tampered with product in the world, after milk and olive oil.While technology can sometimes be daunting for SME owners to incorporate, he says it’s given him more time to focus on the bees. “We’re massively assisted by having Xero on our phones too so we can use it for inventory record keeping, invoicing and statements at any time and anywhere,” he says. He finds the automatic reminders to customers that an invoice is due (or late) particularly helpful, as is the functionality that automatically reconciles his bank statements. “Even though you’re running a small business and lots of things can happen, it’s really important to have a clear mind.”‘We’re trying very hard to make online successful’Since starting in 2011, Papersmiths has grown from a two-employee interior design studio in Bridport, to launching an additional chain of five stationary shops. The company now employs 25 staff and has a presence in some of the UK’s most desirable retail locations (including Bristol, Brighton, and Chelsea in London).Smart technology has played a clear role in the business’s growth, co-founder Sidonie Warren says. The majority of their data is tracked using point-of-sale software Vend, which integrates with Xero. “That’s excellent because it allows us to track what we’re selling, right down to a specific product or colour,” says Warren. “When we open a new store we use that data to figure out what it is we need to buy, and also planning the fit out of the store.” Shop managers also use it to identify that week’s top five products, and arrange displays accordingly.Building the e-commerce arm of the business has been a key focus for Warren recently. “Our challenge is translating that thing of testing a pen or feeling the paper of a notebook into the digital realm,” she says. Automating email sends via Mailchimp has enabled her to engage new customers via discount codes, and she can target people known to be top spenders at certain times of the year using sales data from Shopify.She uses Xero weekly to plan cashflow, as well as process payroll and track all of her staff expenses. She still uses the personal touch – if a customer is late paying an invoice for example, she’d rather call than send an automatic reminder – but is open to integrating new technology in the future, including an online customer service chatbot, and some sort of retail mapping system. “With online you can see how many times a product gets viewed but it’s very hard to do that in store,” she adds.‘We’ve grown substantially and it’s all down to being in control of our finances’Richard Fishenden worked as a farrier fitting horseshoes before he started Made by the Forge in 2006. “My wife went into a local shop that sold curtain poles and I was horrified at the prices. I said bollocks to that, I’m going to make them myself,” he says. The range has since extended beyond bespoke curtain poles, to other wrought iron homeware items.Fishenden says he used to be “archaic with technology”, but has managed to automate processes in various areas. “Xero seems to be the central part of the spider’s web that everything else feeds from,” he says. That includes an order system, where delivery notes and worksheets are generated so staff know what products to make a customer relationship management system for customer data that Fishenden uses to send quotes via Xero, and then follow up on leads that were once buried in paperwork and Receipt Bank for invoices and receipts that he says has saved hours of data inputting.Sign up to Xero here with a free trial"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f5a4215765c202850b5da594b4b26071c8d5223/0_35_2203_1322/master/2203.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=01a1de7a8ffb84a4d6291634b536b26d","title":"eugenics andrew sabisky right ideas human breeding","story":"If there’s one thing policymakers love, it’s simple technical ideas that can solve complex problems at a stroke. They’re always on the lookout for what the American nuclear physicist, Alvin Weinberg, in 1965 termed the “technological fix”, be it a high-speed rail network to solve regional inequality, or nuclear power as an answer to the climate crisis.This week, one old and discredited technological fix has reared its head: eugenics, the pseudoscientific belief that humans can be bred to “perfection” in the same way we breed cattle or domestic pets for particular traits. Developed by Charles Darwin’s cousin, Francis Galton, in the 19th century, it was promoted by politicians and intellectuals in Britain, before becoming the justification for millions of involuntary sterilisations globally, mainly of the poor and disabled, and the Nazis’ devastating programme of “racial hygiene” that culminated in the Holocaust.One might think that such a morally and scientifically vacuous ideology would be behind us by now, yet one of Dominic Cummings’ fresh new hires turned out to be something of a fan. The former Downing Street adviser Andrew Sabisky, a self-proclaimed political “forecaster”, argued that forced long-term contraception might help tackle the problem of a “permanent underclass”, or as early eugenicists termed it, the “residuum”. He also suggested that black people had innately lower average IQs. Downing Street initially stood by Sabisky’s appointment, with No 10 refusing to comment on whether Boris Johnson agreed with his views. After intense media scrutiny, Sabisky announced on Twitter that he was resigning. Who could have guessed that putting out a job call for weirdos and misfits would have led to this?This brand of genetic determinism retains its allure for one reason: its political power. If it were possible to claim that entire groups of people are born stupid, lazy or in other ways inferior to other groups, governments would never need to fix their problems. Welfare or social improvements would be redundant because – let’s face it – poor families are destined to be poor, and their children are doomed at birth. Eugenics is a way of shirking responsibility for the origins of social problems, by casting blame on the disadvantaged. It suggests there is a natural order underpinning existing social hierarchies. Far better for them and the world, argues the eugenicist, that we let the poor die out. We need only look to the second world war for examples of what can happen when a group of people refuses to die fast enough: eugenicists helped them on their way.Beneath the policy proposals of leading eugenicists in the 19th and 20th centuries was a thinly veiled disgust for the poor, disabled and foreign. For more than a century the global eugenics movement has been built around the notion that those who are powerful and wealthy are there not because of privilege or good fortune, but because they are genetically better than everyone else. Eugenics was once the driving force behind the modern-day selective schooling system, which sifted children into ability buckets as early as possible in the belief they wouldn’t change. The rhetorical trick of those like Sabisky is to shift the argument away from moral defences of eugenics, which are no longer socially acceptable, and towards pseudoscientific justifications for eugenic practices. Claims that it’s possible to breed for beneficial traits in humans the same way we do with cows and dogs sound superficially plausible. But here, too, they are flawed. They ignore the physical price paid in genetic defects by these animals in meeting our demands for milk, meat and domestication. Pure-breed dogs, for example, frequently experience health issues.Even if we could breed humans for intelligence – itself unlikely given that intelligence involves many thousands of genes, social and environmental investment, and a significant dose of developmental luck – we could never be sure that a more intelligent population wouldn’t be genetically compromised in other ways. Animal breeding doesn’t create well-rounded iniduals, it creates machines – and sometimes monsters.But, of course, this is not the point. What captivates Sabisky and Cummings is the notion of a fix, the dream that nonconformist geniuses will deliver bold technologies to save us from ourselves. Blinded by this light, they ignore the suffering and misery inflicted upon countless people by eugenicists who imagined they were acting for the national good. The technological fix was always a pipe dream. If policymakers truly cared about improving the lives of the poor and minorities, they would provide everyone with a high standard of nutrition and education, and root out nepotism and inequality of opportunity. It doesn’t take a genius to figure that out.• Angela Saini is a science journalist and the author of Superior: The Return of Race Science"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e3ea00afe35d15648af6738cbe7260e8ad721d8/0_224_5264_3159/master/5264.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9127aa95289423db49582c4dd3c7c65c","title":"european green deal polish miners","story":"For all the talk of retraining Polish miners, this fund will most likely line the pockets of the carbon finance elitesWhen Josep Borrell, the EU’s newly appointed foreign policy chief, recently caused outrage by dismissing young climate activists as flaky sufferers of “Greta syndrome”, he made not just a serious error of judgment but a serious mistake in macroeconomics. It was a mistake that is symptomatic of the dire state of European economic debate after a decade of austerity and schwarze Null (balanced budget) ideas.“The idea that young people are seriously committed to fighting climate change – we could call it the ‘Greta syndrome’ – allows me to doubt that,” Borrell said, before going on to question their naivety about the cost of tackling the climate crisis.“I would like to know if young people demonstrating in Berlin … are willing to lower their living standards to offer compensation to Polish miners, because if we fight against climate change for real they will lose their jobs and will have to be subsidised.”For Borell, greening the European economy is a zero-sum game, in which paying for the move to a low-carbon economy must come out of the pockets of German taxpayers.Borrell’s views, however unpalatably delivered, are perfectly aligned with the flawed macroeconomics of the much-vaunted European Green Deal. The clue is in the name.The European Green Deal is the European commission’s proposed €1tn plan to finance the transition away from fossil fuels to decarbonising Europe’s economy. But the commission quietly dropped the word “new” from original US plans for a green new deal, which of course echo Franklin D Roosevelt’s Depression-era economic New Deal.Losing that “new” is a signal that the commission does not seek system change through ambitious green macroeconomics and tough regulation of carbon financiers. Rather, it takes a politics as usual, third-way approach that seeks to nudge the market towards decarbonisation.The macroeconomics of the European Green Deal remains trapped in the black zero logic of austerity. Instead of ambitious green fiscal activism, it mostly reshuffles existing European funds through a logic of seed funding to mobilise private sector money. Public money will be used to take risk out of private business activities and finance a “just transition” mechanism that promises to protect groups like Polish miners after their coal mines close through retraining and reskilling programmes.But there is little guarantee that European taxpayer money will reach Polish miners. It will probably go into the pockets of decarbonisation “barons”: clever local elites who will funnel transition money to their businesses, just as land barons siphoned most of the subsidies originally intended for small farmers under the common agricultural policy.Take Romania. Mining unions there complain that measures intended to “reskill’ miners, tested in the Valea Jiului region in Transylvania for the past 15 years, solely benefitted decarbonisation firms. Their connections to Romania’s political elites allowed them to capture the “market” for reskilling services, but private investment and jobs in new economic sectors never actually materialised.In dismissing green macroeconomics, the European commission puts its hopes on private finance. The logic is that the state won’t have to pay if the private sector will, provided there is nudging from public funds to “derisk” green investments. Here, the commission seems to have powerful allies, such as institutional investors with trillions ready to be greened. Larry Fink, the head of BlackRock, one of the world’s largest asset managers, recently noted that “we are on the edge of fundamentally reshaping finance” by taking decarbonisation seriously. The turn to green finance is a welcome step given that BlackRock and other global investors have so far behaved more like greenwashing carbon financiers than responsible climate investors: talking green while consistently blocking climate shareholder resolutions.But the danger is that the public money the commission plans to put into greening the European economy will instead merely subsidise greenwashing.Think of it as a two-step strategy through which carbon financiers can turn climate into a profitable business.The first step involves shaping the rules of the game, such as the “green list” of assets (or “green taxonomy”) currently being negotiated by the EU institutions. The EU taxonomy of sustainable activities has important advantages over the private environmental ratings (known as ESG ratings) currently used by private finance to identify green assets. Drawing on a broader range of views, including climate experts, the EU taxonomy sets a public standard of green that makes it more difficult for carbon financiers to purchase green ratings privately. Done properly, it could become a global standard for measuring and regulating the environmental performance of global finance.But the EU list risks being watered down in the ongoing political negotiations over the exact details of what constitutes “green” activities. Already, furious lobbying has led to the inclusion of a category of “enabling” activities under the auspices of “pathways to green”. These could easily become loopholes for activities that are more brown than green. The incentive for carbon financiers is to stick the label green everywhere they can in preparation for the second step: persuading European regulators to promote (de-risk) green assets.Meanwhile the commission refuses to talk about – let alone regulate – “brown finance”. Yet the strict regulation of brown finance could be a powerful tool for financing the European Green Deal. The commission could impose penalties on brown assets, either through taxation (a green FTT) or regulation, thus accelerating the switch to green assets.Those outraged by Borrell’s dismissive remarks about Greta Thunberg’s generation should note that the real political battle is to ensure that the European Green Deal does not morph into the first greenwashed social pact between regulators and carbon financiers, between Brussels and local elites, exporting greenwashed finance standards to the rest of the world.Climate activists should be pushing for a complete green economic agenda that recognises the critical role of green fiscal activism in organising the transition to low-carbon. It also means protecting public finances from carbon financiers, ensuring instead that private finance becomes the first lever in the climate fight.• Daniela Gabor is professor of economics and macrofinance at UWE Bristol"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d20dc7a5582fedf088db5f384a9110b469d4f9c/0_0_7072_4720/master/7072.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=ae124263651058083440a28e4d8ca0f5 1400w","title":"committees blind hiring and flexible work how to build a diverse workforce","story":"By limiting yourself in the recruitment process you may miss out on someone who’s right for the job. These simple steps will help to cultivate an inclusive organisationBut ersity isn’t limited to a candidate’s race, gender, or age – it includes their education, socioeconomic background, sexuality, religion, mental and physical health and many more facets. When we create environments that encourage different opinions and contain a multitude of backgrounds and experiences, we broaden our communities, which in turn benefits both the work and the culture of the organisation.Here’s how to get started with building an inclusive and erse business:Look outside of the obvious education channelsThis may come as a surprise, but where someone studied - for their qualifications – doesn’t necessarily correlate to their qualities as a candidate. It’s important to be intentional about recruitment, and if you are only accepting candidates who have a certain level of education, or attended a certain type of university, you may be missing out on someone just right for the job. Go further afield when you attend university job fairs and remember to think digitally. With an increasing number of courses being offered online, make sure you connect with those graduates as well. The Open University has been offering qualifications through distance learning for 50 years. It has an excellent resource – the OU’s OpportunityHub, which connects prospective employers with graduates and alumni around the country for work and internships. The OU also regularly runs OU Online TalentConnect, a digital careers fair where employers can chat and interact with its uniquely erse body of graduates and undergraduates all over the UK and internationally.“The OU provides a unique supply of candidates, as a majority study alongside full-time employment – it shows a true commitment and a willingness to go that extra mile,” says the HMRC’s Memunatu Bangura.Create a ersity, equity, and inclusion committeeHave a specific committee to oversee ersity, equity, and inclusion at your organisation, to ensure that not only the roles you are hiring, but the work that you do appeals to a broad group of people. Of course, ersity isn’t just about hiring – but it’s probably a good idea to ensure that the team responsible for hiring are erse themselves.Could the role be remote? Or part-time?For many candidates, especially those with disabilities, knowing that a job can be done remotely, or part-time, is deeply attractive. You can also sign up to be a part of the Disability Confident programme, which signals to jobseekers with disabilities that your organisation supports and encourages a talent pool that is inclusive. When pulling together your job description, think seriously about whether it would be possible to offer remote work, or a job share – many parents benefit from flexible schedules.Consider mature studentsNot everyone attends university. Many candidates from lower-income backgrounds, or BAME candidates, may not have been given the same access to opportunity as others, and many people choose to attend university later in life, if at all. Mature students are defined as being undergraduates over the age of 21, and they account for almost 300,000 people a year. According to Ucas, the majority of mature students are women who live at home, undertaking degrees in vocational subjects. These are candidates who will have learned to juggle work, or parenting, alongside their studies.“We want to work with OU students and graduates because we know they are highly motivated and talented iniduals who have the potential to make an enormous contribution to Mencap as either staff or volunteers. We work across England, Wales and Northern Ireland and we know that OU students are spread across the whole of the UK too,” says Jen Stoneman, volunteer services coordinator at Mencap.Be realistic about your goalsWhile it would be amazing to cultivate a erse work environment, it won’t happen overnight. Be patient, and set metrics of success that ensure that you are appealing to erse groups, and growing your workforce. Identify one metric to improve upon, set a deadline, and keep track of the progress.Empower your business.

It will be located in the Thames Valley Science Park, which is owned by the University of Reading.The construction of a new state-of-the-art film studio, which aims to be up and running by 2022 subject to planning consent being granted this year, comes as the UK struggles to keep up with the demand for studio space as TV companies, film studios and the streaming giants such as Netflix pour billions into making content.There has been a rush by commercial companies to build more studio space in recent years but this one is unusual in that the British government has been working with Blackhall Studios over the last year to help secure a site.“The UK and the US are each other’s largest investors and this announcement demonstrates the strength of our trading relationship,” said Liz Truss, the international trade secretary.Truss used the deal as evidence that the UK is capable of striking a wider trade agreement with the US post Brexit.“I look forward to negotiating and signing a new ambitious free trade agreement with the US, to ensure we can continue to deepen our trading relationship and grow our creative industries,” she said.Last month, the British Film Institute revealed that a record £3.6bn was spent making the likes of the next James Bond film, No Time To Die, and Sam Mendes’s 1917, and high-end TV programmes such as the BBC’s His Dark Materials and Netflix’s The Crown, in the UK.In December, the US TV giant Comcast, which owns Sky and NBCUniversal, the company behind The Fast and The Furious maker Universal Studios, announced plans to build a European production base in Elstree, north London.Last year, Netflix struck a deal to set up a permanent production base at Shepperton, home to films including Alien and Mary Poppins Returns.

They wanted to see copies of all emails where “certain women’s names are highlighted in red”.The request was likely to have been directed particularly at Annabella Sciorra, the Sopranos actor who is one of the central witnesses in the case. She is key to the most serious charge that the Pulp Fiction producer is facing – that he engaged in “predatory sexual assault” against more than one woman, which carries a potential life sentence.Over the course of the five-week trial, the court heard that Weinstein had run a “red-flag” list of women who he feared might go public with allegations of sexual misconduct against him. Emails presented to the jury showed that Sciorra appeared on the list with her name highlighted in red.Weinstein, 67, instructed an investigator who he employed to look into potential accusers: “The red flags are the first to call.”The jury has also asked to see a floor plan of Weinstein’s Soho apartment where he is alleged to have forced oral sex on another key witness, Miriam Haley. A former Project Runway production assistant, Haley has accused the disgraced film producer of luring her to the apartment in 2006 where he allegedly forced oral sex on her.The seven men and five women on the jury have a formidable decision to make in considering whether or not to find Weinstein guilty of rape and sexual assault. Their verdict, which must be unanimous, could have monumental consequences.If they find Weinstein guilty he could face a maximum sentence of life in prison.If they acquit, the failure to secure a conviction against a man who has been accused of alleged sexual misconduct by more than 100 women will send waves of shock, anger and dismay throughout the fledgling #MeToo cause that was largely triggered by revelations involving Weinstein in 2017.The jury’s inquiry about the red-highlighted names and the footprint of Weinstein’s apartment suggest they are following the judge’s instructions and beginning with the first of the five counts the defendant is facing: predatory sexual assault. For a conviction on this count, the jury would have to find Weinstein guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of sexually attacking both Haley and Sciorra.Sciorra gave harrowing testimony in which she described allegedly having her hands pinned above her head as she was held down on a bed and violently raped in her Gramercy Park apartment in the winter of 1993-94.If the jury finds Weinstein not guilty on the Sciorra part of the charge, they will then go on to consider Haley’s allegations on their own merits, and can convict Weinstein for attacking her under count two – criminal sexual act. That carries a maximum sentence of 25 years.Once Haley’s testimony is deliberated, the jury has been instructed to move on to the rape allegations raised by the second of the two main accusers in the case. This relates to a witness who the  is not naming because her wishes over identification are not known.She alleges she was raped by Weinstein in a New York hotel, for which he has been charged with rape in the first and third degrees, which carry a maximum sentence of 25 years. Once again, the jury will begin by considering the woman’s rape accusations alongside those of Sciorra. If Weinstein is found guilty of both, the jury will convict him on count three – another charge of predatory sexual assault.If Sciorra’s allegations fall, then again jurors will move on to consider the unnamed woman’s rape claims on their own merits. In counts four and five, Weinstein could be found guilty either of rape in the first or the third degree.The charge sheet makes for complicated parsing. Within an hour of being sent out of the courtroom to begin deliberations, the jury was brought back in again, having sent a series of questions to Burke seeking clarification.Before the jury was brought into court on Tuesday, a furious row erupted between the two teams of lawyers. A prosecutor accused Weinstein’s lead defense lawyer, Donna Rotunno, of jury tampering by publishing an opinion article in Newsweek over the weekend.In the article, Rotunno repeated the complaint made by the defense several times in the course of the trial: that the proceedings were rigged against the defendant. She railed at hostile media coverage, including mockery of Weinstein’s arriving in court each day leaning on a walking frame.In a highly unusual move, Rotunno went on to address inidual members of the Weinstein jury directly.“I implore the members of this jury to do what they know is right and was expected of them from the moment they were called upon to serve their civic duty in a court of law,” she wrote. “Harvey Weinstein is innocent.”Rotunno, who has made a number of extremely controversial comments in the course of the trial and has been admonished by the judge on numerous occasions not to speak to the media, insisted that her article was “not a letter to the jury, it is an op-ed of my feelings about the jury system as a whole”.The judge presiding over the trial at the New York supreme court, James Burke,﻿told Rotunno pointedly: “I would caution you about the tentacles of your public relations juggernaut.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e7904386b196de37cd9a50bb66d5064fb8f57d4/411_179_2666_1600/master/2666.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e2b5d32d52f83ff4779284546a315efd","title":"arsene wenger uses fifa role to propose new offside law marginal var calls ifab","story":"Arsène Wenger is pressing to change the offside rule in his role as Fifa’s head of global development and his proposal could be passed in time for the Euro 2020 finals.The former Arsenal manager wants a player to be onside if any part of their body that can score a goal is behind or level with the relevant defender. His move follows a series of video assistant referee (VAR) decisions in which goals have been disallowed because a player has been fractionally offside.A header by Chelsea’s Olivier Giroud against Manchester United on Monday was disallowed because part of his right boot was offside, for example, and Liverpool’s Roberto Firmino had a goal disallowed because of an armpit offside against Aston Villa.“There is room to change the rule and not say that a part of a player’s nose is offside, so you are offside because you can score with that. Instead, you will be not be offside if any part of the body that can score a goal is in line with the last defender, even if other parts of the attacker’s body are in front.“That will sort it out and you will no longer have decisions about millimetres and a fraction of the attacker being in front of the defensive line.”Wenger’s proposals will be considered by the law-making body, the International Football Association Board, on 29 February. The FAs of the four UK home nations and four Fifa representatives sit on the board and passing a motion requires a three-quarters majority. A change would come into force on 1 June, shortly before the European Championship finals which start 11 days later.The existing law says: “A player is in an offside position if: any part of the head, body or feet is in the opponents’ half (excluding the halfway line) and any part of the head, body or feet is nearer to the opponents’ goal line than both the ball and the second-last opponent.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4cf2320dddb04b42e77dcd3b889106c604509f97/1_0_3023_1814/master/3023.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=01e22a8150514c1a5011721db6c6339e","title":"jose mourinho v julian nagelsmann yesterdays man v force of the future","story":"At 32, RB Leipzig’s coach is 25 years younger than his Spurs counterpart – their Champions League meeting feels like a battle of two erasOn Wednesday night, as Tottenham take on RB Leipzig, José Mourinho might look across at the opposing bench and recognise something very familiar. In Julian Nagelsmann, the coach of RB Leipzig, he will see a driven man who desperately wanted to be a footballer whose career ended prematurely, somebody who quit a university business course to focus on sport, somebody who from a remarkably early age has been marked out as one of the brightest coaches of their generation.He will see, in other words, a version of his younger self. Tim Wiese, the wrestler and former goalkeeper, even nicknamed Nagelsmann “Mini-Mourinho” during his time as assistant coach at Hoffenheim. And perhaps in that, Mourinho will feel a pang of mortality. At 32, Nagelsmann is 25 years younger: he is the future while Mourinho is repeatedly battling suggestions he may be the past.Football at its highest level is now dominated by the German school of hard pressing and rapid transitions, of which Jürgen Klopp’s Liverpool is the supreme example. One of the pioneers of that style was Ralf Rangnick, who – after spells at Stuttgart, Schalke and Hoffenheim and two stints as Leipzig manager – is now the head of sport and development at Red Bull. In an interview with the Blizzard he identified four principles to guide how Red Bull sides should play:“One, add maximum possibility to the team and act, don’t react. So you need to dictate the game with and without the ball, not through iniduals.“Two, use numerical superiority and let the ball run directly whenever possible, with no unnecessary inidual action and with no fouls.“Three, use transitions, switch quickly. Try to win back the ball within five seconds with aggressive pressing. After winning the ball back, play quickly straight away, play direct and vertically towards the opponent’s goal, surprise the disorganised opponent to get into the penalty area and shoot within 10 seconds of winning the ball back.“At Hoffenheim, we did research and showed that the likelihood of scoring is within eight seconds of winning back the ball. In training we have a countdown clock and the target is to score within 10 seconds. Jürgen Klopp has said that the best playmaker is ‘perfect counterpressing’. So four, the more a team sprints faster to win back the ball the greater the likelihood they will score a goal once they have won it back quickly.”Before appointing Nagelsmann, who to an extent was building on the foundations he had left at Hoffenheim, Rangnick described him as “the greatest managerial talent in Germany”. Certainly he is one of the most forward-thinking, benefiting from the work done by the likes of Rangnick, Wolfgang Frank and Volker Finke to normalise pressing. That battle is won and Germany has moved from being a country that believed football was all about inidual battles to be at the forefront of developing pressing.That in itself would distance Nagelsmann from Mourinho who, despite being formed as a coach amid the post-Cruyffian pressing game of late 90s Barcelona, seemed to decide around the time he was overlooked for the Barça job in 2008 that his future would be a low block and reactivity – as though to emphasise his difference from the club that, as he saw it, had rejected him. But it is more than that. Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen https:audio.guim20200217-58536-gnl.fw.20200217.jf.jarsofurine.mp3 In his first two European campaigns Nagelsmann’s Hoffenheim looked a little naive, winning just one of 14 games. He has admitted he made too many changes between Bundesliga and Europe, leading to confusion, and also that he had been too offensive. As he looks to balance his thinking, Nagelsmann has acknowledged the importance of Klopp at Liverpool as a model, explaining how he wants his side also to become less reliant on counterattacking and to learn how to control games.But that’s just the broadbrush strategy. There are also precise adjustments for inidual games which, as the winger Ademola Lookman, who joined Leipzig from Everton on a permanent basis last summer, has said, means that a lot of playing for Nagelsmann involves memory. Everything is done with a specific purpose in mind.“He always has a thought about everything,” the winger Emil Forsberg explained. “What you have to do with the ball, if I take the ball here what can I do then, and how you have to move when he has the ball – you just have to do it. It will appear and you’ll kind of get a light bulb in your head like: ‘Ah OK, so if I do that and that, that will open up and I can play that pass or I can play that pass.’ That’s what I like about the drills, that you always have something behind it.”While the holistic approach sounds a lot like Mourinho’s theories of periodisation, the big difference is that Mourinho, believing football to be essentially random, considers programmed moves too unreliable to be worthwhile and prefers to try to generate in his players a mindset that ensures they make the “right” – as he would see it – decision in any given circumstance.And that, as much as his insistence on the low block, is what separates Mourinho from those who have come after. The old tricks performed well can still prevail, and nobody, least of all Nagelsmann, would pretend he is the finished product. But this seems like a battle of two eras, one thrusting and innovative, the other familiar and possibly moribund."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/abe14e0ce3b3af478a0adf6d4b92c360ca078da2/0_102_5697_3419/master/5697.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4bfcd76551d935d7644f7cd61e80564e","title":"knowledge clubs home games rival ground","story":"Plus: Oscar-voters in the boardroom, multi-stadium day trips and the team shipwrecked on their way to a game“New York City FC will host a match in the Concacaf Champions League at Red Bull Arena, the home ground of the New York Red Bulls,” writes Rashaad Jorden. “Excluding groundshares, have there been scenarios in which a club has to play home matches at the ground of an arch-rival?”There sure have, Rashaad. Jo Bannon takes us back a century or so: “As league games were postponed during the first world war, Tottenham played some home games at Highbury from 1916-19. White Hart Lane was requisitioned by the War Office to be used for munitions work – so it could be said Spurs were at Arsenal because an arsenal was at Spurs.”“Manchester United relocated to Maine Road due to the second world war,” writes Mukhtar Khan. “A match played there between United and Arsenal in 1948 attracted a crowd of 83,260.” Stuart Bateman expands: “In 1956, Old Trafford had no floodlights, so European fixtures against Anderlecht and Athletic Bilbao were moved to Maine Road.” And then, of course, there was their spell at Anfield.“Dundee made the shortest journey in world football, from Dens Park to Tannadice – home of Dundee United – in April 1999 to draw 1-1 with Rangers,” notes Stuart McLagan. “Dens was being renovated at the time.” More Scottish japes from Dougie Ford: “In 1971-72 Celtic were drawn against Rangers in the League Cup. Celtic Park was being redeveloped, so Celtic’s home game against Rangers was played at IbroxThey won at Ibrox three times in four weeks.”Michael Haughey moves us along. “In summer 2000, Aston Villa entered the Intertoto Cup just as they were demolishing the Trinity Road stand at Villa Park,” he writes. “The two home games, against Marila Pribram and Celta Vigo, were switched to the Hawthorns. In the 1985 FA Cup, Burton Albion played ‘at’ Leicester City in a tie switched to Derby’s Baseball Ground. After Burton’s goalie was knocked unconscious in a 6-1 Foxes win, the FA ordered the game to be replayed behind closed doors – at Coventry’s Highfield Road.”Paul Nash chips in: “Bristol Rovers played a very unhappy stretch of home games at City’s Ashton Gate in 1980 following a fire at Eastville Stadium. They also played a home game v Swindon (another local rival) at the Gate in their first season as tenants at Twerton Park.”From Bath to the Basque country: “Athletic Bilbao played a home game at Real Sociedad a few years back when the new San Mamés wasn’t quite ready,” writes Jack Tanner. Over to Denmark, and Emil Reventlow: “Brøndby have played several European matches – including against Liverpool and Manchester United – at Parken, the ground of arch-rivals FC Copenhagen.”And Sean DeLoughry brings the subject to a close: “This happens all the time in smaller leagues, especially for continental competitions. In Ireland, Dundalk recently hosted European games at bitter rivals Shamrock Rovers (Tallaght Stadium), local rivals Drogheda (United Park) as well as Bohemians (Dalymount) and Shelbourne (Tolka Park).” Dara O’Reilly steps up quickly before the music plays him off: “The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences does not disclose its membership, and in theory it is open to everyone who has a film credit, provided they can be sponsored by two academy members,” he writes. “However, automatic membership is conferred on every person nominated for an Academy Award, and they are entitled to vote for those categories for which they have been nominated as well as for best film. Everton chairman Bill Kenwright produced My Pure Land, a female-centric Pakistani western which was nominated for best foreign picture in the 2017 Oscars, so he is automatically an academy member. Similarly, Watford life-president and former chairman Elton John has been nominated four times, winning twice (including this year) for best original song.”“My brother spent last Tuesday morning at the Manor, once Oxford United’s ground and now a hospital, and the evening at the Kassam watching United v Newcastle,” tweets Dale Morgan. “What’s the best way to spend a day at multiple grounds of a single team?”Alun Thomas sketches an itinerary: “On a bank holiday, with a favourable fixture list and open roads, it should be possible to cover four Brighton \u0026amp Hove Albion grounds,” he begins. “An 11am kick-off for AFC Varndeanians at the Withdean Stadium, a 3pm kick-off for Gillingham at the Priestfield Stadium, and an 8pm kick-off for Brighton at the Amex. You’ll probably want to eat something afterwards – so where better that the retail park on the site of the old Goldstone Ground.”Further afield? “You could have a fine day sampling Bayern’s grounds,” offers Sean DeLoughry. “Start with a stroll round the Theresienwiese park, where they started life. Then on to the still-operational Grünwalder Stadion, to take in a Bayern reserve or youth-team game. The Olympiastadion, which hosted the 1974 World Cup final, is still open – you could take a tour – then on to the Allianz Arena for a match.”“Is it true that Falkirk (or another Scottish side) were once shipwrecked on the way to a game?” wondered Dan Palmer in 2012.The side who took a dip in the briny deep came from further down the Firth of Forth. Kirkcaldy’s Raith Rovers were taking in the sunnier climbs of the Canary Islands in the summer of 1923 they boarded the Highland Loch, which was calling in at the Canaries en route to Buenos Aires with its cargo of passengers and, apparently, chilled meat.The Stark’s Park party were off the coast of Galicia, negotiating Cape Finisterre, in violent weather when the ship ran aground. The players and other passengers were roused from their beds, lifeboats were manned and the group was towed to Villagarcia by local fishermen.The following day a passing liner picked up the 20-strong squad and were, according to player Tom Jennings, invited to eat at the captain’s table because of their chivalrous behaviour during the rain-swept abandoning of the Highland Loch. A few days later they were safely deposited at their destination – and the traumatic journey did not seem to adversely effect the players. They won all four games, although history does not report another European adventure in 1924.“What is the biggest lead that’s been blown at the top of the table?” wonders Chris Grant. “I offer the case of Romford in the Southern League, 1963-64. In a 42-match season, they were unbeaten after 24 games, (18 wins, six draws), and 12 points clear (only two points for a win). Their last 18 games produced only eight points, and a final finish of fifth.”“Footballers in dressing-room communal baths celebrating FA Cup wins used to be a sports pages staple,” reminisces Roger Kirkby. “When was the last such photo taken?”“Has any player played for more teams beginning with the same letter than Jan Hochscheidt (Energie Cottbus II, Erzgebirge Aue, Eintracht Braunschweig and Eintracht Braunschweig II),” asks Stephen Bond.Email your questions and answers to knowledge@the or tweet @TheKnowledge_GU."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8b0b9650e8009019b41c586a37053b8adbb29406/0_158_1535_921/master/1535.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a00df376fdeb15b9a7bbf64bc4b26702","title":"liverpools jurgen klopp says atletico madrid tried to get sadio mane sent off","story":"Jürgen Klopp admitted he substituted Sadio Mané during Liverpool’s Champions League defeat at Atlético Madrid for fear the Senegal forward would be sent off after being targeted by Diego Simeone’s players.The influential Mané was withdrawn at half-time during the 1-0 defeat having received a booking late in the first half for catching Sime Vrsaljko with a flailing but accidental arm.Several Atlético players surrounded the referee asking for a second yellow card when Mané was caught up in an innocuous incident moments later, and Klopp confirmed the striker was replaced by Divock Origi as a precaution. Mané’s speed and penetration were sorely missed as Liverpool failed to register a shot on target at Estadio politano.“It is obviously a part of football that I don’t like,” said Klopp. “The plan tonight was to get Sadio out of the game with a second yellow card. I was afraid that Sadio’s opponent would go down if he took a deep breath on him or something. I don’t want to have this situation and that is why I took him off.”Jordan Henderson was replaced with a hamstring injury and will be assessed on his return to Merseyside.Saúl Ñíguez’s early goal gave Atlético a win that was wildly celebrated by their players and fans, and Klopp believes the intensity of the home crowd will be matched by what awaits at Anfield in the home leg on 11 March.The Liverpool manager added: “Yes, there were things we could have done better and things that could have made our life easier. Atlético very obviously were here to squeeze a result out of this game and against that our pressing was exceptional, our buildup was outstanding, our counter-press was exceptional.“The intensity was exactly how it should be. We had not enough clear-cut chances, that is how it is. We had chances but not enough. We had games in atmospheres like this where we lost focus a little bit and they could score a second one. It didn’t really look like that tonight. I say to all the Atlético fans who are lucky enough to get a ticket for the second leg: welcome to Anfield.”Andy Robertson insisted Atlético were wrongly awarded a throw-in in the buildup to the winning goal. The Liverpool defender said: “The officials made a mistake and the corner is just a ricochet. We gave them the best possible start to get their fans up and then they started falling over and trying to get under our skin but we handled it well.“They were falling over easy but we got on with it and we are better than that. It was a decent performance but we have a second leg to put it right. They celebrated as if they had won the tie. But let’s see. We have some weeks then they come to Anfield. We know our fans will be there so it is up to them to come as well.”Simeone, the Atlético coach, said his players were roused by the impassioned reception they received from their fans on arrival at the stadium.“I think we started winning the game when our bus turned at the roundabout and we saw the reaction of the people. It enthused us. Something beautiful woke up in us,” he said.“The feeling that came out of the people, the reply of the people, I’ve rarely seen from our fans at this level. They were there the whole game. It made me want to put my boots on and go on the pitch.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c723fd45f69662f8b889456fb707192fb94d62c/0_310_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=894e76b527b4785e48ebff2e15ac2aad","title":"coal workers are orphans the children and slaves mining pakistans coal","story":"Injuries and fatalities are common among thousands of debt-bonded men and children toiling in one of the world’s harshest work environmentsAll photographs by Mashal Balochby  Shah Meer Baloch and  Hannah Ellis-PetersenThe spectre of death hovers over the coal mines of Balochistan. Under scorching skies, this turbulent south-west region of Pakistan is home to one of the world’s harshest work environments, where tens of thousands of men and children descend below the surface each day to dig up thousands of tonnes of coal.The threats of underground explosions, methane gas poisoning, suffocation, or mine walls collapsing are omnipresent and there is barely a single worker across the state’s five massive commercial coal mines who has not been touched by the fatalities that are common here.“Twenty people that I know of have died underground,” says Luqman Shakir, a 24-year-old from Swat, in Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. Nine years ago, aged 15, Shakir travelled to Balochistan looking for work he has been a miner ever since. “People often die because of a mine collapse and it takes us 18, sometimes 24, hours to take them out because there is no machinery to remove the collapse we are on our own.”Wiping his dust-blackened face, Shakir sighs. “When we pull them out, often their bodies are so mangled they cannot even be recognised. Every time I go down the mine, in the back of my mind I always know there is a possibility that I might not come back up.”Shakir hasn’t seen a sunset for almost a decade. He goes underground before dawn and emerges after dark six days a week, and sleeps for most of his single day off. “Summers are suffocating,” he says, explaining that his impoverished background and lack of education make the mines his only option for work.“This is my life now.”Coal was first extracted in the mineral-rich Balochistan in the 1850s by the British, who built the railway line still used today to transport the coal through the treacherous mountains of the Bolan Pass.It has grown into a massive modern industry. With five major coalfields – Mach, Shahrag, Dukki, Chamalang and Quetta – Balochistan still has approximately 2.2bn tonnes of coal reserves. As a result, the mining operation across the state is huge at least 15,000 tonnes of coal are produced daily, selling for an of average 14,000 PKR (£70) per tonne. It is big business for the country’s coffers, too. The provincial government takes a cut of 130 PKR (£0.65) per tonne and the federal government 500 PKR (£2.50).An operation on this scale requires a massive workforce at the Mach coal mines alone it is estimated that there are between 10,000 and 20,000 workers. Child labour is rife: at all the coal mines visited by the  in January, child labourers were seen working above ground sorting coal, collecting iron and picking up pieces of coal spilled across the fields.“Coal workers in Balochistan are orphans,” says Asif Qambrani, a research scholar whose work focuses on the mining industry in the region.At the mine in Shahrag, sitting on the floor working to remove impurities from freshly mined coal, are Noor Mohammed Marri, 15, and nine-year-old Gul Zaman Marri, who earn between 300 and 400 PKR (£1.50-£2) a day.“My father had died due to an accident so I am an orphan and I have no one except a few family elders and one of them is working here,” says Noor. “We come here to do some work under his supervision. We can’t survive if we don’t work.”There have been multiple recent reports of child sexual abuse at the mines in Shahrag, and while Noor is adamant he has not been harassed, he says he fears for other young orphans who have no family working in the mines to look out for them.The story of the coal miners of Balochistan is one of debt bondage and human rights abuses, an absence of basic health and safety measures, and brutal working and living conditions. Many of the conditions of modern slavery are evident across these mines, which have not modernised in decades. Adult miners earn around £5 a day. Pakistan’s first Mines Act was passed in 1923 to enshrine workers’ rights. It stipulates that canteens, shelters, medical equipment and first aid rooms should be provided at every mine where more than 100 people are employed. Yet there was no obvious sign of these facilities when the  visited the Mach and Shahrag mines. At Mach, the workers’ quarters were a mud building in which more than 10 people shared each tiny room. There was no electricity, running water or a proper bathroom, and drinking water was not provided.The issues are compounded by the fact that that many of the workers have either migrated from Swat or neighbouring Afghanistan, and are not legally registered, meaning their very existence – and therefore their rights – can be easily dismissed. According to the Mines Act, all workers should be registered with firms and leaseholders. But there is little pressure from the authorities to enforce this.“The problem in Balochistan is that most coal mine owners and leaseholders are either influential people in Karachi and Lahore who took ownership in the 1950s and 1960s and have never even visited the mines themselves to see the conditions, or they are politicians, feudal or tribal chiefs who are in provincial and central government,” says Qambrani. “These owners never enforce registration of mine workers because then they have to provide all basic facilities, which would decrease their profits.”There is also little will or incentive for the state government to enforce the act’s provisions or subsequent iterations of the law intended to regulate the industry. Many key provincial assembly members are either owners of mines or have major stakes in Balochistan’s mining industry, including Jam Kamal Khan, who is both the state’s chief minister and minister for mining and minerals. Khan declined to comment when approached by the .According to the Pakistan Central Mines Labour Federation, between 100 and 200 labourers die on average in coal mine accidents every year, but many incidents go unreported. In January a Mach miner was trapped for over 48 hours and had to be dug out by fellow workers after the government failed to help with the rescue operation. In February, four miners died in a landslide at Duki. According to figures taken from records and news reports, from 2010 to May 2019 at least 414 miners were killed, though the real total is thought to be much higher.The unforgiving conditions take a heavy toll on the body. Many workers spoke of the constant threat of coal workers’ pneumoconiosis, commonly known as black lung disease, an incurable but preventable illness caused by inhaling coal mine dust. Bakth Nazar, a 55-year-old coal manager at a mine in Mach, says he has worked in the coalfields for about 30 years. In that time he has lost three family members in coal mines – including his son – due to the unsafe conditions.“We work with no facilities, no training and no safety measures,” says Nazar. “But the dilemma for us is that we don’t get paid when we don’t work. The company doesn’t care about our health.”“The government did not pay a penny for my brother Azam Khan and cousin who got trapped in coal mines and died last year,” says Nazar.Speaking on condition of anonymity, one mine inspector candidly depicts the horrors he has seen workers endure. Necessary breathing equipment is deemed “too expensive” and therefore not provided, he says. He also describes how a lack of training for workers can have dire consequences.He recounts one incident at a mine in Dagari in August 2019, where a cable caught fire underground and ignited gas within the mine, causing workers to fall unconscious and become trapped. Due to a lack of training for such scenarios, other workers and management turned on the fans, which only served to fuel the fire. In that incident two people died and eight suffered life-changing burns.“There are no emergency ambulances in the majority of coalfields and their surrounding areas. There is a lack of basic health units and hospitals. And even if by luck there is a hospital, you won’t find a doctor or equipment there. There is nothing inspectors can do,” he says.Khaliqdad Bugti, in charge of a mine in Shahrag, describes how during rainy season the roads often become blocked, leaving workers stranded without food for days and with only their mud huts to shelter in.Debt bondage is also a huge issue. Mohammed Ibrahim, a frail 40-year-old with one hand, explains that this is the situation in which he has found himself. Hundreds of miles away from his home and seven children in Afghanistan, Ibrahim works as a haulage driver to pay off the 50,000 PKR (£250) he borrowed from the manager of the coal mine to get this job in the first place.“I chose this work because I couldn’t find any other work,” says Ibrahim, “It is very difficult but I have no other way of paying off the debt. I have to work here until I pay the debt.”As well as being a mine manager, Ali works as a jori-sir, whose task is to find and provide mine workers for the contractor – mainly from poverty-stricken villages. He earns at least 10 PKR for each labourer he provides.“I find labourers and jobless people and provide them advance money if they need it, and in return bring them to work here in coal mines,” says Ali. “They will keep working until they pay the debts. I know who owes money and they are not allowed to leave. This business is being run on debt between labourers to petty managers. Labourers owe me money and I owe money to the contractor. In short, we both can’t leave until we pay our money.”The fatalities keep coming. When the  visited the Shahrag mine in January, an incident had occurred just 10 days earlier. Two workers, Faiz Mohammed and Samiullah, who had travelled from Afghanistan in desperate search of work and ended up in the mines, died after a mining trolley broke, throwing their bodies 1,000ft into the pit. Ghulam Raza, another worker at Mach who is originally from Ghazni in Afghanistan, describes the daily fear that has haunted him since he witnessed a portion of a mine wall collapse, killing a co-worker. The death was never investigated. “I got really scared,” says Raza. “When the incident happened, no one came from the government, not even an ambulance. The Frontier Corps just came to inquire about what happened and then told us to take the body to the bazar.”“Due to my debt, I cannot go back to my wife and son,” says Raza. “But if I had a choice, I wouldn’t stay an hour longer here.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3fb578bfee28eff817debeddee4ed66bce4a45c0/0_0_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0e32e1ae9cb0a9ba79a464bc496a9bfc","title":"coming out as dalit how one indian author finally embraced her identity","story":"Raised to hide her low caste, Yashica Dutt’s new book traces her realisation that her history is one of oppression, not shamePretending not to be a Dalit took a heavy toll on the young Yashica Dutt.Her mother, Shashi, was so determined to protect her three children from the discrimination of the Hindu caste system that relegates Dalits to the periphery of society that she pretended the family were Brahmin.Shashi worked hard to find the money throw birthday parties, have curtains on the windows, and to follow traditional rituals correctly. But for the children it meant that one wrong word or gesture while playing with friends or buying sweets from a shopkeeper could expose the lie.It was only after she had grown up, that Dutt, a writer and journalist, began to understand the trauma of her childhood. When she began therapy in New Delhi six years ago, she simply asked her analyst: “Help me to live.”“I was always second-guessing myself, wondering if I had said the right thing, asking myself ‘would upper caste people with happier childhoods have said it better or done it differently?’ I had so much doubt from feeling like an imposter,” she says.Dutt recounts the story in her book, Coming Out as Dalit. It tells of her mother’s ambition to overcome poverty and give her children an education, without support and with an alcoholic husband. Dutt went to boarding school and then studied at St Stephen’s, perhaps the most prestigious university in India. She worked as a journalist in New Delhi and pursued a master’s at Columbia University in New York, where she now lives and works for an advertising agency.In the US Dutt, 34, discovered a parallel with her own experience. She heard some lighter-skinned African Americans talk of how they used to “pass” as white, assuming certain habits, tastes, language and mannerisms, just as her mother had mimicked those of upper caste Hindus.As part of her book tour, Dutt was back in India appearing at the Jaipur Literature Festival last month when the  met her in a New Delhi cafe, she cut a striking figure with her wavy hair, black leather jacket and hands flashing with chunky rings.Guilt entered her soul early and settled into sediment, she says. First it was guilt at her mother educating her when she could not afford it. Then it was guilt at having survived and enjoyed opportunities for education that so many in her community had never had and never would.Her parents, though poor, were educated and lived in a city (Ajmer in Rajasthan) rather than a village and that allowed the family to conceal its caste in a way that is impossible for the majority of India’s approximately 200 million Dalits who live in rural areas.Conversely, Dutt is concerned about the absence of guilt among upper caste Indians. While some white people joined the civil rights moment in the US or the anti-apartheid movement in South Africa, the upper castes are nowhere to be seen in the Dalit struggle against discrimination, she says.“On the contrary,” she says, “there isn’t even the same kind of open discourse here of the kind you have in the US about racism, white supremacy, which is all mainstream. Instead of acknowledging discrimination, upper caste Indians, instead of taking responsibility, have deluded themselves into thinking they are already living in a ‘post-caste’ society.”She marks parallels with America in the wilful “innocence” that James Baldwin wrote of in that white Americans failed to understand what they had done to African Americans and that the race “problem” was “their” problem.At Columbia, she was astounded to find black, Hiic and gay classmates openly sharing their stories of discrimination without feeling any need to hide. Their accounts did not lead to the kind of social isolation she used to fear, but rather elicited sympathy from fellow students.Even Dutt’s moments of triumph as a young girl, she says, were accompanied by self-flagellation. After much imploring by Shashi, she was finally accepted by Mussoorie Public School where her mother hoped she would pick up all the remaining social markers of upper caste culture from the other girls that she would need throughout her life to blend in.Dutt came top of her class. “I felt nothing. To my mind, if someone like me could score so well, then this school couldn’t be all that great,” she says.Caste haunted Dutt, who choose to work as a fashion journalist in India, eschewing politics for fear that in writing a story or expressing an opinion she might reveal her caste. The fear of being “outed” was a permanent cloud. “If people knew, would they even sit next to me?”It was not until 2016, in New York, that Dutt felt able to “come out”. That year, suicide of a Dalit student, Rohith Vemula, at Hyderabad University, was a huge story in India. His last letter began: “My birth is my fatal accident.”“Unlike me, Rohith did nothing to bury his Dalitness. Instead, he used it to … stand up for Dalit students at Hyderabad University,” she writes in her book. His pride and courage despite enjoying none of her advantages prompted Dutt to write a Facebook post announcing her real caste. Vemula’s death, she wrote, “made me realise that my history is one of oppression, not shame”.The reaction from colleagues, friends, and acquaintances ranged from shock and dismay to support and praise. “Oh, you don’t look like a Dalit,” was one particularly inane remark.Dutt’s book is part of a wave of Dalit literature, art, music and experiences finally coming to the fore in India. Dalit film directors are making films on caste. Dalit Twitter is a vibrant platform. Social media generally has become a powerful forum for sharing experiences and presenting a counter perspective to social phenomena. Dutt feels she is now a “whole person”, at home in her own skin. “I have nothing to hide,” she says.Whether her mother was right in her decision to conceal her children’s caste is a question that Dutt says she still does not have sufficient objective distance from.“Right now, I believe it was the right choice. She was trying to protect us and give us a good education,” she says, adding, “in any case, parents always fuck up their children in one way or another, don’t they?”Coming Out as Dalit is published by Aleph Book Company"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6ea155e2d1a24b76b9d5655f1da5a0698601a12/0_369_6019_3612/master/6019.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1ac62232ce1ec34c13c7e3550c602ffa","title":"why cry what can we learn from tears","story":"Weeping is informed by everything from culture and identity to social standing – and studying it could help us better understand ourselvesIt is common for people to scoff at tears as a behaviour and a subject of investigation. Tears are, they say, feminine, self-indulgent and melodramatic. It is not hard to notice, in those beliefs, the patriarchal assumptions about what should be valued and what should be mocked. Writing teachers will instruct students not to show their characters’ sadness through crying, calling it cheap. On the other hand, there are those who proclaim the necessity of “a good cry”, who indignantly defend weeping of all varieties and who see tearfulness almost as an identity. “I’m a crier,” they declare, praising its soul-cleansing effects. “Get over it,” their opponents instruct, demanding the shift toward progress and action that they believe crying prevents.But rather than looking at tears with a predetermined belief in their value, or away from them in embarrassment or disgust, it can be clarifying to look through, into or around tears, to trace the small and large patterns that they create and reveal.Not all tears are alike. The human body produces three kinds: basal, which form an oily layer over the eyeball to keep it from drying out reflex, which appear when an eye is bothered by cutting onions or a speck of dust and needs to flush the irritant away and psychogenic, which are shed for emotional reasons. Notably, emotional tears have a higher protein level than basal and reflex tears, which makes them thicker and causes them to fall more slowly.This thickness intrigues me. The longer it takes for these tears to travel down a cheek, the greater the chance that they will be noticed by another person and their message perceived. Tears are a social signal.Some people disagree, arguing that humans also cry alone. But even without a witness, tears streak outwards, seeking care. That message can be socially directed toward the self sometimes a solitary crier will wrap their arms around themselves, creating their own soothing embrace. One might, in those moments, think of the poet Arthur Rimbaud’s declaration: “I is an other.” Sometimes, a person is the sender and the recipient of the crying signal.What the social signal of tears makes happen varies from culture to culture and depends on the identities, access to power and beliefs of the crier and their witnesses. Think of the “school resource officer” who was called to the classroom of a crying seven-year-old African American boy and put the child in handcuffs. Think of the white police officer who cried in court when she spoke of killing an African American man in his home, and the hug she later received from the African American judge.Tears often serve as a lubricant in the wheels of white supremacy. Many people (including Brittney Cooper and Ruby Hamad) have written about the harm of white women’s tears – how they have contributed to a long history of violence towards black people, indigenous people and people of colour.Doctors have their own precise frames in which to interpret people’s tears. They can hang little paper tabs from a patient’s eyes to measure tear production, the slim rectangles slowly changing colour as the body does its work. When a psychiatrist is working to diagnose depression, she will ask a patient to describe his or her crying, offering a range of possibilities from: “I do not cry any more than I used to,” to: “I cry over every little thing,” before ending in numb dryness: “I feel like crying, but I can’t.” I am reminded of hypothermia, the growing, shivering pain that transforms just before death into a surprising warmth.My depression has yet to reach that dry state. Instead, when an episode is at its worst, I can find myself shaking with cries for an hour after something as simple as dropping a knife to the floor. I am learning to say these things with what I hope is neither pride nor shame. But tears have a habit of magnifying and distorting. Their very nature – their emotional origins – makes it difficult to express these feelings plainly.That is why I try, as much as possible, to say what tears do. Tears can form an intimate bond between people. They can also create a disgusted separation. Their effect depends largely on the degree to which people share common stories about who they are and how the world works.I once read the claim that people sometimes cry from aesthetic experience, “such as the birth of a child or the unveiling of the latest Lamborghini”. Both examples bewilder me. I have gone through birth twice (once as child, once as mother) and I can’t figure out how it falls under the category of “aesthetic experience”. I should admit I have never seen a Lamborghini – newly unveiled or otherwise – but when I imagine one, I feel no inclination to cry. It is hard for me to imagine any possibility of connection with someone whose ideas of aesthetic tears differ so hugely from mine. Honestly, it is hard for me to imagine his tears at all. I have a feeling they are actually tiny Lamborghinis running down his face.The tears that seem most full of potential are those that surprise by breaking out of expected and systemic patterns, revealing the small and strange undercurrents in which people daily resist larger tides. This kind of crying neither confirms what I already find emotionally compelling nor leaves me rolling my eyes. Instead, it points toward new possibilities for understanding, new combinations of ideas. When my child was a toddler, she cried one day because the lemon she wanted to eat would not remain whole. Why did this move me so? I think because, looking through the lens of her tears, the lemon became more real to me than it had been since my own toddlerhood. It was not a commodity, not a metaphor from which to extract a lesson about sweetness. It was utterly itself, brightly containing its wholeness and its destruction. An impossible lemon – of course she was crying.Perhaps you have noticed that it is almost impossible to sing and cry at the same time. The throat muscles cannot simultaneously obey the command to shape notes and the command to hold themselves open to maximise oxygen intake (a command that crying provokes unconsciously). This leads me to believe that the opposite of crying is not laughter (those two, I would argue, are sisters), but song. As a poet and as a human living on a planet careering ever more deeply and unevenly into capitalism-induced horrors, I want to attend to both: the moments of singing the moments when a voice breaks.I have been thinking about breaking points a lot lately, in part because of a conversation with the Iranian-American poet Kaveh Akbar about the limits of the English language and all the violence that has occurred in its tongue. Recently, he sent me a lecture he had just given on this subject, delivered as the US again threatened Iran with war. He wrote that English is “a technology that has been used to promote and protect genocides, chattel slavery, ecological decimation, the building and deployment of nuclear weapons and more. That’s our paint.”Crying occurs when people have reached the limit of what can be said in words and what they are capable of managing on their own. This does not mean that their words up to that moment are necessarily good or true or to be trusted, but it does signify that a breaking point has been reached. It means that it is time to pay attention to the systems the tears point towards.The subject rewards that attention. Years into my research, I still found myself learning surprising new ways of understanding crying, physically and metaphorically. For instance, it turns out that the lump in your throat when tears are imminent is not a lump at all. Obeying the imperative to keep breathing through distress, the muscles of the throat work to stay open. When you try to swallow, the muscles resist, creating the sensation of an obstruction. Some people find relief in this fact – that their throat won’t close up, that their body is taking care of them and bringing them much-needed air. What if we could look at crying in the same way – not as a stopping point, but a passageway? What if we could look through crying to understand the abundance of patterns – of joy, oppression, grief, beauty, violence and transformative potential – that tears have the power to reveal?The Crying Book by Heather Christle is published by Corsair.

As we approached Brussels, there was an onboard announcement that the connecting Deutsche Bahn train to Cologne was delayed by an hour and would no longer be stopping at Brussels Midi.Affected passengers were instructed to travel from Midi to Brussels Nord to catch the train. We did so, only to find the Cologne train had not been delayed by an hour and had already left.We headed back to Brussels Midi but there was no connection to Cologne. We returned to the Eurostar terminal where there were about 70 fellow travellers who had also missed their connection.Staff assured me that Eurostar would arrange a hotel for us at its expense. Ten minutes later, we were told management had decreed that they were not liable for the missed connection, and that it was up to us to sort out accommodation and forward travel plans.Security staff were forcibly stopping Eurostar customers filming when we demanded the manager explain in person, and insisted they delete any footage.Our request for the manager’s name was refused. The manager then appeared with three armed security staff. The atmosphere was now threatening and my partner and I left to find a hotel.Eurostar has since accepted no responsibility for its misleading announcement. It has apologised for the behaviour of staff in Brussels but states that it’s an internal matter and will be dealt with by them, and that’s the end of it. LN, WorcesterEurostar told me, with smooth understatement, that it was sorry that the journey was “not as easy as expected” but that the fault lay with Deutsche Bahn.“Unfortunately, in this instance, the information was changed after we received it, and we apologise for the confusion this led to,” it says. “The passengers’ Eurostar ticket was for London to Brussels and the onward journey to Cologne was a separate booking with Deutsche Bahn. We were therefore not able to support delays from Brussels, where their journey with us had finished.”It says comments about Brussels staff had been “dealt with” and that a decision was made to close the terminal because “the behaviour of some of the passengers was felt to be aggressive towards staff”.Over to Deutsche Bahn, which confirmed that the service had been delayed due to a passenger accident, but not by as much as an hour. Too much time has elapsed for it to confirm what information was supplied, but the German operator has offered to refund the Brussels to Cologne fare, albeit only in travel vouchers.If you need help email Anna Tims at your.problems@observer or write to Your Problems, The Observer, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.

The kind of unscripted events that made last year’s Mercury prize ceremony genuinely interesting for the first time in years – Slowthai brandishing an effigy of Boris Johnson’s severed head one of Black Midi running full pelt into a grand piano with a sickening thud, then attempting to style it out while visibly in great discomfort – were noticeable by their absence.There were extravagant set-pieces from Stormzy and Lizzo, and the sight of Billie Eilish enjoying yet another co-sign from an artist of a more mature vintage, this time Johnny Marr, playing guitar on her Bond theme No Time to Die. But it was left to rapper Dave and Tyler, the Creator to provide the solitary edgy moments of the evening. The latter mentioned Theresa May’s successful attempt to have him banned from the country while she was home secretary – “I bet she’s pissed,” he noted – while Dave extemporised an extra verse during the evening’s standout performance, a version of his single Black, short on bells and whistles but big on emotional clout, during which he bluntly called the prime minister a racist.Otherwise, shocks of any kind were thin on the ground: you could, if you were absolutely desperate, make a song-and-dance about the fact that Foals won best group rather than the more commercially successful Bastille or Coldplay, but it’s hardly an unknown artist suddenly escaping the margins to snatch victory from beneath the noses of the bookies’ favourites. Elsewhere, there was never really any doubt that Mabel was going to win female solo artist – Charli XCX and FKA twigs may boast more critical acclaim, but neither of them had a hit as big as Don’t Call Me Up, which spent over six months in the charts – while Lewis Capaldi, or The Remarkable Talent That Is Lewis Capaldi, as Jack Whitehall insisted on calling him, was a shoo-in for new artist and song from the start: you don’t make the UK’s biggest-selling single and album of the year and go home empty-handed from the Brits.In truth, the closest the actual awards came to a genuine surprise was that The Remarkable Talent That Is Lewis Capaldi didn’t win more awards. Essentially predicated on rewarding commercial success, you might have expected the Brits to give him everything, up to and including the on stage autocue, but Dave’s Psychodrama added to its Mercury win by clinching album of the year, a rare moment when you got the feeling the voting academy might have been listening to the music rather than concentrating on the sales figures.For all that, there were times when the Brits made you feel good about the current state of pop music albeit simply by holding up a mirror to the charts. Psychodrama is a great album – powerful, thoughtful, moving, intense – that went to No 1 and spawned three Top 10 singles. International female solo artist winner Billie Eilish’s ascendency to imperious teen superstardom has been achieved by making genuinely great music that sounds like the expression of a uniquely skewed personality rather than a craven attempt to make something that the maximum number of people will like. Tyler’s album Igor offered a perfect example of how its author has managed to outrun his initial notoriety, ditching the obnoxious shock value without compromising a desire to experiment.As for the ongoing situation regarding female representation, it’s perhaps instructive to look back at the 2016 Brits, where the nominations for female solo artist included Amy Winehouse, who’d died five years previously, the implication being that there were so few female artists worthy of consideration that the awards had to scour the hereafter to make up the numbers. In that respect, too, this year’s awards were business as usual."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de59ce3ce85880754de01de579900e72b9aa3891/0_59_5109_3066/master/5109.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1f6109a90ef6de1b15ec3c184d34fe2d","title":"brits 2020 the best of the red carpet and ceremony in pictures","story":"The highlights from the 40th Brit Awards"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/97531905b8d0fb26c40ad8e403eabbde159b07c5/0_74_2873_1723/master/2873.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c6a08cf110bdea0eb0bf3efffe699e55","title":"can the fashion industry ever be sustainable","story":"Environmental journalist Lucy Siegle has been writing about the fashion industry for 15 years.

Downing Street has so far declined to give even basic details of Sabisky’s work, or how he was recruited. Officials also refused to comment on the status of two other so-called “super-forecasters” pictured with him outside No 10 in January.The photo was tweeted by Michael Story, co-founder of a forecasting startup called Maby, who has now made his Twitter account private. It showed Story and Sabisky with the other founder of Maby, Thomas Liptay.Sabisky stepped down following increasing criticism from Conservatives and opposition politicians after details emerged of his views on subjects ranging from black people’s IQs to using brain-enhancing drugs on children, and whether benefits claimants should be encouraged to have fewer children.The Labour chair, Ian Lavery, wrote to Johnson asking about how Sabisky was hired, whether he was vetted, and if the PM approved the process. Lavery also asked whether Johnson agreed with Sabisky’s views on race and intelligence, and other subjects. Downing Street officials refused to comment on this on Monday.Separately, Labour MP Stephen Doughty has written to Sedwill seeking answers on a series of issues connected to Sabisky, including the basis on which he was hired, who approved his employment, whether the Cabinet Office was informed, and any vetting which took place.No 10 did not respond to questions on whether Story and Liptay worked at Downing Street or had been offered work. The SNP also demanded Johnson say whether Sabisky was vetted, arguing that the prime minister had “serious questions to answer” over the appointment.Kirsty Blackman, the party’s deputy Westminster leader, said: “It is beyond shameful that a man with a well-documented history of unapologetically offensive, misogynistic, and racist remarks was considered by No 10 to be an appropriate hire.“Special advisers do not have the power to hire contractors or to appoint advisers without ministerial approval so there must now be full transparency and the Tories must set out which government minister signed off on hiring Sabisky.”Sabisky appears to have been the first hire in response to a rambling blogpost in the new year by Cummings, Johnson’s chief adviser, calling for “weirdos and misfits with odd skills” to apply for new jobs within No 10.As news of Sabisky’s role emerged, so did details of views he had expounded energetically over years of writing, blogging and social media comments, much of it based around a belief in genetics as the main driver for people’s life chances.This included arguing that differences in intelligence and ability between races and social classes are largely hereditary, and thus there is little point running positive discrimination schemes or Sure Start-like early intervention programmes.It prompted a handful of Conservative MPs to speak out publicly against Sabisky, with other government advisers left notably unhappy at the coverage. One said: “We don’t want to all be tarred with the same brush – that he is in someway representative of all spads.”Downing Street had appeared resolute in sticking by Sabisky throughout Monday, but he abruptly left that evening amid widespread reports that he had been ordered to step down.Kwarteng, was notably more outspoken than Downing Street officials, saying: “I think it’s unfortunate he was hired … We do need to look at these processes.”Describing Sabisky’s views as “racist, offensive and objectionable”, the business minister told BBC Radio 5 live he was glad the adviser had left.He said the government “should prevent racists from coming into No 10 or wherever he was working”, adding: “The fact is his remarks have been identified and very quickly pushed out … and we can move on.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/529ad4387ee1778567e22cf3e9f228ae8e1309b6/0_0_4788_2873/master/4788.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c66e500ccafcd5773ec759c7c98a4cb3","title":"uk brexit negotiator britain eu different planets","story":"EU officials rubbish No 10 claims that bloc is trying to win back Parthenon marbles for AthensMichel Barnier has rejected British demands for a Canada-style trade deal that would free the UK from EU rules as he made a thinly-veiled warning to Boris Johnson not to break his word.Speaking in response to a landmark speech by David Frost, Britain’s Brexit negotiator, Barnier said such an offer was not on the table and noted that the prime minister had agreed only six months ago to stick to the EU’s state aid rules and current social and environmental regulations after the transition period.Asked if Frost was right in his speech on Monday night to say that agreeing to such alignment in a trade deal would be undemocratic, Barnier told reporters: “Truly not. It is a sovereign decision of the EU, it is a sovereign decision of the UK to cooperate … That is what Boris Johnson wrote in the political declaration.”Within hours of Barnier’s comments, the British government seized upon a change to the EU’s draft negotiating mandate, leaked to the , which sources in Downing Street suggested was an attempt to win back the Parthenon marbles for Athens.The latest draft of the EU’s negotiating position calls for both sides to “address issues relating to the return or restitution of unlawfully removed cultural objects to their countries of origin”.“This is just not happening,” a Downing Street source said with reference to suggestions that the language referred to the return of the ancient marble sculptures to Athens. “And it shows a troubling lack of seriousness about negotiations on the EU side.”The Downing Street intervention came despite both Greek and EU officials insisting that the clause, proposed by Italy, Spain, Cyprus and Greece, was not related to the marbles held by the British museum but merely to a desire to stop the fraudulent movement of antiquities around Europe.One senior EU source likened the row as throwing a “dead cat” on the table to ert attention from the fallout from Frost’s comments.The explosion of rhetoric on both sides of the Channel offers little hope that the next 11 months of talks will be smooth.In his speech on Monday night, Frost had set a tough line on EU demands by claiming the consent of the British public would “snap dramatically and finally” if the UK continued to be bound to the EU rulebook after December 2020. The latest EU negotiating mandate says those level playing field provisions should further develop “over time”.Frost went on to suggest that Brussels should offer a trade deal similar to that given to Canada, which avoided any European court of justice supervision of standards or demands on “alignment” with Brussels.Barnier’s response, and that of other EU officials, was one of polite fury. Sources said the EU negotiator had privately suggested to MEPs that the UK was backsliding on the political declaration on the future relationship signed last year.“We have proposed a trade agreement with a country that has a very particular and unique close geographical proximity not like Canada, not like South Korea and not like Japan,” Barnier said. “Very particular. We are ready to propose and work very quickly with Britain on the basis of the political declaration, which was agreed with Boris Johnson. We stand ready to propose this agreement, if the UK wants it.”Speaking separately, the EU’s trade commissioner, Phil Hogan, warned that the UK would bear “full responsibility” for its choices.“We’re looking for a level playing field and they don’t seem to want it,” Hogan said. “It’s a big worry for many of the manufacturing sectors in the UK. If they want to erge from the existing rules and regulations, we are going to have problems. And the more they erge from the existing EU law and regulations, the more problems we’ll have.”Guy Verhofstadt, a senior MEP and former prime minister of Belgium, who has led the European parliament’s approach to Brexit, said the UK was approaching the negotiation as if the sides were “living on two different planets”.He added that it would be a “hell of a job” to secure a successful outcome from the negotiation given the British approach.In response to the row over the Parthenon marbles, a spokesman for the British Museum noted the Greek government’s denial that it would pursue the statues during the trade negotiations with the UK.The spokesman said: “The British Museum welcomes this mandate and is committed to fighting the trade in illicit antiquities across the world.“We work in partnership with law enforcement agencies to identify and help to return objects that come into the UK illegally. The Parthenon sculptures were legally acquired and help us to tell the story of human history presented at the Museum. They are accessible to the 6 million global visitors the museum receives each year.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/486eeccf24e50fb671055e63ad44f19adf4e9cca/0_153_2290_1374/master/2290.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=91668ac9192ed5599133392e145f85c8","title":"how to choose the destination of your winter dreams","story":"Picking the right location for your ski holiday can be stressful.

Unless the question is: “Which ski resorts are best at search engine optimisation?”Here’s everything you need to know about skiing in France, Switzerland and Japan.Family-friendly fun in FranceTypical ski season: December-MayThe appeal is helped by France’s proximity to the UK, which means short flight times and plenty of low-cost airline choice, along with the opportunity to drive or take the environmentally-friendly train option.And French resorts are especially good for family snow trips, thanks to their English-speaking ski schools, tailored beginner areas and fun snow parks for kids. Many resorts also have an impressive array of non-ski activities to keep things enjoyable for children.Nestled in an enchanted pine forest at 1,750 metres, Club Med Les Arcs Panorama is a great choice for families, as it’s right on the slopes and has children’s classes and clubs available from four months up. Kids will love the playful animal sculptures dotted around the property, the ski trails through the woods and the resort’s famed toboggan runs.A luxury treat in SwitzerlandTypical ski season: November-MaySkiing in Switzerland is for those who want to push the boat out – a place of chocolate box beauty, where time appears to have stood still. But its popularity with Britons is also because it boasts some of the best ski resorts in Europe, with great pistes for all levels, excellent snow records, and renowned ski schools.Saint-Moritz was the world’s first winter sports resort and continues to have a reputation for glitz and glamour. By staying at the Club Med Saint-Moritz Roi Soleil you can enjoy all the chicness from a safe distance, knowing the price of your all-inclusive holiday was fixed in advance. The resort is linked to the extensive Engadin valley, and off-piste activities include Nordic skiing, riding in horse-drawn carriages and cosy fondue suppers.Crowd-free adventures in JapanTypical ski season: December-MarchHeading to Japan is the ultimate choice for adventurous skiers and snowboarders who want a fresh and original take on their winter break. Yes, you have to travel farther, but once you’re there Japan will more than deliver on the experience, as more and more British travellers are discovering each year.Hokkaido in the north of the country is the premier spot for skiing and snowboarding. Expect uncrowded slopes, plentiful fresh powder snow, phenomenal food, and unique insights into Japanese culture. Club Med’s Tomamu Hokkaido gives you ski-in ski-out access to Tomamu Mountain, a mix of cultural exploration and a great snow experience. Enjoy the 145 hectares of powder to play in, thaw out in a Japanese onsen and learn how to make sushi from the resort chef.Club Med, founded in 1950, is the pioneer of the all-inclusive concept, offering nearly 70 premium resorts in stunning locations around the world including North and South America, Caribbean, Asia, Africa, Europe and the Mediterranean."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b9c9a5bea3b7e741c77eb03af1c44249e5e8ea7/0_106_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=96a1d114ce01d80b40315fd69bd8029e","title":"scientists discover neanderthal skeleton in an iraqi cave","story":"The fossils found in Iraqi cave provide fresh evidence the species buried their death with mortuary ritualsA Neanderthal skeleton unearthed in an Iraqi cave, already famous for fossils of these cousins of our species, is providing fresh evidence that they buried their dead – and intriguing clues that flowers may have been used in such rituals.Scientists said they had discovered the well-preserved upper body skeleton of an adult Neanderthal, who lived about 70,000 years ago, in Shanidar Cave in the semi-autonomous Kurdistan region of northern Iraq on Tuesday. The inidual – dubbed Shanidar Z – was perhaps in his or her 40s or 50s with their sex undetermined.The cave was a pivotal site for mid-20th century archaeology. Remains of 10 Neanderthals – seven adults and three infants – were dug up there 60 years ago, offering insight into their physical characteristics, behaviour and diet. Clusters of flower pollen were found in soil samples associated with one of the skeletons, a discovery that prompted scientists involved in that research to propose that Neanderthals buried their dead and conducted funerary rites with flowers.That hypothesis helped change the prevailing view at the time of Neanderthals as dimwitted and brutish, a notion increasingly discredited by new discoveries. Critics cast doubt on the “flower burial,” arguing the pollen could have been modern contamination from people living in the cave or from rodents or insects.But Shanidar Z’s bones, which are believed to be the top half of a partial skeleton unearthed in 1960, were found in sediment containing ancient pollen and other mineralised plant remains, reviving the possibility of flower burials. “So from initially being a sceptic based on many of the other published critiques of the flower-burial evidence, I am coming round to think this scenario is much more plausible and I am excited to see the full results of our new analyses,” said University of Cambridge osteologist and paleoanthropologist Emma Pomeroy, lead author of the research published in the journal Antiquity.Scholars have argued for years about whether Neanderthals buried their dead with mortuary rituals, part of the larger debate over their levels of cognitive sophistication.“What is key here is the intentionality behind the burial. You might bury a body for purely practical reasons, in order to avoid attracting dangerous scavengers andor to reduce the smell. But when this goes beyond practical elements it is important because that indicates more complex, symbolic and abstract thinking, compassion and care for the dead, and perhaps feelings of mourning and loss,” Pomeroy said.“Whether the Neanderthal group of dead, placed around 70,000 years ago in the cave were a few years, a few decades or centuries – or even millennia – apart, it seems clear that Shanidar was a special place, with bodies being placed just in one part of a large cave,” said University of Cambridge archeologist and study co-author Graeme Barker.Neanderthals inhabited Eurasia from the Atlantic coast to the Ural Mountains from about 400,000 years ago until a little after 40,000 years ago, disappearing after our species established itself in the region.The two species interbred, with modern non-African human populations bearing residual Neanderthal DNA."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8304b96c4e341bf66dd3d3db3190b9ab9ffce417/0_12_2577_1546/master/2577.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=06cc3cfea4fd3e7413dba0131aae6a19","title":"tell us have you been affected by the coronavirus","story":"If you have been affected or have any information or news tips for our journalists, we would like to hear from youPassengers onboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan have been able to leave after being quarantined since 3 February.Hundreds of people – who spent quarantine largely confined to their cabins – disembarked the ship to board buses and taxis.According to the South China Morning Post, a second person in Hong Kong has died from the coronavirus.

The drugs used in many cancer treatments are known to put fertility at risk.Doctors ruled out the standard IVF procedure of using hormones to stimulate the woman’s ovaries to produce eggs, concerned it might exacerbate her cancer. Another option was to remove and freeze some of the patient’s ovarian tissue and reimplant it when she had recovered, but the woman considered the operation too invasive.Instead, the woman opted for retrieval of early-stage eggs from her ovaries. These were matured in the lab for one or two days and then vitrified – a process that freezes the cells rapidly in nitrogen to reduce the chances of ice crystals forming and rupturing them.The woman recovered from cancer but found she could not get pregnant naturally and returned to the hospital for fertility treatment. There, Grynberg’s team thawed seven frozen eggs, six of which survived the process. These were fertilised with sperm injections, but only one developed into a healthy embryo that gave rise to the successful pregnancy. The boy was born on 6 July 2019 when the woman was 34.Grynberg said that while the procedure was not particularly efficient, it allowed some women to have babies when they had exhausted other options. In cancer patients, removing and freezing ovarian tissue before chemotherapy can be a more reliable approach, but in addition to being an invasive operation, the procedure has long-term risks if cancer cells have infiltrated the ovarian tissue that is removed for storage before chemotherapy. Details of the birth were published in Annals of Oncology. “She was very lucky and we were as well,” Grynberg added. Two more women, one who was treated for breast cancer and another who was treated for lymphoma, were now pregnant after having the same procedure at the hospital, he said.The medical team is working to make the procedure more efficient. At the moment, many embryos created from eggs that have been matured in the lab and then frozen do not develop well enough to establish healthy pregnancies. Grynberg said the team hoped to improve the culture medium used to mature the eggs in the lab.Another issue the doctors want to understand better is why the number of immature eggs they can retrieve from women varies so dramatically. “We can have two different patients, both aged 30, and get 10 eggs from one woman, and 20 from the other, and we don’t know why,” Grynberg said.Eggs have been matured in the lab before and used to create embryos that have gone on to produce live births. But this was the first birth from an egg matured in the lab and then frozen before use."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95a81d75c66975357e4c3047f11c812d655d8db3/0_153_2970_1782/master/2970.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=48476da5466811698e3bdba0ccc78078","title":"englands lewis ludlam we are always hunting other teams down","story":"All-action back row is learning how to control his intense passion and targeting a Six Nations-defining win over IrelandLewis Ludlam is nothing if not passionate. Whether you consider his military metaphors before England’s Calcutta Cup victory to be inappropriate or innocuous, malice was not his motivation. Rather, Ludlam wears his heart on his sleeve, belting out the national anthem and, as he admits, buzzing with excitement the moment he learns he has made the starting lineup.If the backlash against his comments was part of his learning curve off the field, he continues his swift progress on it. Against Scotland Ludlam made only his fourth England start and his first in the Six Nations, but he made his considerable presence felt in a callow back-row alongside the 23-year-old Sam Underhill and Tom Curry, 21. They combined to get the edge at the breakdown and ultimately get England’s Six Nations campaign back on track.Eddie Jones has clearly been taken by the all-action Ludlam, having been so impressed by him last summer when he was a late call-up to the England squad preparing to face the Barbarians. The feeling seems mutual judging by the flanker’s willingness to echo his coach’s fighting talk. You get the sense that Ludlam has this week been advised not to mention the war but his enthusiasm again shines through when addressing Ireland’s visit to Twickenham on Sunday for a contest that looks certain to define England’s Six Nations season.Victory keeps their title hopes alive – all the more so if Wales do them a favour against France 24 hours earlier – and Ludlam is convinced it is within England’s grasp. “As a team and as players we are always looking at hunting other teams down and scraping out wins and that has always been my mindset,” he says. “We want to impose ourselves on other teams and we will try and do that as much as possible.”Asked if England can still win what would be their first Six Nations title since 2017, Ludlam adds: “Absolutely, yes. We back ourselves. We always back ourselves, otherwise we wouldn’t be out there. We have full belief in the team. It would be a hard thing to do but we’re aware of the ability we have in the team.”Having made his mark against Scotland, Ludlam will be hoping to keep his place on Sunday. Jones, mindful of the Scots’ breakdown threat, opted to effectively go with three openside flankers and while Courtney Lawes could return against Ireland, or Ben Earl may be given a first start, Ludlam would be unfortunate if he were to drop to the bench.“I get revved up as soon as I know the team,” Ludlam says. “After it’s announced I’m buzzing and ready. I’m thinking about situations and being involved in the game. But the moment I get really pumped up is during the anthems. That’s when my emotions are really high. The hairs stand up on the back of my neck and that’s when you really know you’re in it. That’s when it gets surreal.“It’s a good thing, but there’s a fine line between being excited and having the emotion drain you. I haven’t felt drained in games yet but I’m fully aware that the lads who have played in the shirt for a long time have learned how to control their emotions and how to switch them on and off. I’m excited early on but I don’t necessarily think that’s a bad thing, but it’s something I’m working on.”The back-row challenge awaiting whichever trio Jones opts for is formidable, all the more so with Curry still learning on the job at No 8 in the absence of the injured Billy Vunipola. Indeed, Ireland’s CJ Stander has been among the best performers of the championship so far, particularly against Wales when he excelled in unison with Josh van der Flier and Peter O’Mahony.“That’s why you play the game – to challenge yourself against the best,” says Ludlam. “Tom was awesome in Edinburgh. It just goes to show what a great player he is. He received a lot of criticism for the France game but has worked really hard to get things right. To put out that performance at the weekend is testament to him, so I’m really happy for him. He’s hungry to learn.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3fc58e952641abd343d584054feb4fa3e75fec41/5_369_4103_2463/master/4103.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d0c6e4feb55eba93f46e5d08712fe1ae","title":"dog agility westminster perry dewitt jessica ajoux","story":"The fast-growing sport of dog agility has become one of the most popular events at shows like Westminster and a welcome alternative for those who believe conformation shows are archaic and outmodedThe sport of dog agility is easy to grasp for a first-time spectator. The object is simple: Unleashed dogs negotiate a serpentine obstacle course – clearing a series of jumps, weaving their way around poles, darting through tunnels, hurdling through tires, sprinting up and down ramps and a seesaw – as quickly as possible under the guidance of their handler, who can rely only on voice cues and body language.At the highest form it’s dressage on uppers, marrying the human-animal bond and precision of equestrian sports with the frenetic pace and inherent volatility of alpine skiing, where the margins that separate first place and disaster are often down to hair-trigger decisions imperceptible to the untrained eye. To the unfamiliar, it can seem like magic.It’s not hard to see why this fast-paced and eminently televisable spectacle of barely controlled chaos has fast become one of the most popular events of the Westminster Kennel Club dog show in the seven years since it was first added to the program – and a welcome alternative for those who believe traditional conformation shows, where dogs are judged almost entirely on their appearance, are archaic and outmoded.The introduction of an agility competition to Westminster marked a step forward for this emerging sport and few trainers have since made a bigger impact on the US scene than Perry DeWitt and Jessica Ajoux, who live together in the Philadelphia suburb of Wyncote alongside two of America’s most famous canine athletes: the border collies Verb and Fame.The six-year-old Verb, owned and handled by DeWitt, captured last year’s Westminster masters agility title with a sensational final run that went viral and enters this year’s competition as the defending champion. Fame, aged nine and in the winter of his career, won it the year before and remains a formidable threat to regain the crown. In a couple days’ time, they will make the two-hour drive north to New York City and attempt to make it three in a row for what’s fast becoming the winningest household in the sport.“I do feel a little bit of pressure of being the reigning champion, because I think everyone’s watching and everyone’s expecting you to do something,” DeWitt says in the days before the trial. “Agility is funny because I’ve had so many good runs with Verb and every time I wonder if I will ever have another, because it always feels like it’s just lucky that it happens. That’s why it’s so addicting, because you can’t guarantee it.”Ajoux, who plans to retire Fame shortly after this year’s Westminster after a decorated career, strikes a more confident pose as the competition looms.“There’s two people that can beat us,” she says. “And it’s us.”The conformation portion of Westminster is one of America’s longest-running sporting events and what most people envision when they think of dog shows (or, indeed, Best in Show), but vocal critics have claimed it enables the breeding of dogs for beauty over health and function to the detriment of the animal.The essential purpose of the more than 20,000 conformation shows held annually in the United States is to assess dogs for breeding stock or, more specifically, in a way that promotes selection of parents in order to produce the “best” puppies. But the judging at these shows almost exclusively places an emphasis on physical appearance, effectively ignoring the genetic factors like health, temperament and function that enable a dog to live a successful life as a working or companion animal.Agility exists on the opposite end of the spectrum from the conformation world, offering a far more dog-positive arena free of controversy. Unlike conformation shows which only allow intact purebreds, it is open to mixed breeds. Handlers don’t care what their border collies look like as they careen through the course and fly toward the finish line: they just want them to win and have fun doing it (and not vitally in that order). As competitions they are similar in the sense they determine a best from a field of dogs and thus exist to celebrate an ideal. But as a spectator sport, agility trials are to conformation shows, more or less, as Miss America is to the Olympics.Any able-bodied dog is eligible to compete in agility under American Kennel Club rules, but border collies like Verb and Fame have won the overall title in all but one of the seven years since Westminster introduced it. That’s no accident. The herding dog is widely regarded as the most intelligent of domestic breeds, underpinned by a sheer athleticism seemingly tailor-made for the sport’s demands. The difference in watching a top border collie churn through a course after watching a dachshund or a mastiff feels something like watching LeBron James take the court on the heels of a mid-major college game.“I would say they’re one of the one of the most, if not the most biddable dog breed out there, which means that they want to do what you want them to do,” says DeWitt, a full-time certified professional dog trainer with an in-depth background in dog behavior. “They were bred to be working in conjunction with humans doing tasks and responding very quickly to cues and commands at a distance. Not to mention, they’re very, very athletic. They can turn on a dime, they can accelerate, they can decelerate, they can sprint, they have endurance. They’re just an overall very athletic breed.”DeWitt had initially been eying a different puppy in the litter of a breeder from outside Las Vegas when she first spotted Verb at five weeks old and knew “within 30 seconds” she needed to have him. She gave him a name that connoted action, auguring the exploits in his future. But innate athleticism is only half of the game. DeWitt’s almost extrasensory communion with Verb as he bounds around the ring in lockstep with her cues, 42lbs of fast-twitch muscle in a blur, is a demonstrable testament to her command of the underlying emotional factors that drive canine behavior.She’s found her other half in Ajoux, a Princeton-educated agility instructor who has less of a formal background in dog training but has competed in the sport since she was a teenager and made it into her full-time profession. She believes athleticism is the most non-negotiable trait in a top dog, but character cannot be overlooked.“These are dogs that live with us all the time, so you have to find a dog that you get along with,” says Ajoux, who wasn’t in the market for a new puppy when an enthusiastic breeder insisted (correctly) that Fame was her type of dog. “Their personality, if it matches well with yours, that’s the winning team. Because you could have the best dog in the world, but if you’re not in sync with that particular dog, it never works. It’s so simple: you have to really like your dog and they have to like you.”DeWitt grew up suburban Pennsylvania obsessed with canines, spending her idle time memorizing an encyclopedia of dog breeds. She was nine when her parents bought the family a border collie and took it on herself to start training him in agility on a makeshift course in her backyard after seeing a competition on television.She put agility on the back burner for a few years when her own lacrosse career took off, but can vividly recall her sudden compulsion to get back into it again while riding the bus home from her final college game. One week after graduation, she was in California buying her first own border collie and the rest is history.“What matters the most in this sport is how a dog and a team responds to pressure,” DeWitt says, a nod to the competitive itch that agility manages to scratch for her. “You can be the best in the world in your backyard or even in class, but you have to be able to take the crowd, you have to be able to take the pressure of being in a final run and manage your emotions and the dog has to be able to manage theirs, too.“That’s one thing that makes Verb such an amazing competitor: he is not fazed by anything. If I took him in the backyard and did agility with him, it would be no different than doing it at Westminster with a huge crowd and the speakers and the people cheering. He does not notice, he does not care. I do, but I think having a history of competing in sports at a pretty high level taught me to be able to deal with that type of emotion.”Ajoux, who was raised in southern California and France, was also a born animal-lover and spent many of her early years horseback riding and show jumping. But from the moment she first saw an agility trial on television, she knew she had to be involved. She researched agility clubs obsessively as a teenager and started training the family’s house dog, Mocha, for competitions that she couldn’t yet drive to. Her parents thought it was a fad, but two decades later it remains her passion and livelihood.They met several years ago through the agility community and describe their early impressions of one another in terms of mutual respect as competitors. Today, DeWitt and Ajoux live together with eight dogs while owning and operating an agility training center in the nearby village of Huntington Valley, about 25 miles outside Philadelphia. One reason behind their success is they devote themselves to it full time, while many of their competitors are hobbyists with day jobs. This is what they do. Even equestrians who live and breathe their animal every day have to put their horse in a stall at the end of the day. Verb and Fame are in the bed with them. It is their work life, it is their romantic life, it is their hobby and it’s their family.The competitive benefits to the partnership are many. They can put their heads together to study the courses, which are designed by judges and kept secret until an hour before a trial, with twice the brainpower and problem-solving experience. If one notices or misses something important during a run, they can pass along the intel to the other before they take the start line. Any training secret that one of them has becomes something both of them have.But there’s only room for one winner in agility – and a relationship between a pair of fiercely competitive handlers is not without emotional pitfalls.“What makes it difficult is that we both really care about it a lot, we both really want to win and I can feel a lot of guilt if I’m not happy enough for her that she did well because I did badly,” DeWitt says. “It’s just a weird mix of emotions that’s hard to navigate.”Ajoux jumps in: “Because you don’t want to take away from their success but we know each other obviously, so we can’t hide it. Then if I’ve not done well and I want to be a little bit sad and I want her to comfort me, why should I be taking away from her excitement? Balancing it is super hard, but at the same time, I think we’ve gotten really good at agility because wherever I go, my biggest competition drove there in the car with me.”The origins of dog agility can be traced to the 1978 Crufts dog show in Birmingham, where a former committee member named John Varley was tasked with coming up with intermission entertainment for the audience between the conformation and obedience competitions. His solution was a variation on show jumping designed to demonstrate a dog’s willingness to work with their handler in a variety of situations.The Kennel Club, Britain’s counterpart to the AKC, established an official set of rules in 1980 and the sport quickly took hold, spreading across Europe and across the pond over the following decade. It was already popular in the United States long before Westminster added it in 2014, but the sport’s inclusion in America’s most publicized and heavily marketed dog show has given it unprecedented mainstream exposure in a few short years.That’s led to increased participation – the AKC claims more than one million entries to the registry’s agility program each year – and higher-caliber opposition than ever before, especially at high-profile competitions like Westminster. The fields on the older United States Dog Agility Association (USDAA) circuit are even stronger.“The competition is getting fiercer and fiercer each year,” says Ajoux, who has been handling agility dogs competitively since 1999. “It used to be more local people because it’s not like it’s easy to get to New York City, but more and more people are coming in from across the country and you’re seeing more competitive teams. The prestige of winning Westminster is definitely taking hold in the agility community, because of the fact that it’s televised and you get so much recognition, more so than any other thing that happens in agility.”She adds: “Dogs are getting so much faster. They’re running faster and the courses are becoming more intricate, more technical. And as a result, it’s also becoming more athletically demanding for the handler to negotiate some of the courses as well, because I can’t outrun Fame, and so the only way I can actually tell her where to go is to have skills trained to a higher level. The level of course is right now, it’s at the edge of our training and it’s only getting harder and faster.”Pier 94, the decommissioned passenger ship terminal on the Hudson River where the agility competition takes place, is already a flurry of activity at 7.30am on a Saturday morning as the Westminster dog show opens for the 144th year. It’s roughly a half hour before the first qualifying runs of this year’s contest and the handlers are walking about the 100-by-40-foot competition space, carefully examining a course they’re only seeing for the first time.“There’s only so many types of obstacles, and there’s usually between 18 and 22 obstacles on the course, but the combinations are infinite and it’s different every time,” DeWitt says. “Sometimes you’ll see some similarities or patterns, but it’s never the same course twice. And so you don’t get to practice the exact sequences before the competition, so you have to have a lot of tools in the toolbox in order to negotiate whatever the judge has put forth that day.”Verb and Fame will be competing in a field of some 325 dogs today. Both will need to complete a pair of clean qualifying runs to reach the evening finals, which have been sold out for weeks and will be broadcast nationally in prime time.Ajoux and Fame compete the first run flawlessly and pace their class entering the second. But Fame takes a bar early in his second run, knocking it to the ground for a five-second deduction, then commits a second fault when he misses a jump near the end. A single fault, which counts against a dog’s overall time, might not have spelled elimination given Fame’s raw speed. But two faults is too deep a hole for the fastest dog to overcome.That leaves it to Verb and the defending champion lives up to advance billing, zipping through a pair of flawless qualifying runs and earning the top seed for the final.After carefully examining the freshly redesigned course before the final run and mentally devising a handling plan, DeWitt retreats beneath the grandstand with Verb, closes her eyes and goes through the creative visualization routine – seeing the perfect run in her mind’s eye. The course is tricky at the finish, but she’s confident in her dog – even if the spiking heart rate on her smart watch betrays her nerves.Then it begins and one by one the dogs in Verb’s class either botch their runs or fail to post extraordinary times. And with Verb running last due to his afternoon performance, DeWitt knows the time they need to beat – and safe in the knowledge that she doesn’t need to push him.A hush falls over the sold-out crowd as Verb takes his position at the start line. Then he’s off like a bullet from a barrel, clearing every jump and obstacle, barreling through tunnels and drawing oohs and aahs from the gallery as he whips through the weaving poles at impossible speed. He’s well ahead of the clubhouse leader and it seems a second straight Westminster title is in the bag when – in a stroke of breathtaking drama – he takes the wrong jump at the final obstacle before turning back and going through the right one. As the crowd deflates like a balloon, DeWitt throws her arms up in a mix of surprise and disappointment. The refusal is a five-second deduction, ensuring their elimination. He didn’t go where she told him to go. Just a moment of an animal being an animal.The overall winner is a border collie named Pink handled by the Ohio trainer Jennifer Crank, the same team who finished second to Fame in 2018 and to Verb in 2019. Behind the winner’s circle are tears and there are smiles as DeWitt embraces Ajoux in the corridor where their photos hang as former champions. Verb’s contagious grin as he looks up from the carpet seems to communicate what they all know: They’ll be back.“We just both care probably too much for what it really is,” DeWitt says. “I mean, it’s a dog sport, dogs jumping over PVC pipes. But we care about it a lot, which makes us better because we’re always working hard.

It melts the coolest of heads, obscures the most obvious move or turns the ball to liquid as hands close around it. Players say they thrive on it, that it brings out the best in them and sometimes they are right. And often wrong.Pressure is hard to quantify and unknown pressure is difficult to prepare for. And it is the pressure of being the overwhelming favourites in a home World Cup, the biggest of its kind, that provides the unknown opponent for Australia in the month ahead. They have never been to this party.Put simply, Australia have the strongest team with the greatest depth and easily the most abundant resources and investment. In the past two years they have won 26 out of the 31 Twenty20 internationals they have played only England and India have surpassed them. And yet, the fact two of those losses came in the tri-series that preceded this T20 World Cup will give others hope that cracks can be exploited, perhaps widened, by the weight of expectation.Reports have zeroed in on the opener Alyssa Healy’s meagre returns from the tri-series – she made scores of 9, 1, 0, 1 and 4 – but her partner at the top, Beth Mooney, generally ensured Australia’s good starts. The pair sometimes seem to trade form and it is worth remembering that before Australia’s victorious 2018 T20 World Cup in the Caribbean, Mooney was piling up runs while Healy struggled. Mooney went on to have a modest competition while Healy flayed her way through attacks, made 225 at an average of 56.25 and was named player of the tournament.That kind of record sums up why Australia feel licensed to attack and take risks with their batting. There is nearly always someone else to grab the baton. Meg Lanning, Rachael Haynes and Ellyse Perry provide experience and stability when consolidation is required, without sacrificing scoring rates, and the explosive power of Ash Gardner can blow an innings open. Even the least experienced player in the squad, Annabel Sutherland, displayed a clear mind and clean striking as she recently plundered 22 runs from 11 balls to take Australia into a super-over against England.It’s no surprise Australia’s aggressive, front-foot approach calls to mind the England men’s World Cup winning ODI side the coach Matthew Mott has worked extensively with the former England coach, Trevor Bayliss, at New South Wales and shares some of his white ball philosophies.If the batting fails to fire as it ought, Australia’s bowling attack in home conditions has the depth and variety to threaten, contain and run through any side. Megan Schutt’s canny swing has made her the No 1 ranked T20 bowler in the world and Tayla Vlaeminck’s raw pace and bounce brings serious excitement. Her fastest bouncers – not often seen in women’s cricket – can surprise even the best batters and force a top edge if the pitches are pace friendly she will undoubtedly bang them in hard.But perhaps the most encouraging sign for Australia lies in the form of their left-arm spinning allrounder, Jess Jonassen. A knee knee injury kept her on the sidelines during the last T20 World Cup but she has been a mainstay of the attack since returning for last year’s Ashes campaign and took a career-best five for 12 in the tri-series final against India, bowling at the death against a side who are easily one of the best against spin.Mott and Lanning have other options, depending on conditions and even specific match-ups. Georgia Wareham has emerged as Australia’s leading attacking leg-spinner while Nicola Carey and Delissa Kimmince offer medium pace and lower-order flair with the bat. Erin Burns offers off-spin to back up her batting but it is hard to see her forcing her way into such a formidable side early on in the tournament.And then there is Perry. It is hard to find new ways to describe a player who has already worn all the superlatives and whose extravagant talent makes the extraordinary seem everyday. Here, indeed, is a player who has always risen in the face of pressure. But you cannot say it transforms her into a diamond that would assume she was once a lump of coal instead of the supreme athlete she has always been, a frankly ridiculous notion.Perry’s T20 batting skills, particularly her power-hitting and strike rate, have flourished in recent years but it is worth remembering what was arguably her finest bowling spell during the 2013 World Cup final against West Indies in Mumbai. An ankle injury had kept her out of the Super Six stage and she had not fully recovered when Australia gambled on her selection in the final. After a key contribution with the bat, Perry, clearly in pain, pulled out of her run-up twice and hobbled back to her mark before taking three vital wickets and conceding eight runs in six overs. Australia lifted the trophy. If Mott could bottle what drove Perry on that day, it would be passed around the players for pre-match swigs, starting on Friday against India.Each World Cup starts with a fresh slate, ready for new tales of sporting heroism. And, of all the formats, T20 is the most unpredictable one brilliant innings, one scything spell, one dazzling moment of athleticism in the field can turn the game against even the best team. Not to mention that intangible, elusive, unquantifiable notion of pressure."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8881800af2ed06761c1cb5017046269bc0bec47d/0_0_4896_2938/master/4896.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6c77db4dd83afe6e60f37ab7b173ff81","title":"talking horses power feels lostintranslation is going under radar","story":"Robbie Power feels his Gold Cup mount has been written off after one bad run, but has hopes for a better effort this timeIf only punters could get it right! Mere hours after Gordon Elliott referred to Delta Work as “a forgotten horse” it was the turn of Robbie Power to claim that Lostintranslation was not getting enough love in the Gold Cup conversation. Power compared him to Sizing John, who he rode to Cheltenham glory in the 2017 race in defiance of pre-race fears about unproven stamina.“He’s coming in, a little like Sizing John, under the radar because people didn’t think Sizing John was going to stay,” Power told a gathering of racing media at Punchestown on Tuesday. “Now they’ve kind of written off Lostintranslation a bit as well. People have been watching Delta Work and other horses and we’re going to slip in nicely under the radar hopefully.”We know from similar quotes in the past that “under the radar” is the ideal place to be if you are a professional athlete approaching a major competition. So acute is their knowledge of where the radar is that the secret services should really be looking to recruit from the ranks of sportsmen and women.As it happens, Delta Work is third in betting on the Gold Cup while Lostintranslation is fourth, but there is no harm in Elliott and Power convincing themselves that external expectations are low for their horses. At least one of them is going to be disappointed on 13 March, after all, and perhaps this kind of thinking will make it easier to bear.Power had some good points to make about Lostintranslation and suggested putting a line through his King George flop on the grounds that it came too soon after his Betfair Chase success. “We do forget sometimes, with these staying chasers, how much a race can take out of them.“I know how good his form is around the New Course in Cheltenham. He was second to Defi Du Seuil in the JLT there and he beat Defi in the Dipper on that track as well. The only thing I’d be hoping for is some nice ground on the Friday.” Lostintranslation has had a wind operation since Boxing Day, another reason why he may surprise some.Meanwhile, Davy Russell evidently feels the public tends to overstate the chance of his Gold Cup mount, Presenting Percy, and is unsure the horse can improve on the level he showed when third in the Irish Gold Cup. “People say ‘That’s a lovely run-up to Cheltenham,’ but he was fairly ready to rock and roll in Leopardstown,” Russell told reporters. “That’s his form. I don’t know if there was a whole load left in the locker.”The Weatherbys Cheltenham Festival Betting Guide 2020, written by Paul Ferguson, is published this week and available through this link for £15.95.A Cheltenham Festival stat of the day will appear here from Monday to Friday for the next three weeks.Paul Nicholls delivered an even-money winner for Tuesday’s nap and the Ditcheat trainer is flying along just now, having scored with his last four runners. Hopefully Southfield Harvest (4.05) can keep the ball rolling at 11-8 or so in a maiden hurdle at Ludlow.Closely related to the high-class trio Southfield Theatre, Southfield Vic and Southfield Royale, ‘Harvest’ won a bumper in April, beating Stolen Silver, who has since become a Grade Two winner over hurdles. Southfield Harvest was beaten on his hurdling debut last month but showed promise in finishing second to a talented, experienced rival.The third horse has since won a big-field Ascot handicap, so the form looks good. Southfield Harvest ought to come on for that first outing in nine months and know a deal more here. He needs to, as Muckamore is also useful.At Doncaster, Potters Legend (3.55) gets his most winnable opportunity of the season so far. He didn’t cope with a sterner test at Haydock in December and bled but he is fairly treated when things fall right and odds of 15-2 appeal.Newcastle’s opener could fall to Liva (2.05), from the Stef Keniry yard that was among the winners on Tuesday. Liva has shown progress on the all-weather since switching yards in the summer and was only beaten half a length when cheekpieces were added to the mix last time. The chestnut is attracting interest at 6-1."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8903526c12721c7c7f826b2962a9dfeb5bf62136/0_189_5640_3384/master/5640.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8225d08380d5379cbe83345e9cf4be9a","title":"dance complexions contemporary ballet","story":"By hiring a erse range of dancers, the directors of Complexions Contemporary Ballet are working to change tired stereotypesWhen Jillian Davis is on stage, it’s hard to watch anyone else. In a blink of the eye, her body swings from long diagonals into swooping parabolas, from the fullest extension of a line to the most cavernous curve.For a moment, she suspends time, like her body is a gasp and the air hasn’t escaped just yet. Then, she’s a hiccup in gravity, light but grounded.“I definitely try to portray, like, that tall, Amazonian type because that’s not something that you see onstage a lot, and it’s beautiful,” Davis told the .At 6ft 2in, she towers over most of her fellow dancers, one of a myriad of qualities that make her an original. But for a long time, that iniduality worked against her.Before joining Complexions Contemporary Ballet, Davis said she attended close to a hundred company auditions. She always got rejected, and nine out of 10 times it was because of her height.“I just couldn’t figure out why I wasn’t even being looked at,” she said.Complexions was the first time she made it through an entire audition without being cut. Dwight Rhoden and Desmond Richardson, the company’s co-founders and artistic directors, identified something in her that was apparently lost on other creatives.It’s not the only occasion in which they’ve made an artistic choice that goes against the grain. Complexions is something of a black sheep in American ballet. One of its recent commissions is described by the company as a “physical reaction to the daily news”. Its programs include music from Kendrick Lamar, David Bowie and Lenny Kravitz – a far cry from the kind of lyric-less instrumentals usually associated with the art form.But perhaps the most radical part of Complexions is the people in it. “We want to celebrate ersity on every level: body types, looks, training, qualities of movement,” Rhoden said.He said he and Richardson are attracted to an “X-factor” in their dancers that’s part of what they bring to the table. Richardson echoed that sentiment he looks for artists who blur lines and boundaries and exude an innate passion. He calls this “otherness,” but without the negative connotation that term sometimes implies.“I always say it’s like a stew,” Rhoden said. “We’re about toasting the idea of unity – you know, contrasting qualities working harmoniously.”Complexions’ members are a snapshot of modern America, if more virtuosic and physically fit than an average Joe. Rhoden affectionately calls them his band of misfits demographically, they’re far more erse than your typical ballet ensemble.“I do think that we have to open up our mind,” Rhoden said. “This is 2020. Dance is evolving. And in order for it to continue to be a vital art form, we have to look at everything.”A number of pitfalls often sabotage ballet’s potential to fully connect with today’s audience. It’s a European craft that sprang from the Italian Renaissance, blossomed in French aristocratic circles, and was canonized centuries ago. But ballet has been slow to evolve and promote inclusivity beyond the confines of a Eurocentric ideal, and even its supporters have taken notice.Former New York Times dance critic Alastair Macaulay called the art form a “sexist view of the world”, and in contrast to other dance styles, ballet has faced scrutiny for its lack of female choreographers shaping the narrative. Often times, programs stumble into tired gender roles that pigeonhole performers as princes and princesses, boys and girls. It’s these cemented stereotypes that some people blame for misogyny in ballet, a hot topic in the #MeToo era.Beyond outdated gender politics, ballet has a legacy of privileging white bodies. Misty Copeland’s unparalleled popularity as American Ballet Theatre’s first female African American principal dancer suggests how much of an anomaly she is, and just how few people of color actually make it in the profession, especially at mainstream ballet companies that perform classical repertoire.Elizabeth Coker, an assistant arts professor of dance at New York University’s Tisch School of the Arts, sees connections between ballet’s systemic relationships to gender and race and the body type it promotes. Certainly, there is a predominant visual of how a ballet dancer is supposed to look.Think of the ballerina atop a childhood jewelry box. She’s almost always white and willowy, her legs like spindles. It’s the image audiences often associate with the art form: a line of jewelry box ballerinas, all carbon copies.But talented, diligent dancers don’t always fit those conventions. Candy Tong, another member of Complexions, knew she wanted to be a professional dancer when she was nine years old and always dreamed of being a prima ballerina at a top company. As she aged, she realized she couldn’t get the job she wanted because of her height and figure.“I don’t have the stereotypical ballet body. I’m not stick thin. I have a very muscular and curvy (build), which is very different from a stereotypical Asian woman, too,” Tong said. “My lines come off very unique, so I won’t have that picture-perfect balletic line and shape that classical ballet will want.”At times, Tong considered leaving dance altogether. Coker said dancers whose bodies don’t fit expectations adapt in a number of ways: Some of them barrel through and conform as much as possible, sometimes through unhealthy, destructive means. Others discover modern dance.In the 90s, Coker started her professional dance career in ballet. But as she went through puberty, her body changed in ways she couldn’t control. She transitioned to modern and post-modern dance soon after.“We just all assumed that if you couldn’t hack it, that that was on you, and that it was just effortless for everyone else,” Coker said. “I think because of this entrenched idea of the body type. Like, you either have it or you don’t.”Just 10 years ago, Macaulay – the same dance critic who called out ballet for being sexist – caused an uproar when he wrote in a review that a New York City Ballet professional dancer “looked as if she’d eaten one sugarplum too many”. He then doubled down with an essay in which he described in detail the “unfortunate” wobble of multiple dancers’ upper arms.But Coker said things are changing: there’s more knowledge now about healthy bodies, and there’s been a shift toward more athletic aesthetics in ballet. Even so, she still has students who struggle with their bodies.That’s why companies like Complexions are game-changing: they’re forging a path for what ballet can be instead of what it historically has been. And while Tong and Davis put pressure on traditional ballet bodies, their colleague Maxfield Haynes is dismantling the very framework that creates those physical expectations.Haynes, a self-identified “nonbinary butch queen”, has no interest in portraying ballet’s omnipresent prince figure or performing the formulaic choreography those roles entail.“I can do that, and I can do that fiercely,” they said. “But like, as a dancer and as an artist, I want to tell a different story, and I want to tell the story that’s most true to now.”Haynes is the only out nonbinary dancer they know at a major ballet company, and their interests haven’t always been accepted by the ballet community. When they were a student at the San Francisco Ballet School, they asked one of the teachers if they could wear pointe shoes for part of class and were immediately shut down.But after Haynes joined Complexions, their pointe skills were used as fuel. In a featured role with the company, Haynes is engulfed in a spotlight, crouching on their pointe shoes, arms outstretched like a butterfly. They fold in half as their arabesque tilts forward, and they fly high in partnered lifts.Richardson doesn’t need Haynes to be male or female – “you do you,” he said. He just wants them to embody strength.“Show that part,” Richardson said. “Knock it out of the park.”Haynes said they never thought they would find a place where they fit in.Now, audiences pay to watch them strut en pointe while mouthing David Bowie lyrics, blue glitter streaming down their face.“We change the world with what we do by just simply being who we are,” Haynes said. “It’s really, really special.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/876096927baa714a75ea5d2c27b0ec1a1bf97dd9/705_651_3358_2015/master/3358.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2f4209cedcdc31f7972a745c046539bc","title":"samsung galaxy z flip review back to the folding flip phone future","story":"Revamp of 2000’s flip phone means big screen folds in half into a compact clamshell that fits in small pocketsIt’s not often something comes along to genuinely change the game, but the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip does just that, bringing foldable displays closer to the mainstream and reinventing the flip phone for 2020 in the process.Screens that fold in half finally arrived last year with the Galaxy Fold, which was originally plagued by durability issues causing a delay and a reworking of the device.The £1,300 Galaxy Z Flip is therefore Samsung’s crucial second bite at the cherry. And it’s a very impressive one at that.Instead of a tall smartphone opening out into a square tablet, the Galaxy Z Flip is a tall smartphone that folds in half like mid-2000s flip-phones. I won’t beat about the bush: folding and unfolding the Galaxy Z Flip is a tremendous experience.The hinge opens and will hold the screen at any angle, similar to a laptop. It’s smooth and reassuringly solid. What you can’t easily do is flip it open with one finger, but you probably shouldn’t even if you could because the screen is fairly fragile – more on that later.Closed, the phone is a compact wedge shape with little rubber feet and magnets holding the two ends together. You’ll be able to fit it in most pockets, including the often useless-for-phones tiny pockets women are burdened with.There’s a small 1.1in oblong screen on the lid of the device adjacent to the main camera. It shows the time, the battery charge and a little notification dot if there’s something waiting for you. Double tap to light it up, swipe left for music controls and right for notification icons, which you can tap and see a little bit with scrolling text. It’s useful when you want it, but also easy to ignore, freeing you somewhat from the burden of notifications.Open it out and the 6.7in screen is remarkable. It looks and feels just like one of Samsung’s regular super-sized smartphones, which is a very good thing, apart from one caveat: there’s a crease in the middle. You can feel it, and get a reflection on the screen and you can see it.What feels weird at first under your thumb immediately becomes normal. It’s more visible when the screen is black, which makes the Galaxy Z Flip the first phone that looks worse in dark mode. You can’t see it while browsing a white web page or similar.The crease is one of the compromises of having a massive screen that rivals the very biggest smartphones available today, but that folds down into a small, pocketable package. I think it’s a worthy trade-off for now.The power button doubles as a fast and accurate fingerprint scanner, mounted below the volume buttons on the upper half of the phone.The screen works, looks great and the hinge feels sturdy. It’s rated for more than 200,000 folds, which is 100 openings a day for 5.5 years. It has nylon fibres in the hinge to literally sweep dust and dirt away as you open and close it, while the edges of the folding part have plastic T-shaped caps to try to block dirt from getting in that way.But there’s a massive question mark over the screen’s durability. It comes with care instructions wrapped around it in the box, including advice not to press hard on the screen with hard objects, such as your fingernail don’t fold something else in when closing the phone the phone isn’t dust or water resistant don’t put stickers or screen protectors on it and keep the phone away from credit cards as it has magnets in it. You can’t say you haven’t been warned.I was only given three working days to test the device and in that time it worked perfectly. Others haven’t been so lucky. Realistically you need at least several months of daily use to truly know if it will stand the test of time.Then there’s the scratch resistance of the glass screen: basically there isn’t any. It uses ultra-thin glass that can fold, which is remarkable, but it’s covered in a plastic layer and is so thin it’s easy to poke holes in. The screen is fairly well protected when closed, but it’s possible to get grit in between the two halves, while pushing hard with your fingernail could damage it.All in you have to treat it with the respect deserving of a £1,300 device, and even then you might run into trouble. If you’re at all blasé with the way you treat your smartphone, this isn’t for you.The Galaxy Z Flip has Qualcomm’s top-of-the-range chip from late 2019, the Snapdragon 855+, not this year’s top chip, the Snapdragon 865. It also has 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, which isn’t expandable with microSD.Performance all-round was good. Snappy, fast and smooth, similar to the Galaxy Note 10+, but not as rapid as the best, the OnePlus 7T Pro despite having the same chipset. If you’re into hardcore mobile gaming this isn’t the phone for you.Battery life was solid but not quite up to the standards set by the very best last year. The Galaxy Z Flip lasted about 27 hours between charges of medium to heavy usage.That was while using the phone as my primary device, lots of email, messages and push notifications, a couple of hours browsing, five hours of Spotify via Bluetooth headphones, 45 minutes of Netflix and about 10 photos.The Galaxy Z Flip has relatively slow 15W charging, taking close to two hours for a full charge, but has wireless charging and wireless powersharing to wirelessly charge something else from the phone’s back, such as a set of earbuds or a smartwatch.Samsung’s version of Android 10 is called One UI 2, which itself is an evolution of One UI launched on the Galaxy S10 last year.One UI 2 treats the phone’s screen differently to most other versions of Android. Broadly speaking the top half is for displaying information, while the bottom half is used for bits you have to touch and interact with. It’s a clever use of space helping you reach the bits you have to tap (with the exception of the notification bar), which is useful for a screen as long as the Galaxy Z Flip’s.As too are Android 10’s gestures: swipe up from the bottom for recently used apps, or across the bottom to switch the last used apps. Swipe in from either side for back. It’s simple, fast and easy to use on big-screen phones.Samsung has also made great strides in the speed of Android updates over recent years, bringing One UI 2 based on Android 10 as an update to the Galaxy S10 line in around three months from its release by Google.Overall, One UI 2 is a pleasing form of Android to use, with useful additions and, importantly, the full Google suite of apps and services, from which competitor Huawei is barred from using due to US trade sanctions.The Galaxy Z Flip has two 12-megapixel cameras on the back, one normal and one ultra-wide, and one 10-megapixel selfie camera peeking through a small hole in the top of the screen.The rear cameras are good but not class leading. The main camera shoots excellent pictures in good lighting, deals relatively well with high-contrast scenes with the addition of an HDR mode, but starts to struggle in middling light conditions. Images shot in the foyer of a theatre suffered from a bit of grain and noise.Likewise, the camera doesn’t have the best low-light performance, although the automatic Night Mode helps. The ultrawide works great in good light, but the lack of a telephoto camera is disappointing.The selfie camera is reasonable, shooting detailed images in good lighting, but again struggles in middling light, unexpectedly producing some blurry pictures. I got better results closing the phone, double-pressing the power button to bring up the main camera, which shows a small preview in the cover display.Samsung’s camera app has a load of tricks. One of the most interesting is the “single take” mode. Press the shutter button and let it run until you think you have enough. The camera shoots photos, videos and produces gifs all at once, showing you a portfolio of content at the end from which you can pick and choose the best. If you’re not sure what will work best, this mode is for you.You can also prop the phone up by closing it part way and use either the selfie camera or the main camera, which works as a makeshift tripod producing some interesting results.Overall the Galaxy Z Flip is a fun camera to use, but won’t win any awards. It’s good enough, just not the best – but that’s not what you’re paying for here.The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip is a tantalising, desirable look at one possible future of the smartphone.A big phone that folds into a compact square is surprisingly pleasing to use, much easier to pocket and has the side benefit of adding a bit of distance between you and your phone. Unfolding it and unlocking it is much more of a deliberate act than it is to glance at a traditional flat phone, potentially helping you avoid notification overload.It looks great, makes you stand out and feels solid, like the premium, cutting-edge product that it is. It’s exciting, different and delightfully tactile. But only having had three working days with it, I just can’t tell you whether it’ll go the distance. Months of daily use is the only thing that will really test the Galaxy Z Flip’s durability.Buy the £1,300 Galaxy Z Flip if you want something different, but only if you can stomach the uncertainty surrounding its durability. You might get three years of problem-free use out of it, but then you might not. Only time will tell. But looking at the sea of boring metal and glass slabs, many of which are similar in price to the Galaxy Z Flip, I want one, and maybe you do too.Pros: a screen that folds in half, big screen made pocketable, stands on its own, good camera, day+ battery life, exciting and different, One UI 2, good gestures, wireless charging and powersharing, nano sim and esimCons: durability unknowns, no dust or water resistance, high cost, no headphone socket, no telephoto camera, no expandable storage This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

Coroner Sarah Bourke adjourned the hearing until 5 August. Flack was due to stand trial next month after pleading not guilty to assaulting her boyfriend, Lewis Burton, with a lamp at her London flat. At a pre-trial hearing in December, the court was told that 27-year-old Burton sustained a “significant injury to his head” and had dialled 999.It is understood that Burton, who has said he is heartbroken by her death, had told police and prosecutors he wanted to withdraw his complaint against Flack.In the post, handed by Flack’s family to the Eastern Daily Press, which covers Norfolk where the presenter grew up, she wrote of her arrest on 12 December: “Within 24 hours my whole world and future was swept from under my feet and all the walls that I had taken so long to build around me, collapsed. I am suddenly on a different kind of stage and everyone is watching it happen.“I have always taken responsibility for what happened that night. Even on the night. But the truth is ... It was an accident.”Flack said she had been having “some sort of emotional breakdown for a very long time”, adding: “But I am NOT a domestic abuser. We had an argument and an accident happened. An accident.”Images published in the Sun showing Flack’s flat covered in blood after the incident were of her own blood, she said, and were sold to the newspaper although she did not name who was responsible for leaking them.“That was something very sad and very personal,” she wrote. The reason I am talking today is because my family can’t take any more. I’ve lost my job. My home. My ability to speak.“And the truth has been taken out of my hands and used as entertainment. I can’t spend every day hidden away being told not to say or speak to anyone.”She added: “For a lot of people, being arrested for common assault is an extreme way to have some sort of spiritual awakening but for me it’s become the normal. I’ve been pressing the snooze button on many stresses in my life – for my whole life.“I’ve accepted shame and toxic opinions on my life for over 10 years and yet told myself it’s all part of my job. No complaining. The problem with brushing things under the carpet is ... they are still there and one day someone is going to lift that carpet up and all you are going to feel is shame and embarrassment.”Flack also apologised for the impact on those close to her, writing: “I’m so sorry to my family for what I have brought upon them and for what my friends have had to go through.“I’m not thinking about ‘how I’m going to get my career back’. I’m thinking about how I’m going to get mine and my family’s life back.”Flack’s mother, Chris, who revealed she was due to see her daughter on the day she was found dead, told the Eastern Daily Press: “Carrie sent me this message at the end of January but was told not to post it by advisers but she so wanted to have her little voice heard.“So many untruths were out there but this is how she felt and my family and I would like people to read her own words. Carrie was surrounded by love and friends but this was just too much for her.In reference to the post, she explained: “It was describing how she was feeling and what she had gone through – no more than that. It was not blaming anyone or pointing any fingers.”She added: “Jody, her twin sister, was there her whole life for her but this time nothing could take away the hurt of such injustice. As Carrie would say: ‘In a nasty world just be kind.’”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/845ab5d722867d942a36bb33ff2da85681aec1d8/0_125_2048_1228/master/2048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=34d372f66062aac23c9e632ee03dbd6d","title":"us chinese media propaganda state department","story":"State department told five Chinese outlets they would need approval to buy property, and must submit lists of employeesThe United States has tightened rules on Chinese state media organizations as it classified them as foreign missions, decrying what US officials described as Beijing’s growing “propaganda”.In a step likely to anger Beijing, the state department told five outlets including the Xinhua news agency and the China Global Television Network that they will need to seek approval to buy any property.They will also be required to submit lists of all employees, including the growing number of US citizens on their staffs, the state department said.The state department said it would not impose any restrictions on Chinese media’s journalistic activities inside the United States.State department officials, who said they informed the outlets of the new rules Tuesday morning, described Chinese media as increasingly a tool of the state since President Xi Jinping took office in 2013.“There is no dispute that all five of these entities are part of the (Chinese) party-state propaganda news apparatus and they take their orders directly from the top,” an official told reporters on condition of anonymity.“We all know these guys have been state-controlled forever, but that control has gotten stronger over time, and it’s far more aggressive,” he said.The official was mindful that China could take retaliatory action but said that Chinese journalists in the United States would “continue to enjoy our free and open system”.“As you know, western journalists already suffer very severe restrictions on their ability to do their jobs inside the People’s Republic of China,” he said.The other three outlets targeted under the rules are China Radio International and the distributors of the official People’s Daily and English-language China Daily.The US justice department has already pushed Chinese media outlets to register as foreign agents under separate regulations that require detailed filings of their activities.While China Daily and China Global Television Network have complied with the Foreign Agents Registration Act, lawmakers last month complained that Xinhua has not followed through and questioned the government’s enforcement powers.Such efforts are not without criticism: the Committee to Protect Journalists earlier voiced unease over the foreign agent registration, saying the US government should not determine which outlets are propaganda and noting that other governments often try to impose regulations on foreign civil society groups.Donald Trump’s administration has ramped up pressure on China in an array of areas, from raising tariffs in a trade war to sharply criticizing Beijing’s incarceration of more than one million Uighurs and other Turkic Muslims.In a strategy setting out national security priorities in December 2017, the Trump administration warned that US rivals will increasingly use “propaganda and other means to try to discredit democracy”.Inside the United States, China has increasingly invested in English-language media, hiring native speakers to produce journalism that is often professional and polished when avoiding topics of sensitivity for Beijing.A recent study by Freedom House, a US-backed research institute, found that China has sought to push through its message “sprinkled among run-of-the-mill posts about pandas, development projects and Chinese culture”.Examples include emphasizing a terrorist threat from Uighurs and repeating debunked assertions that Hong Kong’s major pro-democracy protesters were armed, the study said.China Daily’s spending in the United States has soared from $500,000 in the first half of 2009 to more than $5m in the latter half of 2019, the study said, quoting required filings.The growth has been more dramatic in the developing world, where China has offered attractive partnerships to provide content on television and radio."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/06082f6f68e015e339db679db0225fcd8e4f4b33/0_217_5760_3455/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4ee80038dff68f179535157aa7662330","title":"gezi park verdict may be political ploy of isolated ankara turkey","story":"Acquittals are welcome but not necessarily a signal of change at heart of governmentOne defendant in the Gezi park trial grimly predicted the expected results of Tuesday’s hearing would be the “funeral of civil society in Turkey”. But a surprise verdict led to applause and tears of joy as nine of the activists charged with terrorism offences for their alleged roles in organising the 2013 protests walked free from the Istanbul courthouse.The unexpected acquittals of nine of the 16 defendants – lawyers say not guilty verdicts for the seven others being tried in absentia are also expected if they return to the country – were a rare spot of good news in Turkey, where the judicial system has been hollowed out and weaponised against President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s opponents and critics.However, on Tuesday night the situation appeared to be defaulting to expectations, with the leading rights defender Osman Kavala detained on a new warrant hours after the court ordered his release – this time a charge of attempting to overthrow the constitutional order linked to the failed 2016 coup against Erdoğan’s government.Gezi itself has become a potent symbol of the troubles of modern Turkey. The peaceful demonstrations against bulldozing the rare green space in central Istanbul to build a shopping centre in 2013, which spiralled into nationwide protests, were met with a brutal crackdown. In hindsight, it was the first solid indication of Erdoğan’s increasing appetite for authoritarian measures and the scale of the democratic backsliding to come.Many of the president’s detractors had wondered on Tuesday why the court had ruled against the government in the high-profile case.The answer may not lie in Turkey, but in Syria. Turkey is increasingly bogged down in a military operation in Idlib, the last rebel-held province of its war-torn neighbour, where Ankara backs a handful of rebel groups.Russia, its major trade and defence partner, is so far failing to entertain Turkey’s efforts to reintroduce a ceasefire that would protect 3 million civilians who have nowhere left to go. Hundreds of thousands of Syrian families who have fled the regime and allied Russian bombing are camped out in freezing conditions, begging Turkish soldiers to open the closed border.In the face of indifference from Moscow, Ankara, now somewhat diplomatically isolated from its western allies, may be leveraging the fate of the Gezi 16 to once again court favour in Brussels and other western capitals.The Gezi trial has been closely watched by diplomats and human rights groups for years for clues over Turkey’s democratic trajectory. Noises from pro-government thinktanks, media and even the minister of defence, suggesting Turkey ask the EU and Nato for support in Idlib, have been growing louder in recent days.Tuesday’s ruling is a significant step towards restoring faith in the rule of law in Turkey. Yet the re-arrest of Kavala, the silence on the verdicts from government-loyal media outlets, and hundreds of other new arrests of suspects related to the failed 2016 coup, show how much more work there is to be done."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/620cf0c9f90395b0a6732b3b4c983f5efbebcb45/0_176_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c6cec6c809e2c9c5fd1dc9895dd0e08b","title":"china bars wall street journal reporters over derogatory column","story":"Three journalists told to leave within five days after paper declined to apologise for opinion pieceChina has revoked the press credentials of three journalists from the Wall Street Journal after the newspaper declined to apologise for a column that called China the “real sick man of Asia”, the foreign ministry has said.Spokesman Geng Shuang told a daily briefing on Wednesday that Beijing made several representations to the paper over the column, which China criticised as racist and denigrating its efforts to combat the coronavirus epidemic, but that the paper had failed to apologise or investigate those responsible.The deputy bureau chief, Josh Chin, and reporter Chao Deng, both Americans, and reporter Philip Wen, an Australian, have been ordered to leave the country within five days. None of the three journalists had any involvement with column or its headline, according to the Foreign Correspondents Club of China.“The action taken against the Journal correspondents is an extreme and obvious attempt by the Chinese authorities to intimidate foreign news organisations by taking retribution against their China-based correspondents,” the FCCC said in a statement, adding that a foreign correspondent had not been expelled since 1998.The FCCC said nine journalists had been effectively expelled through non-renewal of journalist visas from China since 2013.“Simultaneously revoking press credentials of three correspondents is an unprecedented form of retaliation against foreign journalists in China,” it said.“FCCC member correspondents and their colleagues in China are suffering from an increasing frequency of harassment, surveillance and intimidation from authorities. The expulsion of these three WSJ reporters is only the latest, and most alarming, measure authorities have taken.”The action comes after the US said on Tuesday it would begin treating five major Chinese state-run media entities with US operations, including Xinhua news agency, China Global Television Network and China Daily Distribution Corp, the same as foreign embassies, requiring them to register employees and US properties with the state department.Geng said China opposed the new rules and Beijing reserved the right to respond.The three Wall Street Journal reporters have reported on human rights abuses in Xinjiang. Deng has been reporting from Wuhan on China’s handling of the coronavirus while Wen previously co-authored a report on a cousin of Chinese president, Xi Jinping, whose activities are being scrutinised by Australian authorities.

The government will say it is grasping a unique opportunity to take full control of British borders and eliminate the “distortion” caused by EU freedom of movement.Among main criteria, anyone wanting to come to the UK to work must have a job offer with a salary threshold of £25,600 – though £20,480 will be acceptable in areas of skills shortage, such as nursing. Self-employed people need not apply – spelling the end of Polish plumbers or Romanian builders coming on their own initiative. Some highly skilled workers will be allowed in without a job offer.

Minette Batters, head of the NFU, said it was “ironic” the government was encouraging people to eat more fruit and veg while “making it harder for that fruit and veg to be produced in Britain”.Industry leaders have accused the government of an assault on the economy, warning of “disastrous” consequences with job losses and closures in factories and the high street.

Photograph: Charly TriballeauAFP via Getty ImagesHundreds of quarantined passengers aboard a cruise ship docked in Yokohama walked on dry land on Wednesday for the first time in two weeks, amid growing controversy about Japan’s efforts to contain the coronavirus.Two Irish citizens who were on board the quarantined Diamond Princess cruise ship have tested positive for the coronavirus.The couple are being cared for at a military hospital in Tokyo having been transferred from the ship to the hospital on February 16th.They were among six Irish citizens on board the ship.About 500 passengers are expected to leave the Diamond Princess by the end of Wednesday after an ordeal in which over 540 of the 3,711 people on board were infected the potentially fatal disease – the largest cluster outside China.Japan’s government says those released today have fulfilled local quarantine requirements after testing negative for the virus. The passengers walked through a scrum of reporters in Yokohama before boarding taxis and busses and retuning to their lives.The liner was isolated earlier this month after a former passenger tested positive for Covid-19 in Hong Kong. Critics have described it as a floating incubator. Debate about the quarantine strategy has intensified since the release on Wednesday of a video by an infectious disease specialist who got on board.Kentaro Iwata of Kobe University described the quarantine protocol on the liner as “completely chaotic,” with not a single virus specialist on board. Mr Iwata said he had 20 years of experience dealing with Ebola, Sars and other diseases but never feared infection until now.“Inside the Diamond Princess I was so scared of getting Covid-19 because there was no way to tell where the virus is – no green zone, no red zone. There was no single professional control person inside the ship,” he said.‘Dual citizenship’The Department of Health has stressed there have been no confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Ireland.Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney confirmed on Tuesday that two Irish citizens who were passengers on Diamond Princess had tested positive for the virus and are receiving treatment in hospital in Japan.“These citizens share dual citizenship with another EU member state and are not normally resident in Ireland,” Mr Coveney said in a statement on Tuesday.To date, with the assistance of the UK and other EU partners, six Irish citizens have been repatriated from Wuhan City in China, where the virus originated. Three were evacuated on January 31st, and three were evacuated on February 9th.Irish citizens who had been on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which is currently docked off Yokahama, included a married couple from Co Meath and a couple with dual Irish-German nationality.“We are also in close contact with those who remain in quarantine on the ship. We are working with our EU partners and other like-minded countries regarding options for their return,” Mr Coveney said.In Dublin, the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) met on Tuesday to discuss plans for how health authorities would respond to any confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Ireland.Suspected casesThere have been 78 suspected cases of Covid-19 tested in Ireland to date, but no positive cases, health officials confirmed on Tuesday.In a statement after the NPHET meeting, Dr Tony Holohan, Department of Health chief medical officer, said officials “are continuing to monitor the situation globally”.“While the overwhelming majority of cases to date have been reported in China, we continue to advance preparedness plans here in Ireland,” he said.“Hospitals have designated leads for Covid-19 preparedness, and isolation response requirements have been identified and are in place in order to deal appropriately with any suspected cases,” Dr Holohan said.Two Irish citizens who were passengers on the Westerdam, a cruise ship which has had one confirmed case of Covid-19, which had docked off Cambodia, have returned to Ireland and entered self-imposed isolation for potential coronavirus.Passengers were allowed to disembark from the ship, but an American citizen later tested positive for the virus, sparking concerns about potential exposure to the virus spreading in other countries from passengers returning home.The death toll from the virus in mainland China rose by just under 100 on Tuesday to 1,868 people. There have been nine confirmed cases of the virus in the UK from nearly 5,000 people tested."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Wayne Whelan\u0026rsquos body found in burning car in Lucan last NovemberPublic encouraged to participate in annual two-week festival celebrating Irish languageTwo Irish citizens who tested positive for virus are in Tokyo military hospitalFour young men left with non-life threatening injuries after incident near ButtevantMet \u0026Eacuteireann issues status yellow rainfall warning for nine countiesMental health watchdog highlights deficiency in number of acute beds for older patientsBeleaguered MV Alta on rocks in Ballycotton not the first mysterious ship to haunt our shoresPrincipal venue for classical concerts in Republic records a loss in excess of \u0026euro41,000Dr Mike Ryan says the WHO is tackling over 30 \u0026lsquoevents\u0026rsquo worldwide but the talk is all about Covid-19Report finds lack of action in tackling climate change threatens \u0026lsquoevery child\u0026rsquos future\u0026rsquoAppointee to succeed Taoiseach\u0026rsquos nominee Frank Feighan, who won D\u0026aacuteil seatSalvage expert says delay in removing ship from Cork coast will increase pollution riskDepartment of Justice confirms contract signed for facility to begin operating in MarchEdward Bryan pleaded guilty to indecently assaulting boy at Cork\u0026rsquos North Monastery in 1981Michael Toner (51) grabbed teen by private parts while she was in Penney\u0026rsquos store with motherStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4177834.1582096911!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"a russian cruiser with cannibal rats what other ghost ships could be out there","story":"A ghost ship was washed up onto the rocks off east Cork by Storm Dennis on Sunday, after drifting across the Atlantic over the last year. Video: Irish Coast Guard\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Russian liner Lyubov Orlova: ‘Somewhere in the vast expanses of the North Atlantic an empty Russian cruise ship has been lost and if it’s still afloat, its next port of call may be the coast of Ireland.’The running aground of “ghost ship” MV Alta, on rocks near Ballycotton in east Cork on Sunday, was not the first time such a derelict vessel has haunted our shores.In 2014 there were reports that the abandoned former Soviet cruise liner Lyubov Orlova was off the Irish coast bringing with it ominous headlines warning of “cannibal rats” aboard a “ghost ship” heading our way.The Irish Coast Guard on Tuesday said it suspects the liner has probably sunk but is “still vigilant” in relation to it. The 4,200-tonne ship was once the glittering choice of Soviet holidaymakers and later wealthy Russians touring the Artic and Antarctic.It is one of a number of ‘ghost ships’, unmanned but still afloat at last sighting, the whereabouts of which are now unknown.The 100m long Lyubov Orlova was seen adrift off the coast of Newfoundland in February 2013. The ship had been sold for scrap and taken under tow from St John’s, heading for the Dominican Republic. But less than a day into the journey the tow line broke and the ship drifted into international waters.As National Geographic put it in March 2014, “somewhere in the vast expanses of the North Atlantic an empty Russian cruise ship has been lost and if it’s still afloat, its next port of call may be the coast of Ireland”.Finding such a ship in the ocean is\u0026nbspnot easy. The International Maritime Organisation’s International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea requires international ships, with 300 or more gross tonnage and all passenger ships, to carry beacons which function as automatic identification systems (AIS).Historical AIS data is also used for analysing the vessels movements on a global scale. In the case of the Lyubov Orlova, it would probably have its transponders off because power ran out. In addition, satellite recorders are not able to easily find a ship in the vast Atlantic unless they know a precise area in which to look.In its efforts to find the cruise ship the Irish Coast Guard combined AIS tracking with radar allowing it to “see” the ghosts . First, radar satellites scanned vast areas of the sea surface, where vessels showed up as blips as on a radar screen. These were then cross-referenced with AIS satellite maps, which showed the positions of all the active ships. In theory, the ghost ship would be the only radar blip not broadcasting a signal. During efforts to find the Russian cruiser an illegal fishing vessel near Scotland which had its transponder turned off\u0026nbspwas discovered.But all attempts to locate the MV Lyubov Orlova by the Irish Coast Guard proved unsuccessful.In 2016 another unmanned vessel washed up on Irish shores. In November of that year a makeshift solar-powered houseboat landed on a beach in Co Mayo after drifting across the Atlantic from Canada. Authorities said the owner of the 20ft timber and polystyrene boat was intending to sail on the “floating caravan”, but was talked out of it before it broke loose from its mooring in Newfoundland. It turned out to have been built by Rick Small, a Canadian environmentalist who had given the boat away and had no idea how it ended up crossing the ocean unmanned.In December 2000 a Spanish boat, Zorro Zaurre, drifted 140 miles to the southwest Irish coast before foundering on rocks yards from where its sister ship, Nuestra Senora de Gardotza, sank 10 years earlier at Roancarrig lighthouse in Bantry Bay, Co Cork. The 13 crew members had been airlifted a month earlier after the vessel sprang a leak.Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4177886.1582063628!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"cash strapped national concert hall told to reflect on music tastes","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe NCH receives approximately €2.8m in State funding per year.

American pop artist Laurie Anderson, German singer Ute Lemper and novelist Roddy Doyle are among some of the artists featuring on the upcoming programme, it said.The Irish Chamber Orchestra said a move away from the concert hall’s traditional programming would be “very disappointing news” and a “significant loss” to the sector . “The Irish Chamber Orchestra has struggled to find a permanent performance space in Dublin that works acoustically and have also found it difficult to secure dates in the concert hall over the past number of years,” a spokeswoman said.Allin Gray, director of the Irish Association of Youth Orchestras and a board member of the European Orchestra Federation, said it is important the NCH continues in its remit of cultural institution. “As part of a movement that is growing participation in classical and orchestral music, we feel spaces should be preserved for all types of music so that we have a full variety of musical expression in Ireland,” Mr Gray said.‘Classical music’“The NCH was so called as a cultural institution rather than a commercial enterprise and we strongly feel it should continue to pursue its remit as such.”He added: “That doesn’t just mean classical music or art music or whatever other labels we might use, but it does mean that it’s not just a space available to the highest bidder.”Evonne Ferguson, director of the Contemporary Music Centre, welcomed this idea, adding that music by composers from Ireland is “erse, vibrant and internationally recognised”.NCH’s financial losses for 2019 were considerably lower than estimated in the months leading up to year-end. In November, the financial deficit was expected to be €91,045 by year-end, down from an almost €200,000 deficit that was forecasted in May, board meeting minutes state.A spokeswoman for the NCH said the losses were minimised further due to strong sales in the last quarter of the year, including the hosting of 45 main auditorium concerts in December alone.

File photograph: The  In attempts to explain the causes of the unprecedented result of the general election, some commentators have suggested the outcome was built on the foundations of the referendums on same-sex marriage and the eighth amendment.It has been argued by some that young voters – feeling energised by the social change delivered through those campaigns – have become increasingly politicised and more eager to drive further change through the ballot box.This is an appealing narrative to explain what happened in our most recent election. However, it is fundamentally flawed. Young people are no more politically engaged now than they were previously.The increased turnout for the eighth amendment referendum was a temporary phenomenon. Turnout levels are now back to where they were at the time of the 2016 general election.Using data gathered through the exit polls conducted for the 2016 and 2020 general elections, as well as for the referendum that led to the repeal of the eighth in 2018, it is possible to understand the profile of voters who turned out on each occasion.Analysis of the data shows that 18- to 24-year-olds were more likely to vote in the referendum to repeal the eighth. Voter turnout among women aged 18 to 24 increased by 94 per cent for that referendum compared to the 2016 election.However, the exit poll for this month’s election suggests this may have been a temporary phenomenon and that the age profile of voters reverted back to where it was in 2016.The Oxford Dictionary’sword of the year in 2017 – youthquake – has been widely used over the past 10 days. This is defined as “a significant cultural, political, or social change arising from the actions or influence of young people”. It has been associated with a number of elections in various countries in recent years suggesting that young voters have mobilised in unprecedented numbers to support opposition parties.However, successful political campaigns are built upon appealing to those most likely to turn out and vote. Not only are there are more people in Ireland aged 50 and older than there are aged between 18 and 34, but also older voters are more likely to turn out on election day. For every vote cast by those aged under 35, there are roughly two votes cast by those aged 50 and older.It is only when this older group is convinced by a particular argument that electoral success will follow. This was the case in the eighth amendment referendum, when those aged over 50 voted as a whole in favour of repeal.It was also the case in the recent general election, with over 50s voting for change.Revealing exit poll dataBetween 2016 and this year, Sinn Féin saw an increase in vote share across all age groups, driving the number of first preference votes it received up by more than 240,000 – from 295,319 to 535,573.The exit poll finds that Sinn Féin’s highest vote share was among those aged under 35, with 32 per cent casting their first preference vote for the party (up from 21 per cent in 2016).As this age group represents roughly a third of all voters, extrapolating the exit poll data suggests that those aged under 35 accounted for less than 65,000 of the additional votes Sinn Féin received on February 8th.In contrast, while the party received a lower share of votes (18 per cent) among those aged 50 or older, this is a much larger group of voters and accounted for half of the additional 240,000 votes.It is only through motivating a sizeable proportion of voters aged 50 and older to vote for the party that Sinn Féin achieved the unprecedented success seen in this election.In seeking explanations for the recent political shift it is necessary to take a wider focus than looking solely at young voters and the issues that influenced their vote. The result of this election was less of a “youthquake”, but more the manifestation of a desire for change across the electorate as a whole.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail Full results and counts for the 39 election constituencies.

Another group of Independents, organised by Marian Harkin and Michael Fitzmaurice, is meeting to form a technical group to get greater Dáil speaking time. It is not yet known if this group will then engage in government talks. These two groups are in addition to Independents 4Change Deputies. Another Independent, Roscommon’s Denis Naughten, is understood to be considering standing for ceann comhairle of the Dáil. It is expected that no one will be elected taoiseach by the Dáil on Thursday, with Leo Varadkar, Mary Lou McDonald, Micheál Martin and Eamon Ryan putting their names forward.One member of the Fianna Fáil frontbench suggested that Fine Gael could help a Fianna Fáil-led minority government pass budgets, but retain the right to vote as it pleased on Dáil motions of confidence. Galway East TD Anne Rabbitte said: “It is important that Fianna Fáil would secure the support of the Greens, Labour and the Soc Dems, and then come to the conversation with Fine Gael seeking support on budgetary matters. “Not on confidence matters – budgetary matters. Any Ministers doing their jobs, there’ll be confidence in them.”The Fianna Fáil parliamentary party is scheduled to meet in Leinster House on Wednesday evening although no agenda for the meeting has been circulated in advance. TDs speculated that party leader Micheál Martin may appoint his negotiating team for government formation talks at the meeting, Green Party talks On Tuesday, Green Party leader Eamon Ryan said coalition formation talks should take weeks not months, as his deputy leader Catherine Martin called on other parties to “woman up” and get on with the process.Mr Ryan, a TD for Dublin Bay South, said it would take time to negotiate a programme for government to get the level of detail needed. But he said: “It’s several weeks, it’s not days but it shouldn’t be months because there is a job to do and we should get on with it.”The Green Party is in contact with Sinn Féin about setting up a first meeting to discuss their policy priorities but Mr Ryan acknowledged that it would be difficult to get a stable left-wing government in place. The meeting is expected to happen later in the week. “The reality is when you look at the numbers it’s hard to see how you get a stable government,” Mr Ryan said.Sinn Féin expects to further meetings on potential government formation over the coming days with the Green Party, Labour, People Before Profit, Independents4Change and others. The Sinn Féin negotiating team – TDs Pearse Doherty, Louise O’Reilly, Eoin Ó Broin and Matt Carthy - met with Martin Fraser, the secretary general of the Government in Government Buildings.It is normal for senior civil servants to make themselves available and information available to parties attempting to form a government. “We want to discuss how those proposals can be transformed into a programme for government for change,” Mr Doherty said on his way into the meeting. “This is about making sure that we have the information available to us, to advance those discussions as we now get into the policy detail of compatibility or areas where there may be no compatibility as we begin those discussions. So this is very much Sinn Féin intensifying the talks over the last number of days.”He said the meetings would assess what change is “deliverable and deliverable in the timeframe that we want it delivered”.

Last November, Ms Cronin replied to an anonymous Twitter account which suggested “loads of judges are paedophiles” by saying: “Wouldn’t surprise me.”She has also criticised the fluoridation of drinking water in Ireland as “poisoning our water”.Earlier this week, the Sunday Times highlighted how Ms Cronin accused the Israeli secret service, Mossad, of “sinister” interference in the UK general election to ensure the defeat of Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, which she subsequently described as “throwaway remarks”.Ms Cronin, who was a Sinn Féin councillor between 2014 and 2019 before losing her seat on Kildare County Council in last year’s local elections, said she took the decision to block access to her account because of abuse directed at her following further publicity about her past tweets.“I received a lot of abusive comments from Israel, the US and UK and some death threats,” Ms Cronin said.In a statement, the TD said she “unreservedly and wholeheartedly” apologised to people she had offended because of “these glib, off-the-cuff tweets that I sent in the past”.“I never intended to cause hurt or distress to anyone. I will assist and work with everybody, without qualification,” Ms Cronin said.She added: “I abhor racism and bigotry of any shade. My character and my politics are Republican and egalitarian.”The TD pointed out that most of the controversial tweets dated from before she joined Sinn Féin in 2013 and entered politics, while some recent ones between losing her council seat and being elected a TD were made as “a private citizen”.On Tuesday night, Sinn Féin sought to distance itself from Ms Cronin’s comments claiming the tweets did not represent the views of the party.A Sinn Féin spokesman said the party understood that Ms Cronin had apologised unreservedly for her remarks. “That is the right thing to do,” he added.On Tuesday night, a spokeswoman for the Israeli embassy in Dublin described the language and ideas expressed by Ms Cronin as “shocking especially when coming from an elected TD”.“They can only remind us of humanity’s darkest hours. It is not only Sinn Féin or the people of Ireland that should be deeply concerned but also any decent human being,” the spokeswoman said.In other tweets seen by the , Ms Cronin described Mr Varadkar in 2017 as “nothing more than a troll”, a “nonchalant shell” and “right-wing Tory boy”.In January 2019 she claimed anyone who did not want a united Ireland was “traitorous”.In her Facebook account which remains active, Ms Cronin was also critical during the recent General Election campaign about media coverage and claimed Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael were plotting with their “media luvvies” to rig the election.In particular, she accused RTÉ of trying to rig the election for Fianna Fáil by the station’s original decision not to include the Sinn Féin president Mary Lou McDonald in the TV debate between Mr Varadkar and Mr Martin. Ms McDonald took part in the debate when it aired. In 2018, Ms Cronin said Michael D Higgins as president had been “a huge disappointment.” Full results and counts for the 39 election constituencies.

Photograph Nick Bradshaw A sense of dissatisfaction about the state of public services and the cost of living drove voters of all age groups to “vote for change” in the general election, political campaigners have said.Voters over the age of 50 led that change and accounted for a large portion of the extra first preference votes received by parties like Sinn Féin, challenging the idea that there was a “youthquake” in this month’s general election.Sinn Féin TD Eoin Ó Broin said that the party increased its vote share in all demographics and age groups but that he particularly noted an increase in support among over 50s.“Our vote increased everywhere but the exit poll data tallies with the experiences that I had on the canvass trail,” he said. “If we take, for example, Palmerstown in Dublin. In 2016, I would have received 14 per cent of the vote there as a general election candidate and the support would have been among younger families.“This time around we had people in their 50s who had adult children living back home with them or were aware that their grandchildren were back living with their mam and dad. There was a growing awareness among over 50s of how the housing crisis was affecting their extended families.”Mr Ó Broin said over 50s were “disproportionately affected by the crises in the health system” and he believes this was a factor in them changing their vote.Labour’s director of elections for the campaign Ivana Bacik said the vote for change was driven “by all groups”.“Among all age groups there was a dissatisfaction that emerged during the campaign that I don’t think any party foresaw, not Fine Gael and not even Sinn Féin. It was evident in terms of the issues raised by different demographics,” she said.‘Harrowing stories’“I canvassed with wide range of our candidates across different environments and we were hearing from all sides about that discontentment with public services. Healthcare emerged as key issues for all ages, and there were harrowing stories even among younger people.”Ms Bacik said other issues that drove a desire for change among those in the older age groups were housing, childcare and a mooted increase in the qualifying age for the State pension. “These two issues came up on every canvass,” she said.Ms Bacik also said that before the election, many commentators predicted climate action would engage and influence younger voters but that “this did not materialise to the extent that we had all anticipated.”“It was raised on doors many times by all ages but it didn’t seem to be driving change,” she said.There was also a narrative that voters who were politicised by the referendums on same-sex marriage and repealing the ban on abortion would play a big role in shaping the outcome of the election.Ms Bacik said that there was “no doubt” that younger voters were politicised during those campaigns and she believes it did have a “direct and indirect impact” on the election result.“I was one of the organisers for Together for Yes and the number of people we were getting out to canvass who had never canvassed before was phenomenal,” she said.Ms Bacik added that there were campaigns to identify anti-abortion candidates and noted the case of Green Party candidate in Dublin Bay North David Healy, who lost out on a seat after being widely tipped for election.During the campaign he was questioned on how he voted in the referendum to repeal the Eighth Amendment and stated that he voted no.Mr Healy said the issue did come up on the doorsteps.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail Full results and counts for the 39 election constituencies.

It was set up by Theresa May on the back of a series of such allegations, many of which have since proved to be without foundation.The  understands that, behind the scenes, the Liberal Democrats have already put in motion plans to suspend and then expel Lord Steel, who is now 81, when IICSA publishes its report on February 25.Close colleagues including former Liberal Democrat leader Lord Campbell are considering quitting if he is expelled.A friend of Lord Steel, who is currently abroad, said: This is really low-hanging fruit for IICSA. There is no allegation about Lord Steel\u0027s personal behaviour, but the way in which he dealt with some publicity about Smith which he raised with him 40 years ago.There is a real fear IICSA will use this as a small trophy and the Liberal Democrats will seize upon any criticism to expel him. We think IICSA will scapegoat him on the basis he is the only name they have got.The inquiry, which has already cost the taxpayer £150 million, will also criticise Lord Steel for his decision to recommend Smith for a knighthood.Smith, who died in 2010, is accused of sexually abusing scores of boys. He was never charged in his lifetime despite a number of police investigations.IICSA warned Lord Steel that he faces criticism in a so-called Maxwellisation letter – which is required in public inquiries – that was sent last year.The report is understood, according to sources close to the inquiry, to be highly critical of his failure to notify authorities after an admission by Smith that claims about him published in Private Eye magazine were true.Under questioning, Lord Steel told IICSA of a conversation he had with Smith in 1979, in which the then MP for Rochdale admitted his behaviour was investigated a decade earlier.The Private Eye article accused Smith of king boys and conducting intimate medical examinations at a Rochdale hostel, but he had insisted that police took no further action.Lord Steel told IICSA last March that he assumed Smith had actually committed the offences, but had mentioned his confession to no-one.But the peer\u0027s supporters point out that, at the time of the abuse in the 1960s, Smith was a Labour councillor in Rochdale and had already been investigated by police and prosecutors with no further action taken.  They add that the conversation with Smith took place at an informal dinner in the Commons at which Lord Steel raised the Private Eye articles with him. But they insist he did not discuss their content in any detail.Friends of Lord Steel also say it is deeply unfair to criticise him for recommending Smith for a knighthood in 1988, when the honours committee had the power to instigate a full investigation but still approved it.A source close to IICSA told The  that the 200-page Westminster report will include a section on Steel, adding: There\u0027s a bit on him, don\u0027t worry. The source insisted Lord Steel would be one focus in a wide-ranging report.IICSA has failed to find any evidence of a widespread paedophile ring since being set up by Mrs May in 2014. She had faced fierce political pressure to do so, including a claim by Labour\u0027s Tom Watson that such a VIP paedophile ring existed.A series of false allegations by fantasists have since been exposed, including claims made by Carl Beech that he was abused by Sir Edward Heath, Lord Brittan and Field Marshal Lord Bramall among others.Beech, himself a  convicted paedophile, was subsequently jailed for perverting the course of justice. Other claims, including allegations that politicians and celebrities had abused boys at a guest house in south London, were also found to have been without foundation.Following his evidence to IICSA, Lord Steel was briefly suspended from the Liberal Democrats but then reinstated after an internal inquiry. Willie Rennie, the Scottish Lib Dem leader, said last year that Lord Steel had been cleared after clarifying that Smith did not confess to any criminality, which is why he took no further action at the time.Lord Steel said at the time of his original suspension that he believed in the highest standards of safeguarding for young and vulnerable people and complained that some of his responses at IICSA have been erroneously reported and taken out of context.He said the allegations against him had caused me great personal distress, adding that his hearing had been impaired at the time and he was confused by some of the questioning.Lord Steel, who was unavailable for comment on Tuesday, is understood to be travelling in Africa. He is not due to return to the UK until February 26, a day after IICSA publishes its Westminster report.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"caroline flack inquest opens","story":"Caroline Flack hanged herself at home, an inquest into her death has disclosed. Coroner\u0027s officer Sandra Polson said police were driving through Northwold Road, Stoke Newington, on Saturday February 15 when they were flagged down. Officers followed informants into Flack\u0027s home and found her lying on her back, she had apparently been found hanging, the hearing at Poplar Coroner\u0027s Court in east London was told. Police attempted resuscitation, which was then continued by paramedics, but she was pronounced dead at the scene.Her body was identified by her sister, Jody Flack.

That’s a fairly rapid u-turn, given that the global campaign was only launched last year.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesPerhaps BP has realised the futility of spending large sums highlighting the tiny part of its business that generates renewable energy when the company remains synonymous with fossil fuels.\u0026nbspAdverts on billboards, newspapers and television in the UK, US and Europe as well as on social media and online\u0026nbsppictured\u0026nbspgreen fields and windmills alongside phrases like, “working to make energy cleaner”. The ads missed out the fact that\u0026nbsp96 per cent of BP’s capital expenditure is on oil and gas.Thanks in part to the efforts of groups like environmental lawyers ClientEarth which launched a complaint against over the campaign, the company has been held to account.Two decades – and billions of barrels of oil – since BP had the chutzpah to relaunch itself as “beyond petroleum”, people have seen through the facade.“In future, any corporate advertising will be to push for progressive climate policy communicate our net zero ambition invite ideas or build collaboration,” BP said.This statement, unlike the target to go carbon neutral by 2050, can be scrutinised immediately and it will be. I will be closely watching BP’s public statements on climate change this year, as well as its advertising and involvement with groups like the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures, to check that they measure up.We can all play a part in this too.

ClientEarth’s suggestion that fossil fuel adverts should be banned unless they have a tobacco-style health warning need to be\u0026nbspconsidered.A fossil fuel company portraying itself as good for the climate is no less ridiculous, or dangerous, than the tobacco companies that in the 1950s pushed cigarettes with recommendations from friendly-looking doctors.Companies that create misleading adverts about climate change need to face the prospect of fines, not just damage to their\u0026nbspreputation. Currently the ASA, is self-funded by advertisers themselves and can only ban particular promotions, often months after they’ve\u0026nbspgone out.While advertising is an important way that large greenhouse gas emitters can use their financial clout to shift the debate in their favour, a more significant front on the climate change\u0026nbspinformation war\u0026nbspis political lobbying.Here too, BP has laid down a marker by which it can be judged not in 10 years or 20 years, but almost immediately.\u0026nbspThe company laid out a less aggressive approach to lobbying, stating that it would “set new expectations” for its relationships with oil industry trade associations. Where those influential groups are pushing for policies that don’t align with BP’s new approach, it will leave.Created with Sketch.Youth Strike for Climate: London protest in photos Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Basically, this is an admission that BP’s net-zero ambition simply has no credibility if the company remains a member of powerful lobby groups like the American Petroleum Institute which has for decades funded climate change denial in a successful effort to cast doubt on the scientific consensus. BP either has to fundamentally change the API or leave it.The impact of a big oil industry player changing tack could be considerable but action needs to follow words. I’ll also be scrutinising other large oil industry firms about whether they will follow BP in “advocating for policies that support net zero, including carbon pricing”.Fossil fuel lobbyists have vast budgets that allow\u0026nbspthem\u0026nbspto shift public policy and discussion significantly towards the industry’s own interests over and above those of everyone else.In any case, oil companies\u0026nbsplike formerly state-owned BP have frequently been pushing on open doors in the corridors of power. Seen by\u0026nbsppoliticians\u0026nbspto be of strategic national importance, oil majors have provided\u0026nbspthe vital commodity that fuels economic growth and\u0026nbspdelivers votes.It’s fair to say the oil majors have frequently enjoyed a cosy relationship with governments sympathetic to their aims.\u0026nbspVast budgets to fund misinformation and dodgy science have been key to prolonging the life of fossil fuel industry decades after oil companies knew climate change was dangerous and man-made.\u0026nbspClimate campaigners, who have enjoyed less privileged access to political decision-makers, have therefore been fighting a hugely asymmetric battle but one which they may now finally be starting to win.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Words by Stacey Smith213 ‘Rachel Ama’s Vegan Eats: Tasty plant-based recipes for every day’ by Rachel Ama. Published by Ebury Press: £12.87, AmazonSince launching her vegan YouTube channel in 2017, Rachel has gained a heap of hungry followers who lap up her simple, delicious recipes (and the dance moves that go along with them). Dishes are often one-pot, can be prepped ahead, and most include a song recommendation so you can dance along as you cook. Within these pages, you’ll find plenty of meals inspired by Ama’s Caribbean and West African roots – from crispy jerk barbecue tacos or ackee “saltfish” with dumplings to peanut stew. Although this is really a celebration of all cultures – and with vegan takes on everything from Thai green curry to creamy cashew and vegetable no-pasta lasagne, we’re pretty confident you’ll find your favourite comfort dish has been given a plant-based makeover. With most ingredients easy to obtain and meals quick to put together, this is modern cooking, for the meat-shunning millennial. 313 ‘BOSH! Healthy Vegan’ by Henry Firth \u0026amp Ian Theasby. Published by HQ: £10.87, AmazonWorking with a registered dietician to ensure recipes follow trusted NHS guidelines, the BOSH! boys (aka, Henry and Ian) have bought us their healthiest cookbook to date. Recognising that just because a plate of food is vegan, that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s healthy (vegan junk food certainly exists!), this is a collection of 80 new recipes showcasing their flavoursome vegan food with a healthier focus. Along with advice on sleep, movement and relaxing, there’s guidance on ensuring you get all the nutrients you need. And although the boys insist this isn’t a diet book, you’ll find recipes to help you reduce fat, build muscle and generally be a bit healthier. So whether you’re looking to up your protein intake (try the ultimate veg tacos), reduce your sugar intake with a summer-berry granola bowl or keep your calorie intake to under 500 per portion with puttanesca potato stew, you should be left feeling suitably inspired to kick start the new year.413 ‘Happy Vegan: Easy plant-based recipes to make the whole family happy’ by Fearne Cotton. Published by Seven Dials: £13.46, AmazonDespite Fearne Cotton not being a fully-fledged vegan herself (or perhaps because), this book got rave reviews from our panel, with both flexitarians, meat-eaters and vegans alike. Recipes are approachable, inexpensive and perfect for the whole family, so we can see ourselves working through them all in time. The broccoli katsu curry was a particular favourite and surprisingly easy to make and for tea time we’ll be trying our hand at her date and almond cake with caramel sauce which uses white miso paste and coconut cream to great effect.513 ‘Vegan One Pound Meals: Delicious budget-friendly plant-based recipes all for £1 per person’ by Miguel Barclay. Published by Headline Home: £10.75, AmazonIf ever there’s a time we feel the pinch, it’s January, with the festivities of Christmas long behind us but the credit card still to pay. Thankfully eating a plant-based diet could be the answer and in this book, you’ll find over 85 recipes all coming in at a frankly unbelievable £1 a portion. Our concerns that we’d be living off of beans on toast were quickly alleviated as we tucked into black bean meatballs and sticky aubergine bao. Full-flavoured, quick and easy, we couldn’t really ask for more.613 ‘Incredible Plant-Based Desserts: Colorful Vegan Cakes, Cookies, Tarts, and other Epic Delights’ by Anthea Cheng. Published by Quarry Books: £11.89, AmazonCalling all sweet-tooths! This collection of recipes from Australian blogger Anthea Cheng is celebratory food for the keen baker. You certainly couldn’t call dried rainbow pear slices convenient, quick or easy to make, however the impact they have when used to decorate her chai cake is truly show-stopping. If that all sounds a little intimidating, we found the Snack Time chapter much more manageable, with the likes of bliss balls, chocolate cups and cookies vying for attention, as well as Instagrammable breakfast bowls, beautifully presented with nut butters, granola and oats.713 ‘Dirty Vegan Another Bite’ by Matt Pritchard, published by Octopus Books: £20, Octopus BooksAfter 10 years of hard partying finally caught up with him, Matt decided to switch from the crazy pranks of MTV’s Dirty Sanchez to fitness – and is now a completely vegan endurance athlete. Believing a natural diet is key, Matt’s second cookbook is brimming with recipes full of veggies and largely focuses on un-processed ingredients (keeping the vegan cheese or meat-substitutes to a minimum). Some of Pritchard’s favourites include roasting tin laksa, sticky tofu bao buns and rhubarb and custard doughnuts. If you’re yet to convince your pal\u0027s that veganism is the way forward, we reckon the Dinner with Mates chapter will convert a few of them, with all the recipes you need to create a Mexican feast, a perfect picnic, a banging BBQ or a cracking Christmas spread. All in all we found recipes really varied, with us ear-marking nearly all of them to try at once.813 ‘5 Ingredient Vegan’ by Katy Beskow. Published by Quadrille: £12.08, AmazonLet’s face it, at the end of a long day the last thing any of us want to be doing – whether we’re following a plant-based diet or not – is trying to track down long lists of hard to find ingredients. This is the fourth book from the award-winning cook, writer and cookery tutor Katy Beskow and follows a similar simplified format, with each recipe requiring just five ingredients. Chapters include soups, lunches suppers, sweets and basics, with recipes beautifully laid out and gorgeous photography accompanying each one. Far from being basic, we were amazed to see we could create a beautiful Mediterranean briam (a layered courgette, potato and red onion bake from Greece) which was as delicious hot with crusty bread as it was cold for lunch the next day.913 ‘Zaika: Vegan recipes from India’ by Romy Gill. Published by Seven Dials : £10, AmazonGrowing up in a small town in West Bengal, India, very few people, including Romy Gill’s own family, ate meat regularly. It’s this home-cooked vegan food of her childhood that the chef and food writer wanted to share with us through her debut cookbook Zaika – meaning taste, or flavour. There’s an entire section dedicated to bread, including gram flour turmeric pancakes which are perfect with chutneys, a variety of rotis and parathas and light naan bread with nigella seeds. The Light \u0026amp Breezy chapter is all about showcasing the freshest ingredients – think watermelon and mint salad while the Warming the Heart chapter is where you’ll find hearty comfort food such as spicy red lentil dahl. The section we most fell for though was Labours of Love for when you’ve got time to really get lost in the kitchen – rich, creamy and so warming, we recommend the Baingan masala with baby aubergines, dill and coconut.1013 ‘Rebel Recipes: Maximum flavour, minimum fuss: the ultimate in vegan food’ by Niki Webster. Published by Bloomsbury: £18, AmazonThe debut book from award-winning blogger and food consultant Nikki Webster shares the same ethos as her blog Rebel Recipes – that healthy food needn’t be boring or lacking in flavour. Taking inspiration from around the globe, you could never accuse these recipes of being dull. If only we could start every day with creamy spiced coconut porridge and sticky sesame banana! Instead of relying on stale vegan ingredients and recipes – this is new-school vegan cuisine for those seeking full flavours. Although despite this, recipes were easy to follow and largely uncomplicated – with lots of spicy curries, pulses, flatbreads, salads, dips and pickles making an appearance. With mouth-watering photography throughout, the Can’t Believe It’s Vegan Desserts chapter is a particular highlight, with the likes of chocolate ganache tart, easy espresso martini pots and lemon curd and thyme tart. 1113 ‘Green: Veggie and vegan meals for no-fuss weeks and relaxed weekends’ by Elly Pear (Curshen). Published by Ebury Press: £14.99, AmazonWhile this title isn’t 100 per cent vegan, half of the book is made up of plant-based recipes so we felt it was still well worth including. Acknowledging that most of us have more time to experiment in the kitchen at the weekend yet need dinner on the table pronto mid-week, Elly Pear’s book separates dishes accordingly. We’re very keen to incorporate more Sunday night batch-cooking into our weekly routine, in order to eat better later in the week and with tray bakes, one-pot wonders and freeze-able options, this will keep us suitably inspired.1213 ‘Vegan (ish): 100 simple, budget recipes that don\u0027t cost the earth’ by Jack Monroe. Published by Bluebird: £10.66, AmazonDon’t be fooled by the title, every one of the 100 recipes within this book is completely vegan. The “ish” comes from Jack Monroe’s belief that if we were all to incorporate a few more plant-based meals into our diet each week, we’d be better off both environmentally and financially. So you needn’t be a full-time vegan to appreciate the practical, inexpensive solutions within this book. Although perhaps not the sexiest food chapter to ever be written – the whole section on sandwiches was inherently helpful for midweek meal inspiration (especially when you consider the “standard” fillings of cheese, ham, tuna, etc obviously aren’t vegan). In true Jack Monroe style, we loved the no-nonsense, easy to follow recipes and believe we’ll turn to this cookbook on a regular basis. 1313 ‘7 Day Vegan Challenge’ by Bettina Campolucci-Bordi. Published by Hardie Grant: £9.72, WorderyIf you’re tempted to give this vegan thing a whirl but you really don’t know where to start, the 7 Day Vegan Challenge is here to help. There are three menu plans to choose from complete with shopping lists: The Easy Peasy Way (quick meals for those that don’t mind repeating some dishes), For the Planners (which requires a Sunday night batch-cooking session) and Fast \u0026amp Fresh (quick and simple recipes). So a typical weekday might look like, banoffee oats for breakfast, a convincing vegan take on the classic BLT sandwich for lunch and creamy satay noodles with salt and pepper fried tofu for tea.Veganuary becomes bigger every year, but it needn\u0027t be just for Janaury as these cookbooks make it easy and accessible.

People seem genuinely interested in the challenge I’ve set myself\u0026nbsp– but I’ve quickly learnt\u0026nbspthat while they initially want to listen to what I have to say, it doesn’t last very long.I can spot the exact moment where people switch off –\u0026nbspusually when I mention what my favourite type of tofu is or the perils of trying to make jackfruit taste like anything other than cardboard. It isn’t upsetting, but it’s a moment of realisation. It’s like going into work first thing on a Monday morning and asking someone how their weekend was you’re really just\u0026nbspdoing it out of politeness – let’s be honest, you don’t really care.One of the biggest worries I had about going vegan was that I would become the annoying person everyone has to accommodate for: you’re going to a restaurant, do they have vegan options? Nope, can’t go there.I’d like to think I’m quite a self-aware person. I know when I’m being annoying, or when people feel a certain type of way towards me.But whether I like it or not – and whether my friends, work colleagues or the people around me do too – turning vegan is (sadly) the most interesting thing about my life right now. It’s the biggest change to my life for as long as I can remember. The dramatics of this might seem high so read with a pinch of salt and don’t take it too seriously.Here’s my sub-pledge: I’m going to try and keep my conversations about veganism short and sweet. People are interested in what you have to say but not for too long.\u0026nbspHow do you know if someone is a vegan? Don’t worry, we’ll tell you.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He stunned Michael van Gerwen to clinch his first title 7-3Surfers at Tynemouth on the north east coastAn analysis by The Independent has found that tens of thousands of students at more than a third of the universities facing walkouts have launched petitions calling for refunds for lost teaching time.But Alistair Fitt, vice-chancellor of Oxford Brookes University and a member of the Employers Pensions Forum for Higher Education, has said student experience could be hit in the long-term if they back down.\u0026nbspMembers’ contributions to the pensions scheme have increased to 9.6 per cent of salary, up from 8 per cent last April, and the UCU says employers should make up all of the contribution increases.Professor Fitt said: “While it is true that some employers could pay more, most cannot. They would be facing a significant impact on the wider university environment, with funding potentially being erted from teaching and research projects alike.\u0026nbsp“It would also have a big impact on the student experience, such as support facilities and class sizes, and there could even be a future impact on jobs.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The reason staff are walking out and education is being disrupted from Thursday is because universities have failed to move the conversation forward and address the concerns of staff.“UCU members are tired of hearing that there is no money for pay and pensions when the truth is that universities are choosing to spend less on staff.

Of course, it was all part of the Ziggy theatrics, a show that began with DavidZiggy walking out to the drums of “Five Years” and continued with mime, flamboyance and songs that have all become classics. I remember his appearance being heralded by music from Beethoven’s Ninth (also used in A Clockwork Orange, the film being current at the time). In those years Bowie always used it as his theme music. I also remember being blown away by the support act – a fresh, imaginative outfit called Roxy Music. (David Lister)Truly charismatic performers leave an indelible impression and I marvelled at the way Chuck Berry had the crowd in the palm of his hand when I saw him in the 1970s. But few could match Dolly Parton in her prime for her larger-than-life enthusiasm and sheer sense of fun. When the country superstar came to London’s Dominion Theatre in 1983, she played some mean finger-picking banjo, sang beautifully, especially on an a capella version of “Do I Ever Cross Your Mind?” and even did an Elvis impression. Her concert was filmed for a video release and about half an hour after the crowd had left in, they brought in a large group of young punks and Goths (to intercut into crowd shots) and suggest an edgy young following. Happily, I had stayed around and saw her deliver this impromptu extra set, which was full of risqué jokes and blue banter. There’s no one quite like her. (Martin Chilton)You don’t usually realise you’re present at what will become a moment in history. But that sunny July afternoon at Wembley Stadium felt special right from the off, even if the off was Status Quo doing “Rockin’ All Over The World”. There were numerous stand-out moments perhaps on paper the biggest was the return of Paul McCartney, topping the bill after nearly five years self-enforced absence from high-profile performing following the shooting of John Lennon. Somewhat sadly the sound failed for part of “Let It Be”, but we can draw a veil over that. The most stunning set of the day came from Queen: a high energy medley through “Bohemian Rhapsody” and “Radio Ga Ga” to “We Will Rock You” and “We Are The Champions”. No one fired up the crowd quite as much that day. And since the band had not been at their most visible around that time, this proved to be their resurrection. (David Lister)Blues titan BB King released two of the greatest concert albums of the 20th-century in Live at the Regal (1964) and Live in Cook County Jail (1971). Even though he was 60 when I saw him at London’s Hammersmith Odeon in 1985, he was still full of energy. He sang with passion and his guitar work was transcendent, especially on gloriously funky version of “The Thrill is Gone”. I skipped my graduation ceremony for the concert and had the good fortune to bump into an old family friend called Ray Bolden, who had worked at Dobell\u0027s Record Shop in Charing Cross Road. King\u0027s face lit up to see Ray, who had put him up in his London flat in the 1950s. The blues superstar could not have been friendlier, despite his tiredness after a long gig. Seeing Muddy Waters live in 1979 was special but BB King at full power, bending guitar notes like no one else, topped even that. (Martin Chilton)When The Jesus \u0026amp Mary Chain reached the status of noisenik godheads with their fourth album Honey’s Dead in 1992, they decided to put together a visceral modern rock revue tour called Rollercoaster that’s still ringing in my ears almost 30 years on. Of the three revolving support acts, Blur opened the night, mid-transformation from baggy latecomers to art-pop pioneers. With Damon Albarn flinging himself wildly around the stage and clambering up amp stacks, they premiered ferocious second-album character studies like “Colin Zeal” while screening films of the journey of meat from slaughterhouse to defecation, in reverse. Most crucially, with their all-horns-blazing new single “Popscene”, they kick-started Britpop right before our eyes. The Mary Chain, meanwhile, were at peak malicious, I left with my skull buzzing, my eyes opened and my tastes re-arranged, convinced I\u0027d seen the new music, and I had. A gig that didn’t just make my night, it made me. (Mark Beaumont)When Pixies came onto a London stage on my birthday in 2004 and played Pixies songs – and music just doesn’t get better than that – it was pure relief, euphoria and dark-hearted epiphany. “Tame” sent me feral, “Gigantic” was titanic, “Bone Machine” crushed out my marrow. Black Francis snarled, barked and ranted through “Gouge Away”, “Monkey Gone To Heaven” and “Debaser”, every bit the demented pervert preacher he ever was Kim Deal’s angelic coos and bass melodies made an unholy pact with Joey Santiago’s werewolf guitar riffs, seemingly played with a plectrum made of Satan’s fingernail. Of their four Brixton dates that week, I lost every ounce of my s*** at three. Best gigs ever, no particular order.North London’s tiny and now-defunct, Buffalo Bar in the 2000s, hosted early gigs from the likes of Bloc Party, The Libertines, The Maccabees – or Foals. Their show took place 14 months before the release of their debut album Antidotes, and it justified their precocious reputation as a live act. That night, the energy of their high-octane math-rock was infectious it’s not often that you see a band in their earliest days and know that this is probably the last time you’ll be able to reach out and touch them. The songs followed: The French Open, Balloons, Hummer”, “Mathletics”, all fuelled by astoundingly complex polyrhythms, interweaving staccato synths and guitar played high on the fretboard in angular electro harmonies, set to punk-disco techno beats and urgent new wave vocals. I’d never seen a rock gig so precisely engineered (a sticker on the synth read Math is for Everyone), yet so exhilarating. There was a true sense we’d discovered something great. (Elisa Bray)Problematic in every way given singer Alice Glass’s October 2017 statement accusing her former bandmate Ethan Kath of sexual abuse, non-consensual sex and controlling behaviour, but this short set in front of a small crowd in a Camden bar was proof that when a performer truly plugs into the mother lode, the intensity they generate can burn itself into your retinas and shake your soul. Glass was 19 years old, and for most of the set just a blur of spectral movement frozen into violent shapes by an almost incessant strobe singing, shouting and screaming her way through songs such as “Courtship Dating”. The result was a reminder that whenever one of your heroes gets on stage to try to channel that primal essence of “rock ’n’ roll” – or whatever the hell it is – most of the time, they’re just trying to find an echo of something that once flowed through them. That can go on for 50 years or more. There’s sadness now in the memory, but on this day in April 2008, Glass had it. (Chris Harvey)918 Nick Cave \u0026amp the Bad Seeds, Brighton Centre, 2008It used to be that rock’n’roll was a young person’s game anyone over the age of 50 still tearing it up on stage needed to calm down and have a word with themselves. Nick Cave, the latter-day harbinger of the apocalypse still identifiable by his raven hair and pallbearer’s suit, has consistently shown us the idiocy of this thinking. I’ve seen Cave perform scores of times and he has never let me down, but this show, which coincided with the release of the album Dig!!! Lazarus Dig!!!, was a whole new level of spectacular: funny, furious, life-affirming, heavy on the biblical melodrama. Alongside the Bad Seeds, then operating as a seven-piece coolly attired in suits, open-necked shirts and slicked-back hair, Cave showed how musical talent can deepen rather than ebb in mid-life, and how he was – and indeed remains – untouchable in terms of intellect, charisma and sheer feral energy. (Fiona Sturges)Leonard Cohen steps onto the stage, dressed in grey shirt and tie, black waistcoat, trilby concealing his white hair. It\u0027s sweltering. And yet Cohen, in his mid Seventies, is barely breaking into a sweat. Much like his attire, the songs - such as Dance Me to the End of Love and So Long, Marianne – are immaculate, his voice no longer a wail but a raw, rumbling baritone. The Spanish sun is beating down and my friends and I are genuflecting before one of the greatest lyricists of all time. This was to be the only time I saw him live and no performance has ever, in terms of pure emotional intensity, targeted me with such laser-guided precision as his rendition of Hallelujah. The song\u0027s been covered by everyone from Jeff Buckley to Alexandra Burke, but sung by him that day, it\u0027s surely never felt as moving. (Patrick Smith)The great Sixties and Seventies soul singers are nearly all gone now, and I doubt we’ll ever see their like again. Bobby Womack had recovered from colon cancer but was in the early stages of Alzheimer’s Disease, and less than a year from his death in June 2014, when he played the UK in the summer of 2013. He came on stage on a sunny Saturday afternoon at the Latitude festival, to play songs from his brilliant comeback album, The Bravest Man in the Universe, to a basking, picnicking audience. “All soul singers come from gospel,” he told them. Womack’s voice still seemed like a gift from God. The years of cocaine addiction hadn’t altered its richness and warmth. To be in the presence of Womack that day, knowing it would likely be the last time, was very special.1218 St Vincent, End of the Road, 2014Most rockstars, terrified of seeming to be trying too hard, would never dream of hiring a choreographer. But St Vincent, AKA Annie Clark, is no ordinary rockstar. For her Digital Witness tour, the musician recruited Annie B Carson to help her dream up a procession of strange, shuffling moves to perform alongside her brilliant self-titled fourth album. At End of the Road Festival – a small, Dorset delight which she had played with David Byrne a year earlier – her headline set was scuzzy, eccentric, and thrilling. At one point, without missing a lick on her guitar, she rolled herself down an oversized flight of white stairs like a glitching robot. Then again, no robot can play guitar like that. (Alexandra Pollard)After 35 years away from the stage it was a moment Kate Bush fans never thought would happen. Beforehand, I was reporting from outside the venue for NME and the excitement and energy was extraordinary, like nothing I\u0027ve ever experienced. One woman told me it would be fine if she died after the gig because she would die happy. The show started with a greatest hits section. And then it all got a bit more, well, Kate Bush, with a dramatic adaptation of The Ninth Wave. Sinking ships, confetti cannons, surreal fish people and a soliloquy about sausages. Act three was more pastoral. The second side of Aerial, The Sky of Honey, was performed in front of the most beautiful visuals I\u0027ve ever seen: birds, a red sun, a moon tilting on its axis and then Kate suspended into the air. Pure theatre. As we filed out, there was a sense that the audience was stunned. I still am. (Lucy Jones)Patti Smith was celebrating the 40th anniversary of her seminal 1975 album Horses at Field Day in Victoria Park, London, 2015. The sky was a perfect blue, and the sun was still blazing hot at 7pm. “I’m sorry about the dark glasses,” Smith said by way of introduction. “I’m not trying to be cool, it’s just, you know… the sun.” “You’re the f***ing coolest!” a fan screamed back. From there, she and her band, including long-serving guitarist Lenny Kaye, embarked on a blistering set that had myself, and many other audience members, in tears. Smith is a ferocious performer, she spat and snarled and howled tearing up her guitar as though it just insulted one of her favourite poets. It didn’t matter if she messed up, as she did on “Break it Up”, because she offered the instantly immortal words: “I don’t do nothing perfect. I only f*** up perfect.” You felt you were in the presence of something momentous. (Roisin O’Connor)When D’Angelo released his surprise third record – the politically fraught Black Messiah – it ended the 14-year hiatus that followed 2000’s Voodoo. It also reminded music fans that the American hip-hop artist was still as monumentally talented as he was back then. Accompanied by his eight-strong band The Vanguard, his show at the Hammersmith Apollo was a visceral, quasi-religious experience. Jesse Johnson, formerly of Prince-produced outfit The Time, added funky hooks to “Sugah Daddy”, while legendary bassist Pino Palladino took time out from The Who\u0027s live shows to join in the fun. At one point D’Angelo led a classic James Brown funk staple, holding three fingers in the air so the band could respond with three loud vamps. One encore was followed by a second that broke the curfew with free abandon, until D’Angelo was left on stage alone, reflective and blissful. It inspired a ine kind of worship, for a show that was appropriately titled The Second Coming. (Roisin O’Connor)A week before she played Brighton, I reviewed Lorde’s Alexandra Palace show in London. It was a five-star performance – the New Zealand musician exorcised the pain of the break-up she\u0027d chronicled on her brilliant second album Melodrama, twitching and twirling as an abstract house party played out in glass boxes around her. The stage design was so good, in fact, that Kanye West may or may not have nicked it a year later. Seeing her in Brighton the following week, without a notepad in my hand, I saw even more clearly all the intimate nuances of her performance – and was free to give in entirely to the exhilarating, heartbreaking melodrama of it all. (Alexandra Pollard)When you’ve been going to gigs for decades, you tend not to expect anything new, just variations – some mind-blowing, others not – on what you have seen before. So when I saw David Byrne’s American Utopia show, it felt like stumbling on the Ark of the Covenant. Here was a man who had been working in music for 40 years completely redrawing the rules of pop performance – no drum riser, no cables, no visible amps or microphones – and taking it deep into the territory of experimental theatre. In opposition to the usual freeform live music set-up, this tour was the result of fastidious planning, with everything rehearsed to the last nanosecond. And yet, forever on the move, dressed in matching grey suits and dancing barefoot in formation, Byrne and his 12-piece band were loose-limbed, unfettered and joyous to watch. And the music was pretty great too. (Fiona Sturges)1818 Christine and the Queens, Hammersmith Apollo, 2018Before her short run at Hammersmith Apollo last year, Héloïse Letissier – known as Christine and the Queens, though she dropped all but the Chris for her second album – tweeted: “I think we finally have some surprises for those who come to the shows!” She delivered on that promise – falling snow and sand, and a balcony homage to Romeo and Juliet – as she redefined what a pop show could be. With a gender-fluid cohort of athletic dancers, she brought to theatrical life her tumultuous journey towards embracing her pansexual identity, and finding liberation. And we went through all those emotions with her, those alternately tender and powerful vocals never faltering despite the restless dance routines. Everyone was on their feet dancing, and her declaration of inclusivity could not have been more empowering: “Vive everyone!” We left thrilled and elated. (Elisa Bray)The long gone Rainbow in London’s Finsbury Park was one of the great rock venues, and though I was young at the time it would be impossible to forget the impact of Bowie in one of his first outings as Ziggy Stardust. “They haven’t even finished building the stage,” I said with breathtaking naievety to the person next to me, on observing the scaffolding and ladder. Of course, it was all part of the Ziggy theatrics, a show that began with DavidZiggy walking out to the drums of “Five Years” and continued with mime, flamboyance and songs that have all become classics. I remember his appearance being heralded by music from Beethoven’s Ninth (also used in A Clockwork Orange, the film being current at the time). In those years Bowie always used it as his theme music. I also remember being blown away by the support act – a fresh, imaginative outfit called Roxy Music. (David Lister)Truly charismatic performers leave an indelible impression and I marvelled at the way Chuck Berry had the crowd in the palm of his hand when I saw him in the 1970s. But few could match Dolly Parton in her prime for her larger-than-life enthusiasm and sheer sense of fun. When the country superstar came to London’s Dominion Theatre in 1983, she played some mean finger-picking banjo, sang beautifully, especially on an a capella version of “Do I Ever Cross Your Mind?” and even did an Elvis impression. Her concert was filmed for a video release and about half an hour after the crowd had left in, they brought in a large group of young punks and Goths (to intercut into crowd shots) and suggest an edgy young following. Happily, I had stayed around and saw her deliver this impromptu extra set, which was full of risqué jokes and blue banter. There’s no one quite like her. (Martin Chilton)You don’t usually realise you’re present at what will become a moment in history. But that sunny July afternoon at Wembley Stadium felt special right from the off, even if the off was Status Quo doing “Rockin’ All Over The World”. There were numerous stand-out moments perhaps on paper the biggest was the return of Paul McCartney, topping the bill after nearly five years self-enforced absence from high-profile performing following the shooting of John Lennon. Somewhat sadly the sound failed for part of “Let It Be”, but we can draw a veil over that. The most stunning set of the day came from Queen: a high energy medley through “Bohemian Rhapsody” and “Radio Ga Ga” to “We Will Rock You” and “We Are The Champions”. No one fired up the crowd quite as much that day. And since the band had not been at their most visible around that time, this proved to be their resurrection. (David Lister)Blues titan BB King released two of the greatest concert albums of the 20th-century in Live at the Regal (1964) and Live in Cook County Jail (1971). Even though he was 60 when I saw him at London’s Hammersmith Odeon in 1985, he was still full of energy. He sang with passion and his guitar work was transcendent, especially on gloriously funky version of “The Thrill is Gone”. I skipped my graduation ceremony for the concert and had the good fortune to bump into an old family friend called Ray Bolden, who had worked at Dobell\u0027s Record Shop in Charing Cross Road. King\u0027s face lit up to see Ray, who had put him up in his London flat in the 1950s. The blues superstar could not have been friendlier, despite his tiredness after a long gig. Seeing Muddy Waters live in 1979 was special but BB King at full power, bending guitar notes like no one else, topped even that. (Martin Chilton)When The Jesus \u0026amp Mary Chain reached the status of noisenik godheads with their fourth album Honey’s Dead in 1992, they decided to put together a visceral modern rock revue tour called Rollercoaster that’s still ringing in my ears almost 30 years on. Of the three revolving support acts, Blur opened the night, mid-transformation from baggy latecomers to art-pop pioneers. With Damon Albarn flinging himself wildly around the stage and clambering up amp stacks, they premiered ferocious second-album character studies like “Colin Zeal” while screening films of the journey of meat from slaughterhouse to defecation, in reverse. Most crucially, with their all-horns-blazing new single “Popscene”, they kick-started Britpop right before our eyes. The Mary Chain, meanwhile, were at peak malicious, I left with my skull buzzing, my eyes opened and my tastes re-arranged, convinced I\u0027d seen the new music, and I had. A gig that didn’t just make my night, it made me. (Mark Beaumont)When Pixies came onto a London stage on my birthday in 2004 and played Pixies songs – and music just doesn’t get better than that – it was pure relief, euphoria and dark-hearted epiphany. “Tame” sent me feral, “Gigantic” was titanic, “Bone Machine” crushed out my marrow. Black Francis snarled, barked and ranted through “Gouge Away”, “Monkey Gone To Heaven” and “Debaser”, every bit the demented pervert preacher he ever was Kim Deal’s angelic coos and bass melodies made an unholy pact with Joey Santiago’s werewolf guitar riffs, seemingly played with a plectrum made of Satan’s fingernail. Of their four Brixton dates that week, I lost every ounce of my s*** at three. Best gigs ever, no particular order.North London’s tiny and now-defunct, Buffalo Bar in the 2000s, hosted early gigs from the likes of Bloc Party, The Libertines, The Maccabees – or Foals. Their show took place 14 months before the release of their debut album Antidotes, and it justified their precocious reputation as a live act. That night, the energy of their high-octane math-rock was infectious it’s not often that you see a band in their earliest days and know that this is probably the last time you’ll be able to reach out and touch them. The songs followed: The French Open, Balloons, Hummer”, “Mathletics”, all fuelled by astoundingly complex polyrhythms, interweaving staccato synths and guitar played high on the fretboard in angular electro harmonies, set to punk-disco techno beats and urgent new wave vocals. I’d never seen a rock gig so precisely engineered (a sticker on the synth read Math is for Everyone), yet so exhilarating. There was a true sense we’d discovered something great. (Elisa Bray)Problematic in every way given singer Alice Glass’s October 2017 statement accusing her former bandmate Ethan Kath of sexual abuse, non-consensual sex and controlling behaviour, but this short set in front of a small crowd in a Camden bar was proof that when a performer truly plugs into the mother lode, the intensity they generate can burn itself into your retinas and shake your soul. Glass was 19 years old, and for most of the set just a blur of spectral movement frozen into violent shapes by an almost incessant strobe singing, shouting and screaming her way through songs such as “Courtship Dating”. The result was a reminder that whenever one of your heroes gets on stage to try to channel that primal essence of “rock ’n’ roll” – or whatever the hell it is – most of the time, they’re just trying to find an echo of something that once flowed through them. That can go on for 50 years or more. There’s sadness now in the memory, but on this day in April 2008, Glass had it. (Chris Harvey)918 Nick Cave \u0026amp the Bad Seeds, Brighton Centre, 2008It used to be that rock’n’roll was a young person’s game anyone over the age of 50 still tearing it up on stage needed to calm down and have a word with themselves. Nick Cave, the latter-day harbinger of the apocalypse still identifiable by his raven hair and pallbearer’s suit, has consistently shown us the idiocy of this thinking. I’ve seen Cave perform scores of times and he has never let me down, but this show, which coincided with the release of the album Dig!!! Lazarus Dig!!!, was a whole new level of spectacular: funny, furious, life-affirming, heavy on the biblical melodrama. Alongside the Bad Seeds, then operating as a seven-piece coolly attired in suits, open-necked shirts and slicked-back hair, Cave showed how musical talent can deepen rather than ebb in mid-life, and how he was – and indeed remains – untouchable in terms of intellect, charisma and sheer feral energy. (Fiona Sturges)Leonard Cohen steps onto the stage, dressed in grey shirt and tie, black waistcoat, trilby concealing his white hair. It\u0027s sweltering. And yet Cohen, in his mid Seventies, is barely breaking into a sweat. Much like his attire, the songs - such as Dance Me to the End of Love and So Long, Marianne – are immaculate, his voice no longer a wail but a raw, rumbling baritone. The Spanish sun is beating down and my friends and I are genuflecting before one of the greatest lyricists of all time. This was to be the only time I saw him live and no performance has ever, in terms of pure emotional intensity, targeted me with such laser-guided precision as his rendition of Hallelujah. The song\u0027s been covered by everyone from Jeff Buckley to Alexandra Burke, but sung by him that day, it\u0027s surely never felt as moving. (Patrick Smith)The great Sixties and Seventies soul singers are nearly all gone now, and I doubt we’ll ever see their like again. Bobby Womack had recovered from colon cancer but was in the early stages of Alzheimer’s Disease, and less than a year from his death in June 2014, when he played the UK in the summer of 2013. He came on stage on a sunny Saturday afternoon at the Latitude festival, to play songs from his brilliant comeback album, The Bravest Man in the Universe, to a basking, picnicking audience. “All soul singers come from gospel,” he told them. Womack’s voice still seemed like a gift from God. The years of cocaine addiction hadn’t altered its richness and warmth. To be in the presence of Womack that day, knowing it would likely be the last time, was very special.1218 St Vincent, End of the Road, 2014Most rockstars, terrified of seeming to be trying too hard, would never dream of hiring a choreographer. But St Vincent, AKA Annie Clark, is no ordinary rockstar. For her Digital Witness tour, the musician recruited Annie B Carson to help her dream up a procession of strange, shuffling moves to perform alongside her brilliant self-titled fourth album. At End of the Road Festival – a small, Dorset delight which she had played with David Byrne a year earlier – her headline set was scuzzy, eccentric, and thrilling. At one point, without missing a lick on her guitar, she rolled herself down an oversized flight of white stairs like a glitching robot. Then again, no robot can play guitar like that. (Alexandra Pollard)After 35 years away from the stage it was a moment Kate Bush fans never thought would happen. Beforehand, I was reporting from outside the venue for NME and the excitement and energy was extraordinary, like nothing I\u0027ve ever experienced. One woman told me it would be fine if she died after the gig because she would die happy. The show started with a greatest hits section. And then it all got a bit more, well, Kate Bush, with a dramatic adaptation of The Ninth Wave. Sinking ships, confetti cannons, surreal fish people and a soliloquy about sausages. Act three was more pastoral. The second side of Aerial, The Sky of Honey, was performed in front of the most beautiful visuals I\u0027ve ever seen: birds, a red sun, a moon tilting on its axis and then Kate suspended into the air. Pure theatre. As we filed out, there was a sense that the audience was stunned. I still am. (Lucy Jones)Patti Smith was celebrating the 40th anniversary of her seminal 1975 album Horses at Field Day in Victoria Park, London, 2015. The sky was a perfect blue, and the sun was still blazing hot at 7pm. “I’m sorry about the dark glasses,” Smith said by way of introduction. “I’m not trying to be cool, it’s just, you know… the sun.” “You’re the f***ing coolest!” a fan screamed back. From there, she and her band, including long-serving guitarist Lenny Kaye, embarked on a blistering set that had myself, and many other audience members, in tears. Smith is a ferocious performer, she spat and snarled and howled tearing up her guitar as though it just insulted one of her favourite poets. It didn’t matter if she messed up, as she did on “Break it Up”, because she offered the instantly immortal words: “I don’t do nothing perfect. I only f*** up perfect.” You felt you were in the presence of something momentous. (Roisin O’Connor)When D’Angelo released his surprise third record – the politically fraught Black Messiah – it ended the 14-year hiatus that followed 2000’s Voodoo. It also reminded music fans that the American hip-hop artist was still as monumentally talented as he was back then. Accompanied by his eight-strong band The Vanguard, his show at the Hammersmith Apollo was a visceral, quasi-religious experience. Jesse Johnson, formerly of Prince-produced outfit The Time, added funky hooks to “Sugah Daddy”, while legendary bassist Pino Palladino took time out from The Who\u0027s live shows to join in the fun. At one point D’Angelo led a classic James Brown funk staple, holding three fingers in the air so the band could respond with three loud vamps. One encore was followed by a second that broke the curfew with free abandon, until D’Angelo was left on stage alone, reflective and blissful.

(Elisa Bray)At the beginning of the gig, Sir Elton announced he had been diagnosed with “walking pneumonia”, an infection in the respiratory tract.Later, on Instagram, the singer told fans he was “deeply upset” by the situation.He wrote: “I want to thank everyone who attended tonight’s gig in Auckland. I was diagnosed with walking pneumonia earlier today, but I was determined to give you the best show humanly possible.“I played and sang my heart out, until my voice could sing no more. I’m disappointed, deeply upset and sorry. I gave it all I had. Thank-you so much for your extraordinary support and all the love you showed me during tonight’s performance. I am eternally grateful. Love, Elton xx.”Sir Elton’s Auckland show was part of his 300-date Farewell Yellow Brick Road tour, the last before he retires.In the recent documentary, Elton John: Uncensored, the singer revealed he was “24 hours from snuffing it” when he contracted a serious infection after having surgery for prostate cancer, and said he was so sick he “had to learn how to walk again”.\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

If we don’t create standards that people feel are legitimate, they won’t trust institutions or technology.“To be clear, this isn’t about passing off responsibility. Facebook is not waiting for regulation we’re continuing to make progress on these issues ourselves.“But I believe clearer rules would be better for everyone. The internet is a powerful force for social and economic empowerment. Regulation that protects people and supports innovation can ensure it stays that way.”The social network said it wanted its recommendations to spark further debate about the issue of online regulation, and confirmed it planned to publish more papers on the subject of elections and privacy later this year.“If designed well, new frameworks for regulating harmful content can contribute to the internet’s continued success by articulating clear ways for government, companies\u0026nbspand civil society to share responsibilities and work together,” Facebook’s vice president of content policy, Monika Bickert, said.“Designed poorly, these efforts risk unintended consequences that might make people less safe online, stifle expression and slow innovation.”Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Capital spending was down 3.7 per cent and exports dipped 0.1 per cent.“Consumer spending, which slumped following the tax hike in the fourth quarter of 2019, will now struggle to do anything except contract further in the first quarter as the impact of Covid-19 weighs on consumer sentiment, weighing in particular on the consumer services sector,” said Dutch bank ING in a report.“Some further government spending may help to curb any further contraction in GDP beyond the first quarter of 2020.\u0026nbsp“But that will not stop what started off as a technical downturn from evolving into a full-blown recession.”A recession is defined as two consecutive quarters of economic contraction.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The couple announced their engagement in November and were interviewed by the BBC\u0027s Mishal Hussain at their home, Frogmore Cottage, in Windsor, about the news.Princess Michael of Kent apologised for wearing a “racist” broach to the Queen\u0027s Christmas lunch at Buckingham Palace, that was also attended by Meghan and was her first Christmas with the royal family.On 19 May, Meghan and Harry married at St George’s Chapel, Windsor Castle. The bride and groom continued to defy convention at the wedding by putting a modern spin on everything from the cake to ceremony itself. The couple chose Reverend Michael Curry, the first black presiding bishop and primate of the Episcopal Church, to deliver a powerful sermon about love. The joyous day was somewhat dampened after it was revealed that Thomas Markle Sr, Meghan\u0027s father, would not be there to walk her down the aisle. Instead, Meghan walked herself down the aisle until she was joined by Prince Charles, who gave her away. In an interview with TMZ, Meghan\u0027s father admitted to conspiring with a photographer to pose for staged paparazzi photos. As a result of his admission, he felt it would be best to not walk her down the aisle because he didn\u0027t want to “embarrass the royal family or his daughter.” He also shared that he had suffered a heart attack six days prior due to the stresses of the situation.Since their wedding, speculation had been mounting that Meghan and Harry were expecting their first child but confirmation didn\u0027t come until 15 October, just as the couple were about to kick off their autumn tour of Australasia.During her pregnancy Meghan, like many prospective mothers, would cradle her bump or place her hand on her stomach during public events.On 6 May 2019, Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor was born at the Portland Hospital in London after Meghan went into labour in the early hours of the morning.Danny Baker was fired by the BBC after tweeting about the royal baby using a photo of a chimpanzee.The BBC showed a comedy programme, Tonight With Vladimir Putin, which portrayed the Duchess of Sussex saying “Stay the f*** out of my trailer or I’ll cut you, Kate.In June 2019 the Duke and Duchess of Sussex received criticism after it was revealed that their home was renovated with £2.4m of taxpayer-funded costs.Meghan and Harry chose to christen Archie at an intimate ceremony attended by close family. Royal baptisms are traditionally private but the couple went one step further by going against convention and deciding not to announce Archie’s godparents.Harry and Meghan were heavily criticised for using private jets to go on holiday with Archie to the south of France. Many people accused the couple of hypocrisy given their staunch views on environmentalism. It came after two other European trips, including one to Ibiza for Meghan’s birthday and another to Sicily where Harry flew to discuss climate change at a conference.Prince William and Harry had been at the centre of rift rumours for months, ever since it emerged that the Sussexes were moving to Windsor. In August, the speculation came to a head with royal sources and experts claiming the brothers have drifted apart. Appearing on Channel 5’s documentary William \u0026amp Harry: Princes At War? royal expert and editor of Majesty magazine Ingrid Seward said: “I would think it might bother William a little bit, because he might see the way that Harry and Meghan do things as being detrimental to the business of the monarchy as a whole.” Seward added that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were surprised by Harry and Meghan\u0027s whirlwind romance, saying: It was all so quick that William and Kate didn\u0027t have a moment to get to know Meghan because Harry hardly knew Meghan. And of course William and Kate would have quite naturally thought \u0027oh she\u0027s been married before, she\u0027s older than Harry, I hope she\u0027s going to make him happy\u0027. Anyone would think that.In August it was announced that Meghan Markle was to guest-edit the September issue of British Vogue magazine. The cover of the special edition featured a grid of 15 women selected as “Forces for Change” and articles inside that had been commissioned by the duchess. While the response was largely positive, some people criticised her choice of women, which did not include the Queen, and questioned whether or not a member of the royal family should edit a magazine, despite several others having done so before. “I feel like I need to bring a bit of reality to the situation. “We\u0027re talking about Vogue magazine. Probably the most elite, expensive, snobby, fashion-dominated, skinny-dominated magazine in the entire world. This is not some great mainstream force for good. This is a magazine for the elite.” Brexit Party MEP Ann Widdecombe also took aim for picking political stars, saying: “Royals have not only got to keep out of politics but they have got to be seen to keep out of politics.”In October 2019, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex took part in an ITV documentary about their royal tour to southern Africa.Following the ITV documentary, Meghan and Harry issued an official statement, in which the duke said he could no longer be a silent witness to Meghan\u0027s private suffering.In December, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex released their first Christmas card with their son, Archie Harrison Mountbatten Windsor.Meghan and Harry are pictured at Canada House in London to thank the Canadian high commission for their “warm hospitality” following their trip over Christmas.

wildlife overseas, campaigners have warned.Environmental group WWF has urged the government to prevent companies importing soy, palm oil and other products that have been linked to the loss of forests across the globe.European consumers, including in the UK, eat around 134.5lb (61kg) of soy a year without realising it, as it is imported and fed to animals such as pigs and chickens reared in the UK.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesPalm oil is found in a wide range of foods and some cosmetics and household goods, but its production can be problematic and unsustainable, with vast plantations that replace native forests in southeast Asia being grown to satisfy rising demand.As part of its “Let’s get deforestation #OffOurPlates” campaign, WWF is calling for lawmakers to set targets to end deforestation and enforce regulations on companies which would ensure their supply chains are not harming nature.Created with Sketch.Amazon rainforest swept by fires: In pictures Show

in the Brazilian state of Rondonia on 23 AugustThe sunsets behind clouds and smoke from fires in the Amazon rainforest in the Brazilian state of Rondonia on 18 AugustKatie White, WWF executive director of advocacy and campaigns, said: “People don’t want to eat food that’s destroying forests – but deforestation is hidden even in food that appears home-grown.“Action by inidual businesses or consumers isn’t enough.“We need the UK government to show decisive leadership to take deforestation off our plates with legislation that makes it illegal to import products that contribute to the destruction of forests.”The soy that is fed to animals mostly comes from South America, where production of the crop has nearly trebled in the last 20 years, WWF warned.UK’s love of chicken ‘fuelling mass forest loss in South America’The Amazon is protected from further expansion for soy production by a 2006 ban but other areas with vital ecosystems such as the Cerrado and the Gran Chaco – South America’s second largest forest – are still being exploited, according to Greenpeace investigators.Meeting Britain’s annual demand for high-protein soya requires 1.5 million hectares of land, an area larger than Northern Ireland. This does not include soy feed that forms part of the environmental footprint of meat imported from other countries.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

May Bulman talks to those kicked out of Britain about the difficulty of\u0026nbspstarting againImagine being ripped from everyone and everything in your life, locked in a cell, then flown across the globe to a country you barely know. You have no friends or family there, no job, and sometimes struggle to even be understood by the locals. This is your new life.That’s the situation facing some of those flown to Jamaica on a controversial charter flight this month, many of whom – though they remain Jamaican nationals – had lived in Britain since they were children. One told The Independent he had only a single\u0026nbspmemory of the Caribbean island:\u0026nbspbrushing his teeth as a small child.The mass deportation, which had intended to return around 50 people before the courts limited the number to 17, has shone a light on human suffering caused by Britain’s returns system, which sees thousands deported each year, often with limited access to legal help to defend their right to stay in the UK.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesOne man struggling to build a life after deportation is Tremayne Brown, 26, who was on a charter flight to Jamaica in 2017. He had lived in Britain since the age of six, having moved from Kingston’s Rose Town to south London with his father after his mother, brother and sister were killed by gangs. His father went to prison soon after their arrival – and was later deported – meaning Tremayne was put into care. No attempts were made to regularise his status in the UK.“I was leaving care and I was meant to get my own place and find a job, but then my social worker told me I wasn’t allowed to work, and they weren’t able to give me somewhere to live either, because of my status,” says Tremayne. “I was suddenly classed as an illegal alien.”Created with Sketch.Windrush generation: threat of deportation from UK Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The ex-troopship \u0027Empire Windrush\u0027 arriving at Tilbury Docks from Jamaica, with 482 Jamaicans on board, emigrating to Britain.Jamaican immigrants being welcomed by RAF officials from the Colonial Office after the ex-troopship \u0027Empire Windrush\u0027 landed them at Tilbury.

In 1948, the ship Windrush brought the first group of migrants from the West Indies to help rebuild post-war Britain, and many others followed from around the Commonwealth.

But he was not allowed to work. His girlfriend and their baby son needed financial support, so he was pushed into crime.“I was stuck in a place where I wasn’t allowed to work and I couldn’t get anywhere to live. What am I meant to do? I regret it every day. If I didn’t do that, I would be there with my son right now.”Aged 18, Tremayne was convicted for supplying class A drugs and commercial robbery, serving three years in jail. He did his time, then was transferred to a removal centre and issued deportation orders. He says that on entering detention he was told his removal had been cancelled, so did not contact his solicitor. But a week later, he was put on a flight.“One night they came to my door and said, ‘Pack your bags.’ When I was on the plane I called the solicitor and he said, ‘Why didn’t you ring me, I could have cancelled your ticket,’ but that it was too late. I never got the opportunity to fight my case.”A young man who grew up in the hands of the British state was now being flown to a country he had not set foot in for nearly 20 years.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThree years on, he is still struggling to settle. Though he lives with his father, Tremayne yearns to see his loved ones in Britain, particularly his son who, now aged six, has spent the majority of his life without his dad, having to make do with video calls.“He always asks me, ‘Dad, where are you?’ And if I’m coming back and why I left. It’s hard to explain it to him. He might hear his father’s voice and see him, but in reality you want him there in front of you. Through his childhood I haven’t been there. I haven’t been able to take him to the park. Those little things are important and have a knock-on effect on him as a child, having to grow up and say, ‘My father wasn’t there.’ It will make him bitter.”Tremayne struggled to find work, largely because of his reputation as being one of the “deportee boys” who had their chance and lost it. His qualifications were not recognised in Jamaica, but he found a job at a holding company. He says the stigma still weighs on his shoulders. His British accent means he is constantly asked where he comes from and why he was deported.“I have had to start again from scratch. You spend your whole life in one place and then you have to adapt yourself again. Nothing is easy, but you have to try,” he says. “Some days are really hard. I miss my son, I miss my foster mum, I miss the scenery. Having been a young boy and grown up there, I class myself as British. Everything I know is from Britain. I never learned anything from Jamaica.”Another deportee, Chevon Brown, was forcibly removed on a charter flight last February on the basis of a driving offence he committed aged 21 – something he describes as a “stupid mistake”. He had moved to the UK when he was 14 and has no close relatives in Jamaica.As a qualified barber who started working at the age of 16, the 24-year-old had hoped to find a job fairly easily. But he says his name has been tarnished by the insinuation by British politicians that everyone on the charter plane was a murderer, rapist or drug dealer.Chevon rarely leaves the house because he says he can feel animosity from people in the street, and he has sleepless nights worrying about his future.“I’ve asked for jobs, told them I’m qualified, but after they’ve heard my name, they don’t want to employ me. They say how can they trust me when I’ve been deported,” he tells The Independent. “People think we’re going to come here and cause major crimes. Most people think I’m a murderer, rapist or drug trafficker, which I’m not. I went to prison for dangerous driving and I completely regret it because I never knew I’d be serving double punishment for one stupid mistake.”The proof that ministers haven’t learnt the lessons from WindrushChevon, who grew up in Oxford, served seven months after admitting speeding in an uninsured car. It happened after a heated argument with his housemate, when he took the car out and drove away from police.“I knew what I was doing was wrong in the moment,” he says. “I was genuinely scared. I wish I had stopped, given them the key, got arrested and that be that. I had no idea that this would be the aftermath of driving away from the police. If I ever come back to England I don’t want any involvement with police. I just want to live a calm and peaceful life. I want to get a barbershop, get a mortgage on a house, start planning a future, get a car, all those things.“But right now, I’m paying two, three years after the actual thing. I’ve gone to jail, done my time, and years later I still can’t actually move on with my life. I feel like I’m still in prison. It’s worse than prison, because I can’t see my family and friends. I feel like I’m stuck. My whole reputation has been messed up by one silly mistake.”“My dad is getting more and more stressed. He’s got health problems. My 18-year-old brother’s not listening to anyone any more. There’s been a ripple effect from what’s happened to me. My little brother keeps asking me, ‘When are you coming home?’ I can’t give him a definite answer about that. I wanted to set a good example. But right now I feel like I’m actually being a weight on my family, because of all this negative attention that’s been drawn towards me.“I feel more British than Jamaican. My dad brought me to England and said this was where I was going to be living for the rest of my life. So I ed into the new society and this is who I am today. Most people try to tell me to speak Patois, but I feel comfortable speaking English. When I speak the Jamaican language I feel like I have to put it on. I don’t want to put it on.”The level of contact goes down, and that just compounds the sense of lost connectionsWhile charter flights to Jamaica have garnered media attention in the wake of the Windrush scandal, forced deportations from the UK take place throughout the year to countries across the globe, with 9,461 people removed in 2018 and 12,049 the year before – in addition to around 20,000 iniduals removed through the voluntary returns route. An estimated 2,000 of those forcibly removed are put on planes privately chartered by the Home Office, of which a total of 20 charter planes left Britain last year, with the destinations including Albania, Pakistan, Nigeria, France and Ghana.Kweku Abodoli, 39, was deported to Ghana in 2018 after having lived in Britain since the age of 12. In a highly publicised court case, he had been sentenced to seven years behind bars in 2012 after losing £1.4bn while working for Swiss bank UBS. The banker, who had a British partner at the time, was sentenced to five years in jail. Two days after he was convicted, he was informed that he was liable to automatic deportation.“All the way from being arrested through to just after I was convicted immigration didn’t cross my mind. The level of stress goes through the roof,” says Kweku, who now lives with his parents in Accra. “Suddenly, the battle’s not over. I can’t just sit in and do my time and go home.“The pressure in the relationship started to go up, because now she’s thinking, ‘Okay, so I’ve stood by him through this fight, now what? What if I keep fighting if he’s going to get deported anyway?’”Kweku had left Ghana aged four, when his parents moved to the Middle East for work. He is grateful to have his parents and other relatives now in the country, but devastated at how his relationships in Britain – including with his now ex-girlfriend and many friends – have broken down since his return.“It’s the inability of being able to get on a plane and be there for someone,” he explains. “The distance creates massive tension in the relationship. You have to increasingly distance yourself from these really close relationships. The level of contact goes down, and that just compounds the sense of lost connections, which then leads to depression.”‘Cruelty’ as Jamaicans driven to charter flight despite court rulingAfter arriving in Ghana, Kweku spent about nine months sitting in his bedroom, unable to leave the house. He developed a number of physical manifestations of the trauma he had been through. “My body started to swell up a lot,” he says. “We thought it was a heart problem so had a lot of heart tests. My face just blew up like a balloon, my legs were like elephant trunks,”The Ghanaian national acknowledges that he was relatively lucky on his return that, unlike the Jamaican deportees, he was welcomed with open arms by both his family and the country as a whole, who gave him what he describes as a “massive embrace”.“Because of the violence and the cruelty of what happened to me, I think Ghana went, ‘This is a son of Ghana, a son of Africa, why should anyone be treated this way?’ Random people on the street would stop me. Everyone recognised me. They were all saying welcome home,” he says, adding: “My stamina is not back and I’m still dealing with adrenal failure, so I still have to do a lot of work to deal with my stress, but I’m getting back to the point where I’m starting to contribute again.”But Kweku still remembers what he went through on during his deportation: “Of all that I went through, none of it was as bad as sitting at the back of a plane with five G4S guards. I was hyperventilating, sobbing non-stop for four hours.”Branded “foreign national offenders” and “illegal immigrants” by the Home Office\u0026nbspas they wait in cells to be taken away, these deportees are characterised as hardened criminals. But for Tremayne, Chevon and Kweku, these terms – and the trauma – ripple through their lives for years to come as they try to start again, thousands of miles from the place they call home.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Premium.Proposal floated as part of crackdown replacing free movement with minimum salary threshold of £25,600 and EU citizens may have to provide fingerprintsTough immigration laws could shut the door on 140,000 workers from the European Union and citizens from the continent may have to provide their fingerprints.The Home Office has floated the hardline proposal as part of a “firm and fair” post-Brexit crackdown that will replace free movement with a minimum salary threshold of £25,600 for most workers.However, ministers are unable to estimate the overall level of future migration – after relaxing salary and skills rules for non-EU migrants – despite insisting they “will reduce” it.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAnd the proposals laid bare how Boris Johnson has abandoned his pledge to introduce an “Australian-style points system”, other than for a small number of the most highly-skilled arrivals.Australia awards points for age, qualifications and work experience, allowing entry without a job offer – but, in the UK, only arrivals with a PhD, or in a shortage profession, will skirt the salary floor, and all but the most talented must have a job to go to.‘No time to lose’: Johnson told to act on Brexit food price hikes riskThe plans have already been branded “a disaster” by social care leaders, fearing a deepening recruitment crisis, although the social care sector could yet be added to the shortage list.Ministers have also rejected any regional variation in the proposed £25,600 floor, despite business leaders warning of problems for companies in poorer parts of the UK.Priti Patel, the home secretary, hailed the shake-up as “a historic moment for the whole country”, bringing immigration policy back under UK control “for the first time in decades”.“It will mean that we will have a global immigration system that doesn\u0027t discriminate between EU and non-EU, and it’ll basically mean that the brightest and the best will be able to come to the United Kingdom to bring their real talents,” she said.Created with Sketch.Brexit day: UK says goodbye to EU  Show all 66Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A message

Their arrival was before the expulsion of Ugandan Asians by dictator Idi Amin in 1972, which saw many families forced to flee the country and admitted to the UK under their status as colonial citizens.The home secretary initially attempted to dodge the question of whether her own family would have been affected by the new immigration rules.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Models on the catwalk during the Bobby Abley show at London Fashion WeekRachel Cox inspecting flood damage in her kitchen in Nantgarw, south Wales, where residents are returning to their homes to survey and repair the damage in the aftermath of Storm DennisTeme Street in Tenbury Wells is seen under floodwater from the overflowing River Teme, after Storm Dennis caused flooding across large swathes of BritainModels present creations at the Richard Quinn catwalk show during London Fashion Week in LondonResigned as Chancellor of the Exchequer.

Free health care? A jobs guarantee? Isn’t that socialism?Cardi B and Mark Ruffalo among celebrities backing Bernie SandersWhy the rise of Bernie Sanders is making some Democrats nervousWill bitter moderates vote for Bernie Sanders?But while policies such as free universal healthcare are seen as extreme in the US they are perfectly ordinary in Europe.The higher tax and spending proposed by Sanders would also not be out of place on the other side of the Atlantic.The economist Paul Krugman says Sanders is better described as a European-style social democrat rather than a socialist, not least because Sanders isn’t proposing to nationalise private industries.OK, but would this ruin the American economy?The French economist Thomas Piketty even argues Sanders’\u0026nbsppolicies could be beneficial to the US economy\u0026nbspby raising the country’s growth rate, and says that his wealth distribution policies tap into an older tradition of American policymaking.“Remember that the US is actually the country that invented progressive taxation of income and wealth in the 20th century,” Piketty points out.Others have described Sanders as a “New Dealer”, referring to the progressive economic policies put in place by former\u0026nbspDemocratic President Franklin Roosevelt in the wake of the Great Depression of the 1930s.So why are people describing Sanders as dangerous?But it may also be that the genuinely fear Sanders’ policies, even if they are in the mainstream of the European tradition, will do damage in the US context.Or they may be assuming that Sanders, if he won power, would pursue policies that go much further than those he has proposed, with the 78-year-old proving more radical in office, perhaps like Hugo Chavez in Venezuela.Against this, though, is the institutional fact that US presidents are constrained by Congress in what policies they can enact. Sanders might be in favour of relatively radical redistribution, but that’s not true of the wider Democratic party.Even some of Sanders’ rivals for the Democratic nomination, such as Pete Buttigieg, are critical of his policies such as the $15 federal minimum wage.That’s why many analysts – even those who support the principle of “medicare-for-all” – think there is little chance he could actually deliver it, even if he won power.And while some financiers are sounding the alarm, others are more sanguine.Another Wall Street Bank, JPMorgan, recently told its clients that, even if Sanders were elected, “we put the probability of major changes like medicare-for-all or a wealth tax at less than 5 percent.”All of which raises a question: is the risk less that Sanders ruins the US economy than that he disappoints his supporters?Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

She had no recent record of overseas travel but had attended church services and sought care at a hospital before being tested for the virus, the agency said.Now at least 10 people who attended religious services with Patient 31 have tested positive for the virus. One other person, who came in contact with her at a local hospital, has also come down with the disease.Hundreds of people are believed to have attended services with Patient 31 in recent weeks at a branch of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus the Temple of the Tabernacle of the Testimony, a religious movement founded in 1984 by South Korean Lee Man-hee, who is revered as a messiah by followers.Passengers disembarking from the Westerdam (TANG CHHIN SOTHYAFP via Getty Images)The remaining passengers who were stuck onboard a cruise ship docked in Cambodia for almost a week have left the vessel on Wednesday after they tested negative for the coronavirus.\u0026nbspMS Westerdam, operated by Carnival Corp\u0027s Holland America Line, arrived in the port of Sihanoukville on 13 February having been turned away at five other ports after leaving Hong Kong, which has reported more than 60 cases of the virus and two deaths.The ship came under renewed scrutiny amid Cambodia\u0027s quick clearance for passengers to fly home, which was criticised after one American woman who had been on the cruise ship tested positive for the virus over the weekend after a special flight chartered by the cruise reached Malaysia.The last 233 passengers on MS Westerdam are disembarked and will continue to Phnom Penh by buses, said Kheang Phearum, spokesman for Preah Sihanouk province, where Sihanoukville is located.Holland America Line confirmed in a statement the last passengers had been given health clearances to leave the ship and make their way home.The company is working to finalise arrangements for everyone, the statement said, adding that those who travelled home previously will be contacted by their local health department.Coronavirus death toll passes 2,000The death toll from the coronavirus outbreak in mainland China has passed 2,000, though the number of new cases has fallen for a second day in a row.China\u0027s National Health Commission reported the lowest daily rise in new infections in 29 January - 1,749 new confirmed cases.It brings the total number of cases in China to more than 74,000.Six people have died outside mainland China, including a new fatality announced today in Hong Kong.David Abel, who was aboard the Diamond Princess, has said he does not believe he will be on a planned evacuation flight to the UK after he and his wife Sally tested positive for the virus.Mr Abel appeared to cast doubt on the diagnosis on Tuesday when he described the situation as a setup in a Facebook post.\u0026nbspBut he said in a YouTube video on Wednesday: We\u0027ve since spoken to a doctor that speaks English, and we\u0027ve had to really press hard for that, and it has been confirmed by him we are both positive.\u0026nbspWe are going to a hostel because there isn\u0027t a hospital bed anywhere around. So, we\u0027re going to a hostel and in four or five days we\u0027ll be removed from the hostel and put into a hospital, where we will receive treatment.\u0026nbspSo I can\u0027t see that there\u0027s going to be any way we\u0027re on that flight to the UK.Cruise passengers who are not taking government repatriation flights will begin to disembark the\u0026nbspDiamond Princess\u0026nbsptoday, a spokesperson for Princess Cruises has said.According to the Japanese Ministry of Health, the disembark process for those iniduals who are not taking government repatriation flights will start today, they said.The disembark process will be undertaken over several consecutive days, since they will be tested, and the testing and results require two to three days to complete. A certificate that indicates a negative COVID-19 test result is expected to be granted by Japanese health authorities to exit the ship.The cruise line also said it will give every passenger a full refund, and a free future cruise of the same value.The firm said: Because of the extraordinary circumstances onboard Diamond Princess, the company is refunding the full cruise fare for all guests including air travel, hotel, ground transportation, pre-paid shore excursions, gratuities and other items.In addition, guests are not being charged for any onboard incidental charges during the additional time onboard. Princess Cruises will also provide guests with a future cruise credit equal to the cruise fare paid for the voyage.Britons on quarantined ship to be evacuated \u0027as soon as possible\u0027\u0026nbspPassengers look out from the cruise ship Diamond Princess at Daikoku Pier Cruise Terminal in Yokohama, Japan (REUTERSKim Kyung-hoon)Britons on a coronavirus-hit cruise ship in Japan will be evacuated as soon as possible, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) has announced.We are planning an evacuation flight from Tokyo to the UK as soon as possible for Britons who are on the Diamond Princess, an\u0026nbspFCO spokesman said.We hope the flight will be later this week, subject to permissions from the Japanese authorities.The FCO said\u0026nbspsome passengers had been allowed to leave the ship.At 0700 local time on Wednesday (10pm Tuesday, UK time), the Diamond Princess cruise operator and Japanese authorities allowed passengers to disembark from the cruise ship, the spokesman added.However there is a chance that people who disembark will not be able to join the evacuation flight.We have the utmost concern for the affected Britons and strongly encourage them to register for the evacuation flight.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

More like an actress acting the part of someone who cares. As so many of them do.“I find Portman’s type of activism deeply offensive to those of us who actually do the work. I’m not writing this out of bitterness, I am writing out of disgust,” she wrote.Unfortunately, coming from someone who has been so integral in the protest movement, this sounds like sour grapes.Natalie’s response to Rose’s criticism was as elegant and as understated as her protest.She said: “I agree with Ms McGowan that it is inaccurate to call me ‘brave’ for wearing a garment with women’s names on it.“Brave is a term I more strongly associate with actions like those of the women who have been testying against Harvey Weinstein the last few weeks.”She also responded to Rose’s accusation that Natalie has only been directed twice by women.But in this criticism, Rose is seriously missing the point. Female directors don’t get as far in Hollywood as male ones, which is precisely what Natalie is pointing out with her cloak protest. Therefore, there are fewer available to work with.As Natalie said: “It is true I’ve only made a few films with women. In my long career, I’ve only gotten the chance to work with female directors a few times . . . Unfortunately, the unmade films I have tried to make are a ghost history.“Female films have been incredibly hard to get made at studios, or to get independently financed. If these films do get made, women face enormous challenges during the making of them.”By the way, this is not the first time Natalie has protested from within the system.While presenting the best director category at the Golden Globes in , she introduced the line-up by saying: “And here are the all-male nominees.”Again, it’s not a shouty, noisy street protest. But it served to make her point. Just that she did it in a dferent way than Rose might. And that’s fine.In fact, some people think that Rose’s in-your-face type of protest risks alienating some people.I think women should support each other when it comes to vying for equality.But also, Rose just sounded spiteful when she said Natalie was “an actress acting like someone who cares”.Rose is a hero to many women. But she needs to understand that whether their contribution is big or small, loud or subtle, anyone’s effort to affect change helps.JANE Fonda, who looked fabulous at the Oscars, has said she is done with plastic surgery.Well, I guess  is as good an age as any to stop nipping and tucking.She must have a great doctor, as whatever the actress has had done has been done very well indeed – because, in my experience, it’s not often you look better after a facelt than you did before.PERHAPS Andrea Leadsom had a premonition that she was going to be axed as Business Secretary in this week’s Cabinet reshuffle.She recently wrote a column obliquely warning Boris Johnson not to cut the number of female ministers in his Cabinet.Addressing the issue of female board members among FTSE  companies, Andrea wrote: “Working in the City in the Nineties, I saw myself how a male-dominated environment can limit a career.”Unfortunately for her, the warning did not save her skin and she has been sacked, along with Theresa Villiers as Environment Secretary and housing minister Esther McVey.By the way, eight of the  members of Mr Johnson’s first Cabinet were female –  per cent.Despite these sackings, that figure has actually risen – slightly – to nearly  per cent.Ideally, the split would be an even -.But the reality is that business and politics can both be brutal.Men and women alike must accept they might one day get the sack.It simply goes with the territory.Being selected on the basis of gender is just as wrong as being sacked on that basis.Right person, right job, regardless of their gender.THAT is what true equality means.SAY what you like about the bonkers lestyle advice dispensed by Gwyneth Paltrow on Goop – and some of it is seriously out there.But whatever she is doing clearly works.She is, at the age of , nothing short of radiant.In fact she looks amazing and also happy.Not only that but she became instantly relatable to parents everywhere with a confession that her -year- old daughter finds her embarrassing.That’s a good reminder there is nothing like a teenager to keep you normal and down to earth for fear that you will embarrass them, no matter what you do.Although, to be fair, perhaps Gwyneth’s daughter has had a predisposition to feel embarrassed by her mother ever since she named her  . . . Apple.What are the ethics of seat-reclining on a long-haul flight An American Airlines passenger raised the question after video-shaming a fellow traveller who punched and pushed her seat when she reclined it.Bearing in mind the recline button moves the seat about in, I suspect this chap has anger issues, as reclining a seat that has a recline button is hardly an act of aggression.I’d disable the recline button and then all you have to fight over is the armrest.DAMIAN Hurleys resemblance to his mother, Liz, is uncanny.More so than ever in the latest shots of the two of them together, which he posted online this week.Some people think it is vaguely unsettling that he looks more like Liz Hurley than Liz Hurley.But as a mum myself, I think it’s heartwarming a teenage boy should be so happy to emulate his mother.OH the utter folly of the face tattoo!The latest to succumb to this trend, which a few years ago would be, frankly, unthinkable, is Amber Rose.She has had the words Bash and Slash tattooed across her forehead in old English manuscript style.It’s a reference, apparently, to the model’s three-month-old son Slash, and six-year-old son Sebastian. And, obviously, it’s lovely that she loves her children so much.But tattooing their names on her forehead where they will remain for all her le  All I can say is: Tattoo in haste . . . repent at leisure.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And more people now watch YouTube than all terrestrial broadcasters put together.Even the BBCs highest paid star, Gary Lineker, says its time to make the fee voluntary, while Dame Helen Mirren admits its had its day.Yet the Government’s policy has provoked howls of outrage, especially from the chattering liberals who seem to regard the licence fee as a sacred part of our constitution.Their squeals of protest are badly misplaced. The fact is that, by guaranteeing a huge revenue stream, the licence fee promotes a culture of excess and mismanagement within the BBC, which has a budget of almost £ billion and employs , people.Its reflected in the vast salaries paid to scores of BBC stars, far beyond market rates, like the £. million previously dished out to Lineker, £, to newsreader Huw Edwards, or the £, to sports presenter Jason Mohammad.You can spot it in the host of botched or extravagant schemes, like the notorious reconstruction of the EastEnders set, whose budget soared from £ million to £. million.Worse still, a staggering £ billion was spent on the refurbishment of Broadcasting House in central London.There is also absurd doubling up among staff, particularly in the news.Last week, the BBC had  correspondents covering the American Democrat primaries in Iowa and New Hampshire, while in  no fewer than  on-air journalists were sent to report on one brief Brussels summit attended by David Cameron.But the lack of any commercial pressure is most easily spotted in the vast, sprawling tiers of flabby bureaucracy.Ab Fab comedian Jenner Saunders once said of the corporation, “It’s become top-heavy in such an ugly way,” adding that it is “an executive-run place for idiots”.A glance through the BBC’s Annual Report for  shows just how correct she was.On these pages, I counted no fewer than eight managers who had “Human Resources Director” in their job titles, all of them on at least £,-a-year.Among them were: Dale Haddon, “HR Director, News and Employee Relations”, on up to £, Rachel Currie, “BBC Group HR Director” on up to £, and Gillian Taylor, “HR Director” on £,.It was the same story with BBC News, whose regiment of well-healed officials included: Fran Unsworth, the “Director of News” on £, Gavin Allen, “Head of News Output” on £, and Jonathan Munroe, Head of Newsgathering” on £,.This grasping spirit prevails throughout the bloated organisation, from the £, “Director of Nations and Regions” to the £, “Director of Radio and Education.”Insulated by public funding, the corporation adores both navel-gazing and self-promotion. So it has a “Director of Communications” on £,-a-year, a “Director of Policy” on £, and a “Director of Editorial Policy” on £,.All that puts into perspective the current moans from the BBC about the need for cuts.But apart from the managerial excess, what also aggravates is how the corporation uses its publicly-funded muscle to promote a fashionable, London-centric agenda.As the state’s monopoly broadcaster, the BBC should be utterly impartial.Yet its output is dominated by trendy political messages on immigration, climate change, Tory cuts, ersity and poverty.The BBC might have lavished reporters on the Democrat primaries, but it gave hardly any live coverage to the recent celebrations in Parliament Square at the moment of Brexit.Typically a Newsnight discussion  that evening – held in a studio bedecked with the blue and gold of the EU - featured two Remainers and one Brexiteer.Left-wing propaganda is continually crowbarred into everything from drama to discussion programmes.Just  per cent of the national workforce is employed in the public sector, yet the BBC is filled with the voices of state employees, most of them whining about under-funding.Left-wing opinions have a stranglehold most topical comedy shows, such as Radio Four’s News Quiz, hosted by the achingly unfunny Nish Kumar.It was Kumar who recently caused a storm by sneeringly presenting an edition of the BBC children’s show “Horrible Histories”, in which Britain’s Victorian past was held up for ridicule.The BBC can get away with this because of its lucrative monopoly as the state’s only broadcaster. It has abused that privileged position for too long.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

No one is suggesting you won’t have Strictly Come Dancing or Match of the Day or even Question Time and Newsnight.But the media is fundamentally changing. Consumer choice – what you or me choose to consume on the box or on our iPads or phones and at what time – is king.The idea that by  paying £. for a service that we may choose not to watch or listen to AT ALL is insanity.It might be unpleasant for BBC lers but the time has come to accept that the licence fee must evolve into a subscription service, so that the corporation is accountable to viewers and not the current behemoth that puts local newspapers out of business, that competes with national newspaper websites to write about Love Island, and that makes podcasts like Reality Tea all about the MTV reality series Geordie Shore.That is NOT public service broadcasting. It is a blatant and constant attempt to undercut struggling commercial rivals.But a sea change is coming. I truly feel it.Sure, there might be disagreement at Downing Street about exactly what that change will involve.Personally I’m on the side of Dominic Cummings who wants wholescale cuts. Sell Radio  and Radio , shut down the sweeping BBC Online department and focus on true public service programming that won’t be provided where. Then in  allow people the choice about whether they want to pay for what they watch from the BBC or not.But the plan by Boris Johnson - who The Times reports this morning fancies an evolution not a revolution - is also valid. The first step to decriminalise the licence fee is the start of bringing the BBC back in line.The fact we’re even having this discussion is the fault of the BBC, which has proven itself to be untrustworthy and lacking in political impartiality in recent years.It disgraced itself over its coverage of Brexit. It proved it was no longer in touch with vast swathes of the country the folk outside of London who don’t spend their days eating quinoa salads and quaffing champagne with other members of the liberal media elite.It proved itself out of touch for failing to predict the biggest story at the most recent election: Boris Johnson’s historic toppling of Labour’s northern red wall.But what’s most telling is the fact some of the BBC’s biggest proponents are now speaking out to insist the corporation must adapt to change. px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT-e.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT-e.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT-e.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT-e.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT-e.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT-e.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT-e.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT-e.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT-e.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT-e.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT-e.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT-e.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT-e.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\" Credit: The Mega Agency Dame Helen Mirren is the latest celeb to e into the debate over the licence feeShe said this week: “I think the that the licence fee has had its day.”She joins the BBC’s highest paid presenter Gary Lineker who has said it should be abolished.In all honesty though so should his contract, which costs licence fee payers £. million a year for minimal work.Radio ’s Evan Davis last week said the BBC needs to axe radio stations and either BBC or BBC rather than keep trimming costs around the edges.The need for genuine change at the BBC has reached a tipping point.It has to happen now.

The Elgin Marbles are going nowhere.”And a UK Government spokesman insisted: “This is not up for discussion as part of our trade negotiations.”Ex Culture Minister Ed Vaizey said any attempts to “strong-arm” No  would be a “non-starter” as the British Museum owns the marbles.The row risked souring relations between the two sides a fortnight to the day before talks are set to open.Greece has repeatedly lobbied for the repatriation of the ,-year-old sculptures which were taken from the Parthenon over  years ago.Last month the country’s culture minister Lina Mendoni said Brexit had created “the right conditions for their permanent ”.EU sources denied the clause was just about the marbles and said it is targeted at trade in antiquities through London’s auction houses.A Greek Government spokesman said its request for their“is eternal, not tied to a Brexit trade deal”.A British Museum spokesman added: “The British Museum welcomes this mandate and is committed to fighting the trade in illicit antiquities across the world.“The Parthenon Sculptures were legally acquired and help us to tell the story of human history presented at the Museum.The demand comes on the back of Spain exploiting the withdrawal negotiations to pursue its agenda over Gibraltar.The th Earl of Elgin, Thomas Bruce, removed the Parthenon Marble pieces from the Acropolis in Athens while serving as the British ambassador to the Ottoman Empire from  to .He requested that the Turks, who had previously conquered Greece and occupied the country, to take away the works of Greek art so he could put them in his London home.Lord Elgin obtained authority to take away sculptures or inscriptions on the grounds that the removal didnt interfere the walls or works of the building.In , the sculptures were removed from the temple and transported to England. The Scottish aristocrat was accused of looting and vandalism.They were kept in storage in a damp, dirty shed at Elgins Park Lane house for two years while he was in prisoned in France.Finally, nearly a decade of being kept in innapropriate conditions, the government bought the marbles in  to be put on display in the British Museum.In , a Labour MP asked Winston Churchill whether the marbles would be ed to Greece and the answer was no.Greece has fought for theirfor years but with no success.The authenticity of Elgins permit to remove the sculptures from the Parthenon has been widely disputed, especially as the original document has been lost. Many claim it was not legal.However, others argue that since the Ottomans had controlled Athens since , their claims to the artefacts were legal and recognisable.The controversy erupted as Michel Barnier hit back at the PM’s chief negotiator over a speech in which he called for a Canada-style deal.He said David Frost was wrong to describe the bloc’s demands the UK respects EU standards as anti-democratic.And he warned that the Britain cannot have trading access on the same terms as Canada because it is much closer to Europe.The Frenchman said: “It is a sovereign decision of the EU, it is a sovereign decision of the UK to cooperate.“We have proposed a trade agreement with a country that has a very particular and unique close geographical proximity, not like Canada.”The Commission also pushed back against Mr Frost’s criticisms of its Level Playing Field demand, saying that “distance matters in trade”.A spokeswoman said: “Every trade deal we do has a level playing field element tailored to the specic circumstances of our partners.“Each deal depends on a number of dferent factors, including distance, and the level and intensity of trade we have with that particular country.”Meanwhile Brussels’ trade boss, Phil Hogan, said that Mr Johnson would have to take “full responsibility” for any trade frictions after Brexit.He said: “It’s up to the UK to make sure it doesn’t happen. We’re looking for a level playing field and they don’t seem to want it.”The Irishman added that Boris Johnson’s plan to erge from EU rules after Brexit is a “big worry” for British manufacturers.Yesterday it emerged that the first round of the trade negotiations will take place in Brussels not London.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The -strong bloc has added the need to “address issues relating to theor restitution of unlawfully removed cultural objects to their countries of origin,” The document, due to be concluded on Wednesday, sets the parameters for the EU’s position going into the negotiations starting next month. The collection of marble sculptures from Parthenon, commonly known as the Elgin Marbles, has been a vexed issue ever since they were brought to the UK between -. Thomas Bruce, the seventh Earl of Elgin, a British ambassador to the Ottoman Empire, removed the stones from Acropolis at personal expense with permission from the Turkish Sultan, and years later after much controversy sold them to the British Museum. Despite repeated requests from Greece the UK has consistently refused tothe artefacts. The addition to the negotiating mandate suggests that the remaining EU  countries could try and add their own specic grievances. Spain is talking up its claims on Gibraltar while France is demanding conditions on fishing rights. A Greek government spokesman told Euronews: Greek governmentaposs request forof Elgin marbles is eternal, not tied to a Brexit trade deal. A senior UK Government source dismissed the idea out of hand saying: This is just not happening and it shows a troubling lack of seriousness about the negotiations on the EU side. Meanwhile the EUaposs chief negotiator Michel Barnier told the UK it could not have a Canada-style trade agreement just a day after his UK equivalent made that demand. Michel Barnier said the EU was ready to offer an ambitious partnership with the UK post-Brexit, but its particular proximity meant it would be dferent. On Monday night David Frost, made a speech in Brussels calling for a Canada-Free Trade Agreement-type relationship echoing the demands set out by Boris Johnson in his first speech on Brexit since becoming PM.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailThe Tory government has finally set out its plans for a points-based immigration system to come into force on January  . The radical shake-up will block millions of aposlow-skilledapos - well, low-paid - workers from coming to the UK. After Brexit people will have to earn over £,, have a job offer and speak English to a certain level in order to get a work visa. There will be some exceptions for people who earn £, to £, in shortage areas like the NHS. But the plans have prompted an outpouring of fury from businesses and council who warn sectors like social care face disaster. In response the Home Office has told businesses they should simply end their reliance on cheap, low-skilled labour.Yet there are a whole host of unanswered questions. Home Secretary Priti Patel refused to give any overall cap or target on numbers, and wouldnapost say exactly when people will be able to bring their family.Â Thereaposs also scant information about how much applications will cost or how a sufficient level of English language will be measured. A policy statement published on Wednesday said free movement would end, laws surrounding this would be repealed and a new Immigration Bill would be introduced for a firm and fair system which would attract the high-skilled workers to create a high wage, high skill, high productivity economy. The government wants companies to train up British workers to fill vacancies but critics say the lack of investment in further education makes that dficult. Meanwhile Labour predict there will be so many carve-outs and exceptions that the system will be pointless. Ms Patel said there will still be ways for some low-skilled workers, such as Polish builders, to come to Britain. We will continue to review the labour market, she told the BBC. So how will it actually work  Hereaposs a handy guide. Skilled workers  All applicants - both EU and non-EU citizens - who want to live and work in the UK will need to gain  points to be eligible to apply for a visa. Points will be awarded for key requirementsthey can demonstrate they:Have a job offer from an approved sponsor, such as an employer cleared by the Home Office . Have a job offer that is at a required skill level . They can speak English to a certain level .Other points could be awarded for certain qualications andthere is a shortage in a particular occupation. The salary threshold for skilled migrants will be lowered from £, to £, for those coming to the UK with a job offer. Butan applicant earns less than the required minimum salary threshold - but no less than £, - they may still be able to come to the UKthey have a job offer in a specic occupation which appears on the Governmentaposs jobs shortage list, orthey have a PhD relevant to the job. This could mean lower earners such as nurses may still be able to apply for a visa, provided a shortage of staff in this area remain on the approved list. The cap on the number of people who can come through the skilled worker route has been scrapped. There are no plans to introduce regional salary thresholds or dferent arrangements for dferent parts of the UK.  This would allow a small number of the most highly-skilled workers, who can gain the required level of points, to enter the UK without a job offerthey are endorsed by a relevant and competent body. This will include science, technology, engineering and mathematics professionals. Points will be awarded for factors such as academic qualications, age and relevant work experience and the route would be capped. Low-skilled workers  There will be no temporary or general visa options for low-skilled migrant workers. The paper said: UK businesses will need to adapt and adjust to the end of free movement, and we will not seek to recreate the outcomes from free movement within the points-based system. As such, it is important that employers move away from a reliance on the UKaposs immigration system as an alternative to investment in staff retention, productivity, and wider investment in technology and automation. It is estimated % of the existing EU workforce would not meet the requirements of the skilled worker route, which will help to bring overall numbers down in future, according the Home Office. It is thought there are around . million EU citizens living in the UK and most are said to be unskilled or low-skilled workers.  Last week it was reported the new system could cut the number of low-skilled migrant workers from European Union countries by up to , a year. The policy document mentioned the immigration system would reduce overall migration numbers. But the Home Office has been unable to provide more detail on how this would be achieved anda target number had been set. A pilot scheme for seasonal workers in agriculture will be quadrupled from , to , places. Youth mobility arrangements with eight countries that result in around , young people coming to the UK each year will continue. Both routes will provide employers with further ongoing flexibility in employing iniduals into lower-skilled roles, the paper said, but added: We expect employers to take other measures to address shortages. Students "},{"url":null,"title":"viewers slam morons behind universal","story":"w.mantis  Viewers slam morons behind Universal Credit debt spiral on BBC documentaryPeople were disgusted at the short-term fix nature of Universal Credit which is juxtaposed with forcing often misinformed claimants into long-term debt, in the last episode of BBC show Inside the Welfare State Viewers of a BBC documentary have slammed the aposmoronsapos behind Universal Credit for hiding their fat heads in the sand with the five-week delay forcing people into a debt spiral. nThe last episode of three-part series Inside the Welfare State aired on Tuesday evening and focused on Bolton Jobcentre claimants Jenny, a sex attack victim, and Paula, a mum who has just £ a day to live on.  nBoth have had to take advances on their claims to make ends meet and are living day-to-day.  nTwitter user Martyn G said: Just watching the BBC programme on Universal Credit and these Middle Class Morons who have been running the DWP have been hiding their fat heads in the sand with regards to the Delay in payments having a direct effect on hardship and foodbank use!  n  nSex attack victim, , trapped in Universal Credit hell and unable to find work  nMum on Universal Credit left with just £ a day for family-of-three to survive  nUniversal Credit is designed to help people on short-term and zero-hour contracts like -year-old Jenny who has recently signed up for the controversial new benefit, having taken a nine-month break from work due to the stress of the assault.  nIn the episode, she is shown to have found herself a job on a zero hour contract at a new restaurant, but her £. an hour wages and meagre benefits mean she is struggling to afford her £-a-week flat rent.  nTwo weeks in, she is forced to apply for a £ advance on her Universal Credit, essentially a loan which will be deducted from future payments.  n  nThe new benefit system, which combines numerous payments into one, often meaning claimants have far less than before, is paid monthly - and in arrears - and Jenny has no savings.  nUniversal Credit will top up her salary but takes p from every pound she earns, though with it always being paid a month behind she never knows how much she will receive - and this is proving tough.  nLater in the episode she suffers a bad fall and cannot work for  days, and with no sick pay or savings she panics and takes out another UC advance.  n  nThree weeks later, she is seen again working at the restaurant but in that time has only been offered one six hour sht in a week, and tells the camera she is desperate to find a proper job.  nAnd in a final cruel blow, she does not receive hardly any money from Universal Credit because it is calculated from her wages last month - and does not take into account the dficulties she has faced this month.  nTwitter user Amber Goodwin, chair of Hull and Hessle Labour Party, said: We need a better system and we need to scrap the ideological  week wait. We need to give people more.  n  nLater, she tweeted: Give people more money so that they can prosper and not simply exist.  nJenny was a talented hairdresser before she was raped, having been plied with alcohol by a neighbour and assaulted in her sleep, she explains, and had dreamt of becoming an air hostess - but is now crippled by anxiety and bogged down with trying to survive day to day on low pay.  nTwitter user Kerri Johnson said while watching the show: I quote ‘it’s just the way the system is’  That is the issue though isn’t it  that the current system is driven by a ‘process’ but no thought for the impact on the person!  n  nAnother viewer, referring to Jenny, was baffled by the short-term fix nature of Universal Credit, particularly in the case of the vulnerable but ambitious young woman.  nThey tweeted: The  year old girl goes to the job centre, wants to work FT and gets offered a zero hours contract position with top up support through Universal Credit.  nWhile Abigail, another viewer, tweeted: Feeling saddened...seeing how just one unfortunate event can put people into situations that seem near impossible to live in, with no clear way of getting out.

The last episode of three-part series Inside the Welfare State aired on Tuesday evening and focused on Bolton Jobcentre claimants Jenny, a sex attack victim, and Paula, a mum who has just £ a day to live on. Both have had to take advances on their claims to make ends meet and are living day-to-day. Twitter user Martyn G said: Just watching the BBC programme on Universal Credit and these Middle Class Morons who have been running the DWP have been hiding their fat heads in the sand with regards to the Delay in payments having a direct effect on hardship and foodbank use! Universal Credit is designed to help people who are out of work, long-term sick or on low-paid, short-term or zero-hour contracts. However critics say there are a string of problems. People must wait five weeks for their first payment. If they want to cover the gap they must borrow an aposadvanceapos against their future benefits. Meanwhile, UC ies for people in insecure work with changing hours - meaning itaposs often impossible to know exactly how much youaposll get until the end of the month. Those people include -year-old Jenny who has recently signed up for the controversial new benefit, having taken a nine-month break from work due to the stress of the assault. In the episode, she is shown to have found herself a job on a zero hour contract at a new restaurant, but her £. an hour wages and meagre benefits mean she is struggling to afford her £-a-week flat rent.  Two weeks in, she is forced to apply for a £ advance on her Universal Credit, essentially a loan which will be deducted from future payments over the next  months . Universal Credit will top up her salary, but the amount she receives in benefits reduces by p for pound she earns in salary. With it always being paid a month behind, this combination of factors means she never knows how much she will receive - and this is proving tough. Later in the episode she suffers a bad fall and cannot work for  days, and with no sick pay or savings she panics and takes out another UC advance.  Three weeks later, she is seen again working at the restaurant but in that time has only been offered one six hour sht in a week, and tells the camera she is desperate to find a proper job. And in a final cruel blow, she does not receive hardly any money from Universal Credit because it is calculated from her wages last month - and does not take into account the dficulties she has faced this month. Twitter user Amber Goodwin, chair of Hull and Hessle Labour Party, said: We need a better system and we need to scrap the ideological  week wait. We need to give people more.  Later, she tweeted: Give people more money so that they can prosper and not simply exist. Jenny was a talented hairdresser before she was raped, having been plied with alcohol by a neighbour and assaulted in her sleep, she explains, and had dreamt of becoming an air hostess - but is now crippled by anxiety and bogged down with trying to survive day to day on low pay. Twitter user Kerri Johnson said while watching the show: I quote ‘it’s just the way the system is’  That is the issue though isn’t it  that the current system is driven by a ‘process’ but no thought for the impact on the person!  Another viewer, referring to Jenny, was baffled by the short-term fix nature of Universal Credit, particularly in the case of the vulnerable but ambitious young woman. They tweeted: The  year old girl goes to the job centre, wants to work FT and gets offered a zero hours contract position with top up support through Universal Credit. While Abigail, another viewer, tweeted: Feeling saddened...seeing how just one unfortunate event can put people into situations that seem near impossible to live in, with no clear way of getting out. Thinking about just how many people live like this too. Mum-of-one Paula, , meanwhile, was left with a feeling in her throat like Iaposve been smothered and with anxiety levels through the roof after receiving her first Universal Credit payment - and with it a major shock.  Having recently moved in with her partner Aaron, the change of circumstances means Paula has to move onto Universal Credit from Job Seekers Allowance and Housing Benefit.  She had been receiving £ a fortnight from JSA and Child Credit, but Universal Credit is paid a month in arrears - and she has no savings to see her through the five-week wait for the first payment. Hoping the wait doesnapost mess us up as it has done with a lot of people sheaposs known, she tells the cameras: A lot of people have killed themselves over it, havenapost they  Needing to pay for a school unorm for daughter Lexi, work coach Lorraine offers her an advance - essentially a Universal Credit loan - of £, to get her through.  This will have to be paid back at £ a month, over  months, she is told. But a major shock is just round the corner for Paula as she gets through the five week wait only to find £. is deducted from her monthly Universal Credit payment. This leaves her with £ for the month - far less than she was expecting - which is roughly £ a day for herself, her partner Aaron, and daughter Lexi, to pay rent, food, bills - everything.  Twitter user Thomas Hemingford said: With Universal Credit and work, the system leaves people constantly chasing their tails, not knowingtheyaposll have money for bills. Itaposs no way to live, you canapost plan, and you canapost build a le like that. And then later: Universal Credit crushes people. It causes severe anxiety and mental health problems. Not just amongst adults, but children, too. It pushes people into a debt spiral. That does not help anyone.

Prince Harry, , and Meghan, , are set to be invited as speakers next year at the annual gathering of some of the world’s richest and most influential people.It comes amid what banking insiders describe as a “gold rush” to work with the couple – who want to be financially independent after quitting the royal family. Butthe couple accept, it could clash with their climate campaigning after activist Greta Thunberg, , slammed the WEF during her speech at this year’s event last month as protesters filled the streets. Harry and Meghan are already developing links with investment banking giants as they plan to rake in millions. And experts reckon by mixing with WEF delegates at Davos they could even hit £billion by striking the right mix of corporate deals and brand ambassador roles. PR expert Mark Borkowski said of the move: “This does not surprise me at all.” A banking source added: “Harry and Meghan have set a clear path to work with big banks and corporate giants as well as doing altruistic work with charities.  “The mix works well with the target audience and the celebrity set. However, it is sure to raise eyebrows in royal circles. “It has echoes of other royals criticised for touting themselves to the highest bidder and all becomes rather tawdry.” Harry and Meghan champion environmental causes but were criticised last year for flying off on holiday by private jet.  Harry’s father, the Prince of Wales, gave a keynote speech on the climate crisis at Davos, in Switzerland, this year and met Swedish activist Thunberg. The teenager used her own speech to angrily accuse the WEF of ignoring calls to cut fossil fuel use.

cannot protect every household, the Environment Secretary said. nThe UKs fourth named storm of the winter saw a months worth of rain in  hours and rampant mph winds this weekend, which led to three deaths. nA red weather warning - the highest threat level - was put in place yesterday by the Met Office as homes in Cardf were evacuated after the River Taff burst its banks and forecasters have warned several more days of misery will likely follow. nIt comes a week after Britain was brought to its knees by Storm Ciara which also caused chaos across the country. nBut new Environment Secretary George Eustice has told Sky News the Government will not be able to protect every house from flooding. nHe was adamant, however, that the floods caused by Storm Dennis had not caught Westminster off guard. nThats despite criticism from within the Conservative Party, that not enough has been learnt since the floods in . nThe Environment Agency has has doubled its severe flood warnings count for Monday in a matter of hours, with isolated properties near the River Lymn and Steeping just one of eight areas at risk.

Shortly before pm this evening a thunderstorm started raging above Plymouth in Devon. Emergency services were called to a home in the Crownhill area of the city following reports that it was ablaze, the Plymouth Herald reported. When they arrived they found the property well alight having apparently been hit by a lightning bolt. Fire fighters equipped with six appliances including an aerial ladder  were deployed to fight the flames. The emergency service workers were spotted entering the property equipped with head torches. Smoke could be seen billowing out of the roof of the home as flames ripped through the property.  The road has been closed off while the blaze it dealt with. By pm the worst of the fire appeared to have been put out.

He was insane, he would rip me to shreds every night and attack anything that moved, absolutely beserk.Touch wood heaposs fine now.  Heaposs even got  his own Facebook page.I do run all my business plans by him, people always think Iaposm joking but Iaposm not.  I talk to him andI have a stupid idea heaposll say aposno, think againapos. Out the back of the pub there is a bottle shop run by Natasha Vukic which sells craft ales, ciders, gins, rums and other unique refreshments. Despite certain limitations, particularly how dark and cold it can be, the Poltimore keeps many fans.

Paula, , from Bolton, Greater Manchester, was left with a feeling in her throat like Iaposve been smothered and with anxiety levels through the roof after receiving her first Universal Credit payment - and with it a major shock. And the situation is one which Jobcentre worker Carmel admits is crazy - and always happening. BBCaposs three-part documentary Universal Credit: Inside the Welfare State tonight focused on Bolton Jobcentre, one of the busiest in the North West, where  people move onto Universal Credit every month. Having recently moved in with her partner Aaron, the change of circumstances means Paula has to move onto Universal Credit from Job Seekers Allowance and Housing Benefit. She had been receiving £ a fortnight from JSA and Child Credit, but Universal Credit is paid a month in arrears - and she has no savings to see her through the five-week wait for the first payment. Hoping the wait doesnapost mess us up as it has done with a lot of people sheaposs known, she tells the cameras: A lot of people have killed themselves over it, havenapost they  Needing to pay for a school unorm for daughter Lexi, work coach Lorraine offers her an advance - essentially a Universal Credit loan - of £, to get her through. This will have to be paid back at £ a month, over  months. Paula is shown to be pleased with this, calling it common sense which puts her mind at rest. But she has no idea - and is not warned - about the reality of this aposadvanceapos, and how it will plunge her into debt from which she will struggle to recover. She tells the camera her family will be able to treat ourselves rather than wondering how we are going to live day to day. And three weeks on, Paula has been allowed a total of £, in advances.  She reveals she has spent it on bills, food, and clothing along with new footwear for herself, a haircut and new phone - decisions she will come to regret - and says itaposs been brilliant. With just seven days to wait until the first Universal Credit payment, sheaposs found itaposs not been too bad. She tells the cameras itaposs right that we treat ourselves as we werenapost born with a silver spoon in our f***ing a***s.  But a major shock is just round the corner for Paula as she gets through the five week wait only to find £. is deducted from her monthly Universal Credit payment. This leaves her with £ for the month - far less than she was expecting - which is roughly £ a day for herself, her partner Aaron, and daughter Lexi, to pay rent, food, bills - everything. She had been under the impression she would only see £ a month deducted to repay the advance - and had no idea about the other deductions.  And itaposs been taking its toll on mumaposs health. Itaposs a lot to take off somebody, she says.  £ for a family. Itaposs ridiculous. My stress levels have been through the roof. Iaposve been really anxious.

She adds: F***ing s*****st thing about Universal Credit is paying back the debt. I wouldnapost know where to start with getting a job.

Lee Solway - who hosts the Realm of the Supernatural with friend aposFinchyapos McFinch - said his co-host, along with an elderly couple, spotted the unsettling beast darting across the A recently. He is now hoping more witnesses come forward as the pair attempt the impossible - proving the existence of a seemingly supernatural creature.Referring to Finchyaposs account of the sighting, Lee, from Grimsby, North East Lincolnshire, said he saw a black mass about ft tall, reports HullLive.He thought it was a ghost at first, he explained. He could see it had a humanoid form but it was darker than night and it just moved across the road. We went back the next day and there was a hole in the bottom of the hedgerow so something could have crossed there. Soon after, Finchy also found and photographed what appear to be two severed aposdeer legsapos lying in the middle of the road nearby. I just think thataposs a little bit strange, Lee said. The picture quality isnapost great as it was taken from inside the car because he was a bit creeped out. You tell people about it and they say itaposs just poachers, and yes that does go on but why would a poacher stop on the A to butcher a deer carcass   Lee and Finchy will be appearing at the Research and Witness Convention  at Princes Quay Shopping Centre in Kingston upon Hull, East Riding of Yorkshire, from February  to March , to discuss some of the areaaposs most infamous cases. We want to seethere are other witnesses who could come forward, said Lee. The most famous tale of Hull and East Yorkshire folklore is the aposOld Stinkerapos, a half-man half-dog creature, mostly seen stalking the area around Barmston Drain, near Beverley. It was once reportedly seen eating a dog before being spooked by the onlookers and jumping over an ft fence with the poor dog still in its mouth. But that is far from the only strange sighting reported in the region. South of the river thereaposs been quite a few sightings of a half-deer, half-man creature very similar to the apospucaapos in Celtic folklore, Lee said. You also get Bigfoot sightings that run up and down the A. He said he and his co-host started the podcast after having dferent encounters with a shadow man and a UFO.Weaposd listened to other podcasts by people who hadnapost experienced this stuff and we had, so we just did it, he said. Their podcast is available on streaming sites including iTunes and Spoty and each episode gets thousand of hits, often heard by listeners as far afield as the US and Australia. Lee said his opinions on the supernatural are often met with scepticism, but he still believes there are more people out there yet to share their experiences. One of my mates was talking about this dog-man sighting and this guy suddenly got interested, he said.  He normally poo-poos this sort of thing this guy, who was in his s, but he asked what he was talking about and he told him and he said, aposWell thataposs what I ran over all them years ago.apos He said it had been a foggy morning driving his Mini, and he hit something crossing the road and it spun the Mini  degrees. He saw an animal lying there and it sprung up and turned round, with yellow eyes and the hind legs of a dog, and it just bounded off. And he had carried that with him for  years, so there are people out there. Now he is asking others to come forward to share there experiences, anonymouslyneed be, for them to discuss at the upcoming convention.

Elon Musk has done us proud.aposapos Autopilot is an advanced driver assistance system that enhances safety behind the wheel.  external cameras, a radar,  ultrasonic sensors and a powerful onboard computer provide an additional layer of safety to guide drivers on their journey.  Autopilot uses these features to see and sense the environment around the car. This robust sensor and camera suite provides drivers with an awareness of their surroundings that a driver alone would not otherwise have. A powerful onboard computer processes these inputs in a matter of milliseconds to help make your driving safer and less stressful. Active safety features made possible by Teslaaposs Autopilot hardware and software system include Automatic Emergency Braking which detects cars or obstacles that the car may impact and applies the brakes accordingly.

The police have told me that all three are fine so eight lives have quite literally saved due to this amazing car.aposapos Construction company director Josh Whitelock, , from Wimborne, was driving the other Tesla with his girlfriend, Kitty McConnell and her mum, Julia as passengers when the tree came down.  aposaposI was on Autopilot driving home when I saw a flash from the power line which lit up the tree as it fell. We stopped suddenly. There was a loud crack and then the sound of metal on metal.aposaposI was expecting to turn around and see my girlfriend and her mother impaled by branches but incredibly that wasnapost the case. They were both ok apart from a bit of whiplash. It was a miracle we all survived. aposaposI helped get them both out of the car and then checked on the other driver on the other side of the tree. When I saw the open Falcon door I couldnapost believe it.  aposaposWe were just in pure shock. Tesla has saved eight lives. aposaposIt just goes to show that le can be over in a split second but thanks to Tesla making amazing cars that wasnapost the case this time.aposapos Laurence said he was so thankful to the local community who came to the familyaposs aid. aposaposOur car has been written off but the landowner has given us his Range Rover Sport to use until we get sorted. aposaposAnother couple who saw what happened, Tony and Olga from Vines Farm took us to their home and kept the kids entertained and fed and watered us.aposapos  Storm Dennis continues to batter the country this morning. Eight aposdanger to leapos severe flood warnings have been issued but the Government cannot protect every household, the Environment Secretary said.

A study of , women showed nearly a quarter had no idea what purpose the pelvic floor muscle served - with some even thinking it was in the inner thigh. It also highlighted that  per cent were unaware that the uterus, or womb, were the same thing and its main role was to develop and grow babies. And ten per cent of women did not know that a weak pelvic floor is linked to bladder leakage. The Only Way is Essex star, who has partnered with Always Discreet, said: Women are conscious of their health, but can be unclear about the what vital parts of the body are actually there for - and how this affects them. Having experienced bladder leaks myself, I know how it can impact your le. At times, I was worried to leave the house and I avoided any kind of cardio exercise for so long. Understanding whataposs going on in your own body is so important to improving your health and happiness. We need to put more of a spotlight on womenaposs health, we shouldnapost be embarrassed about these topics. Many women claim they know that exercising their pelvic floor muscles can prevent and improve leaks - but they still donapost prioritise these in their daily routine.  Squeezing these muscles for a few minutes a day can make a big dference for many women. Itaposs definitely improved things for me and Iaposve now got the confidence to get back on the treadmill. Most women take regular exercise, aposme timeapos and a daily skincare routine, yet only eight per cent do their pelvic floor exercises once a day. And more than a third fail to these exercises all leaving them susceptible to being affected by bladder weakness. When asked what they do in order to strengthen their pelvic floor muscle,  per cent of women say they have attempted pelvic floor exercises, with three quarters believing itaposs possible to prevent or decrease bladder leakage through exercises.  Of those who do their pelvic floor exercises regularly, the most likely locations theyaposll take place are whilst watching TV on the sofa and in bed - and one in  will even do them on the bus. More than half of the women polled, via OnePoll, also thought that being fit and exercising regularly means youaposre less likely to suffer with bladder leaks. Always Discreet has enlisted gynaecologist Dr Anita Mitra - AKA The Gynae Geek - to encourage women to make pelvic floor exercises part of their daily routine.  She said: Bladder leaks are common in women of all ages. It doesnapost mean they should accept it as normal. Many do not realise that there are often simple things that can be done to help their situation. Talking to a GP or nurse is the first step, evenjust to put your mind at ease.

The harrowing footage was filmed on board a service from Oujda, Morocco to Brussels, Belgium, on Sunday evening. In the clip, terried passengers cling on tightly as the plane lurches from side to side while the pilots attempted to navigate through the stream of turbulent air. Some pious travellers are even moved to prayer fearing the worst while another can be heard retching due to motion sickness. The plane eventually landed in Charleroi airport while Storm Dennis raged.

Some areas in Wales and England experienced a monthaposs worth of rain in the space of  hours. Other footage filmed during the bad weather showed a ferry lurching from side to side as it battled high winds and violent waves.The heart-stopping clip shows how the CalMac ferry was buffeted by mph crosswinds as it tried to find port in Androssan Harbour, Scotland, on Friday.The crew of the MV Caledonian Isles were forced to take evasive action during the incident and have since been praised for their skillful navigation.

She would be so proud.“Even more importantly for us as a family is that Academy Street Dance Studio will continue to run and that’s a legacy it its own.“She always called the studio her extended family and that’s how it still is.”Offshore safety expert Mr Rae said: “When I was informed that I was chosen I was in disbelief.“As an Aberdonian born and bred it fills me with pride to be recognised as one of its everyday heroes.”Clan fundraiser Mr Taylor said: “I am shocked and also honoured to have been chosen for this award and I would like to thank my family and friends that nominated me.”Mr Brown said: “I’m delighted and humbled to be honoured by my city of birth and raising awareness of Clare’s Law is invaluable.”And Mr Ritchie added: “It feels amazing to be recognised in this way – thanks so much to everyone that nominated me.”Aberdeen Inspired community and environmental co-ordinator Angela Joss said: “While working on this project it became obvious to us that the everyday heroes had changed Aberdeen and the community around them.“We have six examples of amazing Aberdonians and it makes me really proud to be one.”Lord Provost of Aberdeen Barney Crockett praised the scheme and said each of those honoured was a “fabulous ambassador” for the city.And Mike Melvin, ACVO co-ordinator who was on the judging , said: “All nominations were outstanding and very inspiring.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2020/02/5e4cc3554b0e26.98372725-846x564.jpg ","title":"work continuing on aberdeen art gallery more than three months after opening","story":"Snagging work on Aberdeen’s multi-million-pound art gallery redevelopment is continuing – more than three months after it reopened.Work began in  on the massive £ million facelt of the A-listed Victorian building on Schoolhill in the city centre, which includes new exhibition spaces and a copper-clad roof.It opened to the public in November after suffering numerous delays.However “snagging” works on the roof are still being carried out – with contractors using scaffolding to access it.

That Pittodrie draw was the third successive game the Reds had failed to win at Pittodrie, having lost to St Johnstone and Motherwell.Although they suffered a defeat to the defending Premiership champions, Taylor hopes they righted a few wrongs with frustrated supporters.Aberdeen had left the pitch to boos in recent games at Pittodrie prior to facing Celtic.Taylor said: “The supporters saw a side that was determined to get the right result.“It was positive from all aspects of the game and it was important the fans saw that.“We could have taken a bit more care in front of goal and taken some more shots against Celtic.“It was a solid team performance.“We were disappointed as we thought we were worthy of a win after that performance.“For large spells we dominated the game as we got up against them and forced things to go our way.“We made sure Celtic didn’t get any flow to their game.“Celtic find a way to win games though and have been doing that for a long while now. That is why they are champions.”Aberdeen went behind to Celtic after just  minutes but responded with a superb goal from Taylor midway through the first half.The centre-back controlled a cross from Connor McLennan on his chest then fired home an unstoppable half volley.It was his first goal since resigning for Aberdeen last summer having spent two seasons in England.He said: “I had a bit to do but concentrated on the touch and getting it on target. Luckily it ended in the back of the net.“I have had a few chances to get on the score sheet this season and have been a little bit disappointed that I haven’t scored until now.”The -year-old centre-back was only passed fit to face Celtic less than  hours before kick-off.Taylor had missed the previous two games having limped off with a calf injury early on in the - home loss to St Johnstone.He came through a fitness test during training at Cormack Park on the eve of the game.It was a fortuitousfor manager Derek McInnes as Scotland international centre-back Mikey Devlin suffered an injury in training.Taylor said: “It was last minute really as hewas trying to manage it.“It was on Saturday that he was struggling a little bit and they tried to give him full recovery.“I am disappointed on Mikey’s behalf that he has got that injury at the minute.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2020/02/SNS-19856182-Aberdeen-v-Celtic-scaled.jpg ","title":"it was not a penalty admits dons star","story":"Connor McLennan admits he should not have had a penalty in Aberdeen’s - defeat to Celtic.However, the Dons winger maintains that there was contact which prompted him to go down in the penalty area.McLennan was booked for ing by referee Andrew Dallas during the first half when he went down in the box as he skipped beyond Hoops defender Christopher Jullien.The -year-old was keen to set the record straight about the incident and said: “This is a chance to clear it up.“Believe it or not there is actually contact.“The first challenge that comes is fine and there isn’t contact.“I took my next step to go to the ball and as I do that my trailing leg is clipped by the top of his foot.“I couldn’t see that because I was past the challenge by that point, but as heraised his foot off the ground I felt it clip my trailing leg and that was why my fall was delayed.“I think after it people saw in my reaction that there had been a clip and Kristoffer Ajer said after the incident that he heard the contact.“Looking back on it I’d say it’s not a e, but I don’t think it’s a penalty either.”The TV replays of the incident tell a dferent story to McLennan’s version of events and as a result he has received some flak about the incident.He says he understands why he has been criticised, but insists he was not trying to con ref Dallas.McLennan added: “I got a bit of stick for it from a lot of people, hopefully what I’ve said has cleared it up a bit.“There was contact there, although it was after the initial challenge.“I’ve yet to see a TV angle where it shows the incident in my favour, so I understand why I’ve had stick.“It’s not my game to do that and I wasn’t trying to trick the referee or anything like that.“I don’t want to be involved in things like that and it’s not something that’s in my nature.“Hopefully that clears it up and we can move on from it now.”Despite Sunday’s defeat to Celtic, McLennan felt there were positives for Aberdeen to take ahead of this evening’s Scottish Cup replay against Kilmarnock at Rugby Park.The Dons controlled large swathes of the contest and McLennan believes they need to produce a similar level of performance on a regular basis.He said: “I think overall it was a good performance, but the result just didn’t go our way.“That maybe shows why Celtic are champions because they found a way to get a result.“But we set a benchmark in terms of the performance and anything less than that isn’t good enough really.”"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column december 27 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLooking back over the last  months, no single story has dominated the headlines in these pages, but there have been important themes.There are the negative trends, of course.

All have end-stage organ failure, be it kidney, liver, lung or heart, and require a le-saving transplant.Organs for transplant usually come from bodies of people who agreed to donate before death. But as this does not produce enough organs, both Scotland and England plan to bring in an #opt out# system, meaning that on death a person#s agreement to organ donation is assumed unless they had actively opted out.Live donation is an alternative to awaiting a cadaveric organ. As people can live happily with one kidney or half a liver, family members or altruistic iniduals sometimes offer to donate these organs. Since matching donor and recipient tissue-type, however, is generally required these donations are not always acceptable.Now groups of tissue-type incompatible donor recipient pairs are getting together to mix and match, producing duos who are tissue-type-compatible. So let#s say Annie is rejected as a kidney donor for her sister Jean for incompatibility reasons, and similarly, Arthur is rejected as kidney donor for Jim. But pairing donor Annie with recipient Jim and Arthur with Jean could lead to two successful transplants. A recent report from the US describes the first ever bi-organ exchange involving a liver-kidney swap * .In this specic case a daughter wished to donate a kidney to her mother with renal failure but was rejected because she might later develop the same kidney problem. So she offered half of her liver in exchange for a kidney for her mother. Another donor was eventually identied who wanted to donate half her liver to her sister with liver failure but was rejected because her liver was too small. But she was cleared for kidney donation. So on the day of the swap four operations took place and two needy people received le-giving new organs.Although not presently being considered in the UK, with the ethical issues sorted, this multi-swap procedure opens the way for extended chains of donors and many more lives saved.*Torres et al Am J transplant. :-."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column january 10 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCouncillors wil be put in an unenviable position when they finally decidewhere the axe will fall on council services.But exactly how much Argyll and Bute will have to spend will not be known until the daffodils are beginning to pop through the ground.

From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community. More of the same meritorious awards for the ordinary people of Scotland please.Credit to all editors and staff for their outstanding journalism given over the years in all of Scotlands progressive, thriving local papers.Stephen Jones, Oban"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures january 3 2020 2","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThis week#s photograph whas been submitted by Tom Cullen of Ardfern.The serene scene was taken overlooking the Crinan estuary at about .am on Friday January ."},{"url":null,"title":"lochgilphead bowls into 2020","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead Bowling Club launched into the new year with the first of its indoor singles competitions.Some  members played for the Argyll Arms Ardrishaig trophy on Saturday January  and after some great matches throughout the afternoon it was Alan Guy and Neil Ward that progressed to the final.In a closely fought final, Neil Ward edged the victory in the last end, winning -."},{"url":null,"title":"tarberts senior citizens party the night away","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowWet and windy weather failed to dampen the spirits of Tarbert’s seniors as they gathered in the village hall for the senior citizens# Christmas dinner.A large number of willing volunteers had organised a sumptuous meal and decked the hall with multi-coloured fairy lights and balloons to provide a warm welcome for their guests.The familiar venue quickly came alive with smiles, hugs and the happy chatter of friends gathering for this much-loved annual event which has been going for more than  years.Elma McGougan and Jean Johnston, who had served on the original organising committee, reminisced about their experiences, explaining they ran fund-raising events and that many in the village donated money and goods so the dinner could be provided free of charge.The event, held this year on Friday January , is still organised by a committee and continues to be generously supported by businesses and iniduals in the village and surrounding area.Elma said: #In the s, the women on the committee made soup and brought it along. We did not have the new kitchen then. The hotel has always cooked the turkeys for us but cooking big pots of potatoes and vegetables was quite a job with just the gas rings. Back then, we had ice-cream and jelly for dessert.#Jean added: #It was all good fun and we had loads of laughs.#Elma continued: #We used to have sales to raise money for the dinner. Santa was on the stage and Jean’s children were his elves. They were only little then.#We modelled the clothes and the older women loved the bargains. We thought they were old, but they were probably the age we are now,# Elma said laughing. #We would shout #Roll up, roll up# to get them to come and see what we had on offer.#After a warm welcome from compère Martin Jefferies and a prayer of thanks for the food, the five-course meal was expertly served by members of the organising committee and their youthful helpers.A raffle, again free of charge, saw a large number of guests receive prizes and no-one was left disappointed as the remainder of the guests received selection boxes.Tarbert’s seniors showed they know how to party as dancers left their seats and enthusiastically took to the floor as soon as the musical entertainment began.A stunned Margaret Henderson was named #Citizen of the Year#, confessing she never expected to win the award.For more than  years, Margaret has collected money to support the Tarbert Sea Food Festival and Music Festival. Later, Margaret dressed up as Mrs Brown from Mrs Brown’s Boys to entertain the audience, something for which she is well-known.Martin Jefferies thanked everyone who had helped make the evening such a success with the happy gathering agreeing with loud applause.By Joan Crooks"},{"url":null,"title":"winning start to new year for star youths","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe Now kicked off with a flying start for both Red Star s and s.The s headed to Glasgow in a top of the table clash against Glasgow Boys.

A wee van and a motorbike were behind them at the time and they let them pass and they disappeared down the twisty road at an incrediblespeed.They reached Tighnabruaich at about  o#clock and saw Fulmar in the water, but when they stopped to speak to Johnny Malcolm and Donald Turner they were told she was not in the water more than # an hour and still not fully rigged. They were quite right but George Smith said they were busy getting Psyche ready for launchingbut they would be out first thing in the morning to bend on the sails and finish off the rigging.They got their storesin the yard and with these and their luggage went aboard in two trips. Things were soon put sufficiently enough in order to allow them to get to bed and after watching Psyche go down the slip they were soon in their bunks. It was a beautully clear evening but distinctly cold.Next morning they were up at sevenand about eight the yard men came out and finished up their jobs. Jimmy Smith fixed up the slipping clutch and suggested we do away with the present gear lever fancy arrangement which was not strong enough for its work. This the Skipper agreed to though it meant a less handy working but it did away with the pin and shield that broke up the dog-house seat, they being replaced by a removable hatch cover. It certainly made sitting in the dog-house more comfortable.The Skipper went ashore to the village for meat and some curtain hooks while Archie watered ship and the other two continued cleaning and clearing up aboard.At quarter to twelve they were away under full sail and in brilliant sunshine but with a cold north-westerly they ran to Ardlamont then beat up to Tarbert, being passed just outside Tarbert as an aeroplane flew close overhead, by Blink. They noticed a huge oil tanker doing trials just off Arran.They were anchored off the herring pier before  o#clock and they had supper-cum-lunch then went ashore. The Pilot to visit a friend, the others to get milk in the village then to walk to the end of the road on Loch Fyne. On their way they spoke to an enthusiastic English pair, working in their garden, who wanted to know off which yacht they had come.During the evening Arcturus and Tunnag came in and one or two motor boats. Zaidie was in when they arrived and Leonora was anchored across Loch Fyne in Buck Bay.All aboard, Margaret and Archie went off to the islet in the harbour to get some roots for their new garden then soon afterwards all turned in, for though it was a glorious looking evening it was perishingly cold and the stove, lit as soon as they anchored, had been very welcome.On Sunday they were again up early and found a dull overcast day. The Pilot, ashore for water, heard a poor weather forecastfrom a fishing board. On the strength of this they hurried breakfast and by  o’clock were away with a south-westerly breeze.The Skipper gave the first beacon a rap with the boom-end as they ran out of the harbour. The beat down to Ardlamontand thee ran the engine for five minutes to get out of a nasty lop. The sun came out for about five minutes but by the time they had reached the Carry Buoythe rain had started and it got heavier and heavier.The wind strengthened with the rain and they moved up very fast into Tighnabruaich Bay then up to Loch Riddon to anchor off the pier at Ormidale. As they passed Tighnabruaich they saw Torridon was on Fulmar’s mooring and they watched her crew panicking to get off before Fulmar arrived. They wondered what the Torridons said when they saw Fulmar pass on through and realised that they could have stayed where they were. As they passed Glen Caladh the new Jansi of Kames passed under a not very healthy-sounding engine.They had lunch and the stove was lit then Margaret and Archie went ashore to visit friends and when they came back they brought with them a big sack of coal . The late afternoon and evening were spent below talking and listening to the rain hammering on the deck.Monday morning it was dry but blowing hard. They got the anchor early and motored to the moorings. The sails were hoisted to dry them and St Roma came close by to make their number and at one time a big school of thrasher whales went through the Kyles heading east and at a great speed.About noon they went ashore for a visit to the hotel and for a run round the Ardlamont road . Back aboard they had lunch and soon after packed up and came home."},{"url":null,"title":"the cinema on wheels returns","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe screen machine will be rolling back into Mid Argyll at the end of the month.Bringing with it a host of movies for film fans the Screen Machine will be in Campbeltown Road car park in Tarbert from Wednesday January  to Thursday January  and Lochgilphead Resource Centre car park from Friday January  to Sunday February .Musical fantasy film Cats, based on the Andrew Lloyd Webber stage musical, features an ensemble cast including James Corden, Judi Dench, Jason Derulo, Idris Elba, Jenner Hudson, Ian McKellen, Taylor Swt, Rebel Wilson, and Francesca Hayward.Also known as Star Wars: Episode IX, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is an epic space-opera film.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"hair raising happenings at the co op","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead Co-op staff are on a fundraising mission which they hope will raise awareness and help overcome stigma around mental illness.Trusting her hairdresser Nicky MacDougall, from Casa in Ardrishaig, Tina Holloway will have her hair shaved off to raise funds for the Scottish Association for Mental Health .Explaining why she decided to take on the challenge, Tina said: #I didn#t really think before I opened my mouth.

This is a stunning route and the views over the Sound of Jura to the islands of Islay and Gigha are a rich reward for screaming muscles on the testing climbs.This will be the third year this increasingly popular event will take to the road. As it is a sportive, the Kilberry Loop is a non-competitive event and at just short of  miles long is perfect for a first-time competitor. Of course, for more competitive cyclists who want to push themselves or who are in training, the Kilberry Loop Sportive is a great event to get a personal best.The quicker cyclists in  managed the course # which has almost  metres of climbing # in under two hours, which is quick, and there are others who complete the course inside a comfortable four hours, so there is room for all abilities.Around  cyclists of all ages took part last year, with a couple of gentlemen in their early s and those in their twenties joining in # and organisers hope this year#s sportive will attract even more athletes.To make the event even more attractive Mid Argyll Cycling and Triathlon Club hopes to include race timing for the first time. And, for the third year, the Kilberry Loop Sportive is supported by British Cycling, the nation’s largest cycling organisation and national governing body for cyclesport, which actively helps and encourages people to get into cycling.If you’d like to sign up for this year’s Kilberry Loop Sportive or want more information visit the Mid Argyll Cycling and Triathlon Club website."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part four","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAs crew for our cruise we were lucky, as we have been for the four previous years, and were able to get both the Doctor and Pilot to come again. The Purser, however, found the lure of the theatre too great and she decided to spend her holidays working with a Repertory Company in Aberdeen.Again we were lucky in having a ready-made substitute in Chris Paterson, the Pilot’s we of nearly a year’s standing. We gave her the rank of Tanky – a piece of gunroom slang meaning the midshipman who trots around with the navigator or, in other words the Pilot’s Mate.As usual at the beginning of a cruise we got up early – .am – and quickly finished up our packing, loaded the car, shut up the house, and were on our road by ten minutes past seven. It was a fine bright morning with a light southerly breeze and quite promising though the weather forecast the night before had been not too cheerful. It was dead low water at Renfrew Ferry and as there was a big convoy of Army Transports crossing from north to south there was no delay in our getting across and at .am we were at the top of The Rest having had an easy and practically trafficless trip up Loch Lomond. Twenty minutes later we had Inveraray behind us.We called in at the BRS Depot at Lochgilpheadand collected our three boxes of stores and at ten to ten arrived at Crinan having passed several yachts already making their way east. The basin was busy with in it, amongst others, Arcturus, Vivien, Makoya, Boomerang, and Tookay, most of which were homeward bound. The Fulmar was lying at the back of the basin outside a motor boat and Vanda and as we unloaded the car we had a long carry round and everything was dumped on the basin wall before being taken aboard. Luckily it was turning into a lovely day. The only fly in the ointment was the poor Major – he had developed a paralysis of his back legs the day before and could do nothing but sit where put and look pitully about and only occasionally managed to drag himself a foot or two.The Mate and Bosun after being treated to tea on board Vivien got down to unpacking and stowing our gear and while they were about it the Doctor arrived with his gear and plentul supplies of Medical Comforts, a huge cake, packets of chocolate and a big box of chocolates. Dumping his stuff with the rest on deck he and the Skipper then went to the hotel and drank success to the cruise. They learnt that the night before had been a bit of a night and Arcturus was still showing its effects rather markedly.While the Mate continued the storing the Bosun got petrol and paraffin and the Tar went up to the farm for milk and at half past twelve they, with the Doctor, had lunch. Meanwhile the Skipper had gone to Ardrishaig and got a lot of fresh storesa new screwdriver, and meths. Being too early for the steamer he, after having had a beer at The Anchor, sat on a seat near the pier and had his lunch of six cookies and a sausage roll and listened to the Test Match on a portable set a man sharing the seat had with him .The Pilot and Tanky duly came off the steamer and by half past one all were aboard and the final gear stowing was completed. The car was parked on the steep hill between the farm and the basin and the batteries were disconnected then, while the Bosun, Doctor and Pilot, shted Fulmar to outside Melora on the east wall, the Skipper and Mate went up to the shop and got some strawberry tarts.At half past two the Karma came in from sea and we went into her water but had to wait in the lock for a wee motor boat whose owner had not turned up but was due soon. While we waited a man from a big Belfast motor boat that was lying in the basin spoke to the Skipper and complimented him on the sailing directions and thanked him for them. The Skipper did his best not to look smugly gratied. We filled in the waiting time by having a cup of coffee and one was handed up to the Doctor who was waiting to see us sail.At five past three we were away under engine being waved on our way by the Doctor and promising to be at Tobermory on the following Friday to pick him up. As the wind was light west-south-west we kept the motor going until we could fetch the Dorus Mor then up went the sails and beer was indulged in to mark the start of the cruise.We went nicely for a little but the wind fell very light. An unknown yacht and Mimosa were coming south and, against the flood tide, were making nothing of it. We passed close by the latter and spoke to John Hamilton then as we headed up for the Ardluing buoy we could see her being pushed slowly back to the northwards stern first. We, too, were being carried too far to the eastward and the engine went on to get us into the Scarba Sound stream and we kept it going till up to Leica Point where the wind came away again, this time from the true west.The tide rips at Fladda were in very good form and we fairly roared through the narrows and on up to Easdale but thereafter the breeze went flukey and light ying between north-west and south-west but, as the sun was shining brightly, it was very pleasant slipping along slowly in the smooth water. There was no sign of the usual heavy swell one expects to meet either side of Easdale Point. Away up to the north between Duart and Loch Don we could see half a dozen boats, led by Cerigo, making their way south.At six o’clock we heard a poor forecast promising rain and strong winds to come and listened for a while to the Test Match and heard of the collapse of the Australians in the st innings. The glass was slowly but steadily coming back and we feared the forecast was probably on the right lines.As we came round the north-west point of Seil Island and headed over for Dun Island off Puilladobhrain the wind died and the sea turned to glass so we got the sails down and stowed and the motor was started up.As we approached Puilladobhrain we saw a nished yawl coming down from the Oban direction under power and she passed in just ahead of us. As we were to learn later she was the Sol and at her helmwas a #bearded ancient# with a shock of white hair and a white beard. As we rounded the Fulmar Beacon we passed Kerlo coming out. In the anchorage were two motor boats and as we went slowly up to the south end of the pool we passed far too close to the bows of one of them owing to the Skipper misjudging the tidal drt. One of the crew came hurriedly out on to her forecastle and frowned at us as we slipped past with only inches to spare.It was dead calm when we anchored at half past seven but we were sorry to see that the drop in the glass was now being accelerated."},{"url":null,"title":"man-scottish-university-in-isolation-tested-coronavirus","story":"A MAN who is a member of the university community at Heriot Watt University is being tested forcoronavirus, it has emerged.In a statement posted on Twitter, university officials confirmed the man, who has not been identied, is undergoing tests and they are \"taking extra care to ensure the safety of the inidual and the entire campus community.\"Earlier on Thursday, staff sent an email to all of its students based on the Edinburgh campus informing them that the person concerned was being kept in isolation and was being tested for the deadly virus as a \"precautionary measure\" but assured them that risk of infection \"remains low\".A Heriot Watt University spokesman confirmed the person being tested is male.Ann Marie Dalton-Pillay, secretary of the university, said: ldquoA member of our University community at our Edinburgh Campus is in precautionary self-isolation while they await the results of a test for coronavirus.ldquoThe health and wellbeing of our students, staff and visitors is of paramount importance and I would like to offer reassurance that nothing has been confirmed at this time.ldquoThe University remains open as usual and we will noty our students and staff of the outcome of the test once it is known.

After the session, as the children were heading for lunch, a girl from the class came up and said: ldquoI think the moral in that tale is that we should be kind, but that itrsquos often not easy to do.It was a traditional tale in which the tables are turned on a selfish rich man who had shown no compassion, but then hoped for kindness when he was the one in need. In the brief discussion with this young person, we agreed that itrsquos easier to show kindness to someone who we believe truly deserves it.She told me: ldquoI think the woman in the story did the right thing butIrsquom being honest,it had been me I donrsquot knowIrsquod have been able to be kind like her, because Irsquod have wanted revenge. Thatrsquos the problem, I think, we always think about revenge first. It can make us feel better for a short while but really makes things worse, well at least not better anyway. I try to be kind, sometimes it isnrsquot easy, but I try. Kindness is like a seed we have to plant.I shouldnrsquot have been bowled over by this, for I know a -year-old can have wisdom that many so called grown-ups have forgotten. But I was deeply impressed by her reflection on the storyrsquos message, and her honesty and integrity.This conversation also revealed the power of stories to raise moral dilemmas and human issues without finger pointing or being preachy.And she is right, it can often be very dficult to be kind. The world seems so full of stress, selfishness, anger and intolerance that there seems little space for kindness, except towards those we love and care about. On top of that, it seems increasingly dficult to survive, keep a roof above our heads and pay the bills. Kindness begins at home and often there is little energy, emotion or resources left to think or care about others we arenrsquot responsible for.There can even be a real fear thatwe show lsquotoo muchrsquo kindness we risk becoming a doormat, being used or treated unfairly. We can sometimes watch a child being kind to another and it not being reciprocated, and the temptation then is to suggest kindness isnrsquot shown next time.ldquoWe need to teach people a lesson, is often the mantra which derails our instinct to be kind another way of saying we want revenge. And letrsquos be honest: cruel, uncaring and selfish people can take advantage of someonersquos kindness and revenge does often make us feel better, in the short term anyway.But is the answer to allow unkind behaviour to frame the way we want to live and be treated  Do we respond to unkindness with more unkindness in   So consequently, cruelty with more cruelty, intolerance with more intolerance, selfishness with yet more selfishness  Doesnrsquot this mean that we allow lsquothe lessonrsquo to be that kindness doesnrsquot pay  As Gandhi is famously reported to have said: ldquoAn eye for an eye only ends up making the whole world blind.The truth is, kindness is not weakness but strength. It often isnrsquot easy and takes great courage. It doesnrsquot mean that people should not face consequences for their actions, or that people should be asked to forgive the unforgivable. But it does mean not allowing the unkindness of others to define how we are. We should not allow such acts to clip our butterfly wings.What do I mean by this  There is a theory called the lsquobutterfly effectrsquo. In this theory, it is said that the flapping of a butterflyrsquos wings could cause a chain reaction in which a hurricane could be caused on the other side of the planet. It is not meant to be taken literally, but to show that a very small act, although seemingly insignicant in itself, can have huge, unforeseen repercussions.In this way, kindness is a butterfly. Small acts of kindness may have a huge effect that touches people beyond the knowledge of the person who displayed the kindness. Acts of cruelty and hate also have the same power but all the more reason to flutter the wings of kindness so the wind more likely blows in the right direction.In this way, our behaviour is a butterfly. The way we flap its wings can have huge unforeseeable consequences, either for good or bad, both for ourselves and others. When we are kind, we actually makes ourselves happier too.So to make a real dference, we need only do tiny acts that are easily within our power, and as often as we can. A smile, a moment you truly listen to someone, a helping hand, holding the door open, trying to understand how someone feels, making a cup of tea, not meeting anger with anger, trying not to gain revenge but a change of heart and so on.This is what will truly make up the index of a healthy and happy society. And all of us can be players in this, and beneficiaries of our own kindness.David W Orr, a professor of environmental studies and politics, has said: ldquoThe plain fact is that the planet does not need more successful people.

When the fire effect is switched on, it gives an impressive imitation of a real one.Our small terraced house once had a real fire place, of course, but like so many it was modernised before I moved in, and it was filled in and central heating installed.Yet I am old enough to have lived all my childhood in the lsquos and lsquos without experiencing central heating! It did exist, of course, just not in the houses I lived in as a child!One memory I have is of arriving home from school on a cold winterrsquos afternoon and seeing the smoke coming from the chimney of the church house we lived in at the east end of the Pans. My father had lit the fire early and I still remember its welcoming warmth, and the way it crackled and danced as it defrosted my face and hands. Me and my brothers sat by it, jostling for the best space.Donrsquot get me wrong, Irsquom not complaining about central heating! I know Irsquom lucky to have a warm house and never take it for granted. We donrsquot use the lsquofirersquo for heat, that would be too expensive. But we switch it on for atmosphere. And the effect on the younger kids has been immediate. They sit by it, lie on blankets by it reading and playing and telling stories. I forget that they have little personal experience of having a hearth, even an articial one. The novelty will wane, perhaps, but I hope the cosy pleasure of it wonrsquot.Itrsquos not just the kids, as my we and I love sitting by it in the evening. Wersquove even moved some of the furniture, so this pretend but convincing fireplace, rather than the telly, has become the main focal point of the living room.You could say Irsquom easily pleased, and I suppose thatrsquos true. But our friends have commented on it too, one saying ldquoit really has given your house a dferent atmosphere as he sat by it with the wind howling outside.The hearth has traditionally been the soul of a house. The family would sit by it, soak in the warmth and watch the flames, while telling stories and talking. It was a draw for social communion. Visitors would be welcomed with a place by it and most of the cooking would have taken place there too. The old saying ldquolang may yer lums reekindicated the importance of a lit hearth as a symbol of wellbeing and good fortune.No wonder so many traditions and ceremonies were centred around the hearth. People used to leave objects buried within or near it. There were ious reasons for this: to capture bad spirits that may come down the chimney, for good luck or to deflect a witchrsquos spell. The hearth was seen as a kind of spiritual portal, to be defended and made safe, not just physically.The hearth was also a focus of many ceremonies that marked the changing seasons. The Celtic calendar is full of such events, Imbolc being the most recent. And of course there were the daily rituals of banking up the fire at night, and reviving it in the morning, and keeping it going. All these simple tasks are now fast fading into folk memory.Today, screens are more likely to be the focal point of our homes. Itrsquos kind of unavoidable, of course, and I claim no moral high ground of this issue. But the truth is they drug our senses and dull our conviviality, and, like many parents, we have tried to limit their use in our house. It has felt like a losing battle with my children who, I understand, live in a very dferent childhood to mine. And I readily concede itrsquos got lots of benefits, even though at times I may sound like an old dinosaur lamenting the passing of the Jurassic age.But the arrival of our fake woodburning stove has transformed our house in a way that shows we have lost something in the lsquomodernisingrsquo of our homes. As a storyteller, I have come to understand the importance of a hearth as a focal point for gathering it has the power to bring people together, to share warmth and light but also each otherrsquos presence and social connection. As the freezing wind rages outside, it is a magical space.That magic has been the true gt from my storyteller friend, and she wisely knew it. While much is missing from an articial fire, including the smell and sound of the real thing, our ancestral instinct still kicks in by the visual sight of a flickering hearth.So now my instructions to switch off the screens is more readily obeyed, because it signals time to get together around the fire and lsquobe together properlyrsquo to tell stories and challenge each other with riddles.Burnrsquos poem The Cotterrsquos Saturday Night now has new meaning in our house:To meet their dad, wi flichterin noise and glee.His wee bit ingle, blinkin bonilie,His clean hearth-stane, his thrty wiersquos smile,The lisping infant, prattling on his knee,Does arsquo his weary kiaugh and care beguile,An makes him quite forget his labor and his toil."},{"url":null,"title":"waterside-bistro-chief-takes-castle-inn-dirleton","story":"Brothers Jack and James Findlay have been at the helm of the Waterside Bistro, next to the River Tyne in Haddington, for more than two-and-a-half years.The eaterie was founded by their dad Jim, who also previously ran The Drovers Inn in East Linton, and The Rocks on Dunbarrsquos Marine Road.Now, Jack is expanding the empire by taking over The Castle Inn.He told the Courier: ldquoWe have had quite a soft opening, we just opened yesterday [last Wednesday].ldquoI think the area is lovely and my dad was born in Dirleton, so there is a little bit of heritage there.ldquoWe will be basing it a lot on the Waterside model and obviously myself and my brother will be working alongside each other but from afar.ldquoWe have had tremendous success at the Waterside and we both felt it was probably the right time to look where.ldquoThe Castle Inn was the perfect fit for us.ldquoIt will be myself here and my brother is still based in Haddington.ldquoMy dad is lsquoretiredrsquo but will just be popping in and making sure we are going in the right direction.Twenty-eight-year-old Jack said they already had a good team in place and there were no plans for any ldquodrastic changes.A focus would be placed on locally sourced food, with a daily list of specials.He added: ldquoI would also like to mention the former owners John Dawson and Bert DrsquoAgostino, and want to pay a bit of a tribute to them for their fine work in the trade.ldquoJohn has been fantastic with me and very helpful."},{"url":null,"title":"bench-put-place-memory-tranent-legend-bobby-marr","story":"Bobby Marr, who ran a greengrocer and florist on Tranentrsquos Winton Place for nearly  years, passed away last July.The -year-old was a familiar face to many in Tranent town centre, with hundreds attending his funeral.Marion Hoggan was heavily involved in the fundraising for the bench for Mr Marr, who had colon cancer.She said: ldquoI did not manage the funeral due to work commitments and I felt that I wanted to do something for him.

When he was work and pensions secretary he once warned a Treasury official who had challenged his universal credit plans thathe didnt fall into line he would be \"eating his own balls for breakfast\".\"Mr Cummings has also started to see the \"department that likes to say no\" as the biggest impediment to his campaign to \"level up\" the regions by pouring money into the so-called \"red wall\" seats in the north and Midlands that switched from Labour to Conservative at the last election.\"She added: \"This is more about power than policy.

To those who thought the argument over equality of the sexes had been won long ago, it may come as a surprise that such events have taken so long.

But devolved domestic issues are rather dull for a party and Government that has aspirations to secession, eventhey are the bread and butter of the majority of citizens.Jill Stephenson, Edinburgh EH.WHY does the Scottish Government have a Minister for Europe John Dunlop, Ayr.THE juxtaposition of letters by Carol Vanzetta and Willie Macleangathers criticism of politicians and letter-writers who simply rail against those they disagree with. Further, Ms Vanzetta encourages politicians to present positive suggestions for what it is possible to deliver. I wholeheartedly agree with that approach. Criticising opponents simply saps energy and wastes time allowing others, mainly Westminster, to fiddle, as they say, while peripheries burn.Like Mr Maclean I agree that independence only relates to the SNP insofar as that being the political party most likely to create a means to deliver it. Independence is a choice in how we govern ourselves. Post-independence, I expect the SNP to alter fundamentally as its core purpose changes, perhaps merge with the LibDems on the centre ground or even cease to exist after a few years. The Greens will likely stay the same but Conservative and Labour will need toto basic principles once they become Scottish parties, without external constraint, when I would expect them consequently to gain support.But letrsquos use our experience and imagination at the moment to consider how Scotland could develop rather than constantly do each other down as seems to be the current fashion.John C Hutchison, Fort William.FOLLOWING the letters from Robert IG Scott and the serial doomsayer, Dr Gerald Edwards , I feel moved to reply. At least Dr Edwardsrsquos letter is brief, so Irsquoll start with that one. I think his reference to the former SNP Finance Secretary was something of a low blow, and certainly not worthy of a serious political commentator. He talks up Jackson Carlaw, and says itrsquos ldquodefinitely time for a change in Scottish politics. Exactly who are we to appoint to transform Scotland: Mr Carlaw, Richard Leonard or Willie Rennie  Canrsquot see it myself.Mr Scottrsquos letter is even more troubling. He writes about the Union being basically the most signicant event in our history , without mentioning the devious, and frankly criminal means by which it was achieved. Parcel of rogues anyone Irsquom unsure why he thinks Nicola Sturgeon is ldquoliving on borrowed time, when the SNP has won every election at all levels since , and still holds a more than healthy lead in all opinion polls. Indeed, Yes is also moving steadily towards a win at the next independence referendum.He writes about the Scottish economy being in dire straits, though by all accounts it continues to outperform England and Wales in virtually every measurable area, despite often having its hands tied behind its back by UK fiscal arrangements. Mr Scott also mistakenly conflates the EU with the UK Union: they are very dferent beasts, plus the UK seems to be the only one of the EU members that wants to leave. Everybody out of step apart from us He speaks of the EU as being ldquoemphatically less than democratic. I give you Dominic Cummings.Ian M Baillie, Alexandria.THE letter from Alasdair Gallowayis headed \"So just what will it take for Indyref to be granted \". In previous correspondence, he and others of a similar mind consider this to be a denial of democracy.Thats as may be, but I wonderone of the reasons why we of the Unionist persuasion are not so keen is because Nicola Sturgeon did not simply request a Section  order for a further independence referendum, she wished that the powers to hold referenda be passed to Holyrood on a permanent basis.This would mean that, in the event that any second independence referendum did not deliver the desired result from the SNPs point of view then within weeks, it would be cranking up preparations for Indyref   , or however many it thought necessary to bludgeon us into a state of abject surrender.Christopher W Ide, Waterfoot.Read more: So just what will it take for Indyref to be granted "},{"url":null,"title":"scotland-centre-new-space-race-uks-first-launch-site","story":"The most northerly outpost of Britain, Unst in the Shetland Isles, is anticipating a tourism boom as plans have been unveiled for a privately funded project to build a satellite launch site which could send tourists into space.More than poundmillion has been poured into the proposals by investors but planning permission has yet to be submitted to the Shetland Islands Council.:Spaceport vision falls back to earthIn Sutherland, Caithness, the UK Space Agency plans to build a vertical launch site, with plans submitted to Highland Council on February  and construction is expected to start this year.However, the pound. million Space Hub Sutherland will not cater to lsquospace touristsrsquo - unlike the Shetland Space Centre.A report commissioned by the UK Space Agency had identied Unst as the best spot in Britain for launching small satellites into space.Crofters on the tiny island have welcomed plans for the Shetland Space Centre and have agreed to lease land in a bid to make it happen.And the local authority welcomed the pound,, investment from private equity firm Leonne International.Chair of the councilrsquos development committee, Alastair Cooper, said: ldquoThis announcement of private equity funding for the Shetland Space Centre is positive news.ldquoThe council is committed to supporting local economic opportunities and we hope to maximise the benefit for Unst and Shetland as this project develops.

Our interest in the customer doesn’t end when they purchase a vehicle, we make sure they get good service afterwards.” This commitment to customers extends to the wider community at large, with Steve always making the effort to give back and ensure that Inverurie shares in IK’s success. He said: “In Inverurie there is a particularly strong sense of community. Even though it’s expanded considerably, that sense of cohesion is still there, and we love to be a part of that.“Every year we try and do what we can to give something back. On our th anniversary we raised over £, for CLAN. Last August, we organised a ball at Meldrum house and raised over £, for Macmillan Cancer Support.”“We support local football teams and local sports in general, but I can’t take sole credit for what we do, without the support of my family, friends, the business, and the people in and around the town it wouldn’t be possible.” data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Storm Ciara damage.\"  Storm Ciara:  of the most shocking photos of the damage flooding left in its wake viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Looking to the future, Steve shows no signs of slowing down having recently entered the property development sector and is near completion of a new build facility for international supplier screw fix, with a number of other projects in the pipeline."},{"url":null,"title":"inverurie auctioneer join iaas","story":"An auctioneer from Inverurie has been welcomed to the Institute of Auctioneers and Appraisers in Scotland .Ellis Mutch is one of six Scottish students in year three of the Livestock Market Operations and Management course at Harper Adams University in Shropshire and was presented with his associate membership certicate by IAAS President Scott Donaldson.The certicate in higher education he is working towards is seen as the professional standard for entry into the livestock auctioneering sector.

It’s always very interesting when we get an unusual request like this, and we’re delighted to be able to help restore a building of such signicant historical interest.”The building slowly fell into a state of decline and in  was declared unsafe by the fire department.Two years later it was bought by a developer and the major refurbishment will see the building reopen its doors as a plush hotel, with retail space and a number of private apartments.The pillars have been produced, polished and finished at Fyfe Glenrock’s base in Oldmeldrum and are now being shipped to the USA where, said Mr Collinson, they will not look out of place.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.ellontimes webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Respitality support worker Ann Brodie alongside colleagues from Energie Fitness\"  ‘Respitality’ links to support carers viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"February ,  at : amNorthern Isles MSPs, Liam McArthur and Beatrice Wishart, met yesterday, Tuesday, with the newly appointed Scottish finance secretary, Kate Forbes, to reinforce the need for the government to honour its commitment to fair funding for internal ferry services in Orkney and Shetland.

Daniel Bingham, senior pets buyer for Wilko, offered some advice on helping wild birds thrive during the colder season.He said: “Birds feed every day and don’t store energy well, so one or two bad days in cold weather or without food can be very dangerous for them.“Put out a good selection of food in feeders or on tables to attract birds to your garden — things like fat balls are nutritious and high in energy — perfect to help them maintain weight and stay fuelled.“Put some soft food down for the songbirds who can’t reach the feeders. Suet blocks and pellets work particularly well, as they give the birds a great energy boost and plenty of calories.“Don’t forget to provide fresh water. Ponds, puddles and other water sources may freeze over, making them inaccessible to birds. Birds can be timid so you’ll need to be patient build up trust by sharing plenty of treats and you could soon be rewarded with the perfect wild bird shot”.The Wilko wild bird competition runs until March .

Unless that changes, Orkney will be left with the oldest fleet and the highest fares in the country — and that can only be described as blatant discrimination.”In a response to Councillor Stockan, the minister for energy, connectivity and the islands, Paul Wheelhouse, says Orkney Islands Council is “wholly responsible for the inter-island ferry services which they provide.”He says minsters understand the “signicant financial challenges that can fall on inidual local authorities with responsibility for ferries” and that the Government has “made clear our commitment to Orkney’s internal ferry services” with additional funding of £. million in total over the past two years.Councillor Stockan said: “I am extremely disappointed that the First Minister has chosen not to respond to our considerable concerns directly, or to meet with me to discuss an issue of fundamental importance to our community.“I can only describe the Government’s current position as irrefutable discrimination against the people of Orkney. The additional funding we received over the last two years was welcome, but fell far short of what is needed to fully fund our internal ferry service.“I call on the Government to address this when the budget is published this week — and I have asked the other parties at Holyrood to offer us their full support in securing full and fair funding for Orkney.“The running and replacement costs of Western Isles ferries are fully subsidised by the Government. It is only right and proper that we in Orkney should be treated in the same way.”In the letter, Councillor Stockan also criticises the Government for its continued failure to introduce Road Equivalent Tarf on routes linking Orkney to the Scottish Mainland.“The roll-out of RET began on West of Scotland ferry routes more than a decade ago, reducing fares for local people and visitors alike,” he added.“It is our firm belief that there is no impediment preventing RET being introduced on Orkney routes, and that any further delay is unfair and will result in signicant prejudice against local ferry users.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

He played in bands in London, rubbing shoulders with the Rolling Stones, Eric Clapton and his jamming buddy, Ritchie Blackmore, who went on to form the legendary rock bands Deep Purple and Rainbow.He even jammed at a party with Cream bassist and vocalist, Jack Bruce.A visit from Screaming Lord Sutch, who wanted him to go to Germany with him as a bass playermade Jim think again about a career in rock music.His first passion was always art, and comic book art was his favourite genre.He declined Lord Sutch’s offer and after a few years ed to his beloved Orkney. Here he continued drawing for TV comics before working for AD. He was then head-hunted by the American giants, DC Comics and Marvel Comics.Sadly, Jim suffered with Parkinson’s Disease for over  years and passed away on December , .Despite the diagnosis he continued drawing, painting and writing original sci-fi stories for many years.This celebration of his le and art is dferent from other recent exhibitions, as it contains his le story, original artwork and artefacts relating to him.It also features many Orkney related pieces, rather than just sci-fi heroes like Judge Dredd and Batman.Local characters from the th century hang alongside paintings showing the story of St Magnus, wartime Hoy and illustrations from books, like The Bard of Ballarat and Willick o’ Pirliebraes.Jim’s we, Wendy, said: “I am delighted that the Orkney Museum is having an exhibition of my late husband Jim’s work.“The fact that a young boy from the small Orkney island of Hoy should become world famous in his chosen field of comic book illustration is an achievement in itself, but there were many other aspects to Jim’s le.“This exhibition gives an insight into his early le in Hoy, as well, as his time in the RAF and the excitement of being in the London music scene during the ‘swinging sixties’.“I think it is a true reflection of the times he lived in and I hope it will interest the folk who see it.”The Orkney Museum is open Monday to Saturday, .am-.pm, .pm-pm.

Since then, however, neither has been prepared to follow this up with action on the ground.

While provision has been made, it has consistently fallen short of what is required to reflect fair ferry funding.“Ministers may have changed, but the commitment was one made on behalf of the government. Indeed, the First Minister spent much of last summer in Shetland repeatedly the promises of fair funding.“Claiming it is the responsibility of everyone  to deliver the promises they have made lacks credibility. Instead of holding communities in Orkney and Shetland to ransom each year, the government should honour its commitment to fully deliver on fair ferry funding for these lelines services.”Ms Wishart added: “This Government has already accepted that it must provide full and fair ferry funding for the Northern Isles. Continuing to deny Shetland and Orkney the funding needed to run these leline services is completely unacceptable. At worst it is total cynicism.“The Government needs to step up and deliver on the clear evidence that it has been presented with year after year. We will not allow previous commitments to be traded away.“It is no exaggeration to say that the future of some island communities relies on sustainable ferry services. However, the money that has been given to Shetland Islands Council in recent years does not meet the true cost of running our ferries.“When the budget was announced it was described as having “wellbeing and fairness at its very heart”. But this settlement does not reflect that and is not reflective of a Government that is alive to the needs of island communities.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The second advert, due to be screened in the spring, will showcase Orkney’s lestyle, along with work and study opportunities in the county.The adverts comprise footage created by Orkney-based digital content agency, Start Point Media, as part of the Digital Media Orkney Project, a three-year Orkney Marketing Programme initiative funded by LEADER, Highlands and Islands Enterpriseand Orkney Islands Council .Editing and advert composition was undertaken by STV as part of its Growth Fund initiative, aimed at encouraging Scottish businesses and organisations to advertise on the channel.Morag Robertson, economic development officer at OIC, said: “We decided to create these impactful television adverts with the backing of STV’s Growth Fund and the LEADER programme, as a complement to our marketing activities and as a way of driving more visitors to the official Orkney website, Orkney. It’s the main portal now for our visitor information, and the place anyone keen to learn more about living, working and studying in the islands should head, so we felt a TV campaign would be a great way to both highlight the site and everything Orkney has to offer.”“We’re really delighted with the quality of the two adverts,” added Maureen Shearer, development manager at HIE in Orkney. “The feedback on the first, focusing on Orkney as a visitor destination, has been fantastic and we’re already seeing an increase in the hits on the Orkney website. We’re very grateful to the STV Growth Fund and to LEADER for their assistance in bringing this campaign to fruition and also hope viewers enjoy seeing this snapshot of le in the islands.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

One by one, they planted the rough wooden memorials in the grass –  in all – each one marking a le lost to drugs. As they did so, they reflected on the good times, and lamented the waste.The last to plant his cross was Steven Currie. Steven’s older brother Peter McGrattan – known to most as Big Ped – was obsessed by music. “He was into punk when he was a boy, then U, Inspiral Carpets, Stone Roses, Oasis,” says Steven, who has the word “Brother” tattooed on his arm. “He was the man for the music, and you would follow suit because you looked up to him.” Steven would sit on the floor while Peter played DJ. “I’d tap tap my feet and think: ‘That’s quite good, that.’ His taste was superb. He could have been one of those guys that spotted bands.”But Big Ped carried a bit of weight and it affected his self-esteem. He trod that well-worn path from alcohol through soft drugs, heroin and crack cocaine, on to the grave. He died of a Valium overdose, after eight years clean, in August , dying in their mother’s house. “The paramedic came in and said: ‘He’s gone,’” Steven says. “I sat with him on the floor and cuddled him until they came and took him away.” Gone, but still loved still remembered.We are in the grip of a drugs deaths emergency here in Scotland, as everybody knows. Our drugs death rate is the worst in Europe. The toll for  was , – the highest it has ever been. It will come as little surprisethis year’s is higher still. The crosses are a reminder that each of the , was an inidual robbed of their future.En masse, they capture the scale of the problem. Spread out in rows like war graves, they say: “Here is a generation being wiped out, while those at the top play politics.” Is this too harsh  Maybe. Yet even as Steven placed his cross, the UK and Scottish governments were squabbling over rival drugs summits to be held in Glasgow a day apart. “My drugs summit is better than your drugs summit,” they blustered like children.Of course, politicians on both sides can justy their position. The UK government will say it announced its conference first. “But without consulting us, and without including those with lived experience,” the Scottish Government will counter. If either party does not understand how pathetic it sounds – how pathetic it is – for two governments who share responsibility for drugs policy to be unwilling to cut the crap and share a table, I suggest they get out of politics for a while and look at this from beyond the bubble. I suggest they spend some time in those communities where people are losing their lives for want of inter-agency collaboration and a coherent policy.This is not to suggest the Scottish Government is doing nothing. Last year – under pressure, and having previously cut frontline services – it set up the Drugs Deaths Task Force. In the recent budget it announced an extra £.m to be spent on “delivering innovative projects, testing new approaches and developing a national pathway for opiate substitute therapy”.The Scottish Government conference will also provide training in the use of Naloxone, which reverses the effect of drugs overdoses, and a demonstration model of a drugs consumption room. It insists what takes place there will “inform” its contribution to the UK summit the next day. And yet the mutual blame game neither side appears able to stop does not augur well.So often we hear about successful policy where, particularly in Portugal where drugs have been decriminalised, users have been de-stigmatised and those who consume can choose between harm reduction and rehab.But the key to Portugal’s success was not merely the approach itself, but the political consensus that formed around it and an unshakeable commitment to that approach through successive governments.Here in the UK, we are still treating drugs policy like a political football a forum for the airing of grievances a battleground for ideological dferences. This was happening long before the general election, but it is worse now the Tories have a thumping majority.The destructive relationship between Westminster and the Scottish Government – and more specically between Nicola Sturgeon and Boris Johnson – is spilling into other areas too, most notably the COP climate conference which will take place in Glasgow in November.This conference is supposed to build the coalition necessary to break the deadlock on international climate action – and therefore requires UK-wide co-operation and a gt for diplomacy.Already, however, it has been reduced to oneupmanship. Despite being advised otherwise, Johnson has refused to give Sturgeon any formal role in proceedings. And there have been disputes over the venue itself. With the conference set to be held in the Scottish Events Campus on the north of the river, the Scottish Government booked out the Science Centre on the south. But now the UK government says it needs both sites and has accused the Scottish Government of trying to undermine its plans. To make matters worse, the Prime Minister is said to have referred to Sturgeon as “that wee Jimmy Krankie woman” to which Sturgeon responded “ Boris Johnson wants to make personal insults against me, I’m a big enough girl to make personal insults back”. All highly constructive.I think most of us accept Johnson would try the patience of a saint. As last week’s reshuffle demonstrated, he – or rather Dominic Cummings – is hell-bent on exercising control. Claire Perry claims he sacked her as the president of the COP and replaced her with former international development secretary Alok Sharma because Whitehall couldn’t cope with an independent conference. Sharma is said to have a questionable record on environment issues.Given all this, it must be tempting to answer criticism by pointing out that “Johnson started this” and that he is a twat of the highest order. But that gets us nowhere. Meanwhile, the planet burns.Aware, presumably, that tit-for-tat fighting is destructive and childish, Sturgeon has called for a reset in relations. But for that to happen, the UK government will not only have to be willing to co-operate on key issues, the Scottish Government will have to stop constantly passing the buck southwards.The constitutional debate is not going to disappear. Both governments will be arguing over the legitimacy of a second independence referendum for some time. But they need to be able to set that argument aside when it comes to shared crises such as drugs deaths and climate change.Only by attempting to find common ground can progress be made. If that requires pride to be swallowed, and teeth to be gritted, then so be it. There are too many crosses already in Springburn too many species already extinct. Enough with the playground politics.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"euan mccolm nuisance neighbour sajid javid feels smack of firm leadership","story":"The Prime Minister#s predecessors would have understood his demand for unquestioning loyalty from the Treasury, writes Euan McColmIt was greeted as evidence of a crisis at the very heart of government.When Sajid Javid resigned as Chancellor of the Exchequer on Thursday, after rejecting Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s demand that he sack all of his advisers, opponents scented blood.Shadow chancellor John McDonnell observed that Johnson had “clearly won the battle to take absolute control of the Treasury and install his stooge as chancellor”. We must surely, he added, be witnessing a historical record – a government in crisis after just two months in power.Meanwhile, Labour-supporting commentators lined up to explain the replacement of Javid with, as one columnist described him, the “alarmingly obedient” Rishi Sunak.I’m bound to say that for a man mired in crisis, Johnson appears remarkably relaxed. When he and his chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, told Javid they wanted his team cleared out and replaced by a new staff of advisers working across both  and  Downing Street, they must have know there was a chance – a good one, at that – that the chancellor wouldn’t wear it. His decision to walk cannot have come as a shock.McDonnell’s description of a government in crisis is, I’m afraid, inaccurate. Rather, what we’re seeing is a Prime Minister fully in control. There is no crisis.In Javid’s eager beaver replacement, Johnson has precisely what he wanted: a compliant chancellor who will do what he desires.Quite why Sunak’s loyalty should be seen as “alarming”, I’m not sure. There is nothing in the rule book of politics that says the sign of a good chancellor is a willingness to defy the prime minister. Was Tony Blair’s Labour government improved by the fact chancellor Gordon Brown spent his every waking moment seething with resentment over his rival’s supremacy  No, it wasn’t, was it  In fact, briefing and counter-briefing by Number  and Treasury sources meant the fractured relationship between prime minister and chancellor frequently got in the way of smooth government. When both men would rather have seen their policy agenda make headlines, their bitter relationship became the focus of media attention.When, finally, Brown realised his ambition of becoming prime minister, he could not change his ways. A man born to plot, Brown soon began undermining his chancellor, Alistair Darling, destroying a professional and personal relationship that had endured for years.David Cameron and George Osborne entered government in  having learned from their predecessors. Relations between Downing Street and the Treasury were good for the first time in a long time.Cameron and Osborne were a team and they always understood the pecking order. Each got what he needed from the relationship.But Johnson has no such partner. The Prime Minister has no political soulmate.This being so, what, exactly is the problem with Johnson wishing to take a firm grip of the Treasury  It is, I think, the sort of thing that might look to voters like strong leadership. Few, I’d wager, now lament the passing of the Javid era.Among Johnson’s immediate priorities is solidying the Conservative vote in areas of England which once ed Labour MPs. The Prime Minister will want to deliver for areas in the Midlands and the North of England which went Tory for the first time in generations. If he does not make good on his promises of regeneration and investment then the PM risks watching those voters drt back to Labour.What Johnson needs, right now, is a chancellor who is completely on board with this agenda. But there is something  beyond the Prime Minister’s desire for a compliant chancellor at play, here. Johnson has just sent a message to every member of his parliamentary party that the rules of the game have changed. His demand is complete loyalty, nothing less.From what McDonnell describes as a crisis will, I think, spring a period of uncommon stability in government. Last year, Johnson won the parliamentary majority he craved. Now, he has stamped his authority on his party in no uncertain terms.This same message came across loudly and clearly in Johnson’s dismissal from his cabinet of former leadership contenders Andrea Leadsom and Esther McVey. Leadsom is a popular figure among members of the Tory Party’s Eurosceptic right wing. Johnson’s calculation is that he need not concern himself with the feelings of those members. Javid comes out of the last few days rather well, I think. No chancellor can complain about a demand for loyalty but the order to dismiss his team of advisers was a step too far, one provocation too many.That Javid said no to this suggests he has something about him, after all.In a statement following his resignation, the former chancellor reiterated his support for Johnson. I wonder how long this will last.It is undoubtedly the case that when political parties lose discipline, they lose elections. Look at the SNP. For decades, they did nothing but tear each other apart over the best way in which independence might be achieved. Bitter recrimination was part and parcel of SNP membership. And then Alex Salmond ed as party leader for a second stint and he laid down the bloody law to his colleagues. There was to be no briefing about colleagues, no criticism of government policy, and no public disagreement over any of the party’s positions.What followed was as period of unity in the SNP ranks that continues – the occasional domestic disturbance, aside – to this day.I’m not sure Johnson is behaving especially dferently to the way Salmond did. Doubtless, opposition parties will taunt Chancellor Rishi Sunak when he next rises to speak in the House of Commons. They will leave him in no doubt that they consider him a poodle.But each and every one of Boris Johnson’s opponents will privately admire the way he strengthened his grip on the Tory Party last week.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"it s nessie mystery skeleton washed up on scots beach leads to speculation it s loch ness monster","story":"The photos of the rotten carcass on Balmedie Beach in Aberdeen were posted on a local community Facebook page - Fubar News - after it was revealed following the powerful storm which battered the country last week.

After a spirited campaign by his opponent Michelle Ballantyne, Carlaw in the end won comfortably with a % to % share of the members’ votes cast. The party should be thankful to Ballantyne for ensuring there was a contest, not least for allowing Carlaw to now say with authority he has an unequivocal mandate to run the party. She also gave voice to concerns that have been building up over recent years about party management. Carlaw will surely want to address these rather than exacerbate them. While the candidates did their best to present themselves as dferent and thus offer a genuine choice, the reality is they had far more in common than what ided them. For the party this is a good thing as members now have to unite behind Carlaw’s leadership and turn their attention to the most important challenge facing them – defeating the SNP in the  elections.Their first goal will be to prevent the SNP having an overall majority like that won by Alex Salmond in , but then lost by Nicola Sturgeon in . Despite the appalling performance of our public services under the management of the SNP government, recent polling suggests it could yet win such a huge mandate. While possible I think it unlikely, for once the electorate begins to consider the SNP’s record in detail its failure must begin to pay idends for the opposition. Also fundamental to the debate is how the dominance of Brexit will recede, allowing more oxygen to be given to the scrutinising the performance of SNP ministers.The second goal must then be to lay the ground for a new administration that locks the SNP out of government evenSturgeon wins the most seats. An alternative minority administration that enjoys a comfort and supply arrangement would be the most likely route – as neither Labour nor the Liberal Democrats will want to even hint at a coalition, never mind formalise one. In an effort to kill-off such a prospect the SNP will seek to demonise any party offering to work with dreaded Tories – or “Tory Scum” as the infamous banner that graces nationalist marches brands over half a million Scottish voters. In response the argument has to be put that it was the Tories who provided a comfort and supply arrangement to Salmond and Sturgeon between -. If the Tories were good enough for the SNP then, why should it not be good enough for Carlaw to do the same with other partiesit’s best for the for the country It is impossible to say what role the Labour Party will play in all of these developments too much depends on how its UK leadership election works out, but there are other encouraging signs that offer hope to unionists. Yesterday Scottish Business UK, the pro-Union business group backed by hundreds of Scottish businesses and including many household names, published a new paper advocating a more positive and assertive approach by the UK government. Included in the paper Strengthening the Union: A Framework for Business Success were proposals for a UK Department of the Union which would have grant-aiding powers to assist directly initiatives that will help the UK’s cohesiveness. These might be community based or infrastructure projects – but they would clearly demonstrate and say on the tin they have been delivered by the UK.Other ideas included an Office for Budget Responsibility for the Union that would bring more transparency to encourage both accountability and value for money in public spending. Interestingly it is argued the new OBR could become a force for helping achieve UK-wide spending commitments in Scotland as well challenging them. The paper also considered issues from taxation to fisheries, cultural exchange within the UKto migration. Some may fly, others probably will not, but the fact that a business group is bringing forward positive ideas that can add value to being in the UK illustrates how the UK’s status quo is never set in stone.Indeedthere is one dference why the UK’s advocates won the independence referendum of  but the Europhiles lost that of  is the UK is evolving and decentralising by devolving power out to nations and cities – whereas the EU is taking more and more power for itself. Other unionist organisations are also stirring Scotland in Union, the largest campaign group defending the Union launched a Valentine video message last week and another offering ten reasons Scotland is stronger in the UK. That might not seem especially unusualbut the adoption of a positive rather than negative tone represents a change in approach away from the project fear of the past and, I believe, will begin to pay idends. Likewise the meetings being organised around the country by the unionist lobbying group Scotland Matters demonstrates the level of activism outside party circles is growing. True, such events are not at the levels of Yes activism, but that’s not the appropriate comparison, the point is no such activities were even being considered by unionists before the last referendum in . This time Unionists of all parties or none are mobilising in advance of the  elections to head off nationalism before any referendum.Later this weekend in Newcastle-upon-Tyne the discussion forum “These Islands” holds a two day conference to explores issues of culture and identity that are rarely given enough thought by unionists.The growth of such activities points to a more confident and less complacent approach from unionists be they large or small “U”. It shows a willingness to do grown-up politics, to have adult and reasoned debate away from the obscenities and hatred spouted at marches, worn on T-shirts and sprayed across social media that too many nationalists have descended into.All of Scotland’s pro-British parties can tap into this new wave of unionist optimism – and then maybe learn to work together.Brian Monteith is editor of ThinkScotland.org©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"watch dramatic footage shows ferry caught in storm dennis","story":"A ferry swaying heavily at sea as storm Dennis batters parts of the country has been caught on camera.Stuart Bell was visiting the Isle of Arran when he filmed the ferry approaching the Calmac Ferry Terminal.

Underfloor and internal wall insulation and a staircase to allow insulation to their loft room – then only accessible by a loft ladder – was part of the package.The work began in February  after confirmation that Julie and Rachel were eligible for the insulation scheme grant as they were in receipt of working tax credits.

She also told him that she would leave a key for the workmen to access her house as she had to go to Inverness for surgery.: “They were very happy with their job, but I went in to have a look and the staircase was dangerously on a forward tilt. There was no headroom # you actually had to duck to get in the attic space. So I brought this all to Mark’s attentionand he said #yes, I’ll get them to do something about it# – but what they did was wedge in an extra bit of wood underneath the staircase to try and put the tilt backward. It’s not fixed to the floor, there’s no banister, there’s no handrail at the top. I started looking at building regulations and there isn’t two metres clearance.”She added: “The underfloor heating was fine, no problems –but I think that is really all they are capable of doing because they weren’tjoiners.”After multiple messages asking Mr Crilly what would be doneto recty the damage Julie conducted a search through Companies House to finddetails of the Central Heating Team. She discovered that it was a limitedcompany but that it did not mention Mark Crilly at all.She spoke to one of the company’s directors, David Mastertonwho told her that Mr Crilly was merely one of their lead generators and that itwas through them the underfloor insulation had been carried out. She added thatshe was told Mr Crilly did not have the correct certication in place to undertakethe internal wall insulation. Mrs Child said that Mark Crilly emailed her in April  to say that Mr Masterton would arrange for a joiner to sort the staircase as soon as possible. In June , Julie managed to track down the joiner in question.He told her that Mr Crilly had casually mentioned that there might be work for him but nothing more. Mrs Child claims that the joiner inspected the work at her home and said he was shocked at the poor workmanship and was not interested in trying to put it right.In September , Julie employed the services of theStornoway-based firm Alex Murray Construction.She said: “I went to Alex Murray Construction and they said ‘they have cut through ceiling joists, which they haven’t reinforced, it’s dangerous – you shouldn’t be using the stairs # that all needs to come out or be strengthened.’“They sent us a quote for about £, to put it back to what it was before. They suggested that we speak to the building inspectors.”In November  Comhairle nan Eilean Siar conducted a building inspection of her home.Mrs Child said: “They said ‘your home insurance is invalid. There are major structural ceiling joists that have been chopped through without any reinforcements –you have a problem and have an assessor come in, the first thing they are going to do is come up to the attic and your insurance will be void#.”Following the building inspection, Mrs Child contacted Mr Crilly to determine who was liable, to which she claims he said he was.After sending him the quote and building report, and withher house no longer insured and vulnerable to the winter weather, she sent aletter at the start of December. This explained that the couple would give MrCrilly fourteen days to pay the quote in full otherwise they would take legalaction.She said: “He did email us and offer the deposit and money on completion but as we had already told him, the construction company would not accept that. They needed the money paid up front. He never got a valid quote for the work with them nor took it any further. All he has done is stall at every opportunity.“He has made us feel very foolish and like complete idiots.We came over here for the quiet le and we’ve no mortgage – so that we can makea few changes with our little business.

When the family approached us, they didn’t have a grave number but informed us the grave was in City Cemetery. When we checked our records, three people had been buried in the grave at City Cemetery.“It later transpired that the correct grave which belonged to the family of the deceased was actually in Glenalina Cemetery, which is adjoining. We appreciate the immense pressure on families when arranging the burial of a loved one and apologise for any upset that was caused by Council during this dficult process.”Responding to the council’s apology, a family member insisted that council officials had earlier admitted entering the wrong coordinates for the plot, incorrectly entering the letter ‘j’ instead of ‘i’.“We totally expected Belfast City Council to turn the blame back on us,” she said.“My brother told the council that the correct grave was in the top part of the City Cemetery, officially called Glenalina, but they obviously didn’t listen.“The council should just admit that whoever keyed in the plot number got it wrong.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"familys fitting tribute to danielle","story":"THE family of a Glengormley woman who died just weeks before she was due to begin a new le-extending cystic fibrosis drug have raised over £, in her memory.Danielle McFalldied at Antrim Area Hospital in October after a week in intensive care.She was diagnosed with the disease aged just six weeks and after being diagnosed with epilepsy at the age of  she developed cirrhosis of the liver.Danielle was due to start the new drug, Orkambi, which can improve lung , after a deal was struck with US drug manufacturer Vertex.However, Danielle became ill on October , soon after the announcement was made, and died on October .In her memory, her family decided they wanted to do something and recently held a fundraiser for the Cystic Fibrosis Trust in Cltonville Golf Club.Speaking to the North Belfast News, Danielle’s mother Angela explained: “She fought long and hard all her le and we all really miss her.“We wanted to do something in her memory but had never done anything like this before.“It was a daunting task to organise something from nothing but we sat down and got sponsors who donated vouchers and prizes for a ballot.“As we got closer to the event, we worried more and more about whether it would be a success.“It was a freezing night in January and we were worried that people wouldn’t come out but thanks to a combination of hard work and incredible generosity, we raised far more money than we ever expected to.“We put on a buffet, had great music from DJ Gerry and a ballot draw.“We had vouchers for make-up salons and barbers, loads of drinks hampers, tickets to the Belfast Giants and the Game of Thrones Giant’s Causeway tour and the main prize, which was a gigantic perfume and make-up hamper from Medicare in Northcott.”Danielle’s family managed to raise an amazing £. for the Cystic Fibrosis Trust and Belfast International Airport have pledged an additional £ to the total raised.“It was a really fun-filled night and as a family, we would like to thank all who helped make it possible.“We’re overwhelmed by the result and are glad that out efforts paid off as fantastically as they did.

It is the jewel in the crown of Belfast.“The Council say it is closed due to health and safety issues. Nature has caused damage with trees growing and it has really been left abandoned by the Council.“Enough is enough. We need to start now and start fixing it up.”The call has been backed by historian Joe Baker from Belfast History Project.“Clton Street is one of three ancient cemeteries in Belfast,” he explained.“It is the most unique because it didn’t belong to a church. It belonged to the old Belfast Poor House at Clton House.“It opened in , two years before United Irishmen rebellion.“For me, the most remarkable thing is the ersity of graves. It is a small graveyard but there are , people buried in it.“That is so many le stories. It is a very historic place. The largest famine grave and largest cholera grave is in there as well as the graves of famous names such as United Irishman Dr William Drennan and the McCracken’s.“I am hoping it gets re-opened so people can learn more about its history.“It is also one of the very few green areas in the district so it would be a huge asset to the local community.“The Council say about costs and health and safety but that can be addressed very easily.”The motion has been referred to next month’s People and Communities Committee to allow time for a report to be brought back by Council officers.A spokesperson for Belfast City Council said: “We can’t make any comment until that report has been discussed at the March meeting of the People and Communities Committee, a decision made and subsequently agreed by council.”"},{"url":null,"title":"i was burned from uup leaders job by unionist sectarianism nesbitt","story":"Former UUP leader Mike Nesbitt was speaking at Stormont  FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappFormer UUP leader Mike Nesbitt was speaking at Stormont By David Young, PAFebruary   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailA former UUP leader has blamed unionist sectarianism for driving him from office as he urged unionism to wake up to the existential threat facing it.Mike Nesbitt compared unionism to a frog sitting in a pot of water unaware of the threat to its le as the temperature gradually rises.Mr Nesbitt said unionists needed to stop “disregarding the importance of human rights” and start thinking about how to tackle sectarianism within Northern Ireland society.The Strangford Assembly member was addressing the launch of a new report on sectarianism at Parliament Buildings in Stormont.\"If we tackle sectarianism, we tackle one of the most toxic legacies of the Troubles.\" - @mikenesbittni speaking at the launch of Sectarianism: The Key Facts.

We need to stop disregarding the importance of human rights and we need to think about how we tackle sectarianism.”Mr Nesbitt said one of the most effective ways to tackle sectarianism would be the creation of a single education system.“If you are mixing children from the ages of three or four every day you are giving them an inoculation against sectarianism.“Andwe can tackle sectarianism we can tackle one of the most toxic legacies of our Troubles.”There is \"a long legacy of sectarian decision making\" in Northern Ireland\" - Dr Robbie McVeigh, who is launching his new research report, Sectarianism: The Key Facts, at Stormont today. He argues for the effective equality proofing of decisions going forwards. pic UhoPCwzAE— EqualityCoalitionFebruary , The -page report was penned by independent researcher Dr Robbie McVeigh.Dr McVeigh said there was a need to consider the problem in the context of Northern Ireland’s changing demographic landscape.He said the region was no longer characterised by a Protestant majority and Catholic minority and was instead a place of “three minorities” – Protestant, Catholic and increasing number who identy as neither.He said disparities between Protestants and Catholics still existed in many areas across the public sector – expressing particular concern about stalled efforts to make the PSNI more representative of the community it serves.He urged authorities in Northern Ireland to learn from an initiative undertaken by former prime minister Theresa May when she ordered an audit of all government departments to establish areas where racial disparities existed.Dr McVeigh said departments were then challenged to either explain the disparities or take action to address them. vw,vw,px, px\"Declan Kearney said sectarianism was the ‘elephant in the room’ across society in the region Stormont Junior Minister Declan Kearney also addressed the event.

The warning comes after the Public Health Agency published figures showing there were  confirmed cases of the illness last year, compared to just  cases in .The majorityof the cases were in young adults, aged  to . Mumps is a viral infection that used to be common in children before the introduction of the MMR vaccine. Before the MMR vaccine mumps was the most common cause of viral meningitis.Although people can recover from mumps without treatment, in some cases it can cause complications such as viral meningitis, deafness and inflammation of the testicles.Rob Dawson, director of support and advocacy at Meningitis Research Foundationsaid: “Mumps meningitis can be a frightening, although infrequent complication of mumps. MRF encourages everyone to get the vaccinations they are eligible for as immunisation is best way to protect yourself from mumps. Vaccination prevents most cases of mumps and evena vaccinated person does get mumps, they are likely to experience a less severe illness.”The Public Health Agency#s Dr Jillian Johnson told the BBC that two doses of the MMR vaccine would maximise protection against mumps. Whilst the majority of all cases, including young adults, have received two doses of MMR vaccine , the proportion of people with less than two dosesis enough to continue to drive the spread of mumps every three to four years and this is what we are seeing during , she said.The warning comes after it was revealed cases of mumps in England had reached their highest level in a decade. The increase, which was attributed to outbreaks in universities and colleges, raised the number of cases of the viral illness to , last year- four times the number in . Many of the cases were seen in young adults born in the late s and early s who are likely to have missed out on the MMR vaccine after the vaccine was ly linked to autism. The children are now young adults going to college and university. Symptoms of mumps include painful swelling of the glands at the side of the face, a fever, joint pain, feeling tired and loss of appetite.

The results of the survey aren#t surprising and underline the dangers of listening to political echo chambers. But the UUP leader added that unionists shouldn#t be complacent and must get out there and actively promote the many positive benefits of the Union.Read MoreOpinionJon Tonge: An antidote to recent excitable predictions of Irish unity, but there are signs of changeMr Eastwood noted that only a very slim majority - % supported the Union.It must be our job in the months and years ahead to set out an inclusive and compelling vision for a new Ireland that attracts the support of more people, particularly those who define as neither nationalist nor unionist, he said.We need to take on board the concerns raised by those who aren#t natural supporters of Irish unity. That means acknowledging that shouting #up the Ra# is devastating to our goal of reconciling our people and uniting this island. We need to show unionists, and others, that their identities will be accommodated, cherished and celebrated in our new Ireland.TUV leader Jim Allister described the poll as a reality check to those who believed Irish unity was around the corner.After years of propaganda about Brexit and demographic changes, someone has actually bothered to go out and ask people face-to-face about their opinion on Northern Ireland#s constitutional future and the results, unsurprisingly, are clear, he said.Who would give up the free NHS to pay € to visit their GP  Who would give up their £, tax-free personal allowance to pay tax on all income Read More Just % in Northern Ireland would vote for unity, major study revealsDUP leader Arlene Foster said: Northern Ireland is best served being part of the fth largest economy in the world. For historical, cultural, social, political and economic reasons, I want to ensure that Northern Ireland is always part of the UK. Therefore, I welcome the poll results. That poll result can be cemented by making everyone feel at home living and working in Northern Ireland. People who have a British, Irish, Northern Irish and none of those identities must feel at home here.Sinn Fein MLA Emma Sheerin said: No one is seriously advocating for a referendum to be held tomorrow, but it is clear that people want such a referendum after a proper period of debate and discussion. There is room for everyone in that discussion. No one has anything to fear from Irish unity and we would encourage everyone to take part and help shape a new and better Ireland. Independent unionist MLA Claire Sugden said that after three years without a government here, a border poll would be destabilising and people wanted their politicians to focus on delivering public services.Alliance deputy leader Stephen Farry said: We recognise there is a fluid debate on the future of Northern Ireland, but we are clear that whatever the constitutional position, the priority must be to promote reconciliation and make this region work.Belfast Related ContentNorthern IrelandexclusiveJust % in Northern Ireland would vote for unity, major study revealsLess than a third of people here would vote for a united Irelanda border poll was held tomorrow, according to a major study of , voters.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming ae .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_fac--da-a-bfbb_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming ae .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_fac--da-a-bfbb_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming ae .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_fac--da-a-bfbb_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming ae .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_fac--da-a-bfbb_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming ae .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_fac--da-a-bfbb_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"News AnalysisOpinionJon Tonge:An antidote to recent excitable predictions of Irish unity, but there are signs of changeSurveys of public opinion lead to cherry-picking of the results according to political preferences.

He then entered the pub trade, joining his uncle Brendan at the Market Inn in Draperstown. His affable, fun and friendly personality made him a natural barman.In the late s, Niall was at a dance in Dungiven Castle where he met a beautul young teacher called Geraldine Agnew who was holidaying in Maghera from her native Belfast. They married in  and set up home in Hall Street.Around this time, Niall was keen to venture into the pub business on his own. He and his father had been leasing a drinking house on the very top of Glenshane called Bradley’s since the early s. Niall bought it in the early s and put his own stamp on it with a notable new name - the Ponderosa.The name was a nod to Niall’s father who bore a remarkable resemblance to Ben Cartwight, the lead character in the s television show Bonanza featuring a ranch called the Ponderosa. Niall and his three brothers also looked like the Cartwright brothers. What started as a joke stuck.Running a pub on the top of a mountain throughout the s wasn’t always easy.The Troubles raged and Niall’s remote location made him a sitting duck for raiders. He had no electricity supply, no telephone and was also at the whim of Glenshane’s notoriously cruel winters. googletag.cmd.push  The Watty Grahams championship-winning team. Niall Regan is in the back row, fth from the left, with his arms folded. Despite the challenges, he was in heaven with wonderful staff, a loyal dog, a blazing turf fire, an endless pot of homemade soup and a stream of fascinating characters through the doors bringing plenty of stories and news.It was a popular stopping point for tourists and well-known customers, including Manchester United footballer Paddy Crerand.The early s saw Niall branch out into the snooker club trade and he operated, with others, a handful of halls across Mid Ulster. By the mid s, he and Geraldine had three young children. After nearly  years of pulling pints at the top of the Sperrins, Niall took the tough decision to sell his beloved Ponderosa.Away from work,Niall was a talented Gaelic footballer, and was proud to play for many years for Watty Graham’s GAC, Glen. He was part of the Watty’s team which lted the Derry Junior Championship title of . He last lined up for Glen at the age of  as part of an over s match to mark the opening of Watty Graham Park in .Niall’s father Matt had been an exceptional footballer, playing soccer professionally for Belfast Celtic and Shamrock Rovers in the s, as well as Gaelic for his native Ballinascreen and Derry.Matt was the first Derry player ever selected to play for Ulster in the Railway Cup, and was also the man who brought future England manager Ron Greenwood to play for Belfast Celtic.Niall was pleased to follow something of his father’s path by pulling on a Derry jersey as a junior player.  Niall gets to hold the Sam Maguire after Derrys success in . He remained an avid Derry GAA fan throughout his le and was present at Croke Park for both of the county’s only two All-Ireland finals, in  and . He was, of course, a happy man in .When Geraldine became principal of St Columba’s Primary School, Straw, in , Niall volunteered to coach the boys’ football, nurturing a squad of young Ballinascreen players as they made their way up through the school.Niall loved traditional Irish music. He played the tin whistle and sang in a band called Roguery in his younger days. He was the le and soul of any party he attended and never had to take much convincing to sing his favourite, The Mountainy Farmer.He was an accomplished golfer, playing off a handicap of six at his best. One of the founding members of Moyola Park Golf Club, Castledawson, in , he spent many happy hours on its fairways and clubhouse over the decades. The same can be said for Dunfanaghy Golf Club in Co Donegal where Niall was granted honorary letime membership in recognition of his dedication there.Niall’s love of Maghera and Derry was matched only by his love of Dunfanaghy where he had holidayed since childhood.Niall’s later years were marked by ill health after he suffered a le-changing stroke in . He gave up golf but still patrolled the Dunfanaghy links in his Harley Davison golf buggy, acting as course ranger on busy days.A devoted grandfather and great grandfather, Niall suffered another series of strokes almost five years ago, leaving him with signicant disabilities and the on-set of dementia.He was cared for unfailingly by his devoted we in these final years. Niall passed away peacefully on Friday st January in his Hall Street home. Following Requiem Mass at St Patrick’s Chapel, he was buried in its graveyard, at the foot of Glenshane.Niall will be sadly missed by his we Geraldine, their children Siobhan, Niall Og and Claire , their granddaughters Cliodhna, Katie and Rosa, great granddaughter Saoirse, son-in-law Chris, sister Maeve , brothers Matt and Terence and the wider family circle.Niall was sadly pre-deceased by his brother Barney.The Regan family were deeply touched by the large congregation who turned out for his funeral, representing all eras and interests in his full and fulfilled le.

Maybe you’ve had some information sent home from your child’s school or nursery  I had a great discussion with these children, most of whom did understand when to ask for help, what ‘not to do’ online but scarily some still thought they didn’t need parental controls, thought they ‘knew it all’ when, during our discussion it quickly became apparent that they didn’t. However, this discussion linked to how they used their tablet, when I asked did they have a phone or did they use their parents, I was shocked that most of them didn’t think the dangers on their tablet were also on the phone - nearly the whole class said they would use the phone to watch videos on YouTube or games that ‘popped up.’Gulp!At the end of the day, I was in another class and the teaching assistant explained to me that at the end of every day the children were allowed to watch Netflix for  minutes.I thought this was a treat but, no, it happens every day. Yes, they were watching Horrid Henry which is age appropriate, but I thought why couldn’t it be read to them  Gulp! Walking back to my car at the end of the day with these ‘incidents’ in my head, I saw a child from the class I had just taught getting into his car and being passed a tablet... why, I wondered, what happened to talking  Gulp! Then, now I’ve heard about these things but I really didn’t think any parent would actually do this, I saw a mum pushing a pram with a gorgeous little baby about one-year-old in it, with a screen attached to the handle bars. I thought, no, the baby can’t seriously be watching that, it can’t be on, it must be a fancy phone thing or something. So, I crossed over and deliberately walked slowly passed mumand was absolutely shocked to see what was obviously a child’s video playing, gulp! I drove home in a bit of a daze, reflecting on all I’d seen and heard, I even had a glass of wine instead of coffee when I got in! I really did wonder, and I do know there are lots of very conscientious parents out there, do most not take any notice of all the information about internet safety, about the dangers of strangers online, of cartoons and films with ‘dodgy characters and images popping up,’ about the danger of too much screen time etc  Do they think ‘my child knows it all, knows how to be safe’, ‘my child only watches a couple of hours and that’s okay,’ ‘my baby loves watching the nursery rhymes,’ googletag.cmd.push ‘I trust my child not to be friends with someone he hasn’t met,’ ‘my child needs the tablet to relax’   A few years back, the Greater Shantallow Area Partnership developed an amazing campaign called Screen Wise, which gave parents information about internet safety, the impact of too much screen time, about parental controls, cyber bullying and much more. I’ve listed a few sites below, and I’m sure there are many more, for you to find some of this information for yourselves - I know as a campaign it had a huge impact on everyone in that community, from babies to teenagers and adults too, so maybe you could start a wave of internet safety messages yourself - find a tip, share it on line and together let’s help all our babies, toddlers, children and teenagers enjoy their tablet, phones and internet and all they can offer. But always remembering ‘too much screen time is not good for me,’ for our lives are about living, about being social, about talking and playing together, not about sitting, zoned out for hours at a time on a machine. We have one le to share with our children, one le to love, so screens away it’s time to talk and play, oh and that means your phone is to go away too. Screen Time RecommendationsWhen I’m under two no screen time for me, and half an hour will do as I go from two to three.And an hour is plenty when I reach four and as I get older you can give me a little bit more. But remember and please, please, do… these times cover the whole day through! Sites For AdviceNSPCC Share Aware videos, tips and information - fab! Internet Safety- lots of information about everything!. Safer Internet Day  Quiz for seven -year-oldsChildnet childnet - great information plus resources to discuss and share with your child.

Paediatrics warn that kids literacy and language skills suffer with screen use, and MRI scans of their brains appear to back up the findings .* ’Digital devices caninterfere with everything from sleep to creativity .* new study suggests that increased screen time could detrimentally change the very brain structure of preschoolers’ .* Screen time ‘can have negative effects on their development, including issues with memory, attention and language skills.… is linked to poorer progress on key developmental measures such as communication skills, problem solving and social interactions.  googletag.cmd.push I’ve been in school this week and helping pupils in year two and three to understand and think about internet safety as it was Internet Safety Day. Maybe you’ve had some information sent home from your child’s school or nursery  I had a great discussion with these children, most of whom did understand when to ask for help, what ‘not to do’ online but scarily some still thought they didn’t need parental controls, thought they ‘knew it all’ when, during our discussion it quickly became apparent that they didn’t. However, this discussion linked to how they used their tablet, when I asked did they have a phone or did they use their parents, I was shocked that most of them didn’t think the dangers on their tablet were also on the phone - nearly the whole class said they would use the phone to watch videos on YouTube or games that ‘popped up.’Gulp!At the end of the day, I was in another class and the teaching assistant explained to me that at the end of every day the children were allowed to watch Netflix for  minutes.I thought this was a treat but, no, it happens every day. Yes, they were watching Horrid Henry which is age appropriate, but I thought why couldn’t it be read to them  Gulp! Walking back to my car at the end of the day with these ‘incidents’ in my head, I saw a child from the class I had just taught getting into his car and being passed a tablet... why, I wondered, what happened to talking  Gulp! Then, now I’ve heard about these things but I really didn’t think any parent would actually do this, I saw a mum pushing a pram with a gorgeous little baby about one-year-old in it, with a screen attached to the handle bars. I thought, no, the baby can’t seriously be watching that, it can’t be on, it must be a fancy phone thing or something. So, I crossed over and deliberately walked slowly passed mumand was absolutely shocked to see what was obviously a child’s video playing, gulp! I drove home in a bit of a daze, reflecting on all I’d seen and heard, I even had a glass of wine instead of coffee when I got in! I really did wonder, and I do know there are lots of very conscientious parents out there, do most not take any notice of all the information about internet safety, about the dangers of strangers online, of cartoons and films with ‘dodgy characters and images popping up,’ about the danger of too much screen time etc  Do they think ‘my child knows it all, knows how to be safe’, ‘my child only watches a couple of hours and that’s okay,’ ‘my baby loves watching the nursery rhymes,’ googletag.cmd.push ‘I trust my child not to be friends with someone he hasn’t met,’ ‘my child needs the tablet to relax’   A few years back, the Greater Shantallow Area Partnership developed an amazing campaign called Screen Wise, which gave parents information about internet safety, the impact of too much screen time, about parental controls, cyber bullying and much more. I’ve listed a few sites below, and I’m sure there are many more, for you to find some of this information for yourselves - I know as a campaign it had a huge impact on everyone in that community, from babies to teenagers and adults too, so maybe you could start a wave of internet safety messages yourself - find a tip, share it on line and together let’s help all our babies, toddlers, children and teenagers enjoy their tablet, phones and internet and all they can offer. But always remembering ‘too much screen time is not good for me,’ for our lives are about living, about being social, about talking and playing together, not about sitting, zoned out for hours at a time on a machine. We have one le to share with our children, one le to love, so screens away it’s time to talk and play, oh and that means your phone is to go away too. Screen Time RecommendationsWhen I’m under two no screen time for me, and half an hour will do as I go from two to three.And an hour is plenty when I reach four and as I get older you can give me a little bit more. But remember and please, please, do… these times cover the whole day through! Sites For AdviceNSPCC Share Aware videos, tips and information - fab! Internet Safety- lots of information about everything!. Safer Internet Day  Quiz for seven -year-oldsChildnet childnet - great information plus resources to discuss and share with your child. Childline Staying Safe On Line great for pre teens and teenagers.

Creator, Tony McCourt, , said a similar Facebook page exists for the Brandywell area so he felt it was only right to set one up for Creggan.  Within a day it had , members and less than a week later it has amassed over ,. Built in the s, Creggan is one of Derry’s best-known estates. It has been home to an abundance of artistic and sporting talent, including Olympic athletes, a Eurovision winner, a Top Ten rock band and international footballers. googletag.cmd.push In the late s and early s, Creggan became a byword for political resistance all over the world. On the Memories of Creggan Facebook page, people have been sharing cherished photos of relatives, historically signicant portraits of the Troubles, images of friends playing on the street, tales of famed characters from the estate, all sorts of myths and legends true and untrue, and everything in between. Former Creggan residents who have emigrated all over the world, including those from America and Australia, have joined the page to reminisce and share old tales from their childhood. “Everybody is enjoying it,” Tony explained, “they’re all sharing old memories.” googletag.cmd.push Friends contacted Tony to tell him that they can’t get their mothers off the page, one of the ladies is -years-old and is “loving all the old photos so much”. He added: “They’ve said they’re getting no housework done and no wains are being watched because they’re all too busy on the page. People are talking about their schooldays and friends who haven’t been in touch for many years are reconnecting.”  Memories Tony spent most of his childhood in Creggan and lived there until he got married at the age of . His brother, Peggy, still lives in Creggan and Tony has happy memories of “great neighbours and friends”. “The page brings back good memories. Nobody had anything but everybody shared what they had with each other.” The Troubles were never far from peoples’ minds, and people had their own troubles, but Tony prefers to recall the joyful times. “There was a lot of heartbreak at that time. But I like to remember all the positive experiences I had growing up. Playing football in the street all day when there were barely any cars around. “I remember the first TV on the street, it was the Kennedy’s and we used to go in to watch the FA Cup final. I also remember watching Popeye and the Lone Ranger. “I had a bad leg at one time and I remember a friend of mines carrying me to Grianan Fort and back again.” Moving forward, Tony would simply like to see people use the page in a positive way. “There are no real rules, we’re just asking people to keep it clean and to refrain from any insults. “Everyone is finding it funny going through all the old photos and that’s what it’s all about.” With that said Tony was off to the attic to unearth a few more boxes of photographic treasures from his boyhood.  ‘Heroes’ Peggy McCourt has lived in Creggan Heights for sixty-two years, asked what the estate means to him, he proclaimed: “Creggan means community.” He explained: “It was tight-knit no one had very much but what they had they shared be it a cup of milk to a drop of sugar, or can you lend me ma three slices of bread. “We all grew up in the Creggan, most of the families came from the Springtown Camp so hardship was a way of le but they made sure their wains were fed and watered, even going without themselves. “Then came the civil rights movement, then a full-blown war on the streets but again the Creggan community rallied around those who were affected by the conflict. “So many young people were first interned just because they were Catholic, many were arrested, put though interrogation centres and ended up in prison.” Peggy continued: “The hunger strikes took their toll on many families but no matter what went on Creggan grew into the best estate in Derry – in the world. “Growing up was hard at the time we lost so many friends and family members but it was a fun place to grow up, friendships formed that still last to this day. The friends I had sixty odd years ago are as strong as when we first met.  “No video games, all street games, football, rounders, even cricket, hopscotch, all these plus many more sitting out till  or  telling ghost stories, then you ran home the living day lights scared out of you. “Creggan is more than a council estate, its a way of le, its in your blood, we don’t even have to look anywhere for heroes, Creggan is full of them they are called ma’s and da’s.”   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Born and raised in Derry until the age of , I always had a calling for adventure and opportunity, and it was at this stage in my le I took a huge leap of faith and went in chase of the American Dream. A little Irish girl lost in the big city of New York awaiting my immigration papers is where I learned so many le lessons and character building. At the age of  I stumbled upon a movie The Secret which would eventually change my le and my direction. googletag.cmd.push This movie for me was a beginning, an awakeningyou will. I had opened my eyes to a whole new world of self-belief, ambitions and possibilities. At the age of  I opened my first business which was a Health Care Call Centre. Alongside this I worked for a healthcare administration business which was family run and set up by my mother in New York. Whilst I found great business acumen and skillset in my work, it took its toll on me. The corporate pace and stress fuelled environment was not my fit so I sold my shares in the family business and sold my own business. googletag.cmd.push This was an important and pivotal moment for me in my le where I would embark on a journey of self-discovery and promise. From the beginning of le as I know it until now, I have never known fulfilment like being a mom. Being we to my husband, Dr Frank Dos Santos, and mother to our gorgeous and amazing children and brought me happiness like no other and for this I am eternally blessed and grateful. The le we share together is precious and I value this every day. There came a point for me personally, where I had reached that feeling of fulfilment and happiness and these feelings are what I embrace and evoke everyday in le. Drawing on my previous experiences and knowledge of The Secret as well as the process of le which had led me to this point, spurred me on to find my true passion in le. Helping others. I thought, whatI can pass on these feelings that I’m feeling  WhatI can help others to feel joy, hope and happiness whatever their environment or circumstance  So, in , alongside my business partner Chiara I set up a company Joy In The Workplace whose sole aim was to bring and implement productivity and joy into the workplace. This was my fit. The gratication and sense of fulfilment in helping others became a part of me. I knew I could do this, loved doing it and I did not want to stop here. I knew that feeling of being in a corporate environment and feeling stressed, overworked and unfulfilled and being able to approach and work with iniduals and groups who were in the same position and offer them a road to productivity and happiness in their role was le changing. I wanted to do more. In the Secret Bob Proctor was the clear definitive practitioner for me. I got in touch with the Proctor Gallagher Institute and trained in becoming a PGI Consultant The programmes set by Bob Proctor and Sandy Gallagher are some of the most effective and efficient I have ever seen and I was thrilled to become a part of it and be able to offer coaching to clients in both the U.S and Ireland. I recently was promoted within this company to Senior Coach and Account Executive which now enables me to offer some of the most elite personal development programmes PGI has to offer. Working alongside these esteemed colleagues has been a huge ambition of mine and I have learned so many invaluable skills and ideologies that I cannot wait to share with more and more clients whether personal or in a group setting. As my journey to date describes, I have achieved some great things and I am still achieving and believing every day. But there has been for quite some time, a feeling of wanting to offer something back home. I often would hear stories in the news, and reports from my hometown Derry in Ireland of the suicide epidemic which has been playing on my mind for quite some time. It is with such sadness and despair that I have felt the strong urge to help in some way. Derry is such a beautul town steeped in wonderful facts of history and monument but there is a huge cry for help and I simply cannot and will not ignore this. In understanding these facts, I have purchased a building in the city and will be hosting mindset workshops for both adults and children in the near future. It is never too early to implement positivity and to teach the importance of le and its value. In addition to this my foundation for suicide prevention is well underway as I have been working constructively with a team of like minded professionals from the city in order to structure and further develop and implement this project which I know in my heart will instil a new light of positivity and hope for those going through tough times and needing some guidance. My connection to Derry has been growing as of lately and I have found myself travelling back and forward trying to help in ious ways. Myself alongside Catrina Crillyhave set up “Bee Me LTD” which is the first children’s personal development company of its kind. We will be launching a child friendly app and host Bee Me Camps which will have a fun and friendly environment where children will learn about self-image, empowerment, positivity and how thoughts create things. We’re excited about this project and cannot wait to see it develop. My journey has come with its teachings, its blessings and its le changing moments and I for one would not change any of it. I am at this point in my le where I am seeing my dreams come to reality. I am helping others to see THEIR dreams and make them a reality. My work is not work for me anymore, it is my passion and I feel incredibly lucky to wake up everyday to the le I have and to be able to share my teachings that will help my clients achieve the le they too want. It is my pleasure and my honour. The world is ours and we can think it into whatever we want it to be. And together, we are making it happen.

But just one win in five league games since then and the league table is now taking a dferent picture, and it is not particularly palatable for Paul OKane, Richard McCarter and their players.McCarter said in the build up to Saturdays game against Bangor that the league table was to be avoided because of the psychological implications of seeing his team second from bottom, despite playing well in recent games. Four points on Saturday would change everything however – Derry would rise three, four or maybe five places, above Bangor, away from second bottom, away from relegation fears. They just had to win.They didnt.As Storm Denis raged across the skies, all Division  games were called off, bar two, with the Judges Road surface holding up. Unfortunately, that durability only suited Bangor, who used the conditions as part fo their game plan, and did damage in the first half that the hosts could not recover from. The absence of prop Sam Duffy was ultimately pivotal for the home side as Bangor used their physical superiority to dominant up front and get just enough points needed to get a hugely valuable win. That victory would have been much more emphatic o not for some heroic defending by the hosts, who also suffered from questionable decision making in their own attack which cost them crucial points at crucial moments.Derry could also look at some harsh refereeing decisions, but at the end of a day in which most things went against them, the celebrations of the Bangor players told its own story. They left the pitch drenched and muddied, but victorious, whilst not even a losing bonus point could console Derry, who will feel building pressure going into this weeks home game against Tullamore. Bad startEvery one of the  points scored on Saturday came in the first half and they came early on. Derry, despite knowing the huge importance of a victory, started poorly and were on the back foot from the start. Bangor had a strong wind pushing them on and they held Derry in their own  from the off, evengtually getting their reward for their strong start after five minutes. The visitors pressure told as front row Phil Whyte forced his way over through a crowd of bodies. Rhys Larmour converted and Bangor had the perfect start at Judges Road.To their credit, Derry responded in the best possible manner as they levelled almost immediately.The score owed everything to the hard work and tenacity of David Ferguson who took his team forward with a driving run. He was eventually stopped but offloaded to the lightning quick Simon Logue, who eluded a number of challenges before scoring right under the posts, giving Alex McDonell an easy conversion to make it -.That did not prove to be a precursor to a high-scoring game however, the deteriorating conditions making it dficult for both teams to showcase their attacking ability. It was Bangor who took control through sheer will and they put Derry onto the back foot again as they sought to restore their lead. Mounting pressure from the visitors saw Derry penalised and referee Keane Davison awarded a penalty try and the hosts had it all to do again at -.The half time break gave Derry a chance to re-evaluate their position and come again, but the worsening conditions only added to the challenge facing them. It was Bangor who had something to hold onto and they emerged after the break to take the game to the hosts again.Derry were better overall in that second period, but impatience and bad decision making cost them progression and momentum, while at times they had to dig deep to stay in the game as Bangor pushed them right back into their own  again. The defence at times was superb, but this was a game that they needed to win, and it just was not happening in attack, each small opening quickly shut down as much by their own play as by Bangor defending. It was an ultimately frustrating second half, and a result which has serious repercussions for Derrys season. There are now six games remaining and unless results improve Derry will have a very uncomfortable few weeks ahead of them. Tullamore visit Judges Road this week for a game which has now taken on extreme importance for the home side, who have to dig deep, not for the first time in recent seasons, to ensure that the club remain in Division C for next season, at the very minimum. At the moment, the weather is the least of their concerns. googletag.cmd.push TeamsCity of Derry: James Hamilton, David Ferguson, Quermy Wamerdam, Gerard Doherty, Criag Huey, Stephen Corr, Tiernan Thornton, Richard Baird, Ricardo Schneider, Alex McDonnell, Thomas Cole, Dennis Posternak, David Graham, Callum OHagan, Simon Logue. : Ross Harkin, Barry Laverty, Stephen Kelly, Neil Burns, David Lapsely.Bangor RFC: Phil Whyte, Andrew Shaw, JP Leary, Craig Burton, Michael Ferguson, David Bradford, Jamie Clegg, Mike Weir, Alistair Lockhart, Rhys Larmour, Connor Scallon, Zack Kerr, Mark Widdowson, Nathan Graham, Logan Norman. : Even Welland, Andrew Jackson, Andrew Smyth, Max Preston, Ryan Young.Referee: Keane Davison googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

As a result, innovative ways will have to be found to include the building in the new retail scheme which could also include new housing.There are also some who believe that a multi-storey car park mdash with retail outlets on the ground floor mdash should be considered in the new development and built on top of the existing Irish Street car park footprint.Local council officials say that they are committed to working with the Downpatrick business community, residents and other stakeholders on the redevelopment of the Irish Street site.They hope that working alongside local people on the redevelopment proposal will provide consultants charged with coming up with a design on the way forward with an understanding of what residents and traders would like to see and what would work at this particular site.The development brief for the town centre location is expected to outline what all those involved in the process would like to see happen in Irish Street to maximise the potential of every square inch of available space.Leading High Street brands including Marks and Spencer and Home Bargains have expressed an interest in the Irish Street location which is the last large scale development site remaining in Downpatrick town centre.It is over two years since it was revealed that the former police station site had been earmarked for a major economic regeneration initiative, with local council officials confirming recently that ious pockets of land which make-up the Irish Street site have now been purchased.Downpatrick councillor Oonagh Hanlon has welcomed confirmation that a so-called soft market testing exercise is to proceed shortly.ldquoThis will allow potential developers and interested parties an opportunity to visit the Irish Street site during a planned open day. This will allow them to give their views on the potential of the site and point out any likely constraints within any proposed project, she explained.Cllr Hanlon added: ldquoThe feedback provided will be used to assist the Department for Communities and Newry, Mourne and Down Council to prepare a development brief for the site.ldquoThe regeneration project for the former police base site provides an opportunity to regenerate Downpatrick town centre.

But I am committed to working to find solutions that deliver better for our communities and improve lives across Northern Ireland.ldquoI will be assessing the pressures across my department reflecting on my priorities, the commitments in the lsquoNew Decade: New Approachrsquo document and the budget made available for the period ahead.Ms Mallon said that as a result, it is therefore ldquotoo early to comment on specic schemes such as the Ballynahinch bypass.Designed to alleviate chronic town centre congestion in Ballynahinch and along the main approach roads to the town, major new roundabouts are proposed at the Belfast Road junction with the Saintfield Road and at the Newcastle Road junction with the Downpatrick Road.Overtaking lanes stretching almost  metres are proposed at either end of the by-pass where major new roundabouts are to be constructed, with the scheme also including a shared footpath and cycle lane.During last weekrsquos meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Council, there was across-the-board political support for a motion seeking a meeting with Ms Mallon and seniors roads engineers to discuss the Ballynahinch scheme.It was tabled by Rowallane councillor Billy Walker, who is keen to see work starting on the near two-mile scheme to link the Newcastle and Saintfield roads.He said the scheme has been shovel ready for some time and is hoping the Department for Infrastructure will allocate funding to allow construction work, which is expected to take in excess of  months to complete, to begin.Cllr Walker argued that the Newry, Mourne and Down area has missed out on signicant roads funding for decades, with many major schemes constructed in other parts of the Province.He added: ldquoThe time has come for this council to demand its fair share of infrastructure funding. I have been a councillor for over  years and the bypass issue has been raised during every one of them.Slieve Croob councillor Cathy Mason described Ballynahinch as the ldquogateway to the wider South Down area through which all traffic must pass, including HGVs.

However, a buoyant St Maryrsquos outfit replied with points from Cora Convery, Alishia Lundy and Shannon Sloan to maintain their six-point lead.Six points quickly became  by the half-time break as St Maryrsquos continued to terrorise St Fanchearsquos and scores from Doran , Abi Murphyand the lethal Shannon Sloangave the locals a commanding - to - lead.St Franchearsquos came out fighting in the second half, scoring a goal and two points without reply to reduce the arrears to  point, but that was as good as it got as St Maryrsquos quickly regained the initiative and went for broke.They certainly put the foot on the gas and points from Erin Sands, Katie Convie and Cara Doran had St Maryrsquos well clear St Fanchearsquos kept on to the bitter end and forced a great save form St Marys goalkeeper Fia McFaul as they tried to get back into contention.However, McFaul and her defensive wall of Keely OrsquoNeill, player of the match Nora Maguire, team captain Neva Loudon, Katie Black, Louise Lundy and Lucy Morgan kept St Fanchearsquos at bay.At midfield, Eimear Teggart and Erin Sands dominated throughout the game and kept their dazzling forward busy with a constant supply of good ball.Abi Murphy, Cara Doran, Alishia Lundy, Cora Convery, Shannon Sloan and Katie Convie were literally unplayable and gave the St Fanchearsquos defence a torrid time all afternoon.St Maryrsquos: Fia McFaul, Keely OrsquoNeill, Nora Maguire, Neva Loudon, Katie Black, Louise Lundy, Lucy Morgan, Eimear Teggart, Erin Sands, Abie Murphy, Cara Doran, Alishia Lundy, Cora Convie, Shannon Sloan, Katie Convie.

Local authority officials hope that work on the much-needed project can start within four years.News of the new leisure centre plan, exclusively revealed in the Recorder last October, is being discussed by senior council officials and local politicians and recently topped the agenda during a special workshop examining the way forward.Among the proposals being examined are building a new complex at the rear of the current Newcastle Centre, which enjoys protected status. This would also result in the current outdoor Tropicana swimming pool being bulldozed.Local politicians were recently presented with an update on progress on a new leisure proposal, with council officials confirming this week that a review of ious feasibility studies and their findings is being considered by the organisation.While the local authority said that it is not yet in a position to confirm any plans or timelines in relation to the Newcastle Centre or indeed the Tropicana, it insists any new-build will not encroach on the promenade at the rear.Most signicantly, the council has confirmed that any commissioning of a full economic appraisal and business case would involve consultations, including public meetings, as part of the process.Council officials say that they are ldquoacutely aware of the need for improved leisure provision in Newcastle and are keen to address criticism that on wet days in the resort, there is little provision for both residents and tourists.While redeveloping the existing Newcastle Centre, which forms part of the Annesley Buildings, is one option moving forward, there are suggestions that given the age of the building, the scale of the work involved an the constraints of the site, a new-build at the rear would be more most cost-effective.One of the key issues the council will have to address is how it intends to replace the Tropicana , as widely expected, it will be bulldozed. There are those pushing for an indoor water facility which would be available all year round.Council officials are also keen to ensure that the redevelopment of the Main Street site is in keeping with a part of the resort where millions of pounds have been invested over recent years. Serious consideration will also have to be given to on-site car parking, included adequate disabled provision.In addition, council officials say that they recognise that as one of Northern Irelandrsquos premier tourist resorts, Newcastle does not have a modern indoor leisure facility which has been its Achilles heel for some considerable time.Two sites were previously identied for a new leisure centre in the resort, with sports pitches at Donard Park the preferred option.However, councillors subsequently switched attention to the former St. Maryrsquos Girlsrsquo Primary School campus at Shanslieve Drive. Despite a number of attempts to secure the site and hopes that a deal could be agreed with local church officials, it was bought by supermarket giant Lidl to develop a new store and dedicated base for the Mourne Mountain Rescue Team.Councillors are keen for the local authority to take the lead and ensure that Newcastle boasts an ultra-modern community and leisure facility.They say that the provision of a new centre for residents and visitors is long overdue and that a resort the size of Newcastle should and must have adequate leisure provision. Some councillors are keen to see a family fun pool in the proposed new-build.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokeswoman confirmed that several feasibility studies and strategic reports have been compiled in relation to the Newcastle Centre.She also confirmed that a recent review of the feasibility studies and their findings has been completed and is being considered by the local authority.ldquoUntil further scoping works are carried out, the council cannot confirm any plans or timelines in relation to the Newcastle Centre or the Tropicana, said the spokeswoman.She added: ldquoHowever, encroaching on to the promenade is not anticipated.

Ryan explained how a friendship forged in football gave birth to what is believed to be the only dedicated retro football shop in Northern Ireland.He said: “Pete and I are both Bangor fans – that’s a real labour of love – but we didn’t know each other until we met through work. We worked together for years in Yell where we pretty much talked about football non-stop.A Linfield shirt from  “The idea to start selling shirts online came after I’d been over to watch the Frampton fightand I went to the Classic Football Shirts Shop in Manchester. It’s  times bigger than the shop we have here.“I was with my fiancee at the time, now my we, and I said to her I’m going to try and do something like this online. I know how to do marketing, I love football, social media is easy enough when you know what you’re doing so I thought, I’ll give it a go. She didn’t object so that was a good start.“I started doing the shirts online last December. I got a bit of traction so I applied for a stall at St George’s in December and again in August.“I was getting married in July so I probably should have only been concentrating on that and nothing , but then I found out this unit in Smithfield was available. The Northern Ireland Subbeteo print is the top seller“Just before I was getting married – I think it was only a couple of days – I signed for the unit. Just before we got married I had to break the news to my we that I now owned a shop.“Around that time I spoke to Pete about coming on board. He said, ‘you don’t know what you’re doing, I don’t know what I’m doing, let’s see what we can do together’.”Askedthe dynamic changes when something you love becomes your job, Pete said: “I could never see us getting bored of it, I think I’ll forever be in that bubble, it’s something I love. “People work in office jobs and talk about football all day, that’s what we were like. Now we’ve got a set up where we can talk about football to whoever comes in and it’s part of the job.”Some of retro kit coasters for saleRyan commented: “On the business side of things we’re talking to clubs, striking up partnerships with other companies. Everything revolves around a love of football.”Pete said: “It’s good getting into the business side of it. There’s a buzz that comes from speaking to commercial managers of football clubs, trying to strike up partnerships.“It’s really easy to speak to people over here, quite a few clubs have heard of us.”He continued: “We’ve four clubs from the Irish League we’re in partnership with – Portadown, Linfield, Glentoran and Cltonville – and we’re branching across into England too.”At the moment the NI Classic Shirt Co is a part time venture, with the shop open on Thursday afternoonsand Fridays and Saturdays from . to .pm.Pete said: “We’re hoping to get full time. We’re going after clubs in England, Scotland and the League of Ireland as well as more local clubs. If they put in orders of a lot of units that can allow us to get a regular income and go full time.The interior of the shop in Smithfield market“We want to do as much Irish League stuff as we can with every club, that’s including the Championship. It would be great to get everyone on board. We’ve got a concept that can work with any club in the world.”Some of the shop’s best selling items are art prints of Subbuteo players from the Irish League or national team in kits from the eras in which they played. Another popular line sees a selection of classic kits displayed on coasters, mugs, T-shirts and art prints.And for those who like memorabilia they can wear the shop has a great range of old shirts, some match-worn.The strike partners leading the retro football revolution in Northern Ireland talked about some of their key team mates in their bid to climb the commercial ladder.Ryan said: “Tom Woodsdoes the Subbuteo prints. I approached him way back in the summer. I saw what he was doing with teams all over the UK. I commissioned him to do the Northern Ireland one which is a fantastic seller for us. “It’s kits from ious eras worn by  of the best ever players – there’s nothing like this available anywhere .“For the Subbuteo designs the club sends us photos of the players, we send them onto Tom and he works his magic. “We’ve also got him to do some Irish Leagues teams that we’ve teamed up with.” Pete continued: “With Hally Designs, they produce artwork featuring classic kits and you can turn them into prints or coasters or mugs or T-shirts. “They also do art prints of classic moments like when we beat England -. “We persuaded them to branch into the Irish League.”Ryan said: “There’s always new ideas out there, new brands to team up with.”In one of the framed prints by Hally Designs I spot the dubious yellow Broomhill kit which Glenavon wore in . It’s a kit I still own, but can’t recall wearing this side of the millennium.“Some of the worst kits are the best loved,” commented Ryan. “Some of them are an acquired taste. The fans love the Cltonville Kit Kat kit, we keep selling out of that on the coasters.”As well as the bespoke printed items, the shop is home to an array of old football programmes and some rare football shirts.Pete, an Arsenal fan, is particularly proud the shop has recently acquired the club’s yellow and blue ‘bruised banana’ away kit from - as well as a ‘Bergkamp ’ Holland shirt from .He said: “Bergkamp was the top man for me. It’ll pain me to sell those shirts but that’s how a business works.”Ryan said: “When I say we get shirts from all over the world I’m not trying to be vague, they genuinely come from all over the world. “There’s a Linfield top in there I got from Hong Kong. We’ve worked with collectors in Thailand, we’ve got stuff from America. “We get stuff locally as well, for example we sold a ‘ Red Star Belgrade top that had belonged to a guy who lived just outside Belfast. It was bought by someone in Miami, Florida. That shirt has done some miles.“There’s a Rangers match-worn Alex Cleland in there with number two on the back. It came from a collector in Asia.“We do get requests from people looking for specic shirts. There’s a network of collectors you can put a message out to and see what people have.”Of the resurgence in the Irish League that has helped boost the sales of memorabilia, Pete said: “We’re finding a lot of people are coming back to Glentoran and there’s been a big cash injection at Larne. “Some matches are on BBC, some on Sky Sports. You are getting good crowds again, it’s coming back.“Just last week we sold a the Glentoran home kit from - by auction for £. I reckon it would have cost about £ to £ at the time.“The Irish League is our bread and butter, but we want to branch out into the lower leagues in England and Scotland. “We’d especially love to get our own club Bangor on board. There’s a big fanbase still there.”Ryan said: “We’ve spoken to a few Irish League players on Twitter – we’ve got feedback from Joe Gormley and Liam Boyce, they both like their versions on the Cltonville Subbuteo print.”Ryan continued: “We don’t come from a retail background, we’re just football fans.“Initially I was just emailing every address I could find, pitching to them and explaining what I was trying to do. Now we’re speaking to clubs on the phone.“Obviously George Best put Northern Ireland on the map but recently with us doing well in the Euros people are paying attention outside of here.”While the online shop is rising in prominence the lads are trying to spread the word that they have a physical shop in Smithfield as well. “So many people come in to the shop and say they didn’t know we were here,” said Ryan. “Now they’re coming once a month to see what new things we’ve got in. Word of mouth for us is massive, customers telling their friends.“In most sports shops in Northern Ireland you can only get the most recent kits from the main Premier League, European and Scottish teams. We’re trying to offer something a bit dferent.”\"\" for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from Belfast News LetterSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bMVAic sc-bAeIUo dEhRfb\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Cecilia is on the wireless issuing a weather warning and my son is in the back seat asking mewe’re going to be late for school.By Jonny McCambridgeWednesday, th February , : am\"\"Parallel parking, easier to spell than executeWe may well be late. If we are it will have been caused by his insistence on wearing his Incredible Hulk pants today, a demand which led to a panicked last minute inventory of damp garments hung on steamy radiators. However, it seems uncharitable to mention that now so instead I just grit my teeth and tighten my grip on the steering wheel.I’ve almost driven past before I notice the gap between two stationary cars. On a dark, snowy morning a parking space near the school is as rare as a newborn with whiskers, so I hurriedly apply the brakes and put on the left indicator.However, as soon as I begin to reverse I feel something is not right, it’s an instinct which tells me that the positioning of the car is not quite as it should be. Perhaps I’m a little bit too far forward, or too far back. Or maybe I don’t turn the steering wheel far enough, or too much. I know from habit it’s wrong but I keep going.I attempt to straighten the vehicle and, to be fair, some of it is in the parking space. Unfortunately more of it is encroaching onto the road and blocking the flow of traffic. I look out the side window, I can see the footpath which I want to park beside. It’s definitely within walking distance. \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...So I start trying to get my car closer to that path. I turn the steering wheel one way and reverse a little, then I turn the wheel the other way and go forward. I seem to be further from the pavement now.I try switching the direction that I’m turning the wheel. Now the front of my car mounts the footpath while the rear hangs out towards the middle of the carriageway, asI’m attempting some sort of audacious road-block.My son, in the back seat, is watching me. He is impassive.‘What are you doing daddy ’‘I’m trying to park the car son.’‘But why are you driving on the footpath daddy ’‘It’s all because of your flipping Incredible Hulk pants!’ I answer unconvincingly.Several minutes pass tortuously like this before I concede what has become clear, that I’m going to have to start again. I put on my right indicator and pull again into the busy school run traffic. The other cars stop and wait, growling impatiently while I steady myself, select reverse gear and try once again to execute the parallel park.But there’s an inevitability to my ultimate failure now. I’m flustered and a little embarrassed and my hands seem to have lost their dexterity. Conscious that I was too far out last time I over-compensate with the steering wheel and soon feel the bump as one rear tyre lts onto the footpath.I try to straighten up but, such is my panic, that I’ve lost the ability to distinguish left from right. I jerk wildly at the steering wheel and feel the bump as my second rear tyre mounts the pavement. Now the front of my car is hanging out in the middle of the road, forcing traffic to go round it.And then I just give up. Or to put it another way, my brain decides to close down. I’ve noticed this state of vacillation come over me before in moments of great stress. While my body is still in the car my mind has taken itself off to a sunnier place, a golden meadow where I’m playing with a labrador pup and picking daisies. It’s very enjoyable for a few moments, until a blast of a horn brings me back to reality. I look at my son in the back seat, his angelic features fixed on me.‘Why has your face gone so red daddy ’It’s not the fact that I’m not very good at parallel parking which bothers me, I’ve long ago reconciled myself to that failing. It’s the fact that I’m embarrassing myself in public. Again. I’ve convinced myself that everyone will be talking about me. Again.Back in my days of therapy I used to chat to a lot of counsellors who attempted to help change the way I think. If a brain tends to dwell on the negative then there are techniques which can be used to separate thought from emotion, fact from prejudice, to teach the mind to be less self-critical. Part of this is reminding myself that other people obviously have better things to talk about than my deficiencies.But on this morning, with my car jutting out onto a road at an unnatural angle and causing a traffic jam, it’s a struggle to believe that. Not only have I convinced myself that my pathetic parking will be all of the talk of the village for days, but I also fear that Netflix have already commissioned a  part series on the debacle, with Daniel Day-Lewis talked out of retirement to bring my tortured soul to le on the small screen.There is nothing  to be done but to abandon the parking attempt altogether, to find another space far away where there are fewer cars. Swaziland would be good.And so I drive away. In my rear-view mirror I’m sure I can see a granny parking a giant x in the same space on the first attempt. I drive around the corner and up the hill further away from the school. I park in a quieter spot, away from the constipation of congestion.I turn off the engine and watch some of the other parents rushing with their children towards the school gates. Their faces are strained against the weather and it’s obvious that they don’t notice me in . I relax because I can see things more clearly now. These people are not bothered with my deficiencies at parking or anything . They have their own lives. I doubt nowany of them are even aware of me, let alone discussing my parallel parking.Reassured, I step out of the car. My shoe slips on the snow and I slide painfully onto my backside in the middle of the pavement.A young mother has to stop suddenly to avoid treading on my head.I begin to vacillate again. I think I’ll just lie here in the snow for a bit.\"\" for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from Belfast News LetterSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bMVAic sc-bAeIUo dEhRfb\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

More than two years on, a play he wrote based on the Good Friday Agreement has premiered in London, raising money for CALM – the Campaign Against Living Miserably – and getting rave reviews.The play ‘On McQuillian’s Hill’ features Helena Bereen, known for her roles in films ‘Hunger’ and ‘The Devil’s Doorway’, and as a stalwart of Belfast’s theatre scene. In spite of a long and busy career, the opportunity to work in London never presented itself ... until now.Set in the aftermath of the Good Friday Agreement, the play written in  centres around IRA man Fra Maline. With peace on a kne-edge, bitter memories, family secrets and lies long buried in the bog threaten to resurface as an accidental family reunion descends into pitch black farce.

Those were dferent times, and that was a very dferent experience.”Playwright Crilly was an acclaimed writer and actor, who had long since given up penning plays and treading the boards. Exchanging full houses for social housing, at the time of his death he was working at Peabody Housing Trust, where few of his colleagues knew he had been involved in the theatre at all, let alone that he was an award-winning playwright, and had worked as an actor at the highest level, including time with the Royal Shakespeare Company and a litany of television appearances.Doreen Productions formed for the sole purpose of introducing Crilly’s work to a new audience. ‘On McQuillan’s Hill’ opened at the Finborough Theatre, directed by Belfast’s Jonathan Harden.

His second vegan recipe book, Dirty Vegan: Another Bite, was released last month alongside a tie-in BBC cookery programme.Last Friday, Matt Pritchard visited the Penarth Pier Pavilion to discuss his latest culinary enterprise and prepare a vegan dish with Mel Grfin of Grfin Books.Pritchard has not lost his mad-dash style and performative vigour. He relished his new role as he prepared for the talk: ldquoI enjoy it, man. Itrsquos better than shoving a drumstick up your arse on stage, he said.Originally from Cardf, Pritchard studied cooking at college but dedicated himself to professional skating when he was sponsored at .ldquoDirty Sanchez was great. It was just  years of mayhem.ldquoWe were getting paid to travel around the world. Getting drunk and off your head with your mates ndash thatrsquos like winning the lottery when yoursquore that age.ldquoI loved it. But then it took its toll on my mental health. Especially the drugs part of it.ldquoI needed to do something about it and thatrsquos when I started my fitness journey.ldquoWith my addictive personality, when I do something, Irsquove got to do it ndash not just dip my toes in.ldquoI started looking into veganism because a lot of endurance athletes were vegan. The more I researched it the more it started making sense to me.ldquoI love animals. Irsquove got a dog and I wouldnrsquot eat him.

So many people were trying to put me off it.ldquoBut on a vegan diet, I did The Decker, which is  full Iron Men in  days.ldquoNow Irsquom looking at doing the Double Decker which is  in  days. On my th birthday Irsquoll be doing  of something for  years.ldquoItrsquos another way of proving to people that veganism helps me, and that age is but a number.Pritchard became vegan in  and began to film his own cooking show on YouTube. In , the BBC aired the first series of Dirty Vegan.ldquoIf yoursquod told me  years ago that Irsquod be sitting here with you now and talking about vegan cooking books, I would I have laughed in your face, he said.Pritchard said that he was forced to leave Twitter last year because of abuse from online trolls and members of the Welsh farming community.Why were people so hostile ldquoBecause of guilt. Anger does it. Cognitive dissonance. Theyrsquore too lazy to change or they donrsquot want to believe it.ldquoBut the evidence is there. What I care about is the evidence and the animals.\"I donrsquot want to kill something that doesnrsquot want to be killed. If you eat steak, how can you say you care for all animals In his characteristic salt-of-the earth way, Pritchard hopes to entertain audiences with his new series whilst gently educating them about the benefits of vegan cooking.ldquoYou know, therersquos   arguing about Brexit. Therersquos   arguing about meat and veganism.ldquoWersquore all arguing amongst ourselves like lunatics. This show is just there for people to enjoy. ldquoTherersquos a bit of fun in it.

Who they are will have a real influence on Welsh Labourrsquos prospects in  and beyond. We are the most successful part of the UK Labour family over the last decade in terms of winning elections and running a national government. However, that cannot be taken for granted. An unpopular UK leader could make our task much harder next May.The first and most important attribute the next UK leader must have is the ability to fulfil the mission of our party - to become a party of government again across the UK, not just a party of protest. I want someone who can implement our labour values in government, not just talk about them.That requires some honesty about why we took such a beating at the general election, together with the willingness and strength to do something about it. Offering more of the same would be a betrayal of people who need a UK Labour government and will condemn the UK [or what is left of it] to a further decade of the Tories.We didnrsquot get hammered in  for one reason alone - there were a number of them. Agreeing to the election in the first place when we plainly were not prepared. Agreeing to an election certain to be dominated by Brexit. Our vacillation on Brexit when people wanted certainty and leadership. The factional infighting. The demonisation of the last UK Labour government, asthat would encourage people to vote for us. I grew up with  Tory years in power and I know that things really did get better following Labourrsquos victory in .An overloaded manesto with some popular policies but without a key central message. A costed manesto that then had a huge extra spending pledge added to it, meaning that people didnrsquot believe that we were serious or credible one even the policies they liked. A staggeringly inept UK campaign that wasted the amazing dedication of our volunteers, prepared to go out in the cold and rain to campaign. Our abject failure on anti-Semitism. This and much more.Many people recognised that Boris Johnson is a dishonest man who is completely out of touch with most peoplersquos lives. Lots of people still voted for him or refused to vote Labour because they could not trust and support us. Our own people - long term Labour voters - struggled to support us. Our leader was undeniably part of the reason why. Blaming our defeat solely on the mainstream media or whichever side of the Brexit ide we favour isnt honest and will not help us to win in the future.I donrsquot much care whether someone claims they are from the left, soft left, centre or old right of the Labour Party. We all have a stake in our party and the countries of the UK. These are serious times and we need a serious figure who can nail the Tories and the clown in number ten.Irsquove been interested in what Lisa Nandy has to say and believe that Lisa and many other figures have a key role to play in rebuilding our party ndash first as a credible opposition, then as a credible alternative government at the next UK General Election.However, I think the person best placed to win the argument, and even more importantly to help us win an election, is Keir Starmer. Itrsquos not the protesting, or the taking part that counts. Itrsquos the winning and the decisions you get to make in government that can change peoplesrsquo lives and change the country for the better. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He acted to prosecute MPs who had abused expenses and Murdoch journalists in the phone-hacking scandal when he was Director of Public Prosecutions.We need to win back these voters that we lost in the last general election. It was heart-breaking on election night, to see Labour lose places like Wrexham and Bridgend.The UK Labour Party must get back to being a party that votersrsquo can trust. That means we cannot just have a ldquoone more heave approach. We need someone who can speak to the whole of our country, not just one region or subset of voters, with the values and vision to win. Keir fits the bill. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Natural Resources Wales and the Welsh Assembly should not ignore the issue this time around.Responding to public concerns about the new plans, a spokesman for the Welsh Government said: ldquoIf EDF Energy submits a formal application, Natural Resources Wales will carry out a thorough assessment of the proposed activity before making a determination, having regard to the need to protect the environment and human health, as required by the Marine and Coastal Access Act .ldquoI know many constituents are very worried, said Stephen Doughty MP for Cardf South and Penarth.ldquoWe shouldnrsquot be a dumping ground for others, and I will continue to raise concerns on behalf of residents and report back any information I receive.To comment on the proposed sample plan, visit NRWrsquos consultation page before Wednesday, March  at: naturalresources.wales permits-and-permissions permit-applications-consultations-and-decisions current-consultations-marine-licence-applicantions hinkley-point-c-sediment-sampling-plan-sp  langen article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was Captain Robertrsquos who did it.Mr Davies spent time conducting research in Bilbao, Durango, Gernika, and Alicante where he consulted Spanish historians and met with descendants of those involved in the civil war.Outwitting Franco: The Welsh Maritime Heroes of the Spanish Civil War can be purchased on Amazon for pound in paperback.Alternatively, it can be purchased digitally for pound on Kindle. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

She said: ldquoIt has been a privilege to be headteacher of Dinas Powys Primary for so long.ldquoEvery day is dferent, bringing its own rewards and challenges.ldquoI have witnessed the great success of our pupils and now have the wonderful experience of over  children of our past pupils attending our school.ldquoThe whole team of staff ensures the best possible opportunities are provided for all our lovely children.ldquoIt is dficult to choose a single highlight. I enjoy it all ndash from meeting the parents and their child on admission, to organising the annual budget and ensuring the school is well resourced and maintained.The school recently renewed its green status under the Welsh Governmentrsquos coloured banding system which recognises its high performance.The New Curriculum for Wales, which will be implemented in , has already been fully embraced by the school.Staff have been trained in co-operative learning and emphasis has been placed on active participation in class.The school prioritises the health and wellbeing of its students.Mrs Thompson said: ldquoThe school has a recognised ethos of warmth, care, and love with an inidual approach to all pupils and their families which ensures that children feel secure and make the best academic and social progress throughout their school le.In January, the school was invited to become a flagship school as part of the Jigsaw programme, a mindful approach to personal and social education.This is further supported by the schoolrsquos Values Programme which promotes values such as honesty through books, lessons and visiting speakers.There are also several wellbeing groups which support the childrenrsquos needs.As part of its movement towards the New Curriculum, the school developed a new project this year, CF: Our Local Area and Beyond.This encouraged children to explore their local community and express what they liked about it.As part of the CF project, Year  visited Peter Alan and are currently undertaking drawing work to be displayed in the estate agentrsquos window.Year  were invited to the opening of the play park in the Edenstone Woodlands housing development where each student planted a flower bulb as part of the CF project.The school received pound from Studio Response for their participation.As anyone who visits the school will know, books are highly valued. Mrs Thompson is personally committed to creating a culture of enthusiasm for reading and said that she enjoyed seeing children becoming readers and getting ldquohooked on books.ldquoTo be able to read opens all education to our children, she continued.ldquoResearch is forever reporting that a child who is read to or who reads for pleasure will become a success.The schoolrsquos library holds an extensive collection of literature and each term a portion of the school budget is allocated for the purchase of books.On World Book Day, the owner of Grfin Books, Mel Grfin, will bring a pop-up book shop to Dinas Powys Primary where children can buy a book for pound.The school also participates in eCalm in collaboration with Dinas Powys Library, meaning that every child is a member.The school has its own student council, Pupil Voice, which is active on both sites.The Eco Committee recently introduced an Eco Bear to encourage all pupils to be eco-friendly and this year the school had its Platinum Status renewed by Eco Schools.The school has invested heavily in Lego resources and iPads and has received grant funding from Dow Corning supporting this investment in promoting science, technology, engineering, and mathematics .As part of its commitment to the importance of STEM, the school participates in the National Primary Maths Challenge.Two students from Dinas Powys Primary have reached the Bonus Round in this yearrsquos challenge.The school has achieved the Cymraeg Campus Bronze Award Charter that commends its commitment to the Welsh language and culture.Strong links with outside agencies include CAVMS music tuition and JAFFA Club.Last November, students from Dinas Powys Primary School performed Shakespearersquos The Tempest at The Riverfront Theatre, Newport, as part of the Shakespeare Schools Foundation.They also sang at St Davidrsquos Hall with the Cardf and Vale Christmas Showcase Cluster Choir in December.The schoolrsquos two dance squads will shortly be performing at Barry Memorial Hall for Best Foot Forward on Wednesday, March .For more information on the school, visit dinaspowysps article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief.

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_MM-Photo-1.jpg","title":"manufacturing month ni to showcase strength of sector","story":"Posted on Tuesday  January  by Ulster Business Economy Minister Diane Doods with Manufacturing NIs Stephen Kelly Northern Ireland’s burgeoning manufacturing sector will be showcased as part of a major initiative to highlight the strength and excellence of the industry here. Manufacturing Month NI, led by Manufacturing NI, will run for the entire month of March. It will include a series of events, business breakfasts, seminars, workplace tours, and the flagship annual Anchor High leadership summit will be held across Northern Ireland to highlight local manufacturing success stories, address major challenges as we enter the new decade, and inspire the next generation of manufacturers and engineers.

The revamp is part of the Department of Finance’s Reval – which is a reassessment of the rates system which businesses pay. While still a draft schedule of values, each council will also have to apply its own regional rate, based on the new proposed figures.“The Cathedral Quarter isn’t just about eating and drinking,” Gareth Neill, BID manager, Destination CQ told Ulster Business.“We have a vibrant ecosystem of arts and culture and fantastic built heritage that makes this area stand out, hospitality plays an integral part to the quality of le in this part of Belfast – for a city to be striving to attract new residents, increase our tourism offer these are crucial to the city’s success. “We are concerned about that the potential knock-on effects to the affected business owners and there’s a very real possibility it will have an impact on the price of a pint to the people who come to socialise in Cathedral Quarter. The knock-on effect of outdated methodology for calculation of rates on licensed premiseshas a potentially crippling effect on jobs and character of this area.”A spokesman for Land  Property Services said: “In Northern Ireland, nearly % of pubs will have no change or a decrease in their Net Annual Value .“Any business rate payer who thinks their new valuation may be incorrect, can contact LPS to arrange an informal review and supply any relevant information before the new valuation list comes into force on  April .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mip1.jpg","title":"mipim taking belfast to the world","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster Business Joe ONeill and Suzanne Wylie Belfast Harbour boss Joe O’Neill will help lead a private and public sector delegation to MIPIM – the world’s biggest commercial property event – as chairman of the taskforce. He chats to John Mulgrew about the big announcements, fighting off the competition and attracting a global giant to Northern Ireland For Joe O’Neill and the wider delegation heading to potentially warmer climates, the proposition of selling the city and wider region to major investors has gotten easier.In the five years since Belfast ed to MIPIM – an event which sees tens of thousands descend on Cannes in France for four days of real estate and development – the private and public team, and taskforce, have developed a “strong ” in which to sell the city and Northern Ireland, with hopes of attracting a big name insurance or tech firm on the list.“MIPIM is a great  for the promotion of city-wide initiatives, and demonstrating to investors and to occupiers the growth potential in the city, and the opportunities for them and that the key stakeholders are all aligned behind an appropriate growth agenda,” Joe says.“You see dferent sizes and scales of stands out there – you see some really ambitious stands and proposed developments, so Belfast has to see it’s entry point into that. Belfast first and foremost will be competing against peer group cities within the UK… but then it is a worldwide show, so you will be competing against other cities.”Belfast is leading a major delegation this year, and will also be joined by representatives from other Northern Ireland councils, including those that are part of the Belfast Region City Deal, such as Mid  East Antrim. That deal is also going to be a focus for announcements and development, during the event.This year’s delegation will be led by a host of top private sector developers in Northern Ireland, alongside Belfast City Council and organisations such as Belfast Harbour. That includes Bywater, Wirefox, Titanic Quarter, Tribeca, McAleer  Rushe and Graham Group, along with the two universities and others working within related fields from law, professional services and the supply chain.For Joe and the delegation, MIPIM represents an opportunity to announce some of Belfast and Northern Ireland’s wider major new infrastructure and commercial plans. Previous visits have included the announcement of major offices schemes, hotels and apartment developments.“We will have a series of announcements – some of those announcements will be new, and some will be progress, and demonstrating to investors or occupiers that progress has been madeit’s a multi-year scheme, to show we are delivering.“… we have new projects coming through the pipeline in ious sectors. This year we are looking at launching schemes around digital innovation. That aligns with one of the themes in the Belfast Region City Deal, for the city and councils in the deal. We have a particular focus on cyber-security as an investment and operating location – particular those from the US.”Joe says that would be in addition to the already well-established cyber-security development at Catalyst in the Titanic Quarter, and that new names are coming in to the marketplace creating a “cluster” around the sector, and setting up Belfast and beyond as a new global hub.“We are looking at announcing some details around the Belfast-Dublin-London corridor,” Joe says.“As an economic corridor, or triangle. Post-Brexit, there are clear synergies in developing a proposition where companies can avail of the three locationsthey are looking at a global footprint, and see advantages to locations in three cities.”The issue of increasing connectivity between Belfast and Dublin also remains high on the list – improving the speed and frequency, and making developers aware of the new Belfast Transport Hub, which will transform the city’s rail and bus connectivity when complete.For Belfast Harbour, it’s also bringing the expansion of its already successful film studios to MIPIM, amid further plans to grow and develop the hub to attract big names and become the largest of its kind outside London.“We will be revealing more of our expansion plans, which is being supported by NI Screen,” Joe said. Some of those delivering their own presentations to potential investors will include the Harbour, Belfast City Council, Catalyst and the universities. “We are out looking around, when we are there, at what dferent cities are doing – seeing whether something works well, and looking at our competitive advantage in that area.”As for the strengths and attraction for potential investors, Joe says: “Skills, talent and technology are very much at the fore. Agility as a small region and to be able to respond, and seeing that team Belfast is there and that we are aligned with a particular project. It doesn’t have to be taken back home and introduced to someone .“There is the emergence of Belfast as an attractive city – investment opening up, and people are always looking at new markets. “Part of the initial roll-out when I took on the chair of MIPIM, the role was to go around to ask those who were on board previously to ask about it,it had changed. Everyone noticed and recognised considerablechange over the last four years. “We were pioneering and establishing ourselves four years ago, now they felt we were very much a concerted and effective operating team… the collective was a powerful message, and having  or lunches involving all of the stakeholders at one time. It’s a really strong  to take on the next chapter.”So, for Joe and the rest of the MIPIM delegation, what would be considered a major goal or success on the back of the visit to the commercial property show in March  “A particular focus this year is to attract key institutional investors – the big insurance companies for example. That’s a chicken and egg situation… you need to have product, to have product you have to show that you have occupiers and a steady revenue stream. “What we have been able to say to the investment market is ‘we have product and we now have sustainable occupation coming through… now it feels like the right time for you as an investor, to come in, and to support further investment’.”Asked whether replicating the successes of our neighbours in Dublin in attracting tech giants such as Apple, Facebook and Google is also on the cards, Joe says: “Something like that, or a major investor. For them to do that – a technology or an investment company – they need to see that the public, private and third-tier sectors are all collaborating together to make an effective market, and I think we are good at doing that now.”And the timing couldn’t be better for the delegation – now able to go in with a clear mandate and message with the restoration of the Executive and ato day-to-day power-sharing politics.“The positive thing for us is with the government and secondly, somearound Brexit… it takes those two challenging issues off the table.” πView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/johnm1.jpg","title":"companies must act quickly on new ir legislation reforms","story":"Posted on Monday February  by Ulster Business At the start of this year the government launched a review into the changes to IR legislation which will affect medium and large private sector organisations and have far-reaching impacts on the way they engage with non-permanent workers, writes John Moore, managing director, Hays NI.The timeframe between the review and the reforms coming into effect in April is shorter than many would have liked but with the reforms now on the horizon, companies need to act, particularly those in sectors such as technology, construction and finance where use of contractors operating as personal services companiesis common. At a basic level, the reforms to IR legislation sht the responsibility of determining the tax status of personal services company workers to the company that engages them where previously they could self-certy. The original rules required the freelance contractor to determine their tax status, but HMRC believed non-compliance was common.Now,a person’s assignment falls outside of IR legislation, they are deemed to be self-employed, so gross payment will be made to the PSC. Butthe assignment falls inside of IR, the professional should be treated as an employee, applying PAYE and NIC deductions from their payment. In simple terms, the tax arrangements for contractors are changing so that they won’t get such a good dealthey can’t demonstrate their work is out of scope and employers will have to pay more for using and keeping what were previously non-payroll workers.This will have a big effect on how people choose to work and who they choose to work for, not to mention how organisations plan and budget. An organisation’s policy towards contractors will affect how attractive they are to freelancers. But on the other side we’ve already seen some risk averse companies adopt a blanket ban on freelancers just to be safe – meaning they are missing out on skilled professionals they need to deliver projects.In Northern Ireland, as where, it’s likely the IR reforms will hit technology hardest, but the effects could be wide ranging across roles in construction, project management and finance.We’ve heard anecdotal evidence of IT contractors leaving the big banks and starting to view early stage tech companies with less than  employees more favourably because they fall outside the scope of the legislation. When similar legislation was introduced in the public sector in , hundreds of highly skilled contractors left roles to join organisations who were prepared, often leading to projects being scrapped. Now the private sector is catching up, preparation is key and anyone who hasn’t done a review of what it means for their capacity should do so urgently. A Hays survey showed % of private sector firms expect cost increases when IR reforms come into effect, % expect to lose key talent and % think it will be harder to bring in non-permanent workers. A third of organisations surveyed were completely unaware of the reforms – a big concern given how tight the labour market is.So, first you need to determine whether assignments are inside or outside of IR. You need to have full visibility of all workers your organisation engages who are paid via agencies and consultancies as well as knowledge of how they are paid. You will also need to have the expertise to determine the tax status of each assignment. When you know that you can then start communicating with freelance workers, renegotiating working arrangements, standardising onboarding procedures and decidingany specialist skills need to be brought in house to get projects over the line.If you expect to use a high volume of temporary workers in , outsourcing your temporary worker provision through a managed services programme could be an option, as an expert would carry out accurate assessments for every temporary worker placed with you.Whatever stage you are at, don’t ignore IR. It’s coming and you need to understand it.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20200109_-3489_web.jpg","title":"nie networks keeping the lights on and a focus on the future of power","story":"Posted on Thursday February  by Ulster Business Paul Stapleton, managing director of NIE Networks, sits down with Ulster Business to chat about the future of energy here, huge investment across Northern Ireland and the responsibility of keeping the lights on for almost two million people In the last three decades, Paul Stapleton has already seen signicant sweeping changes across the energy industry, and is now helping lead the charge towards a carbon neutral economy with an ever-increasing focus on green power.He is now at the helm of NIE Networks – an organisation responsible for the electricity network here, delivering reliable power to , businesses, homes and farms right across Northern Ireland.“Our role is to provide a safe and reliable network – keeping the lights on  ,  days a year,” Paul told Ulster Business.And part of that responsibility and ability to ensure strong and reliable electricity flow is an investment of around £m each year, working towards a  ‘net zero’ carbon emissions target and embracing the key changes and evolution in power here.“Many dferent players need to work together to ensure the electricity system of the future can achieve what it needs to achieve in terms of zero carbon and remaining economically efficient, and reliable, at the same time,” he says.“We are the custodians of the electricity network – everything between where power is generated and up to and including the meter in your home or business.“Our network is connected to , customers – that’s every home, every farm, every business, and every organisation in NI. It’s a regulated utility business, and commercially, everything is regulated by the Utility Regulator.”Paul’s been in the energy industry for his entire working le. The Limerick man joined ESB in  where he held a number of senior management positions, before taking up his current role in May .He’s taken over NIE Networks as it’s hitting record performance targets, with those likely to improve further still this year.“The network is in as good as condition as it ever was, and we are giving a good service in terms of continuity of supply. “In , we achieved a ‘customer minutes lost’ average of  minutes, which is the lowest in our history. But we will continue to look at improving further. Where faults do occur, % are fixed within three hours and % within less than  hours. “We operate in business cycles around regulatory price controls. We are now just over two years into a six year price control. “There has been some downsizing, cost-reduction and efficiencies, while we are gearing up to deliver a signicant capital investment programme. We are investing more than £m a year in upgrading, refurbishing and maintaining the network.“The focus in present terms is about delivering for today and looking to enhance our services to customers.”But it’s the future of NIE Networks, power generation, and a new Strategic Energy Framework, which will become the focus for Paul and his team in the coming years.“A lot of my focus is about planning for the future, as well as the day-to-day,” he says. “The longer term horizon is now looking out to ,” he says. “The UK Government has enshrined in legislation the target that the economy will be entirely carbon neutral.”For Northern Ireland, it’s already broken recent records in terms of the move towards green energy. “There is a huge amount to be done and it’s a very challenging target,” he says.“It’s a huge change and transition. But I think all the scientic evidence regarding climate change suggests it has to be done, and maybe has to be done sooner.“The headline target was that we would hit % from renewable sources by . We actually achieved that target and are now at %. That is very signicant progress. It puts us ahead of GB and the Republic of Ireland.”NIE Networks has invested around £m in the network to facilitate this generation. In the last few years the number of power generators connecting to the network has grown to ,, whereas two decades ago it was reliant on the three main power stations here.“The bigger challenge is how do we use that green energy to displace carbon  That brings in transport and heat, and that’s something where the electricity sector will play an important role.“As we all start adopting electric vehicles, as I think we all will in the next decade, we have to make sure people have the ability to charge them, at home and in public spaces. It’s our role to connect the chargers and to make sure we have a network which has the capability to meet the demands.”But Paul says there’s signicant positivity out there, with a younger generation in Northern Ireland and throughout the world embracing the small everyday changes that have to be made in order to tackle an international problem.“We are in the policy framing stage and  is going to be key. There is a call for evidence now from the Department for the Economy to inform the development of a new Energy Strategy for Northern Ireland and I would encourage anyone who has any interest in energy or climate change to contribute into that.“Hopefully that will lead to the development of clear policy initiatives, targets and measures for Northern Ireland and that will set the context for the market to respond.“I think there is economic opportunity for Northern Ireland, but there will be some downsides. We need to minimise the downsides and maximise the opportunities.”NIE Networks is currently examining its role in the future energy market in Northern Ireland. That includes looking at how it can make the distribution network more open and accessible in order to allow burgeoning technologies, such as battery storage, heat pumps and electric vehicles, to be introduced and operate in a sustainable way.“We see our role as evolving. Historically, we were somewhat passive – we provided an infrastructure which shipped electricity from A to B. Now, we need to be much more proactive and we are part of an overall system.”That includes a role in balancing when green energy is available and when it is required and in high demand on the distribution system. “All of that needs a more connected and dynamic distribution system – rather than just being seen as a physical infrastructure,” Paul says.“We need private investment and developers who are willing to invest in new solutions, whether it’s wind, solar, electric vehicle charging or heat delivery. All of those need policy directions, but they also need a network to connect to, so we have a major role to enable all of that.”Paul says most businesses and iniduals now know that they “have to get on this journey” in order to play their part in tackling climate change, reducing their carbon emissions and improving energy efficiency.With Brexit, there have been concerns over the future of the all-island energy market. But Paul is confident that it will be secured, despite the UK’s exit from the EU. “That continuing is really important for businesses in Northern Ireland. Currently, all sides in the Brexit debate seem comfortable that the Single Electricity Marketwill continue, so we don’t see any specic threat around that.”As part of NIE Networks’ Northern Ireland-wide investment in infrastructure – of around £m a year – it has recently completed a £, investment in the Cathedral Quarter area of Belfast – where our interview took place – which is home to many of its best known pubs and restaurants. “That gives us a more resilient and reliable supply, as well as capacity for the future,” Paul says. Some of the other latest investments include projects in Enniskillen in advance of a new public realm scheme, along with another in Newry.“Right across Northern Ireland we are continuing to invest,” Paul says. “There is a lot going on. There’s a lot to do today, challenges, to keep efficient supply for the economy, but equally we need to plan for the future.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
