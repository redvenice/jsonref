Tolkien, Author of Lord Of The Rings, Lived here 1930-1947.\u0027    It was given Grade II-listed status on the basis of Professor Tolkien\u0027s importance despite having no particular architectural qualities. Last year, Oxfordshire estate agents Breckon and Breckon said it was \u0027situated on a generous plot within a leafy central north Oxford suburb\u0027 and described the property as \u0027substantial\u0027.      On Wednesday, Sir Ian and a host of celebrities shared their support for the initiative by releasing a fundraising video to mark the launch of the project. In their appeal they said: \u0027In 1930 a family moved to 20 Northmore road, a big house in the university city of Oxford, England. \u0027The young father entertained his children with his stories about a hobbit called Bilbo Baggins and Bilbo went on a quest to the lonely mountain in the company of a wizard.\u0027The young man was J.R.R. Tolkien and in the 30s he wrote The Hobbit and by 1939 England was once again at war.\u0027The shadow of that war and the earlier one in which Tolkien had himself fought would stretch across the pages of The Lord of the Rings from the shire to the marshes but ultimately good would triumph and peace return both to Middle-earth and the world of 1945.\u0027They added: \u0027Tolkien\u0027s world has been the inspiration for many artists, writers and filmmakers  but so far there has been no specific place dedicated to the appreciation of Tolkien\u0027s life until now.\u0027For the first time in many years the Tolkien house is up for sale. We many never have an opportunity like this in our lifetimes to convert the home and grounds into that little haven of beauty and creativity that Tolkien would have recognised and that included restoring the garden that he loved so much.\u0027Sir Ian later took to Twitter to write: \u0027Unlike other writers of his stature, there is no centre devoted to J.R.R. Tolkien anywhere in the world.\u0027The hobbit hole at the end of the garden maybe? Spaces for quiet and reflection like Rivendell. This is our vision at project Northmoor, a charity set up to purchase the house and then go on to set up the centre.\u0027 While Ms Golding added: \u0027It is with great joy I announce along with and many others the campaign to #SaveTolkiensHome! Watch the video and please donate to create the first world centre for Tolkien in his old home. #SaveTolkiensHome.\u0027Alongside setting up a permanent residence for his literary work, the project aims to include an online presence inside the house in order for writers and artists to take programme without having to leave their homes. Last month it was revealed that a previously unpublished anthology of work by the iconic author would be released next summer.The collection of essays on topics ranging from Elvish reincarnation to which characters had beards will be called The Nature of Middleearth. The British author, who wrote the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings, continued to explore his fantasy setting of Middle-earth until his death in 1973. His estate has authorised the new book, which is to be published by HarperCollins in June, The Times reports.  HarperCollins\u0027 deputy publishing director Chris Smith added: \u0027It offers readers a chance to peer over Professor Tolkien\u0027s shoulder at the very moment of discovery: and on every page, Middle-earth is once again brought to extraordinary life\u0027. The writings will be edited by Nasa computer engineer and Tolkien expert Carl F Hostetter. He previously worked with Tolkien\u0027s son Christopher on editing his father\u0027s writings, until Christopher\u0027s death earlier this year. To donate or for more information: www.projectnorthmoor.org                    "},{"url":null,"title":"New mother 35 barred entering Makro store breaching social distancing rules","story":"Share this article \u0027But when we came out of lockdown again, and we could partially open as a gym, we thought let\u0027s do another deep clean so went to Makro again.\u0027But they stopped me at the door again and said you can\u0027t come in with a baby.

The higher category bans all hospitality business, while the other permits pubs to stay open only if they serve food and household can only mix outside with a substantial meal. More than 50 pubs and breweries including Greene King, Heineken and Budweiser pleaded with the Government to extend support to avoid thousands of local venues going bust.They said in a letter to the Chancellor Rishi Sunak: \u0027It would be nothing less than heart-breaking if, having survived through the last nine months, pubs now face ruin with the end of the pandemic in sight.\u0027The support the Government has given us up to this point would all be for nothing, a colossal waste of resources. The looming disaster is avoidable, but only if you act now.\u0027Over 38,000 pubs, restaurants, bars and hotels in England have been shut in Tier Three, apart from for takeaways, affecting 38,000 workers.A Government spokesperson previously said: \u0027The length of exposure is one of the main factors in the spread of the virus which is why alcohol may only be served as part of a main table meal, and cannot be served once the meal is finished.\u0027There is no prescribed limit for how long a meal is expected to take, however we expect people to act reasonably and exercise good judgement.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Two pubs just yards apart different tiers","story":"Share this articleIt comes as yesterday a row deepened over whether a scotch egg can be classed as a \u0027substantial meal\u0027 under rules only allowing alcohol to be served with food from today.Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove told LBC two scotch eggs would be \u0027a starter\u0027, 24 hours after Environment Secretary George Eustice said one is a substantial meal. Mr Gove reiterated his stance on LBC in a second interview on Good Morning Britain yesterday - before backtracking and then telling ITV News: \u0027A scotch egg is a substantial meal.\u0027The confusion came after the Government said people going into Tier 2 from today will have to have a \u0027substantial meal\u0027 to allow them to buy a pint.The law says a substantial meal is \u0027might be expected to be served as breakfast, the main midday or main evening meal, or as a main course at such a meal\u0027.Some pubs have now brought out new menus, with one offering a \u0027Boris Menu\u0027 of £1.99 meals - while Wetherspoon has launched a new breakfast muffin range. Landlords accused the Government of providing \u0027no clarity\u0027 on the substantial meal rule.One Essex pub has launched a new £1.99 simplified food menu so that customers can enjoy alcoholic drinks, but do not have to spend lots of money or have a large meal.Named \u0027The Boris Menu\u0027, The Kings Head in Gosfield is offering plates such as a hotdog and chips baked beans on toast with cheese and cheeseburger and chips.Pub owner Matthew Arnold, 38, told Essex Live: \u0027Every time a new regulation is implemented it incurs a lot of time and cost for pubs to abide.\u0027It\u0027s the frustration that prompted the menu idea initially at the same time as catering for customers that don\u0027t necessarily want a large and costly meal each time they want to visit us.\u0027Meanwhile the Wetherspoon pub chain has launched a new breakfast menu ahead of tomorrow\u0027s reopening, include a muffin range and reducing the price of coffee and tea to 99p.Customers can choose from four new breakfast muffins – egg and bacon egg and sausage breakfast (with bacon and sausage) and egg and cheese.In Worcester, one pub is teaming up with a fish and chip shop in order to stay open under Tier 2 rules.Mark and Debie Daniels, of The Brewers Arms, which has no kitchen, has partnered with Nick Zipiti of St John\u0027s Fish Bar, according to Worcester News.It means The Brewers Arms can keep pulling pints - which they would be otherwise unable to do without serving a substantial meal alongside.The pub will operate around the chip shop\u0027s usual hours and customers will be asked to order food at the bar before being able to buy a drink.Mr Daniels told the paper: \u0027This partnership has allowed us to open again as we do not have a kitchen on site.

Each container holds trays, each roughly the size of a pizza box, containing 975 doses.When the MHRA issued authorisation for the vaccine to be used, it stipulated that each box could be moved and opened only a limited number of times before the vaccines were used.And it said that until a detailed distribution plan is drawn up, the trays should not be split before the vaccines were ready to be used, making transporting them to care homes all but impossible.It meant the initial doses were likely to have to be given out at one of 50 major hospitals across England and meant earlier plans to make care home residents the first to get the jab had to be put on hold.But health officials have now drawn up a new method to ensure it can get to the most vulnerable, by allowing the packs to be split up. Subject to approval by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), officials expect to be able to start rolling it out to care homes within a few days, and by Christmas at the latest.Explaining the problem of getting the vaccine to care homes, Mr Hopson said: \u0027So what you would need to do is break those 975 pizza boxes into smaller batches, and then the good news is, when we can do that, which we think we\u0027ll be able to do really quite quickly, is we can then ask GPs to go in and administer the vaccine into care home residents.\u0027So what hospitals are doing is they\u0027re working out today, yesterday, the day before, tomorrow, they\u0027re going to be working out exactly how many of those care home staff, care home residents, and over-80s they can administer, they\u0027re going to tell NHS England and Improvement what those figures are, and then the vaccines will be allocated depending upon how many people they can get through.\u0027         "},{"url":null,"title":"Tesco trialling new self service checkouts customers using trollies","story":"Share this article A Tesco spokesperson said today: \u0027We are currently trialling a new self-service checkout option in our Braintree store in Essex, with more space around the checkout for customers to fit trolleys and their bags when they are doing a bigger shop.\u0027Self-service checkouts were introduced at UK Tesco stores in 2003 and are mainly used by customers with a basket of shopping as there is currently limited space around them in most stores."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1fd93b14c55930d1443bb09a51dd04855b5b9d72/0_413_6192_3715/master/6192.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4dab35c873de9ce7bf51edc0a75349f8","title":"kimchi from field to lunch in pictures","story":"Originally a means of preserving vegetables during winter, kimchi is emblematic of Korean cuisine and accompanies almost every meal served in the country.

They argue that they need the government help because of the financial strain placed on their clothing and homewares businesses during the crisis.On Friday, Christian Härtnagel, Lidl’s chief executive, became the latest food industry boss to cave in on the business rates issue, with the privately owned German chain promising to return more than £100m to the UK government.Härtnagel insisted Lidl had not been bounced into the decision but had been considering making an about-face “for some time”.He added: “We are now in a position to confirm that we will be refunding this money as we believe it is the right thing to do.”The business rates relief had been vital in enabling Lidl to make “quick, unplanned investments” in its stores at the height of the crisis, Härtnagel said but now the company felt sure it would be able to “navigate and adapt to any further challenges brought by Covid-19”.The supermarkets and discounters have faced fierce criticism for accepting the rates relief as they were, along with DIY stores, classed as essential retail and allowed to remaining open throughout the pandemic.The tax break was a blunt instrument intended by the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, to prop up retail businesses deemed “non-essential’ and banned from trading during the lockdowns. A gulf has opened up between the food retailers reporting strong figures and the rest of the high street. This week, Debenhams went into liquidation and Topshop and Dorothy Perkins owner Arcadia Group collapsed into administration, putting 25,000 jobs at risk.Pets at Home, which was also deemed as “essential” by the government, is paying its £29m rates bill, too. Peter Pritchard, the group’s chief executive, said the recent positive news about vaccinations for Covid-19 led it to reassess the level of uncertainty the business was faced with.Pritchard said Pets at Home’s finances were in robust shape, with the decision to repay the rates relief demonstrating its “commitment to acting responsibly and treating all of our stakeholders fairly”.With the hospitality industry brought to its knees by coronavirus restrictions, there are plenty of worthy alternative candidates for taxpayer support including struggling pubs and restaurants, analysts say.John Webber, the head of business rates at the property advisory firm Colliers International, said the windfall could be used to extend the rates holiday for non-food retailers by three or six months, which would cost circa £1.4bn or £2.8bn. It was “inconceivable” that high street chains would be able to resume their high business rates commitments in April, Webber said, particularly after missing out on the lucrative November trading period."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/54c85dd8e8dd941b44ca5c5b87219a65f947a5d7/0_8_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3136a79ae88bf39264d832243cf043a1","title":"tell us have you lost your uk retail job as a result of the pandemic","story":"As the Arcadia retail group goes into administration, we want to hear from retail workers who lost their jobs this yearAround 314,000 people lost their jobs in the three months prior to September in the UK, with hospitality, retailing and leisure amongst the hardest hit industries.As the Arcadia retail group, which owns brands including Topshop and Dorothy Perkins, goes into administration and Debenhams looks set to close for good, we’d like to hear from retailer workers who have lost their job as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.You can get in touch by filling in the form below.

Jab? Yes. Two jabs? Yes, please. Down a vodka ice luge fashioned in a tableau of Jonathan Van-Tam and Chris Whitty looking mildly withering at a lectern? Let me just get my best party dress on. (I understand the product needs to be kept cold, so this feels like one method of delivery that The Science should maybe consider.)Of course, it’s important to understand that other people have more complex feelings about what might happen. Take former actor Laurence Fox, London’s most fragile man, who recently addressed health secretary Matt Hancock directly via Twitter. “I’m sure I don’t need to say this,” began Laurence promisingly, before spoiling it all by saying it anyway. “But if you do try and take away the last vestiges of my personal freedom by trying to stick a needle in my arm without consent, bring at least four police officers with you, you are going to need them.”Wow. I know his TV agent dumped him, but that’s a long way to go for a headline reading “Laurence Fox in cop drama”. Also, you’re going to need one police officer, tops, and could probably do it with a community support officer with a bad back. Still, what’s not to be amused by in the way Laurence pictures vaccination rollout, where the actual secretary of state for health arrives at his flatfaux-boho stockade with four police officers and a big syringe? Perhaps our hero wrote the tweet “after lunch” (an increasingly elastic timeframe, by the looks of things).Back in the rational world, and without wishing to go out on a limb here, it is fair to say the vaccine is INCREDIBLY GOOD NEWS. And being the first country to approve the vaccine, and therefore the first custodian of said incredibly good news – well, that allows the UK to be positive, magnanimous, gracious and encouraging to the other countries and blocs just behind us in the quest to end the virus that has caused, and continues to cause, death, economic devastation, and loss of freedom and normality all over the world.Cut to Gavin Williamson’s Thursday morning radio appearance on LBC. “I just reckon,” reckoned the education secretary, “we’ve got the very best people in this country and we’ve obviously got the best medical regulator, much better than the French have, much better than the Belgians have, much better than the Americans have. That doesn’t surprise me at all, because we’re a much better country than every single one of them.” And yet, if that’s the case, explain how our education secretary is Gavin Williamson?In fairness to Gavin, if you actually listen to the clip, it does seem as if he was attempting a joke. And again, in fairness to him, it does seem that he was also attempting some kind of joke back when he made his famous suggestion that Vladimir Putin’s Russia should “go away and shut up”. On these pieces of evidence, then, the results are in. The statement “the secretary of state was attempting a joke” belongs in the same category of outcome as “the secretary of state was attempting to bath a toaster”. Don’t do it, Gav. It ends badly.I keep reading that the government and health authorities want trusted celebrities to advocate taking the vaccine. If so, what was the thinking here? “Right, Attenborough’s not answering the phone – let’s get Gavin Williamson out there as a stopgap.”Despite being the tone-deaf witterings of a serially insecure man, Williamson’s comments got such blanket coverage that it doesn’t seem to be beyond the realms that Anthony Fauci got wind of them. The top US infectious diseases expert certainly seemed to be giving some sort of slapdown when he suggested the UK had “rushed” approval – comments he has since walked back. Perhaps Fauci, too, somehow missed the joke element to Williamson’s posturing. You can hardly blame him – he’s been dealing with Earth’s most insecure man for the past year, and is bound to have a reflexive response to this kind of thing.As for the business of politicising the approval of the vaccine in any way whatsoever in an era of festering anti-vax sentiment … that feels even more wildly unnecessary and counterproductive. In order for the vaccine to be effective, as many people as possible need to feel minded to take it, and anything that plays on isions in our already grimly polarised era is crazily unhelpful. Trying to conscript the vaccine into the culture war is the last refuge of people who should really be denied all forms of refuge.You would have to be a category-five idiot to cross the Brexit and Covid streams, so – inevitably – several government ministers did just that. A special mention for health secretary Matt Hancock, who completely wrongly said the approval had been so swift “because of Brexit”. A shoutout, too, to health minister Nadine Dorries, the imbecile’s imbecile, who claimed it was all “thanks to Brexit”. And a sarcastic handclap for the leader of the House of Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, who informed the house: “Germany, France and other European countries haven’t managed to do the same thing. We have and we’re leaving. Draw your own conclusions … as I’m sure the British public will.”Mmmm. I want to say there’s a fine line between national pride and national boastfulness that’s almost designed to get you a slap … But there isn’t. There’s a very thick, very heavy line between these two ways of acting. It’s both incredible and wearyingly credible that we contrived to end up on the wrong side of it.And so it was that senior public health officials have had to devote airtime this week to correcting ministerial lies, and lies of implication, instead of focusing entirely on their brilliant news. June Raine, head of the UK’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Authority (MHRA), specifically took time to counter the health secretary’s claim that the MHRA had in any way benefited from Brexit. “We have been able to authorise the supply of this vaccine using provisions under European law,” she stressed, “which exist until 1 January.” No 10 was duly obliged to accept this, despite what its winged idiots were saying. I hope someone in the new, touchy-feely Downing Street rang up every offending minster and screamed: “You’re only supposed to dead-cat BAD NEWS, you absolute braindead amateurs!”Given the sheer number of people who now lie dead around the globe from this virus, turning it into some attempt at one-upmanship against other nations – even in bungled jest – feels bizarre and distasteful. I mean, what we’re talking about here is something pretty much everyone is yearning for. Turning round to other countries, particularly poorer ones, and doing the political equivalent of “na-nana-naa-nah!”, is kind of a dick move. Furthermore, tough times lie ahead. A government that lies even about good news is, by nature, very bad news indeed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f6b60a9b7734c9c023f01064ffef3f4d8995d0fe/0_0_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026s=d3552f7841aa5bd90b033471dae057b9","title":"have you experienced racism at a uk university","story":"We would like to hear from black and minority ethnic students and lecturers about their experiencesA new report has concluded that UK universities perpetuate institutional racism.

And thanks to my persistence, they are regular, enthusiastic users of the cat flap. Particularly at night when it’s locked and they bash their paws against it like amateur feline bongoists.But this is where my cat-training prowess plateaued – I couldn’t manage to take things to the next level. I did buy a tedious 700-page book that promised feats such as teaching your moggy to sit. I tried random websites’ impressive-sounding tutorials on high-fiving, vaulting and convincing cats to happily don a harness and be walked like a dog. But, invariably, my cats would stray from the plan and I’d be left scouring 800 words of text for a solution. What did my efforts actually teach them? That there’s no better time to steal snacks than when your confuddled owner is staring at his or her phone or into a book. So I gave up.Until today. Now, I am armed with the teachings of School for Cats – a series of TikTok videos, each one around 20 seconds long, making it easy to refer to while training my two beloved feline companions. There’s Mochi, a three-year-old tabby and highly strung madam. Also Poirot, an elaborately moustachioed and insanely rambunctious five-month-old kitten. They’ll be taught separately, though, because – to put it mildly – they are not the best of friends, and it’s difficult to conjure up an informative educational atmosphere in the middle of a fist fight.Day one of training starts well as a super-keen Poirot turns up wearing an elegant tuxedo (which, admittedly, he always does thanks to his black and white fur pattern). But I quickly learn that some of these skills might well be beyond my cats. I’d thought that “lay down” would be the ideal trick to teach a pair of cats that border on narcoleptic. However, when I try gently pushing Mochi into a lying position, she stares balefully at me – her sad, wide eyes dripping with betrayal. Poirot thinks we’re roughhousing, so uses my hand as a scratching post.Another trick, known as “paw” or “shake”, involves getting your cat to give you a high-five by offering them a treat. However, Poirot just ends up biting my fingers until I drop the treat in pain. I move on to the tutorial “over”, in which a compliant cat jumps over an owner’s foot. Mochi, being the contrary moggy that she is, instead learns how to slide under my leg.However, when I find the right trick, I am genuinely astonished by the results. The 360-degree turn that is “spin” is a hit with both of my cats. Not only do they quickly comprehend that they’re meant to follow a treat around in a circle but, after a couple of sessions, they even start following my empty hand in the hope of being rewarded afterwards. Which is the first time I have ever managed to get my cats to do anything without food-based bribery. I mean, if I’m honest, it’s also one of the few times I’ve managed to make them respond to instructions with anything other than a sarcastic narrowing of the eyes. So it’s a double win.What’s more, the training for a trick called “sit pretty” genuinely becomes one of Poirot’s favourite things in the world. Apparently, standing up on his hind legs to reach for a treat is the absolute pinnacle of exciting playtime for a kitten. Hours after one training session, my wife inadvertently points at Poirot during conversation, causing him to leap four feet into the air on to her finger. So successful it is, I’m tempted to rename the trick “fly, my pretty”, or “rocket launch”, or “TAKE COVER! INCOMING CAT!”I’m chuffed. Initially, because the training exercises are a lot of fun. They’re simple to follow, easy to refer to during training and perfect for a creature that has a five-second attention . Plus, they suit the cats.But, eventually, I come to appreciate them for something I hadn’t anticipated. They’ve had lovely consequences for my relationship with my pets. It was fairly predictable that Poirot would take to it, given that he’s an excitable, pliable kitten. But Mochi’s response has been a revelation. She has spent the past two hours sitting next to me on the sofa, just watching me operate a Word document. She’s even begun hopping on to my lap for a snooze – something unheard of since the honeymoon period of her moving in with us. If I’d known that teaching her to spin in circles would make her this content, I’d have done it months ago.Frankly, there’s only one small disappointment in this whole process. No matter how much I scroll, there is one thing I can’t find. Seemingly, School for Cats has no lessons on how to stop your pets playing your cat flap like a bongo."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/74bc9cfd344ef14f902f863df2c81f4fcabb7856/1425_908_2315_1389/master/2315.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4448c44920eda0df46b69b9db1f6210c","title":"pause and breathe how i learned to meditate with tiktok","story":"Are you finding it hard to switch off and relax? Short and snappy mindfulness videos were just the thing to help me refocusThings I’m good at: multitasking, overcommitting, starting things and not finishing them. Watching Netflix while listening to a podcast while cooking dinner while messaging a friend, while skim-reading an important article.Things I’m not good at: silence, boredom, focusing on the present, being alone with my thoughts. And so, by extension, meditation.I’ve tried to meditate several times over the years, encouraged by stories from friends and experts about how beneficial it is for our mental health, motivation, confidence and clarity. So far, I’ve never managed to make it more than several minutes into a session without: a) falling asleep b) remembering something very urgent that needs to be done right now or c) allowing my thoughts to wander in such catastrophic directions that it leaves me more stressed than when I started. But if I’m ever going to change that, 2020 seems a good time to try.This year, like so many people, I’ve felt my anxiety skyrocket while my productivity and creativity have plummeted. My silence-aversion and phone addiction have reached new lows (I’m talking watching TV on the toilet), and it often feels as if the only way to coax myself through another working day is offering my brain episodes of Gilmore Girls like dog treats to a wayward puppy.So can I finally learn to be mindful? And could I do so by using the zeitgeist social media platform TikTok? The irony of using social media as a tool to refocus my attention isn’t lost on me. But the truth is that beyond the dance challenges and celebrity lip-syncs, TikTok is fast becoming a hub for short and snappy instructional videos about a variety of subjects and skills.Videos tagged #meditation clock up a cool 643m views. And after the number of adult users multiplied more than six times between October 2017 and March 2019, it is little wonder that lockdown saw an influx of professionals and experts using the platform as a teaching tool.But where to begin? While I’m open to a certain amount of omm and woo (a walk that consists of crossing one foot over the other while hopping), it’s fair to say my tolerance for wind chimes is low. One of the first videos I land on is “meditation tips for witches”, which worries me. If witches are struggling, what hope do us muggles have?Still, TikTok’s pick and mix buffet of content suits my natural impatience. There are as many different ways to meditate as there are users to teach me – I just have to find the one that resonates. So I learn about third eye activation. I experience my first sound bath. I watch absurdly beautiful yogis demonstrating their perfect lotus pose and feel burdened by an extra thought: “How can I get my skin to look like that?” I hope the answer is “by aligning my chakras” and not a serum that costs £300.Then I land on Headspace, and things begin to click into place. An extension of the wildly popular mindfulness app, Headspace’s TikTok is filled with videos delivered in the brand’s signature fluff-free style. Here, instead of a woman walking dreamily through a cornfield or a dandelion clock blowing in the breeze, I can breathe in time to soothing images of fresh linguine falling languidly from a pasta maker. My kind of therapy.Having picked up some beginners’ tips, naturally my first impulse is to multitask. Can I meditate in the shower? While running? At Sainsbury’s? But deep down I know that looking for shortcuts only leads me into a mental cul-de-sac. So I commit to 15 minutes of pure meditation every morning. I sit in an armchair I never normally sit in, and feel slightly more enlightened just by seeing the room from a different angle. Deciding it’s probably best not to start off too ambitious, I begin with the easiest possible exercise: breathing.One myth every instructor I watch seems determined to debunk is the idea that meditation means emptying one’s mind in fact, the goal is to let thoughts pass through without panic or judgment. During my second session, I can’t stop thinking about what I’m going to eat for lunch. But as @lovecolbyjanine reassures me, “distractions can be messages”.Next I discover the Miami-based spiritual coach Estefanía, who posts as @alignwithmee. From her Meditation Hack Tuesdays, I’m thrilled to learn about whistle breathing. Whistling is something I am good at. I’ve often lamented the lack of opportunities for talented whistlers to monetise our skills or harness them for good now I can whistle my way to a higher plane! My downstairs neighbours are thrilled.The next morning I move on to fire meditation, as guided by “spiritual seeker” and author @vishuddhadass. Staring at a candle flame for 15 minutes feels more comfortable than keeping my eyes closed, and with the flickering light to focus on I find that it’s easier to gently bring my mind back each time it wanders. For the first time, I’m disappointed when my meditation ends. For all digital tools, there’s a fine line between companion and crutch. I’ve saved more than 20 videos for future reference, but @whitneycatalano advises that when we find ourselves scrolling the internet in a desperate hunt for more information, that’s when we should turn to meditation instead. “You’re craving connection,” she says. “And information is not the same thing as connection.” Like all good teachers, TikTok can only take me so far before I need to put my phone down and go it alone.After a week of morning sessions, I may not have unlocked bountiful secret reserves of creative energy, but I do notice I’m sitting down to work with less weary apprehension than before. I’ve stopped taking my phone to the loo. And I’ve realised something: successful meditation isn’t like conjuring up the image in a Magic Eye picture. It’s not a knack you grasp, or a hypnotic trance you slip into – at least, not at my amateur level.Rather, it’s a practice, in every sense of the word. The most important thing is being prepared to pause, breathe, and see what happens. Sit with my feelings, as the kids say.It turns out, I wasn’t “failing” to meditate all those times before. I was just giving up before it got good."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/208c4c7316bbcefac43001292d41c149503dee45/1435_723_2316_1390/master/2316.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0da95454495fe8554b679e6415dd0d7a","title":"fast and fun learning how tiktok became my fount of scientific knowledge","story":"Are you fascinated by the universe but find in-depth online tutorials on existence a bit long-winded? For one writer, short and snappy videos opened his eyes to a different worldThe worst thing about living in a 3D spacetime continuum is how boring the explanations are for it. Having taken almost a year to finish Stephen Hawking’s A Brief History of Time: From the Big Bang to Black Holes – an experience that felt longer than the creation of the universe – I’ve always been on the lookout for scientists and cosmic experts who can give me an insight into what this thing we call “reality” actually is.I hoped the internet would allow knowledge to travel at warp-speed, enabling my brain to consume information as easily as black holes do galaxies, but found myself confronting the snore-inducing perorations of science geeks who managed to extend their insights on string theory into infinity. Most video platforms allow their experts too much time to show off their intelligence, but that approach quickly drains my enthusiasm. Luckily if, like me, you like your science fast and fun, the video-sharing network TikTok can be an unexpected starburst of scientific know-how.Using simple hashtags to search for the most useful user-generated videos, my learning began. “Everything is connected!” enthused @kerwinrae over stellar visuals, stating that quantum theory dictates that everything breaks down into “nothing but strings” that are laid down like a web over the entire universe. “Pluck a string on Mars,” he says, “and it’s going to vibrate on earth.” In less than a minute, I realised that God is simply a great guitarist, like an ethereal Jimi Hendrix ecstatically playing everything into being.Over a slow Richard Rodgers jazz song, @physicsdude gave me a quick but very comforting chalkboard introduction to the four basic principles of physical reality – these four being the only reactions that cannot be broken down into simpler reactions. Now I know electromagnetism is the reason everything has a solid structure, while the strong force keeps those crazy quarks in order in the nucleus of an atom the weak force, however, is responsible for all nuclear decay. Gravity, I came to understand, is simply “the curvature of spacetime” – but it could be a particle, though that hasn’t been observed yet.The best thing about TikTok is how it captures the “gee-whizz!” enthusiasm that should accompany the understanding of the universe. Given that it’s the greatest creation of all time, you’d think people would discuss it with more excitement than the wearied waffling that is the usual online lecture. Giving users of Tiktok only 60 seconds to get their messages across really helps the material to be easily digested.Another TikTok user, @weirdpioneer – who describes herself as a wife, mother and psychologist – conveys her awestruck fascination with the universe with a special-effects video of the epigeneticist Bruce H Lipton jiving on the structure of existence. Matter, he enthuses, “is just an illusion of energy and light … there is nothing physical”. Physicists, he argues, have broken down the atom to find that, at its fundamental core, “there is nothing material at all – it’s an energy vortex”. The existential implications of this were mind-blowing. “According to quantum physics,” Lipton says, we’re not physical but merely “energy vortices” – just a flicker of the cosmic light-switch, basically.I was saved from the depression that might have accompanied this recognition of my irrelevance by science communicator Athena Brensberger. She makes sure she is easily comprehensible with short, joyous flashes of insight, such as into the “super position” taken by quarks – those particles that make up the particles that make up atoms.While anything bigger than a quark has to have a fixed location in time and space, quarks can occupy two places at once – until, that is, you observe them, when, like naughty children on being discovered, they stop dead in one place. The fundamental cheekiness of reality – hedging its bets until forced to decide what it is by a grownup – is a bit like my romantic history, and made me relate to the universe a lot more. My commitment issues, I can explain to my next girlfriend, are just the underlying fickle nature of the cosmos playing out through human experience.The universe is a big and complex place, and I’m just a small speck in one tiny corner of it. I could spend my whole life studying, but would only grasp the merest fragment of it.In many ways, TikTok is the ideal platform for a layperson to tackle the big questions of existence, keeping me interested while never pretending to arrive at an answer. I might never entirely understand existence but I can always take joy in it, and TikTok seems to be the ideal platform for that."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/333b2a5933d17e193b981d515f6fdf4af2b9b2ec/0_327_5549_3329/master/5549.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0bcd3c1cc87e07e7e7e86d46f91a74fe","title":"cinemas hope cash festive films reopen england","story":"Up to 150 expected to begin screening films before Christmas after Covid-enforced closuresThe first of more than 150 cinemas will reopen in England this weekend in a final attempt to cash in on festive moviegoing cheer, but plans by Warner Bros to stream new films including Dune and the next Matrix sequel at the same time as theatre premieres next year threatens to undermine a post-Covid box office revival.Hollywood studios have seized on theatre closures during the pandemic to experiment with digital releases, infuriating theatre owners who rely on the once sacrosanct model of big screen exclusivity for months on end to make their finances work. Warner Bros’ move is unprecedented. All 17 of the films it will release next year, from The Suicide\u0026nbspSquad and Godzilla vs Kong to Tom \u0026amp Jerry, will stream on its HBO Max service for the first month when they also premiere in cinemas.The company has described the decision as a one-year plan, limited to the US, to maximise profits as the Covid pandemic is expected to cut cinema attendance significantly for the foreseeable future.Nevertheless, other Hollywood studios will almost certainly look to adopt similar plans, which if successful would mark the moment the global streaming phenomenon broke the traditional cinema model.Adam Aron, the chief executive of AMC, the world’s largest cinema firm and the owner of Odeon in the UK, said he would “aggressively pursue economic terms that preserve our business”, as the value of AMC shares tumbled following the Warner Bros announcement.“Warner Bros says it is a one-year plan, that it isn’t out to kill theatres, so I wouldn’t say it is the death of the movie theatre but it isn’t helpful,” said David Hancock, the cinema research director at intelligence firm Omdia.“There are enough films to keep people in cinemas, the movie experience is strong enough and powerful enough, but if the plan went beyond a year it would change the economics for theatre owners.”If simultaneous streaming with big screen premieres did become the norm, cinema owners would probably have to look at closing sites in less viable locations and rein in expansion. “They would have to adjust to demand,” said Hancock.The pandemic has already pushed cinema companies’ finances to the limit. UK admissions are set this year to hit the lowest level since records began, in turn fuelling the worst UK box office in three decades.British cinema owners are desperate to reopen, with Vue and Odeon planning to open about 100 of their almost 200 UK sites combined over the coming weeks. Others including Everyman, Showcase and independent operators will take the number of festive reopenings to more than 150. However, Cineworld, the UK’s largest operator, has kept all its 127 sites closed since October, when the premiere of the next James Bond thriller, No Time to Die, was moved to next April.With almost no major new films to entice moviegoers and lockdown restrictions keeping cinemas shut across large parts of the UK – including Wales, parts of Scotland, Northern Ireland and large movie markets in England including Manchester, Birmingham and Bristol – the economics of reopening are marginal at best.“We have done the analysis and from a purely economic perspective it is marginally in favour of opening,” said Tim Richards, the founder and chief executive of Vue, the UK’s third biggest chain. “But there are other variables. We want to reopen for customers, for our studio partners and our staff who are tired of being on furlough. All of those together pointed to trying to open where we could.”There is, of course, a superhero-sized reason for opening in the form of the premiere of Wonder Woman 1984 on 16 December, the only bona fide blockbuster not to be moved due to the pandemic.As well as shattering preconceived notions about a female-led and directed superhero film, the first movie grossed $820m globally and £25m in the UK. “The reopening is really about Wonder Woman,” said Hancock.\u0026nbspAside from a few notable exceptions such as A Christmas Carol, starring Martin Freeman, it is mostly Christmas classics such as Home Alone and Die Hard on offer. Odeon says pre-sales indicate that Will Ferrell’s perennially popular 2003 festive comedy Elf may top the UK box office in reopening week.Richards remains bullish about the future of traditional cinemagoing, identifying the Bond premiere next spring as the start of a return to normality.“Five years from now we will look back at 4 April when James Bond: No Time to Die opens as a watershed moment,” he said. “That is when the big movies start to return. We will keep going as the vaccine comes out and are hoping not to face closure again now. Cinema is going to return to normal.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26597f054b3621f6437541ede8045b8b200f9f7e/0_250_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=03bc618875a78f163bf3c4e6d6e3d935","title":"jean michel aulas lyon inequalities football","story":"The Lyon president on learning about respect and equality from his parents, making the women’s team the best in the world and the futureIn August the Lyon owner-president, Jean-Michel Aulas, felt he was close to realising an incredibly ambitious dream. For the second time during his 33 years in charge he had the men’s and women’s teams competing in the latter stages of the Champions Leagues. Could a historic double be achieved?In 2010 the men failed to reach the final, while the women were runners-up after losing to Turbine Potsdam on penalties. A decade later, in a “quite exceptional” year, both Lyon teams were readying to play Bayern Munich, the men in a semi-final and the women in a quarter-final three days later.But where the women triumphed the men were emphatically defeated. The men had a period of ruthless domestic success in the 2000s after Aulas had bought the debt-ridden club in 1987 and began the process of lifting them out of the second ision, but the Champions League has eluded them. For the women though, this was business as usual, a fifth consecutive European title and seventh win overall.At the heart of a decade of dominance sits Aulas, who, in 2004, oversaw the acquisition of struggling women’s side FC Lyon and embarked on another “great adventure” that would lead the team to become the envy of clubs around the world.“He’s basically the gamechanger,” says the Lyon forward and Champions League record scorer Ada Hegerberg. “’I’m not talking about him being the gamechanger just for Lyon but for women’s football in general.”Aulas has invested in women’s football to an extent that few, if any, have before and it was not easy. “Within men’s football there was a huge resistance, inside clubs, inside the federation and in society in a general sense,” Aulas says. “I thought I had to take responsibility and proceed with those changes.”Change was motivated by seeing first hand the level of inequality that existed. He cites two examples. First, around 2006, a player made him aware of the fact the men’s teams had complete freedom in choosing their kits, while the women’s had theirs imposed on them.He collared the president of the France Football Federation and said that this “had to change immediately and that it didn’t correspond at all to the vision that should exist about the treatment of women, both in sports clubs but in companies in general”.Then, in 2011, he stood in the changing rooms at half-time of Lyon’s Champions League semi-final second leg against Arsenal wringing out rainsoaked kits which would “again bring to light the unacceptable differences in the treatment that existed”.These values feel somewhat unique to find in a man of his generation and influence, but they are deep rooted. There are essentially two factors that built the 71-year-old entrepreneur’s ideological commitment to equality and the holistic values that have driven him in business and football.“My father was a French teacher and my mother a maths teacher, and the culture they raised me in was one of respect for rules and values,” he says of the first. The second was a strong desire to remain independent and he actually filed for emancipation from his parents so that he could run his own business as a minor.The purchase of FC Lyon in 2004 and then the ongoing financial commitment was prompted by conversations with Uefa, Fifa and with the former chairman of Montpellier, Louis Nicollin, who died in 2017 and had pioneered the women’s team at the club, all of which gave Aulas an “understanding of the inequalities that existed in football” and “my personal ability to do something about it”.Aulas, who founded Cegid, a company that specialises in the development of management and accounting software, has not just handed over cash and guidance though, he has built relationships with the players past and present in the same way he does on the men’s side of the game.Ask Lucy Bronze, who played for Lyon between 2017 and 2020, or Megan Rapinoe, who embraced the Lyon president on the pitch after the US women’s national team had won the World Cup in 2019, about his influence and they will gush in the same way Hegerberg does. That care is not just affection for the team, though that is there, but it is also strategic. “It is a personal investment I have in both the players from the academy but also with all the international players,” he says. “It is very important for me not because it’s absolutely necessary, but because it is something that can be very personally enriching, for both sides. It is something I do in all my companies because it is win-win.“It’s very important, especially for high-level players, that if you are going to expect a lot from them then you should also give a lot. And in that sense it can help grow the game because the investment that you give pays off on the field and women’s football is promoted through their accomplishments.“We should separate the return on investment from an economic point of view and then the return on investment from the point of view of the image and the values,” he adds. “It is true from a strictly financial point of view, the balance is not there yet in terms of the women’s game but the evolution is generally going in the right direction.”The long view is key. Where other European clubs, such as Chelsea, Manchester City and Barcelona, are all increasing their investments as they try to catch Lyon, it is having played the long game and having built a culture at the club that sees the women’s team firmly embedded that is keeping the French giants ahead. “We don’t just want to fight for titles but also to make women’s football an absolutely essential and super positive part of the success of the whole club,” explains Aulas.Hegerberg says: “We shouldn’t forget that maybe eight years ago, the team didn’t even have a changing room. We have come to a point where we’re at the same training ground as the men which is in my eyes very essential. That should be modern football today. And there’s still things to improve at Lyon as well. And that’s why it’s so important that we still keep on pushing.”Another area where Lyon has set the benchmark is through player salaries. The club reportedly pays the best wages in the world with top salaries believed to be between €300,000 and €400,000 a year. However, those figures are still far below the salaries of male footballers, so how do they set the level?“It’s an excellent question,” says Aulas thoughtfully. “Women’s football exists in the economic society that we live in. We operate as a private company, of which I’m the main shareholder, and which is also on stock exchange. So we need a balance sheet and to justify everything we do.Aulas is a playmaker. He is on the board of the European Club Association and chairs the women’s football committee. Now he is expanding the Lyon brand into the US with the takeover of Reign FC, now called OL Reign. “It is a strategy that aims to make the most from the influence of US women’s football and hopefully it will help the group be able to act even more effectively as a lever to influence things, such as pushing for the introduction of a women’s Club World Cup,” he says.Never stand still is the motto and it is the constantly evolving drive and the depth of the equality culture that exists at Lyon that means the task of dislodging Lyon from the top of the women’s game is probably a far greater one than many clubs will have reckoned with."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0881aefebd7cfacac30ccc76d0b2a9887451350f/0_448_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=2b92f1821ad2ef07f0a182c0826b3cfb","title":"how to have a covid safe christmas","story":"Families across the UK are being allowed to gather over Christmas, even as tens of thousands of new coronavirus cases are recorded each day.

This live blog is now closed – please follow the global live blog for updatesThat’s all from the UK blog today, you can keep following our coronavirus coverage over on our global blog.Thanks for reading along. Here’s a quick recap of the latest developments across the UK today:The numbers of new daily coronavirus cases and deaths in the UK have increased again – there have been a further 504 deaths within 28 days of a positive test and 16,298 confirmed cases.It brings the total number of cases in the UK to 1,690,432.The numbers are up from Thursday, when the UK reported 414 new deaths and another 14,879 cases.Separate figures published by the UK’s statistics agencies for deaths where Covid-19 has been mentioned on the death certificate, together with additional data on deaths that have occurred in recent days, show there have now been 76,000 deaths involving Covid-19 in the UK.As England navigates the Covid-19 tier system, spare a thought for one Yorkshire couple for whom it is anything but straightforward.Sheila Herbert and her husband, Philip, from the picturesque market town of Otley, live in a house in tier 2, while their garden is tier 3.“It’s all one big conundrum,” said Sheila, 74, explaining that their quiet cul-de-sac home of 18 years was built over a culvert, which runs directly under their garden, with the underground channel of water acting as the official boundary between West Yorkshire and North Yorkshire.“Our house is in Harrogate and our garden is in Leeds. The culvert cuts right through my garden. In fact, it goes right underneath the corner of the conservatory,” she told the local paper.Under government restrictions it means that though, under tier 2, the couple should be able to meet people in their garden, under tier 3 they are prohibited.The future of a museum that tells the astonishing story of the British “father of immunology” is hanging in the balance because it has been forced to close throughout the Covid crisis and faces uncertainty over how it will operate in the post-pandemic world.Edward Jenner’s former family home in Gloucestershire has been shut since February, and the decision has been taken to keep it closed until spring, meaning it will lose more than a year’s vital admission fees.Supporters of Dr Jenner’s House, which bills itself as the birthplace of vaccination, have pointed out the irony of it facing financial crisis in the year when its subject matter is so pertinent.Owen Gower, the museum’s manager, said Jenner’s work had taken on a new relevance in 2020. “But unfortunately we’ve had to close our doors for it,” he said.Two members of the Royal Statistical Society’s working group looking at the accuracy of Covid tests have questioned the results and the way they have been evaluated.Prof Jon Deeks from Birmingham University and Prof Sheila Bird, formerly of the MRC Biostatistics Unit at Cambridge University, say the tests perform poorly where people have low levels of the virus, which is often the case in people without symptoms.They say the discrepancy in the figures is because the evaluation used “spiked” samples – saliva to which the virus has been added in the lab. Those manufactured samples were picked up efficiently by the test, but “real world” samples from people with asymptomatic Covid were not.People in Wales should not travel to England to do their Christmas shopping or for a drink in a pub, first minister Mark Drakeford has said.The Welsh Labour leader’s plea comes as tougher restrictions on the hospitality sector came in across Wales, with pubs, bars and restaurants unable to sell alcohol and forced to close at 6pm.But a relaxing of travel restrictions in Wales means people will be able to go between the country and areas of England under Tier 1 and Tier 2.Drakeford urged the Welsh public not to use the new freedoms to travel across the border for Christmas shopping deals or in search of a drink in areas where pubs and restaurants can sell alcohol.Asked whether people can go Christmas shopping in border areas such as Hereford or Oswestry, which are in Tier 2, Drakeford said: The law in Wales will not prevent people from going there.The advice from the Welsh Government is not to do it, because the further you travel and the more people you mix with elsewhere, the greater the risk you pose.This is a year to go Christmas shopping in Wales, and close to home. Because in that way you can both celebrate Christmas, and you can do it without posing a risk to yourself and others.Asked what is stopping people in Wales flocking into English cities and towns where they would be allowed to drink alcohol, Drakeford said: “The law would not require people in Wales not to travel to a Level 2 or Tier 2 area outside Wales.“The clear and unambiguous advice to people is not to do it. Because to do it is to add to the risks that we are already facing, and those risks are already driving coronavirus rates rapidly upwards.“So please, don’t do it. It’s not good for you, it’s not good for anybody you know, it’s not good for the rest of the population of Wales.”Drakeford added there is “a very big difference” between a person travelling a long distance to a pub or bar in England and going to one on a person’s doorstep near the border.Andy Street, the mayor of the West Midlands region, said he had discussed vaccine distribution with Dr David Rosser, the chief executive of England’s biggest acute trust, University Hospitals Birmingham.The decision about which locations will be used has not been made public.The distribution to all regions of the UK will be at the same time.It’s been said by some leaders across the country today it will be on Tuesday, but I do not believe that has been formally confirmed.The first of more than 150 cinemas will reopen in England this weekend in a final attempt to cash in on festive film-going cheer, but plans by Warner Bros to stream new films, including Dune and the next Matrix sequel, at the same time as theatre premieres next year threatens to undermine a post-Covid box office revival.Hollywood studios have seized on theatre closures during the pandemic to experiment with digital releases, infuriating theatre owners who rely on the once sacrosanct model of big screen exclusivity for months to make their finances work.Warner Bros’ move is unprecedented. All 17 of the films it will release next year, from The Suicide Squad and Godzilla vs Kong to Tom \u0026amp Jerry, will stream on its HBO Max service for the first month when they also premiere in cinemas.The company has described the decision as a one-year plan, limited to the US, to maximise profits as the Covid pandemic is expected to cut cinema attendance significantly for the foreseeable future.Other Hollywood studios will almost certainly look to adopt similar plans, which, if successful, would mark the moment the global streaming phenomenon broke the traditional cinema model.Stocks of coronavirus vaccine have arrived in Northern Ireland, PA Media reports.The initial batch of the PfizerBioNTech vaccine were transported overnight from England and taken to a central storage facility, the location of which is not being disclosed.The delivery means Northern Ireland remains on track to start administering the vaccine to healthcare workers next week.There have been a further 1,471 cases of coronavirus in Wales, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 85,432. Public Health Wales reported another 33 deaths, taking the total in Wales since the start of the pandemic to 2,671.Across the world, offices would normally be gearing up for their annual Christmas party. But like many things this year, plans have had to change in these extraordinary times. Hilary Osborne and Kalyeena Makortoff report on what UK firms are doing to keep the holiday spirit alive:The dancefloor may be swapped for the kitchen, and the buffet for a box of breadsticks and some mini bottles of booze, but the office Christmas party is set to go ahead this year – and there may even be some star guests.With the latest restrictions and working-from-home making the traditional Christmas staff get-together a no-no, companies are turning to virtual celebrations for this year’s festive season.One tech firm is sending out virtual-reality headsets to staff, so they can “see” each other while they celebrate. Elsewhere, online games and karaoke are on the cards, along with classes in crafts and cooking – with some firms sending ingredients round in a box and bringing in household names to host.Lloyds Banking Group is redeploying 700 staff into full-time homeworking roles from 2021, in the latest sign that big banks are embracing remote working even as vaccine candidates begin to put the end of Covid restrictions in sight.The UK’s largest domestic lender – which has 50,000 of its 65,000 employees working from home because of the pandemic – temporarily shifted about 1,000 workers from Halifax, Lloyds and Bank of Scotland branches to customer service teams in order to cope with a surge in demand in areas such as telephone banking and video chats during the outbreak. understands about 700 staff will be permanently moved, making it the largest tranche of Lloyds workers to ever be shifted into homeworking roles full-time.Government ministers should stop politicising the Covid-19 vaccine by boasting about being the first to license it, the head of a leading research group has said.Heidi Larson, the director of the London-based Vaccine Confidence Project (VCP), said the government should instead focus on building support for the jab or it will lose the confidence and trust of the British people.“I don’t think it is in the interest of the government to be racing along without building the ground,” Larson said. “Unfortunately it feels like announcements are made more politically.“The message – ‘We are the first ones in the world to get there’ – may be a message to other countries but that does not matter if you don’t have your public behind you.”Larson, an anthropologist, said she did not think the British public were overtly against taking a Covid vaccine but, having announced the licensing of one, ministers needed to explain “what it will look like between now and April”.There will need to be a “sustained fall” in coronavirus cases across Wales before restrictions on hospitality are eased, the first minister, Mark Drakeford, has said.He told a press conference the number of infections would need to “come more into line” with levels used to determine tier 2 in England and level 2 in Scotland.If that were to be the case then the flow of people into our hospital system – and the pressures that are currently being created there – would be being mitigated.Those are the sorts of things that we would need to see before we will be in a position to do anything to lessen the restrictions that we have to have in place in Wales in order to bring the virus under control, to see the number of people who are dying from it decline, and to allow our health service the room it needs to deal not just with coronavirus but with all the other things that we rely on it to respond to in our lives."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c12e9316e8a0367da274fcacd80d5526e98217b/0_301_6139_3684/master/6139.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=775f97fce81cac3ea1866a6059690669","title":"tom jenkins favourite moments from the past decade buy a guardian photograph","story":"From drama at the Grand National to London 2012, via England winning the Cricket World Cup, the  and Observer sport photographer has picked his favourite images from thousands he has shot during the past 10 years.  is offering readers the chance to buy exclusive prints of Tom’s favourite photographs.

Under cover of darkness, they hike up to the structure and tear it down while chanting “Christ is king!”. They then erect a homemade wooden cross in its place and drag the remains of the monolith down the mountain to their car.During the video, the men also make offensive comments and drink substantial quantities of energy drinks, while also referencing Donald Trump and the QAnon conspiracy theory and their mission is to demonstrate “how much we love Jesus Christ”.“We are upset that these young men felt the need to drive five hours to come into our community and vandalize the monolith,” Atascadero’s mayor, Heather Moreno, said in a news release. “The monolith was something unique and fun in an otherwise stressful time.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/936eb15416a692d2f2f32c7ac6692c706bd5c070/0_120_3600_2161/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4434e02cb32166234786d5affe2072a7","title":"fauci accepts biden offer chief medical adviser","story":"Anthony Fauci, the US’s top infectious disease expert in the country’s response to the coronavirus, told NBC News on Friday that he “absolutely” accepted Joe Biden’s offer to join his administration and serve as chief medical adviser.“I said yes right on the spot,” Fauci told the Today Show’s Savannah Guthrie.On Thursday, in an interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper, the president-elect confirmed that he had asked Fauci to continue his role on Donald Trump’s coronavirus taskforce when he takes office 20 January.“I asked him to stay on in the exact same role as he’s had for the past several presidents, and I asked him to be a chief medical adviser for me as well and be part of the Covid-19 team,” said Biden.Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has had a difficult relationship with President Trump, who had threatened to fire him after November’s elections.After public statements disagreeing with or contradicting the president on wearing masks, social distancing and public gatherings, he became the target of Trump’s attacks.Throughout his campaign, however, Biden showed support for Fauci, imploring Americans to follow the guidance of a trusted expert over the president’s often-debunked conspiracy theories.Biden said he spoke with Fauci about staying on by stressing the need to build American confidence and trust in any coronavirus vaccine. He also argued the country doesn’t “have to close down the economy” in order to stop the spread.The news comes as coronavirus cases across the country surge during the holiday season. Fauci and other public health experts have cautioned Americans to avoid travel and large gatherings altogether.In a tweet, the incoming White House chief of staff, Ron Klain, praised Fauci for a lifetime of service and work during the pandemic.Fauci had confirmed to CBS News that his Thursday meeting with Biden’s transition team was “the first day where there will be substantive discussions about the transition”.Fauci has warned the US could suffer a “terrible” January as the country set three grim coronavirus records on Thursday, recording the highest daily number of coronavirus deaths, the highest number of new cases, and as the number of people admitted to hospital with Covid exceeded 100,000 for the second day in a row."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5cf8e7dc5fb0110f1dc07885530f6c13dcd490d1/0_178_5120_3071/master/5120.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=af7ba2a2eb9f3c00c189199ab79861ef","title":"experts question claimed accuracy of covid 19 saliva tests","story":"Two members of the Royal Statistical Society say UK government’s figures rely on spiked lab tests and not real world testsTwo members of the Royal Statistical Society’s working group looking at the accuracy of Covid tests have questioned the results and the way they have been evaluated.Prof Jon Deeks from Birmingham University and Prof Sheila Bird, formerly of the MRC Biostatistics Unit at Cambridge University, say the tests perform poorly where people have low levels of the virus, which is often the case in people without symptoms.They say the discrepancy in the figures is because the evaluation used “spiked” samples – saliva to which the virus has been added in the lab. Those manufactured samples were picked up efficiently by the test, but “real world” samples from people with asymptomatic Covid were not.The government’s Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) says its priority is to prevent Covid-related deaths and protect health and social care staff and systems.Elderly care home residents and their carers are first on the JCVI’s list because their risk of exposure to the virus is higher and because the risk of death closely correlates with older age. They are followed in priority by anyone else over 80 and frontline health and social care workers.Even so, for pragmatic reasons NHS staff are likely to be the first group to receive the PfizerBioNTech jab. This is because the vaccine needs to be stored at ultra-cold temperatures, which can be achieved more easily by using hospital facilitiesTogether, care home residents, their carers and the over-80s make up nearly 6 million people, and frontline NHS staff a further 736,685. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, has said he expects 10m doses of the PfizerBioNTech vaccine to be available this year, so if this is the only vaccine authorised, everyone else would have to wait until further doses become available next year.\u0026nbspCovid-19 vaccines are expected to be delivered at three types of venue: NHS trust “vaccine hubs” at hospital sites mass vaccination centres, which are in the process of being set up at places such as\u0026nbspfootball stadiums, conference buildings\u0026nbspand racecourses – these are expected to vaccinate up to 5,000 people a day and at GP surgeries and pharmacies. GPs can also visit care home residents and housebound patients at home without them needing to travel.While there is some evidence to indicate high levels of short-term protection from a single dose of vaccine, a two-dose schedule is what has been approved by the\u0026nbspMHRA.The second dose will need to be delivered at least 21 days after the first, and both will be injected into the deltoid muscle – the thick triangular muscle we use to raise each arm.For the Pfizer vaccine, its efficacy rate was calculated seven days after the second shot. It is likely that people will have some protection before this, but this is how long it will take for full protection to kick in. We will learn more about the extent of protection and how long it lasts as data from ongoing clinical trials comes in.Unlikely. England’s deputy chief medical officer, Jonathan Van-Tam, has said he believes Covid-19 vaccines should be delivered according to clinical priority rather than allowing people to jump the queue if they can afford it.Also unlikely, at least in the short to medium term. Assuming more than one vaccine is approved, the priority will be distributing any available doses to the people who need it as quickly as possible.The OptiGene RT-Lamp test, which can be used with saliva samples or nose swabs, was intended to be part of the Liverpool mass testing programme, routinely offered to asymptomatic NHS workers. People in the community have been given lateral flow tests, which involve nose and throat swabs. Both tests have the advantage of speed, with results within half an hour.The health minister Lord Bethell said the Optigene Lamp tests’ sensitivity had been confirmed in the lab and in the field.But Deeks said the data released on Monday showed that spiked samples had been used to increase the number of samples where the virus levels were low. Using laboratory-made “spiked” samples did not reflect performance in the real world and meant that some people would wrongly think they were in the clear when they had the virus, he said.“Before the government decides that these tests are to be used in the population, it is really important that we find out how well they work in people like us. This study has mixed together real clinical data with data from samples that have been made in the laboratory. This has led to its performance on saliva looking better than it is, and wrongly suggests that it can detect Sars-CoV-2 in samples with less virus in them,” he said.The PfizerBioNTech Covid jab is an mRNA vaccine. Essentially, mRNA is a molecule used by living cells to turn the gene sequences in DNA into the proteins that are the building blocks of all their fundamental structures. A segment of DNA gets copied (“transcribed”) into a piece of mRNA, which in turn gets “read” by the cell’s tools for synthesising proteins.In the case of an mRNA vaccine, the virus’s mRNA is injected into the muscle, and our own cells then read it and synthesise the viral protein. The immune system reacts to these proteins – which can’t by themselves cause disease – just as if they’d been carried in on the whole virus. This generates a protective response that, studies suggest, lasts for some time.The two first Covid-19 vaccines to announce phase 3 three trial results were mRNA-based. They were first off the blocks because, as soon as the genetic code of Sars-CoV-2 was known – it was\u0026nbsppublished\u0026nbspby the Chinese in January 2020 – companies that had been working on this technology were able to start producing the virus’s mRNA. Making conventional vaccines takes much longer.Adam Finn, professor of paediatrics at the Bristol Children’s Vaccine Centre, University of BristolBoth the Lamp tests and the lateral flow tests were part of Operation Moonshot, of which the Liverpool programme is the pilot for the whole country. The government’s hope is to use the saliva tests in care homes, hospitals and universities.Bird said tests should be tried out in the context in which they are going to be used. Early on in the development of a test, she said, you would use spiked samples to assess how well it was doing. “Then you gradually move closer and closer to the real world and it is the real world that matters. If you are using the test very widely and helping people to make decisions about their own lives and the lives of their relatives, you want to know about its performance in the context of use.”A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “With up to a third of iniduals with Covid-19 not displaying symptoms, broadening testing to identify those showing no symptoms and who can infect people unknowingly will mean finding positive cases more quickly and break chains of transmission.“We are committed to using the latest testing technology, and the country’s leading scientists have rigorously evaluated the Optigene Lamp test in the lab and in the field and confirmed its sensitivity for asymptomatic testing.“The use of spiked samples is a perfectly valid and standard practice for a study of this sort it is in accordance with the guidelines laid down by the Technical Validation Group. The inclusion of spiked samples does not change the conclusions made”.OptiGene was approached for comment but made no response."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/847b8e85e025b10b6db8fce3fea9af1380504537/0_400_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=41a7dd59e654d0776f8f9f390daa491d","title":"germany museum to restore enigma machine found seabed","story":"Desalination of code machine - which ers thought was ‘old typewriter’ - to take 12 monthsGerman ers who fished an Enigma encryption machine out of the Baltic Sea have handed their rare find over to a museum for restoration.The code machine – which was used by the Nazis to send coded messages during the second world war – was discovered last month by ers on assignment for the environmental group WWF. The group was searching for abandoned fishing nets in the Bay of Gelting off the north-east coast of Germany.“A colleague swam up and said: there’s a net there with an old typewriter in it,” Florian Huber, the lead er, told the DPA news agency.The team quickly realised they had stumbled across an historic artefact and alerted the authorities.Dr Ulf Ickerodt, the head of the state archaeological office in Schleswig-Holstein, said the machine would be restored by experts at the state’s archaeology museum.The delicate process, including a thorough desalination process after seven decades in the Baltic seabed, “will take about a year”, he said.After that, the machine will go on display at the museum.Dr Jann Witt, a historian from the German Naval Association, told DPA he believed the machine, which has three rotors, was thrown overboard from a German warship in the final days of the war.It is less likely to have come from a scuttled submarine, he said, because Adolf Hitler’s U-boats used the more complex four-rotor Enigma machines.The allied forces worked tirelessly to decrypt the codes produced by the Enigma machine, which were changed every 24 hours.The British mathematician Alan Turing, who is seen as the father of modern computing, spearheaded a team at Britain’s Bletchley Park that cracked the code in 1941.The breakthrough helped the allies decipher crucial radio messages about German military movements.

At more than 58,000, the country has the most Covid-related deaths in mainland Europe and health officials say the tightening of restrictions is essential to prevent the sort of catastrophe the nation faced during the first wave in the spring.People will be barred from travelling between regions from 20 December until 6 January except for work, health or emergency reasons. Furthermore, they will not be able to leave their towns on Christmas Day, St Stephen’s Day or New Year’s Day. This will prevent relatives who live in different areas from congregating on what is considered the most important occasion for family get togethers.“Christmas is very important for Italians,” Riccardo Ciogli said outside Gatsby Cafe in Rome’s Esquilino district. “This is what we do – we get together with family, with friends, and we eat.” His friend Erica Salvatore, who works at the nearby federation of architects, is from the southern region of Molise, where she usually spends Christmas with her parents. “I will go and see them for a few days this weekend but I don’t know if I’ll be able to travel before 20 December,” she said. “In Italy our traditions are very important, you can’t just take them away.”Giulia Della Fratte, who also lives in Rome, said: “I kind of understand the ban on inter-regional travel but not the one between towns. Rome, for example, is made up of lots of different municipalities that are maybe only 1km apart – so how will that work? It’s nonsense.”France reopened non-essential shops last weekend, allowing Christmas shopping to begin. Travel should be permitted form 15 December, when a 9pm to 7am curfew will kick in that will be lifted only for Christmas and New Year’s Eve. Bars and restaurants will not reopen until January and private gatherings are set to be limited to six adults.Germany has extended its “lockdown lite” until early January and tightened rules in the run-up to holidays so that it can relax them slightly over Christmas. Private meetings, restricted to 10 people from two households in November, are limited to five until 23 December when they will be eased to allow up to 10 from any number of households to meet, but only until 1 January when the stricter regime returns.Austria’s strict lockdown ends this weekend. The government has announced a programme of mass testing over the next few weeks partly to allow more families to reunite over the festive period. Christmas markets have been cancelled.Italy has banned inter-regional travel from 20 December to 6 January except for work, health or emergency reasons, and Italians may not leave their towns on Christmas Day, Boxing Day or New Year’s Day. Midnight mass on 24 December will be brought forward so worshippers can get home before the country’s 10pm curfew, and people arriving from EU countries between 10 and 21 December must present a negative test.Spain has appealed for people to be responsible but will allow movement between regions “for family reasons” between 23 December and 6 January. Regional curfews, which range from 10pm to midnight, will be pushed back to 1.30am on 24 and 31 December, when when the limit for gatherings will be raised from six to 10, a measure that will also apply on Christmas Day and New Year’s Day.Authorities in the Netherlands are still debating whether restaurants (but not cafes and bars) should be allowed to reopen, and if the maximum number of guests from outside each household can be raised from three to six. Many Catholic churches have cancelled midnight mass and school holidays may be extended.Belgium has said households may be in close contact with just one extra person over the Christmas period, although people living on their own will be allowed to meet two others. Fireworks are to be banned on New Year’s Eve to limit gatherings.Poland will allow people to spend Christmas only with their immediate family, with no more than five guests to be invited to each household until at least 27 December and travel banned outside people’s home towns.During a press conference on Thursday night, the prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, said “a different Christmas awaits”. He warned a third wave could strike as early as January. “It is an essential caution to protect our loved ones,” Conte added.Although the infection curve has been flattening and hospital admissions declining, the main concern is a resurgence of cases once the Christmas and new year festivities are over, as happened after a summer of mostly unbridled travel and socialising.The rules will run alongside a 10pm-5am national curfew – extended until 7am on New Year’s Day. Ski resorts will remain closed until 7 January, while those who travel abroad between 21 December and 6 January must quarantine for 14 days upon their return.Bars and restaurants in the majority of Italy’s 20 regions are closed as part of a “red, orange and yellow” tiered system of restrictions adopted in early November. As the infection curve slows, Conte said all regions would be in the yellow zone within a few weeks, meaning bars and restaurants could stay open until 6pm, including on Christmas Day and St Stephen’s Day.But this has brought little comfort to restaurant owners. “As a businessperson I am extremely angry,” said Valentina Santanicchio, a chef whose restaurant, Capitano del Popolo, in Orvieto has been closed since the Umbria region was placed in the orange zone last month. “Listening to Conte’s press conference, there wasn’t a word of solidarity towards the thousands who can’t work right now or who have lost jobs. And as a citizen, the Christmas travel ban is a slap in the face to families and their feelings.”The Christmas restrictions were criticised by regional governors, who claimed in a joint statement that they were not consulted about curbs that they said were too harsh on families. Matteo Salvini, the leader of the far-right League party, said: “These families must remain ided even at Christmas. This is yet more proof that the government does not know Italy.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/67f3372c070b59a99a8bd41525162b20b491fc5c/628_121_4267_2560/master/4267.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=e023e8a103f970a27af7d6176473258a","title":"yorkshire couples house in different covid tier to garden","story":"Covid boundary puzzles include couple whose home is in Harrogate and garden in LeedsAs England navigates the Covid-19 tier system, spare a thought for one Yorkshire couple for whom it is anything but straightforward.Sheila Herbert and her husband, Philip, from the picturesque market town of Otley, live in a house in tier 2, while their garden is tier 3.“It’s all one big conundrum,” said Sheila, 74, explaining that their quiet cul-de-sac home of 18 years was built over a culvert that runs directly under their garden, with the underground channel of water acting as the official boundary between West Yorkshire and North Yorkshire.“Our house is in Harrogate and our garden is in Leeds. The culvert cuts right through my garden. In fact, it goes right underneath the corner of the conservatory,” she told the local paper.Under government restrictions it means that though, under tier 2, the couple should be able to meet people in their garden, under tier 3 they are prohibited.While most of the homeowners on their street pay their taxes to Harrogate borough council, eight houses at the bottom end fall under Leeds city council’s remit, with the couple on the border.From 2 December, England will be ided into three different tiers of restrictions. They are slightly amended from the previous system.Across all tiers, shops, personal care, gyms and the wider leisure sector are set to reopen. Collective worship and weddings – with a maximum of 15 in attendance – can also resume.Under the new system hospitality businesses in England can stay open until 11pm with table service only but last orders must be made by 10pm, in an effort to stagger departures. The\u0026nbsp“rule of six”\u0026nbspwill also remain in place indoors, meaning social household mixing is still allowed.In tier 1, people will be encouraged to minimise travel and work from home where possible. Support bubbles – which allowed a single household to join with another household – are also being broadened across all tiers. Parents with a child under one will be able to form a support bubble, as well as those with a child under five who needs continuous care, such as a child with a disability. Also, in cases where there is a single adult carer, for a partner with dementia for example, they would also be able to form a support bubble.How was it before?In the least restrictive tier, also known as alert level “medium”, the rule of six applied indoors and outdoors, meaning up to half a dozen people from different households could gather. Hospitality businesses, such as pubs and restaurants, could stay open but were forced to shut by 10pm – a move that prompted much criticism, including from Conservative backbenchers.Under the new system, although hospitality venues will be allowed to stay open until 11pm – with last orders at 10pm – only those that serve substantial meals can operate. It means pubs and bars that do not will have to close.As before, social mixing outside of households or support bubbles will not be allowed indoors. The rule of six will apply outdoors.Indoor entertainment venues, such as cinemas, casinos and bowling alleys, must also close.How was it before?In the “high” alert level tier people were prohibited from mixing socially indoors with anybody outside of their household or support bubble but the rule of six remained in place outdoors. Hospitality businesses, such as pubs and restaurants, could open until 10pm but people were only allowed to visit with their household or support bubble.Hospitality venues will have to close, except for delivery and takeaway service. In tier 3, hotels and other accommodation providers must also close, except for specific work purposes where people cannot return home. Outdoor sports, including golf and tennis, will be allowed to continue in all tiers, as will amateur team sports such as football. Unlike the first two tiers, spectators will not be allowed to watch sport in tier 3.How was it before?In the most restrictive tier, known as the “very high” alert level that was endured by vast swathes of the north of England, mixing socially indoors between households – unless a support bubble was in place – was banned. Under baseline measures hospitality venues serving substantial food could remain open until 10pm. Up to six people from different households could socialise outdoors in public spaces, such as parks, beaches or public gardens.They are not the only ones for whom the restrictions make little sense. The village of Groombridge boasts two pubs, but the Crown Inn lies in Kent’s tier 3, while the Junction is in East Sussex’s tier 2. The pubs are less than half-a-mile apart, with a seven-minute walk between them.As the 1,600 residents on both sides are not supposed to cross the county border, at a bridge over the river, the Kent side of the village cannot go to the East Sussex pub.The Crown’s landlord, Steve Harmes, described it as “horrendous”. Not being able to open was “very frustrating”, he told the BBC. “Being put in this position, it’s really hard for us to move forward.”Meanwhile, the Junction’s landlady, Tiffany Pearson-Gills, said the situation was “perplexing”. She said: “It’s great for us, but it doesn’t make sense that the Crown up the road cannot open. It’s just so close, it’s a really, really difficult one. It’s quite perplexing for everyone, for such a small village as well … it just doesn’t make any sense at all.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4409770.1605434900!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"400 yes 400 irish retailers for all your online christmas shopping","story":"A number of Irish independent retailers describe how lockdowns and Covid restrictions have impacted their businesses - and what they’ve had to do to adapt. \t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIrish retailers are facing a tough Christmas with new Covid-19 restrictions closing non-essential outletsWe have been overwhelmed, in the best possible way, by the response to our original list, a few weeks ago, of 100 Irish websites where you can buy lovely, unique and good-value presents in the run-up to Christmas.Almost as soon as it appeared, business owners and many of their customers emailed us, tweeted us, sent us Instagram messages and contacted us on Facebook to champion more Irish companies doing the business online.That response matters, because we all know that the run-up to Christmas,\u0026nbspwith so many physical shops in lockdown,\u0026nbspis going to be incredibly hard for many businesses. It is also going to be a challenging time for shoppers, as they try to get organised for a Christmas like never before with more than 40 shopping days taken from them almost overnight.We know the problems all too well, but we know the solution, too, or at least part of it. The internet. But,\u0026nbspas we have said before and will say again,\u0026nbspshopping online comes with a caveat. As much as 70 per cent of Irish consumers’ virtual spending leaves the country as people shop overseas.It doesn’t have to be that way. As we are learning, there are many, many local sites that need our support this month and every month. If we could keep just 10 or 20 per cent of our online spend this year at home it would inject tens of millions of euro into our local economies. That would save jobs and keep businesses going.So our 100 became 200, and is now becoming 400.Jump to: Toys Food and drink Art and gifts Jewellery Clothes Books Music and tech Sporty stuff Health and beauty Everything elseTOYS nimblefingers.ie  A Dublin toyshop that has been making children and their parents happy for generations.

Photograph: Andres PovedaFormer astronaut Commander Chris Hadfield has turned up on The Late Late Show to surprise six-year-old Adam King.Adam, who has brittle bones, was one of the stars of the RTÉ Late Late Toy Show on Friday night last week.He expressed an interest on it of being a capsule commander (Capcom) because his condition meant he could not be an astronaut.His appearance came to the attention of Cmdr Hadfield who flew two missions on the space shuttle and was commander of the International Space Station in 2013 when he tweeted on St Patrick’s Day: “Maidin mhaith from the international Space Station! Happy Saint Patrick’s Day to the Irish all around the globe.”His daughter was studying in Trinity College Dublin at the time and he has since become a regular visitor to Ireland.On Friday Adam was on the Late Late Show again, this time via Zoom when he was linked up with Cmdr Hadfield.Cmdr Hadfield first spoke to host Ryan Tubridy and told him how Adam had caught his attention:Cmdr Hadfield told him that he had been a Capcom too for space shuttle missions.“Capcom is a fascinating job, you are right in the thick of it, it’s like a mystery, solving things constantly . You have to rely on your own skill and the skill of the people around you,” he explained.“Sure, he will end up doing something superb with his life, but the process and the inspiration I think is so important and that’s part of the reflection that I really like to see also.”Cmdr Hadfield asked Adam where he went on his imaginary space missions to which Adam responded: “Sometimes I go to the moon and sometimes I go to some other places, like different planets.”Cmdr Hadfield responded: “I don’t know if you know but I have two brothers and two sisters and when I was your age, we did the exact same thing, we dreamed about flying in space.“The cool thing Adam is that, when I got older, I got the chance to actually fly in space, three times.

Photograph:  MaxwellsIrish republicans during the War of Independence were capable of reprisals and atrocities, and the British forces were not alone in this, President Michael D Higgins has said.In an address to launch the Machnamh 100 centenary commemorations address, Mr Higgins said: “Of course, the British forces were not alone when it came to reprisals and atrocities. Violence breeds violence.“Cruelty is learned and, indeed, the history of Irish republicanism is one in which the callous disregard for human life has been displayed on too many occasions, with civilians often constituting the target, in what is often termed the ‘Irish struggle’,” he said.“War is always ugly, and posthumous glorification is neither desirable nor morally sound,” he said, in remarks that come just days after Sinn Féin TD Brian Stanley’s remarks about the 1979 Warrenpoint attack.People should engage with history and commemoration in “an inclusive, ethical, pluralist and honest” way, that evaluates the motives and of actions “on all sides with fairness”.Daunting challengeFinding “a fair and comprehensive way of dealing with the past” is a daunting challenge, he said. “However, it is a challenge that on moral grounds cannot be, should not be, I believe, shirked.”However, it is the basis for a new future “not only of hope”, but of “fulfilment for all on our island and for all in our neighbourhood”, he said. “For the sake of the future, we must break loose from the snares of the past.”Meanwhile, the President said that Irish people, the subject of stereotyping for so long, should not stereotype British people because a majority of Irish people disagree with Brexit.Efforts to generate Anglophobia are perhaps being fuelled by the worst aspects, and feared consequences, of Brexit, Mr Higgins said in his address to open the Machnamh series of talks.In the lecture series – the word Machnamh means to reflect or meditate – the President has drawn together historians to discuss how events of 100 years ago have shaped modern Ireland.During the address, he suggested attacks on creameries and shops in rural Ireland during the War of Independence were a “key strategic tool” of the British government.Attacks by Auxiliaries and Black and Tans were not merely a spontaneous series of acts by the uncontrolled, or the drunken, but rather a deliberate response by empire to “quash support” for independence.The sophisticated reprisals “marked an escalation” in the economic damage wrought during the conflict by punishing population through the destruction of a “cherished” local employer.Collective punishmentsReprisals and collective punishments were an established strategic tool of imperialist military strategy by the time before they occurred in Ireland during the War of Independence.Such acts, and the anticipation of them, drew a violent response in turn from Irish nationalists who were “motivated by both new and recalled humiliations of which there was no shortage”.The President’s lecture will be responded to by Prof Ciarán Benson, the chairman of Poetry Ireland and the Irish Museums Trust Prof Anne Dolan of Trinity College Dublin Prof Michael Laffan, emeritus professor of history in UCD and Prof Joep Leerssen, professor of European studies at the University of Amsterdam.It will be followed in February by a seminar entitled Empire: Instincts, Interests and Power that will examine British responses to events in Ireland during the War of Independence and the treaty.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4427389.1607104306!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"sinn f%C3%A9in s brian stanley asks to make statement to d%C3%A1il over tweets","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSinn Féin TD Brian Stanley, chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, apologising for posting a controversial tweetSinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald has asked the party’s Laois-Offaly TD Brian Stanley to take a week off after following a political controversy over his social media activities.Ms McDonald also said he has written to Ceann Comhairle Seán Ó Fearghaíl to request time to make a statement to the Dáil on December 15thLess than 24 hours after apologising for a tweet that praised IRA attacks on British soldiers, the Public Accounts Committee chairman was forced to defend himself on Thursday against alleged homophobia in a tweet posted on the day Leo Varadkar became Ireland’s first openly gay political leader in 2017.In addition to the tweets, Mr Stanley seemed to infer during an interview with a local radio station that he would not eat Chinese chicken over his concerns about the spread of Covid-19.Ms McDonald held a meeting with Mr Stanley on Friday amid calls from Government that he make a public statement and take questions before the Dáil.In a statement, Ms McDonald said: “Today I met with Teachta Brian Stanley. We discussed the ongoing public commentary relating to tweets he has posted and a radio interview he gave in March.“At my request, Teachta Stanley will take next week to be with his family, for whom this period of public controversy has proven very difficult.“Teachta Stanley has this afternoon written to the Ceann Comhairle to request time to make a full personal statement to the Dáil on December 15.”Mr Stanley had being facing mounting calls to appear before the Dail following a series of controversies.CredibilityEarlier, Taoiseach Micheál Martin said the credibility of the Public Accounts Committee has been thrown into question by the social media activity of its chairman.Mr Martin said the Laois-Offaly TD needs to reflect on the impact on the PAC in terms of the issues that have arisen following his two controversial tweets.Mr Martin said the tweet about Mr Varadkar had an inference of homophobia in his view and exacerbated the situation for the Sinn Féin TD. He also said that his view was that Mr Stanley’s apology for the tweet that referred to the IRA atrocities was not sufficiently comprehensive.“It’s part of a wider agenda by Sinn Féin to justify the narrative of the past 40 years,” he said. “It’s a problem for me and a problem for younger generations, of informing a them that it was appalling.”In a strident criticism of the IRA campaign, Mr Martin described the Narrow Water bombings - in which 18 British paratroopers died - and the bombs which killed Lord Louis Mountbatten and three others - as “crimes against humanity” and “war crimes”.“In my view I do not believe his (Stanley’s) apology was comprehensive nor did it did deal with glorification of military events he spoke, or the deaths of so many people,” he said. “There are loved ones of those who died who are still alive. That (tweet) was very upsetting to them.”So with the recent controversy surrounding Brian Stanley, I’ve decided to step down as LGBT Officer and member of Ógra SF UCD. This is not something I wanted to do, but after thinking it over the last few days I feel it’s the best decision.— seán pender | BLM (@seanpender_) Earlier, Fine Gael Ministers increased pressure on Mr Stanley by implying that deleting his Twitter and Facebook accounts might suggest he has something to hide.The suggestion come as Mr Stanley’s party colleague Louise O’Reilly said the tone of the 2017 tweet was not acceptable but that a wrong inference was put on it and the allegation that there was homophobic content. The tweet should be taken in the context of “the whole world” discussing the fact Ireland had its first openly gay leader, she said.Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe and Minister for Justice Helen McEntee renewed their criticism on Friday of the Laois-Offaly TD, over a number of insensitive posts on his Twitter account.Less than 24 hours after apologising for a tweet that praised IRA ambushes at Narrow Water in 1979 and at Kilmichael during the War of Independence, Mr Stanley found himself defending himself against alleged homophobia.HomophobiaMr Stanley rejected any suggestion of homophobic undertones to a tweet that read: “Yippee 4 de tory. it’s Leo. U can do what u like in bed but don’t look 4 a pay rise the next morning.”He said on Thursday that his record on campaigning for LGBT rights “speaks for itself” and he was involved in every campaign for gay rights. “I don’t have any apology to make to anybody,” he insisted.However, later on Thursday night both his Twitter and his Facebook accounts were deleted.Mr Donohoe asked on Friday why the social media accounts needed to be deleted and questioned if there were further posts that could prove problematic for the Laois-Offaly TD.He called on Mr Stanley to clarify if there were other comments on the account that was deleted and to explain why it was necessary to delete it.In a signal of an escalation of the matter by Fine Gael, Mr Donohoe said that the apology and the deletions were no longer enough and clarity needed to be given.Likewise, Minister for Justice Helen McEntee said on Friday that Mr Stanley should come before the Dáil to explain himself on the matter.Speaking on LMFM radio, she said: “My own view is that it referred very negatively and in a completely inappropriate way to the sexuality of my own party leader. And I do think he needs to clarify why he tweeted it and what exactly it was in reference to and I think that’s not just a political thing. I think LGBT groups would share the same view.”Sinn Féin reactionSinn Féin defended Mr Stanley in relation to his tweet about Mr Varadkar, backing his defence that there was no homophobic innuendo or intention behind it.Speaking on RTÉ’s Today with Claire Byrne show, Ms O’Reilly, Sinn Féin’s health spokeswoman and Fingal TD, said that the tone of Mr Stanley’s tweet in 2017 referencing Mr Varadkar “was not acceptable”.“If any offence was caused, of course Brian needs to engage and he needs to have those discussions with people,” she said.As a party colleague, she knew Mr Stanley to be an ally to the LGBT community and a “very, very staunch campaigner, not just for LGBT rights but also for human rights.”It was important to understand the tweet in context, she said. “At the time in 2017, not just here in Ireland, but the whole world was talking about the fact that we had elected an openly gay head of Government.“It is something for which we should rightly be proud, and Brian Stanley’s remarks are in that context.”However, Ms O’Reilly said that the tweet had been left open to misinterpretation. Twitter was not the platform for everybody, “not everybody is suited to engagement on Twitter”.She said Mr Stanley was not on the platform any more “as I’ve said it is not for everybody.”However, the tweets did prompt negative reaction and criticism within the party. Seán Pender from Kildare, who is an LGBT officer and member of Ógra Sinn Féin in UCD announced he was resigning because of the recent controversy surrounding Mr Stanley.“This is not something I wanted to do, but after thinking it over over the last few days I felt it’s the best decision,” he wrote on Twitter.Former Sinn Féin Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown councillor and LGBT officer Chris Curran said Mr Stanley’s tweet on Mr Varadkar was “ridiculous and insensitive”.Mr Curran, who left politics in 2019, added that the views “did not really represent the Sinn Féin that I know. Something like this holds the party back from doing what it wants to do,” he said.Speaking on Today with Claire Byrne on RTÉ, Mr Collins said, however, he was not calling on Mr Stanley to resign as that was a matter for himself. He added that there was a wider issue of Sinn Féin activists and their use of social media. Mr Collins said that during the Mother and Baby Homes debate he had been “hugely abused” on social media by “Sinn Féin types.”When questioned about this he said the abusive tweets had been from Sinn Féin supporters, not necessarily members. It was not acceptable that some people said one thing in person or in public, but something else on their social media account, he added.Leadership needed to be shown, it was an ongoing challenge. The issue had to be addressed at all levels, he urged.An index of selected articles available exclusively to our readers with an  digital subscription Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4427956.1607117647!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"sinn f%C3%A9in member resigns amid claims party is trying to silence her","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tChristine O’Mahony said she left the party in light of the controversy surrounding Brian Stanley. Photograph: Crispin RodwellThe A Sinn Féin member has resigned from the party saying she was told not to discuss internal issues in public and after a party member called to her house to ask her to delete recent critical tweets.Christine O’Mahony (22), from Co Meath, said she has left the party in light of the controversy surrounding Sinn Féin TD Brian Stanley, who said he had nothing to apologise for over a 2017 tweet about Leo Varadkar.In that message, the now-head of the Public Accounts Committee wrote: “yippee 4 d tory. it’s Leo. U can do what u like in bed but don’t look 4 a pay rise the next morning.”Ms O’Mahony criticised this online and said she encountered significant pushback from the party.She received messages from other members of Ógra Sinn Féin stating that a cornerstone of the functioning of the party was to have discussions that were kept internal and that adhered to the principles of “democratic centralism”.She was told that “going after” the party would only serve Sinn Féin detractors. She was also told that both senior and junior members of the party had raised concerns about social media posts in recent days. She was told “sensitive matters” must be kept internal and online messages, which contradicted this, would have to be taken down.The masters student in UCD said that a member of the party, who she knows, then called to her family home.She said she made the decision to resign after this and said she believes members are being “silenced”.“Seeing how the members are reacting to basic criticism, minor criticism…it shows they are not going to listen to me.”Ms O’Mahony said that some members are being encouraged to give social media a break.“But this is my platform. I can write about what I want. You can’t censor me just because I am criticising the party. “A Sinn Féin spokesperson said: “Sinn Féin has guidelines for the use of social media that members are asked to adhere to, which includes asking members not to post offensive or harassing material.“Internal party matters, should by definition, be discussed within the party. This does not prevent any member from speaking on any issue.”An index of selected articles available exclusively to our readers with an  digital subscription "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4427957.1607115782!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"taoiseach renews criticism of beleaguered sinn f%C3%A9in td brian stanley","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Micheál Martin: he says   Brian Stanley’s   apology for celebrating “atrocities” has not gone far enough.  Photograph:  Getty ImagesTaoiseach Micheál Martin has renewed his criticism of beleaguered Sinn Féin TD Brian Stanley, saying the Laois-Offaly Deputy’s apology for celebrating “atrocities” had not gone far enough.In a strident criticism of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) chairman, Mr Martin described the Narrow Water bombing in August 1979 – in which 18 British paratroopers died – as a “crime against humanity”, and also described the bomb attack in Mullaghmore, Co Sligo, on the same day that killed Lord Louis Mountbatten and three others as a “war crime”.“It’s part of a wider agenda by SF to justify the narrative of the past 40 years,” he added.Mr Martin said another tweet posted by Mr Stanley in 2017 about Fine Gael leader Leo Varadkar inferred homophobia in his view. The Taoiseach said it exacerbated the situation for the Sinn Féin TD, and called into question the reputation of the influential all-party PAC.Mr Stanley published a tweet that praised the IRA ambush in Narrow Water, Warrenpoint, Co Down, as well as the Kilmichael ambush in 1920 that also resulted in the deaths of 18 British soldiers.Within 24 hours of apologising, a second tweet about Mr Varadkar came to public attention. It was published by Mr Stanley on the day Mr Varadkar became Fine Gael leader.Mr Stanley strongly rejected any suggestion of homophobic undertones in the tweet that read: “Yippee 4 de tory. it’s Leo.

Photograph: iStock Exercise leaves us healthier and more likely to live longer, yet many of us struggle to swallow the recommended dose of physical activity.This is because it is unnatural to exercise, says Prof Daniel Lieberman, a top evolutionary scientist at Harvard University. He has studied extinct humans and living hunter gatherers for decades, and describes exercise as a uniquely modern phenomenon.“When people don’t exercise, we label them as lazy,” laments Lieberman, “but they are actually doing what we evolved to do - which is to avoid unnecessary physical activity.” His recent book is Exercised - The Science of Physical Activity, Rest and Health. In it he busts myths and misunderstandings about exercise by looking at it from the viewpoint of evolutionary biology and anthropology.The biggest myth, he says, is that it is normal to exercise. Our hunter-gatherer and farming ancestors never ran or walked several miles a day just for health. Lieberman explains why exercising can be so difficult and suggests how to overcome our instincts to avoid it.If you ever watched the gorillas or chimps in Dublin Zoo, they spend a lot of time inactive, sitting around grooming or feeding. A 2016 study in Nature showed that apes spend hundreds of calories less energy per day than we do. A chimpanzee typically is inactive for 10.5 hours in a 12-hour day. Our ape ancestors evolved for sluggish activity levels to suit life in a rainforest.Around 7 million years ago, as the climate in Africa dried and rainforests retreated, our ancestors evolved to walk on two legs. They took on a different strategy to our ape relatives, wherein we spent more calories to earn more calories - and reproduce twice as fast. “We evolved an unusually expensive way of increasing our reproductive success, from an unusually low-energy-budget ancestor,” Lieberman writes. He argues that as result, our deeply embedded human instinct during downtime is “to be as inactive as possible.”While some describe sitting as the new smoking, he scoffs at this notion. “Hunter-gatherers sit as much as Westerners,” he says. Studies of Hazda hunter-gatherers in Africa show them typically spending nine hours sitting, two hours squatting and an hour kneeling each day.Still, average hunter-gatherer men and women walk about 9.5km (six miles a day), respectively, in order to hunt or collect food. We evolved to walk with extreme efficiency. Chimps spend about twice as many calories to walk the same distance as humans. Therefore, it is hard to expend large amounts of calories quickly by walking. Our ancestors evolved to be endurance walkers, adds Lieberman, but only when necessary. Our adaptions include a big toe that points forward, angled thighs and the forward curve in our lower spines.Born to runOne part of Lieberman’s research that attracts media attention is his focus on how we also evolved for endurance running. “We have short toes, and an arch in our foot, which is basically a spring. You don’t need an arch for walking, but you need one for running,” he says. “We have long tendons in our leg like the Achilles’.”And there’s our unusually large gluteus maximus, the largest muscle in the human body. “Which we don’t use when we are walking, but which is incredibly important for running,” says Lieberman. There is also a special “nuchal ligament,” which works like a spring and keeps our heads steady as we run.Gorillas, chimps and our early ancestors lack this ligament. It first appears about two million years ago in Homo erectus, along with other adaptations for running. Fossil evidence suggests that this is when running long distances to scavenge and hunt became important. We were never fast. Almost all four-legged creatures can outsprint Usain Bolt. Instead, we evolved to be long-distance runners.Lieberman proved this to himself when he once took part in a race in Arizona over 40km (25 miles), with 40 others on shank’s mare, competing against 53 horses and riders. After 4 hours 20 minutes, he had finished ahead of all but 13 horses.While antelopes, horses and zebras easily galloped away from human hunters, our ancestors (just like Lieberman in Arizona) did not give up. Yet for most of human history, hunting animals meant getting up close. The first stone-tipped spear dates to around 500,000 years ago, and the bow and arrow was invented just 100,000 years ago.Persistence hunting seems to have been widespread. This involves humans running and walking after prey, never letting it cool down, and tracking it until it overheats and exhausts itself. The San hunter-gatherers in the Kalahari in southern Africa have been recorded hunting in this way, with the average distance slightly longer than a half marathon.Humans are especially adapted not to overheat. In his book, Lieberman crowns humans the sweating champions of the world. We alone have five to 10 million sweat glands all over our skin, allowing us to sweat one litre every hour, which keeps us cool, something animals we pursue cannot do.“Until relatively recently, running was part of everyday life,” says Lieberman. This includes accounts from Native Americans, Australian aborigines, Africans and Siberians. It is only in the modern world that we don’t have to run anymore and with that comes problems.Run to repair Walking and running are essential to switch on repair and maintenance in our bodies. Exercise breaks down muscles and triggers inflammation, but this in turn switches on anti-inflammatory and repair mechanisms. The long-term effect is less inflammation all over the body. Exercise also keeps off belly fat, which in itself is a major cause of inflammation and other problems. “We evolved to be physically active. It is important for almost every system in the body,” he adds.But we evolved to be active when it is either necessary or fun - dancing is a fun tradition in almost all human cultures. When we exercise we produce chemicals that make us feel good and can lift our mood. But dopamine levels, for example, only go up after we exercise, so cannot get us off the couch, and (rather unfairly) overweight people have fewer dopamine receptors. We never evolved to be physically inactive and out of shape, so many of the rewards from exercise only come after several months, Lieberman explains .We all know exercise is good for us. But our natural instinct is not to exercise. “Two-thirds of Americans don’t exercise, and I dare say that the data are not that different in countries like Ireland and elsewhere,” Lieberman says. He argues that we need to accept how natural it is not to exercise and come up with ways to get around this - similar to how we approach education.The key to getting started is to try make it social and fun and also to enter into a commitment contract, like we do during university studies. “I am a professor at a university where students pay for me to essentially torture them, making them do all kinds of work,” Lieberman says. He supports compulsory physical activity in schools and universities.For adults, we might schedule exercises with a friend, and be socially obligated to show up. One can pay to enter a race or event that requires training, or post exercises online so others can see what you are doing, and not doing. Or one could designate someone you admire or fear as a referee to check up on your progress. Or commit to teams or sports clubs. “One thing we do with education is make it social and we make it fun,” he points out – and we should do the same with exercise.We also need to accept that exercise is not natural and is challenging for most people. “Let’s stop pretending that exercise is necessarily fun, especially for habitual non-exercisers,” Lieberman advises.The book Exercised can easily be enjoyed over the upcoming festive season, when we all begin to consider changes for 2021 and most of us reflect on how we might fit in – against our instincts – more exercise."},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons december 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlTo order The 2020 limited-edition Matt Christmas jigsaw, go to telegraphcartoonjigsawsOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514. To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Matt Hancock\u0026#39s \u0026#39step-grandfather\u0026#39 who died of Covid-19 was his step-father\u0026#39s ex-wife\u0026#39s second husbandCaving to Brussels on fish and level playing field risks leaving UK a \u0026#39permanent client state\u0026#39, Boris Johnson warnedBoots runs out of Covid tests in six cities as public rushes to get swabbed before ChristmasGovernment sets up secret \u0026#39green nudge unit\u0026#39 to persuade Britons to  install smart meters, drive less and cut down on meat Three quarters of pubs not reopening due to tier restrictions, poll findsComment: I love the EU but I\u0026#39ll vote for Boris\u0026#39s Brexit deal and so should the rest of the Labour PartyOld Etonians accused of launching smear campaign against Head MasterLabour will be \u0026#39putting two fingers up\u0026#39 to voters if it fails to back Brexit deal, Sir Keir Starmer warnedBrexit deal: what has been agreed, and what happens next?Gynaecologist struck off after filming sex with camera hidden in his glasses, tribunal hearsComment: How the \u0026#34moonshot\u0026#34 rapid testing plan could free us from Covid purgatory even before a vaccine Exclusive: Rail passengers set to ignore five-day Christmas window amid overcrowding fearsExclusive: Tory rebels plot to block new homes on climate grounds in planning algorithm rowLeading charity facing legal action over claims of anti-Christian discriminationCovid vaccine will have \u0026#39marginal impact\u0026#39 in next three months, chief medical officers warnUS House of Representatives votes to decriminalise cannabis, hurdles remainEmmanuel Macron would rather see Brexit talks founder than agree to a bad deal, sources sayLiverpool Mayor Joe Anderson arrested in bribery investigationCovid vaccinations in Wales and Northern Ireland to begin on TuesdayBrexit Negotiations: the sticking points explainedRSPB to recognise female founder with new statueBack to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"denmark end oil gas extraction north sea","story":"Denmark has become the world\u0027s first major oil producer to stop offering exploration licenses, putting pressure on the UK to do likewise ahead of next year\u0027s UN Climate Change Conference. As part of a political covenant agreed by all Denmark\u0027s parliamentary parties, the country will abandon its planned 8th licensing round, and end oil and gas production completely by 2050. We\u0027re doing it because we hope that we can inspire others, Denmark\u0027s climate and energy minister, Dan Jørgensen, told The .We hope that we can be the country that takes one of the first steps towards a global alliance so that we can live up to the Paris Agreement.The decision will cost Denmark some 13 billion kroner (£1.6 billion), according to a press release by the energy ministry, and prevent the production of about 150m barrels over the next 30 years.Louise Burrows, policy adviser at UK campaign group Fossil Fuel Transition, said that the decision by Europe\u0027s third-biggest oil and gas producer would increase pressure on Norway and the UK, the top two, to follow suit.It\u0027s really holding the UK to account, it\u0027s a signal that the market is changing, and counties need to get ahead of the game, she said. Really the UK should have done this first, as the host of COP 26. I think it\u0027s very realistic for the UK to do it now.One cannot underestimate the potential that Denmark can now become a pioneer country for winding down fossil fuels, she said.Others, however, were more cautious.The real news here is that Denmark will apparently go on extracting fossil fuels for another three decades, the Swedish teen climate activist Greta Thunberg wrote on Twitter. To us children, this is not the \u0027good news\u0027 that some people seem to think. We\u0027re in a climate emergency. Act accordingly. Danish Society for Nature Conservation also said it would have preferred an earlier end to production. Under the agreement, oil companies will also be able to continue oil and gas exploration on their existing licenses and, according to the press release, will also have access to two other licensing schemes with limited scope. New Zealand in 2018 became the first major country to ban oil exploration, with Ireland and Italy following up with similar bans last year. But the move is much more significant coming from Denmark. Since 1972, the country has earned more than 541 billion Danish kroner (£65bn) from North Sea oil, helping fund one of the world\u0027s most generous welfare states. The country is currently the 39th biggest oil and gas producer worldwide.  Denmark\u0027s Social Democrat government came to power last summer in an election in which the environment unexpectedly trumped immigration as the key issue.Under pressure from supporting parties, it then committed to reducing emissions by 70 percent by 2030, later enshrining the commitment in a climate law binding on all future governments.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"fast mette denmarks mink farmers grieve end industry mass cull","story":"Peter Hindbo takes a mink pelt from his 4-year-old grandson, turns it fur-side out with a vacuum tube, and tosses it into a barrel of salt and sawdust for a final tumbling.Outside, his mink sheds on the family\u0027s traditional Danish courtyard farm in central Jutland are now completely empty. Just a single rack of chilled carcasses remains to be skinned after a nationwide cull forced him to wipe out his own farm stock of 25,000 animals.“I think we\u0027ll be finished in three hours,” he says. “And then it\u0027s all over. It\u0027s so sad.”Whatever you think about the ethics of the fur industry, it\u0027s difficult not to feel sympathy for a man forced to destroy a family business he has spent the last 35 years building up - growing it from 400 to 3,600 breeding females.And it\u0027s not just Mr Hindbo. Since Denmark\u0027s government at the start of last month gave the country\u0027s 1,500 fur farmers just 12 days to cull the country\u0027s entire population of 17 million mink in an attempt to eradicate a new vaccine-resistant Covid-19 mutation, a world-leading industry has been destroyed almost overnight.In the drying room, Mr Hindbo shows me some recently finished pelts.This type is called sapphire. We are the best in the world at this, Peter says as he runs his hand over a creamy, silvery pelt.Our farm is the best in Denmark, and if you are the best in Denmark, you\u0027re the best in the world.The way he tells it, since Danish farmers began breeding mink in the 1930s, the breeding stock has been transformed. Danish minks have richer fur, shorter hair, have more puppies, and are bigger than those produced in China.Danish farmers have also managed to keep out mink plasmacytosis, the AIDS-like disease that has devastated herds elsewhere.But all of that appears to now be lost. It was the plan that I should buy the rest of the farm in 2022, Andreas says. Everything was accepted from the bank, and then this came, and it all collapsed.Restarting a mink farm from scratch has not been banned, but the difficulties would be numerous.Farmers will miss the support of the Danish Fur Breeder\u0027s Association, or Kopenhagen Fur, the marketing organisation and auction house it operates, which will likely be closed or scaled down, making them vulnerable to animal rights groups. Additionally, the companies making mink feed, cages and machinery are all shutting down.The tragedy for Mr Hindbo is that it now looks like none of this was really necessary.Two days before he finished killing off the last of his minks, Denmark\u0027s government admitted that it had no legal right to demand the cull of animals in farms without nearby coronavirus outbreaks. Even Denmark\u0027s SSI infectious diseases agency, which sounded the warning that Denmark risked becoming a new Wuhan, recently said it had never called for a total national cull.That\u0027s part of the reason why Denmark\u0027s Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen came to Mr Hindbo’s farm a week ago on November 26.“And now, after all this, we hear that cluster five died out in September. So I really think it was the wrong decision. Maybe she realises that now, but it\u0027s difficult to turn it back.Mogens Jensen, the former agriculture minister, has resigned over the scandal, and Ms Frederiksen has faced calls to follow suit.After parliamentary talks over compensation for mink farmers broke down last month, there\u0027s still little sign of how much Mr Hindbo and his son can expect to get, with some now saying it might take five years to clear up. They want compensation not only for the minks, but for all the equipment, including an estimated 10m kroner\u0027s (£1.2m) worth of machinery.We hope they will say \u0027it\u0027s over for fur farming in Denmark\u0027, and then they have to pay everything: houses, cages, everything, Peter says.In a way, the Hindbos are lucky. At least they got to keep and sell the pelts, unlike farmers in parts of Jutland where minks are affected by coronavirus, who had their animals buried in mass graves.Buyers know that the pelts sold this year may be the last of this quality for decades, perhaps forever, according to Mr Hindbo.If he can sell all his 25,000 mi nk skins at a high price, he could be looking at a final payout of 7.5m kroner - close to a million pounds.Still, the money would not make the end of his farm any less painful.I will miss them very much,” he said. “I\u0027ve always loved this work.”Read more:  17 million mink culled \u0027illegally\u0027 - no wonder Denmark\u0027s fur industry is now \u0027officially dead\u0027More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"rapid tests could free us covid purgatory","story":"Once again, they’re up in arms. “Experts” are calling on the Government to rethink. The ambulance-chasing lawyers are readying a lawsuit. The Prime Minister is being cajoled over his wedding plans.This time, it’s the plan for rapid tests, or “lateral flow testing” in the jargon, that has people raging. In his Facebook Q\u0026ampA appearance this week, Boris Johnson made clear that the vaccine programme is only part of the plan for reopening society in the next few months.The other, he suggested, is the roll-out of quick-fire, mass testing, known as the “moonshot” programme. These speedy tests will, he hopes, enable some normality like weddings and conferences to return even before Easter, the informal deadline for vaccinating most vulnerable people. Given the worries already emerging about a vaccine supply crunch, having a backup plan makes sense.Yet something about this plan – perhaps it is the word “moon” – is driving people crazy. A few scientists have already gone nuclear, calling it “totally unsafe” or “really worrying”, and their views are being wrongly reported as a consensus. An outfit set up to sue the Government called the Good Law Project is attempting to get a judicial review going, even before there is anything to review.They are missing the point. The “moonshot” plan is about reducing transmission and risk, not eliminating it. It is not perfect, but it might be a damn sight better than the status quo.The main gripe about rapid Covid tests is that they are not as accurate or as sensitive as the gold-standard PCR tests. Whereas a PCR test will essentially pick up over 99 per cent of Covid cases in a batch, rapid tests have been known to miss six per cent even in a lab. Used in a school, the OxfordPublic Health England study found that they missed almost 17 per cent.The UK’s biggest trial so far in Liverpool suggests they perform even worse out in the field. As usual, the Government damaged its own cause by not being open about this. On Monday, it invited localities to apply for mass testing with a long page of information. Buried in an annex, it revealed that the Liverpool trial suggests the rapid tests may be missing 50 per cent of all positive cases. Cue rage and panic.It isn’t actually that bad, however. Firstly, the annex also stated that the tests are capturing 70 per cent of those with high viral loads – those likely to be the infectious ones. This is the relevant figure and is exactly the level of field performance one should expect from these sorts of tests, according to Ankur Mutreja, an infectious disease expert at Cambridge. Michael Mina, a Harvard epidemiologist agrees: “These are transmission detecting tests. They detect you when you’re high enough to transmit.” They might miss people carrying extremely low levels of coronavirus, but who cares?(As an aside, as someone who was given a PCR test to take in my car and, in retrospect, almost certainly did not shove the swab far enough down my throat, I wonder what their true field performance is.)Secondly, no one is suggesting that these tests replace PCR tests in high-risk situations. In hospitals, for example, it is essential to know if a healthcare worker or a patient has Covid. Likewise, if a person has symptoms, they are much more likely to have Covid and be infectious than if they are asymptomatic, so isolation and a PCR test are merited. Rapid tests are not a substitute here. They are an added extra, a screening tool for use in situations where it would never be economical or practical to do the full works.They do, after all, have two advantages over the PCR. They are much, much cheaper and much, much quicker. Whereas a PCR can cost $40 (£30) a go, a rapid test costs just $3-7. And whereas it usually takes at least a day to get a PCR result back, rapid tests give a result in 30 minutes. In fact, as a surveillance tool to find out what is going on across a population and isolate cases, their rapidity makes these tests far superior to the clunky process we use now. That’s because these tests are convenient enough that, as Dr Mutreja points out, “you’re reaching many times more people”.One study led by a team of scientists at Harvard and Colorado looked at exactly this question. If you imagine a particular population, whether it’s a school or a whole country, and decide to subject everyone to a testing regime to reduce transmission, there are three factors that really matter. The first is how well your test picks up a person’s infectiousness. The second is how often you test people. The third is how quickly you can get the test results back.On the first of these metrics, rapid tests perform nearly as well as PCRs and mainly miss people who aren’t actually infectious. On the second two metrics, a good rapid test wins hands down. It simply isn’t practical, from a cost, capacity and convenience point of view, to test whole populations every three days or every week unless you use rapid tests. And since the results come back while you wait, you can isolate infectious people immediately, rather than having asymptomatic spreaders going about their business.The overall point is that public health policy is about balancing priorities. Would it theoretically be better for virus control to roll out 100 per cent accurate tests to everyone all the time and have them all sit at home while they await the results? Sure, but the cost to society would be devastating.Rapid tests offer an alternative, a potential way to cut transmission by 70 per cent across a much wider swathe of the population than our current testing programme could ever manage.They do not eliminate risk entirely, which is why visitors to care homes must still be symptom-free, wear masks and wash their hands. Their chance of spreading the virus given all these precautions is far, far below one per cent.Why, then, are we making the perfect the enemy of the good? Why focus only on the risk of missing 30 per cent of cases who would probably never have been tested anyway, when we should be thinking about how to mitigate the devastating cost of lockdowns, pub closures, cancelled weddings, online-only universities and care home residents cut off from their families for months?It’s time we stopped focusing only on how to shut things down and thought about how to open them up. If rapid tests can help us achieve that faster, they are well worth a try.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"reporters moscows spies could have chosen did pretend","story":"The date was April 6, 2018, and I was sitting in The  newsroom furiously writing about Stilton cheese, Nectar cards, and the perennial inability of British holidaymakers to tip waiters.Back then I was the paper\u0027s consumer affairs editor, meaning I could have told you anything about the nation\u0027s shopping habits, or the latest changes to mortgages and pensions.But if you\u0027d asked me what I knew about the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, I\u0027d honestly have been stumped. Yet on that day, 19 emails from a private Gmail account appearing to belong to me landed in the inboxes of 19 of its officials.Greetings, the email read. Our team has carried out an independent investigation into the Salisbury spy poisoning case. We have interviewed one of the witnesses and ascertained previously unknown facts that may help this investigation.Before the materials are published, we would like to consult and discuss the option of cooperation with you. You can review the details of the case in the attachment below. Kind Regards, Katie Morley, The  Journalist.Now of course, many of my colleagues would have been legitimately working on the Skripal poisonings story in April 2018. It was an international scandal and a major front page news story at the time. But as you will have guessed by now, it was not me behind these emails.Somebody had decided to impersonate me. It would be two and a half years before I would learn that my identity had been stolen for a very sinister purpose, most likely by a Russian military intelligence officer and cyber criminal called Anatoliy Sergeyevich Kovalev (but we\u0027ll get to him later).On an otherwise unremarkable day last week I was midway down a Sainsbury\u0027s trolley ramp with my groceries when a call from the editor, Chris Evans, came out of the blue. Not in a month of Sundays could I have ever imagined what he was about to tell me.The GRU, the same Russian military intelligence service behind the Salisbury nerve agent attack, had stolen my identity, I was told, and used it to try to ascertain what the British Government knew about the attempt to kill the Skripals.Almost exactly a month prior to the emails being sent, the GRU had attempted to assassinate Sergei Skripal, a former colonel in the service who had acted as a double agent for MI6, and (after a spy swap with Moscow) had settled in the UK.On March 4, 2018, Skripal and his daughter Yulia collapsed in Salisbury, where he had made his home. They survived, but a member of the public, Dawn Sturgess, died after coming into contact with the poison, which had been discarded in a perfume bottle.The UK authorities launched a huge investigation, assisted by the OPCW, and the poison was quickly identified as Novichok, a Soviet-era nerve agent. The Kremlin was desperate to discover what the British counter-terrorism police and intelligence agencies knew about the attack and what evidence, if any, they had to show it was officially sanctioned by the Kremlin and carried out by the GRU.And that\u0027s where the bogus emails impersonating me came in. Quite honestly, knowing I have been used as a pawn in this monstrous crime has been difficult to digest. Since this newspaper was informed about the phoney emails, I have had assurances from UK intelligence services that my security has not been compromised.Obviously this has come as a relief. From what I can make out, the copycat attempt was rather basic and no in-depth checks were conducted into my background. For a start, the fake email address contained a middle name that was not mine, and it wouldn\u0027t be that difficult to find my real one on the internet, especially for someone who knew where to look.But I can\u0027t help wondering, of all the journalists the Russians could have picked to impersonate for this espionage mission, why on earth did they choose me? I\u0027m a consumer journalist who has never reported on international politics, home affairs or crime, and I have certainly never held any professional interest in Russian politics.Wouldn\u0027t it have been more convincing to impersonate a reporter with years of experience in this field? We have plenty to choose from at this newspaper who would have been emailing the OPCW for real at around that time. I am not among them.The answer may lie in the fact that I wasn\u0027t the only journalist the Russians impersonated in an attempt to trick officials at the OPCW. Helen Russell, whose usual subject matter is similarly irrelevant to the Skripal case, was also hand picked, despite being a highly unlikely candidate to be investigating the case.They sent the same email, claiming she was with The , though she has only ever written a few pieces for us. The one thing we do have in common, however, is that we are both women of a similar age with blue eyes and long blonde hair. In fact, we look strikingly similar.This has led to speculation that perhaps we were selected based not on our credentials, but our looks. I find it laughable to think I might have been part of a honey trap, but it appears to be a distinct possibility. Did the Russians think their targets would be more likely to respond and click on a link sent by a friendly looking young blonde?It is hard to say, but the thought sits uncomfortably, to say the least. It is believed that the man who selected us and sent the emails was Kovalev (below), who heads up a cyber gang unit within the Russian military. This team of prolific hackers has tried to infiltrate other UK agencies, including the Foreign Office, as well as the Olympic Games.The Russian government would have been desperate for information on what was known about the Skripal attack. It is thought that Vladimir Putin or his people ordered Kovalev\u0027s team to find out all they could.That\u0027s when Kovalev created an email account with a username mimicking a German national weekly newspaper, before bombarding Porton Down with 60 spear phishing emails, headed the Incident in Salisbury, claiming to be a journalist.The next day, he sent emails with malware attached that appeared to be from a legitimate email address. On this same day, April 5, 2018, Kovalev is thought to have also set up the Gmail accounts impersonating myself and the other journalist, to extract information from the OPCW.Recipients who clicked on the attachment included in the email might have unwittingly downloaded spying software on to their computer, resulting in a security breach. But thankfully, intelligence sources do not believe Kovalev and his team had any success penetrating the OPCW or Porton Down networks.For me, this certainly makes the incident easier to deal with and move on from.The year after it happened, I vacated my role of consumer affairs editor. Since then I have run the Katie Morley Investigates column, solving readers\u0027 money problems. I do hope this will be the first and last time I get caught up with the Russian government and its shenanigans.As extraordinary as this episode has been, I feel the Russians have taken up quite enough of my time. Now I want to get on with doing what I love most: helping readers of The  get their money back from companies they feel let down by.As it happens, I am presently staring at a pile of letters as high as my knees, so I suppose I\u0027d better get cracking.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"rspb recognise female founder new statue","story":"The RSPB is to finally recognise its most prominent female founder, who campaigned against feathers in hats, by funding a statue in her honour.The charity\u0027s story began when Emily Williamson invited a group of similarly-minded women to her house in Didsbury for tea in 1889, asking them to sign a pledge to no longer wear feathers in their hats.She called the group of women the Society for Protection of Birds, with all those involved incensed by the slaughter of wild birds because people wanted decorations for their millinery. Together with Eliza Phillips and Etta Lemon, who ran a similar group in Croydon, they formed what would become Britain\u0027s biggest conservation charity.Until now their history has not been widely championed by the society, which said all photographs and information about them was lost when archives were destroyed in the Blitz. However, new research by the writer Tessa Boase unearthed photographs, information and long-lost relatives of the pioneering ladies to highlight the role they played. She told The : Emily founded it because she was angry with the men who were doing nothing to take a stand against decimation of bird life. She wrote to the ornithology society and asked for them to take a stand against it and got no reply so, in a huff, she decided to found her own all-female group.Ms Boase said she believed the women have been ignored because they did not fit with the RSPB\u0027s image, adding: There are various reasons why the RSPB hasn\u0027t remembered them. They seem to embody everything the RSPB wanted to move away from – they were old, Christian and middle class and the RSPB wanted to be seen as pushing the science of ornithology and getting away from this single issue campaign.The charity is now giving £25,000 in seed funding to the campaign to erect a statue of the female founder in Didsbury after the writer unearthed pictures of the women. Once a design is chosen, the group behind the statue campaign will seek corporate funding and run crowdfunding campaigns. It will not require council approval because it will be erected on private land.Among the birds Williamson helped save are the great crested grebe, egrets, flamingo and spoonbills, all of which were targeted for their luxurious plumage.Beccy Speight, the chief executive of the RSPB, said: I am delighted that we will be able to honour Emily Williamson\u0027s legacy in this way and that we are able to take a moment to reflect on the history of our incredible organisation and the inspirational women who started it all.Williamson and her friends campaigned for only ostrich feathers to be used, as they were farmed and not killed for their plumes, as well as feathers that were a by-product of game shooting.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"teenage inventor named time magazines kid year","story":"A teenage scientist whose inventions include an app capable of detecting and discouraging cyberbullying has been named TIME magazine\u0027s first-ever kid of the year.The Colorado teenager\u0027s fascination with science began when an uncle gave her a chemistry set when she was only four or five years old.I am a very curious person, if that\u0027s one thing you need to know about me, she told TIME.

The ban prompted scenes of landlords pouring barrels of beer they will be unable to sell down the drain.Emma McClarkin, the chief executive of the BBPA said it was “ridiculous” and “unfair” that stringent tier restrictions had forced pubs to remain closed during their most profitable part of the year after the industry had invested £500 million to make their premises Covid secure. For those pubs that are reopening, some fear they could close again as soon as this week because they expect trade to be so low.The Treasury has promised a £1,000 grant to aid all ‘wet-led’ pubs, which generate most of their revenue from alcohol rather than food, during the tier period.However, earlier this week the Government descended into confusion over its own pub rules as ministers clashed over what constituted a ‘substantial meal’.On Monday, Michael Gove prompted a backlash when he contradicted the Environment Secretary George Eustice’s claim that a scotch egg would suffice.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster later backtracked and conceded the snack was sufficient to allow patrons to be served drinks.Yesterday, police were also accused of ‘overzealous’ enforcement of the rules, with reports of officers arguing with landlords over what qualified as a substantial meal and throwing customers out as soon as they had finished eating.Tim Martin, chairman of the Wetherspoon chain, lambasted the Government’s ‘draconian’ rules, which he said were ‘devastating’ the industry and creating confusion for staff and customers.He added: “Many (pub managers) report that sensible explanations are impossible because the rules are so contradictory and absurd.”Following the survey, a Government spokesman said: “We understand the pressure businesses are currently under, particularly pubs. These restrictions, which are reviewed on 16 December, are essential so we can control the virus, protect the NHS and save lives.“We have acted quickly to support businesses with one of the most extensive packages of financial support in the world worth £280 billion, including the extension of the furlough scheme, various loan schemes, a business rates holiday, VAT deferrals and grants of up to £3000 a month for those required to close.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"travel news restrictions corridors covid tests business travellers","story":"Visitors to Cyprus will not need to take a Covid test if they have been vaccinatedTravel quarantine to be cut from 14 days to 5 – all your questions answered ​The 23 countries you can (feasibly) visitHow to get a Covid test for your holidayCan I go on holiday?

I was six years old, watching it on TV and thinking “wow, that looks fun.” People partied against the backdrop of a graffiti-covered barrier, which was being demolished with hammers and picks. The wider geopolitics passed me by until I watched James Bond’s Octopussy, in which Berlin was the setting for Cold War intrigue.Unlike Europe’s other capital cities – such as Paris or Rome – Berlin does not feature in movies for its beauty: it’s a place where you meet people and things happen, rather than a place to gaze at. It’s more of a Detroit or a Manchester than a London or New York.The city really entered my consciousness when I moved to east London and began clubbing in the late-2000s. As London’s music star waned, more and more trendies moved to Berlin, or headed there at weekends for its experimental counterculture.The legacy of the Cold War has dominated much of my recent work, and I’ve travelled everywhere from Kirkenes to Chisinau so it’s remarkable that I’ve not yet made it to Berlin’s Checkpoint Charlie. When I finally walk the route of the Wall, I will reward myself with punk music and Berliner Weisse then a wild swim in the lakes to batter through the hangover.Read the full article But since my wife and I decided to stay grounded, our trips have become more adventurous. Like last year’s cycle trip up the Dutch coast.

But the criteria for ‘high value’ still means that many business travellers, who are vital for the successful operation of their company, will still need to quarantine.

Put simply, Ryanair became a carrier that even the most ardent full-service devotees would struggle not to have a grudging respect for.One judge added: They revolutionised air travel within Europe. They revolutionised the market, they revolutionised and impacted on what the legacy carriers were doing, they revolutionised passenger expectations… and passengers flock back to them time and time again.Hipolito Lima has dedicated a third of his life to protecting sea turtles on the West African island of Sao Tome, writes Sarah Marshall.It’s a process that never gets easier for the tireless 70-year-old, who’s dedicated almost a third of his life to protecting the marine creatures.

Travel, has called the Government\u0027s priorities in question, point out that a quarantine exemption for business travellers sidesteps the more pressing issue of opening up international travel for all. Ordinary travellers will have to pay upwards of £100 per person to access a private test, if they can find any availability, and even then will still have to quarantine for a minimum of five days. The Government should instead be putting together a plan that gets international travel up and running for everybody who needs it, not just a select few.The Deputy First Minister of Scotland, John Swinney, has confirmed that there will be no new exemptions for travellers arriving in the country, despite the change in rules for business travellers, elite athletes and journalists travelling to England.Speaking at the Scottish government\u0027s daily coronavirus briefing, Mr Swinney said: As you may be aware the UK Government announced last night a number of changes to the quarantine rules in England. Those changes exempt certain categories of people, working in certain sectors, from the requirement to self-isolate.I want to emphasise these are changes that apply only in England, and that they do not apply here in Scotland. The quarantine requirements in this country are unchanged.After a year of cancelled holidays, grounded planes and dissolved travel companies, help is finally on the way for the travel industry, writes Greg Dickinson.The vaccine is seen as the thing that will give the travel industry, and our holidays, the shot in the arm we have all been waiting for. Indeed just this week, Cyprus has emerged as the first country to announce a plan that will allow holidaymakers to enter the country without the need to quarantine, so long as they can prove they have been vaccinated.We do not yet know the precise mechanics of how a vaccine will open up the world on a wider scale – but the likelihood is that some kind of internationally recognised vaccine certification will be developed as more countries roll out vaccination programmes, and new travel corridors will emerge as cases numbers go down.So for the first time since the pandemic began, we can look ahead to a time when we will be able to pack our bags and jet off to exotic places, without the uncertainties and stresses that have dogged our getaways in 2020.So when, exactly, will our holidays get back to normal? 10 travel experts have their sayThere are high hopes that the vaccine will open up the world to holidaymakersNow known worldwide as the place where the first cases of Covid-19 were recorded, Wuhan has launched a new media campaign in an effort to woo visitors. It has been more than six months since the city last reported a new coronvirus infection.While the quarantine exemption for business travel is welcome, the Transport Secretary must go further and open up travel for those representing smaller firms, says Abby Penston, who is CEO of Focus Travel Partnership, a business travel consortium for the small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) sector.  Unfortunately the new rule does not include those in middle management or even those representing small businesses, which fuel this economy and will be key to unlocking recovery.Aviation chiefs are rallying around the hot-button issue of airport testing, citing concerns that proposed vaccine-to-travel requirements will condemn their industry.The Airports Council International, a global trade organisation representing airports around the world, has stated that mandatory inoculation could be as damaging for aviation firms as quarantine, with people prevented from travelling until the vaccine becomes widely available.“Just as quarantine effectively halted the industry, a universal requirement for vaccines could do the same,” ACI World Director General Luis Felipe de Oliveira told Reuters. “While we welcome the rapid development and deployment of vaccines, there will be a considerable period before they are widely available.“The industry cannot wait till vaccination becomes available worldwide. During the transition period, tests and vaccines together will play a key role on the industry recovery.”It comes after the chief executive of Qantas, Alan Joyce, announced last week that passengers will be required to show proof that they have taken a Covid-19 vaccine before boarding.To celebrate the festive season, we\u0027re offering the chance to win a £200 holiday voucher every day until Christmas  in our Travel Advent Calendar competition.How much do you know about South Africa?Answer three questions about South Africa for your chance to winHere are the entry requirements for key business hubs in East Asia, according to the Foreign Office. Even with the new quarantine exemption granted to business travellers, athletes and journalists, they must still contend with strict rules elsewhere.Travellers arriving in Hong Kong on flights from overseas countriesterritories, who are not Hong Kong residents, will be denied entry to Hong Kong. All travellers entering Hong Kong, including Hong Kong residents, will have to take a mandatory medical test for coronavirus on arrival and need to undergo 14-day compulsory quarantine. Arrivals may be placed in a Hong Kong government quarantine centre.Apart from Singapore citizens and Singapore Permanent Residents who have been granted permission to enter Singapore from the UK (and from most other countries), must obtain a negative Covid-19 test (PCR test) within 72 hours of travel. You will be issued with a 14 day Stay at Home Notice (SHN) for mandatory quarantine upon arrival.Non-Japanese nationals wishing to visit for short-term business purposes are also permitted to enter, provided that they have a visa. However, the number of people permitted to enter Japan under these rules will be restricted, with priority given to those moving to Japan.Non-Japanese nationals arriving will need to provide written evidence of a negative Covid-19 test result conducted within 72 hours of their flight departure time if they have visited the UK in the last 14 days. You will also need to provide written assurance from your company or sponsor that quarantine measures will be followed upon arrival.All passengers arriving in Japan are required to self-isolate for 14 days on arrival at a designated location (such as a hotel or your own home) and to avoid using public transport, including on leaving the airport.All foreign short-term travellers must quarantine at a government-designated facility for 14 days on arrival. Arrivals from the USA and Europe will be tested on entry before transferring to the quarantine facility arrivals from elsewhere will move to the quarantine facility and be tested within 14 days. Iniduals are required to pay a daily charge of around 100,000KRW (approximately £66) while in government quarantine facilities.John Grant from aviation analyst OAG has cast doubts on the Government\u0027s decision to waive quarantine requirements for business travellers, saying: If this move was designed to place pressure on other countries to reciprocate or change their entry requirements then it is unlikely to work.The Prime Minister of Japan has defended a controversial domestic travel campaign against attacks by medical experts, who claim it has fuelled a third wave of coronavirus infections.At a press conference earlier today, Yoshihide Suga double down on the decision to extend the Go To Travel campaign, which offers subsidies to promote domestic holidays and boost the national economy. But critics say that encouraging citizens to move around the country has helped spread Covid-19, with the daily count of confirmed new cases climbing above 2,000 for the first time last week.Mr Suga stated the decision was made to help the struggling hospitality sector, adding “the government moved to promote the domestic travel campaign, seeing that they would not be able to continue their businesses as things were.”He also pointed out that the campaign has been suspended in two Covid hotspots – Sapporo and Osaka.“G’day, how’s it going?

Service, whether it’s a perfect, barista-crafted flat white or an ice-cold beer served up in a refrigerated glass, moisture beading its sides, is with a smile. People work to live, rather than live to work, clocking off at 5pm to catch a wave before the day ends. Ask someone to do something for you and you’ll be met with “ah no worries, too easy!” rather than a barely concealed eye roll and an audible ‘humph.’Australians are known for their relaxed and sunny disposition, but it\u0026#39s a facadeWhich is why it comes as something of a surprise to many when an Australian gets into a flap.

You have to wear a mask in the city centre (even outside) but virtually everything here is open. Not bad going for one of the most densely populated places in the world.Although I learnt about Gibraltar back in school, and was intrigued by its rich history, I didn’t get around to going there until a couple of years ago. I didn’t realise what I’d been missing. Gibraltar is a world away from the old colonial stereotype. The Gibraltarians are British to the bone, and English is the lingua franca, but the people are an exotic mix of British, Spanish, Italian, Maltese and Portuguese. Most of them are Roman Catholic, but there are also thriving Anglican, Jewish, Muslim and Hindu communities. A contemporary commercial centre with an antique core, it’s a bustling multicultural place.Read the full articleGibraltar is a world away from the old colonial stereotypeHolidays may never return to the way they once were, but airport testing is the surest way to kickstart travel while we wait for a widely available vaccine, says Ali Shah, CEO of online travel agent TravelUp.  However, a lot now hinges on how effectively the vaccine is rolled out in the UK and also on vaccines being approved across the EU and in other territories, particularly the USA. The quicker we can negotiate travel corridors with other countries who have vaccine programs in place the better. In the meantime what we need is cheap and effective testing widely available at airports. This is vital because it is going to realistically take months for vaccines to reach the majority of the population. Testing can reduce and hopefully remove the need for quarantine and restore confidence among travellers. The new Test to Release scheme to cut quarantine in England to five days is a great first step but we need to go further. We need quarantine-free travel bubbles between major cities. I do not think we will see a total return to how things were pre-Covid for a long time, and possibly never. People are going to be much more mindful about health and hygiene. It is not comfortable to wear a mask on a long-haul flight so quick and accurate testing is the way forward in the long term.The US and Canada contain some of the UK\u0027s most important trading partners, and therefore rank among the most-visited destinations for British business people prior to 2020.But with strict border controls still in place in North America, can the UK\u0027s new quarantine exemption have much of an impact? Here\u0027s a quick overview of the entry requirements for business travellers heading West, according to the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office:British nationals cannot enter the USA and its territories if they have been in the UK, Ireland, Schengen zone, Iran, Brazil or China within the previous 14 days.If you are eligible to enter the USA you must be prepared to self-isolate for up to 14 days after arrival.The Canadian authorities are barring entry to Canada, including at its border with the US, to most foreign nationals, including British nationals. This exclusion does not apply to temporary foreign workers, most international students, Canadian citizens and permanent residents or their immediate and extended families provided they remain in Canada for 15 days or more. Anyone arriving in Canada must self-quarantine for 14 days, and have a credible self-isolation plan.Almost nine months after the coronavirus pandemic brought the global cruise industry to a standstill, Royal Caribbean has returned to the water, reports Kaye Holland.Royal Caribbean’s Quantum of the Seas departed Singapore on December 1 in the first of its series of short ‘Ocean Getaways’ – also known as ‘cruises to nowhere’. As the latter name suggests, these are voyages that start and end at the same destination, without calling at any ports.The 4,180-passenger ship set sail at a reduced capacity of 30 per cent as part of the precautions put in place due to the pandemic, with the cruise only open to Singapore residents.Quantum of the Seas is only carrying a third of its capacity during its restartPassengers onboard Royal Caribbean’s first vessel to resume sailing during the time of Covid-19 were required to take a Covid-19 test 48 to 72 hours before boarding, and to be able to prove a negative result.The cruise giant is covering the cost of tests for sailings departing on or before January 30, 2021, and this may be extended depending on the Covid-19 situation.Read the full storyAlongside business travellers, the Government has given the green light to \u0027elite sportspersons\u0027 to skip quarantine if they are travelling from a high-risk country. Well, almost. Those participating in \u0027elite\u0027 sporting events, alongside support staff, will be allowed to leave self-isolation to attend the venues in which they are either training or competing. Otherwise, they must stay in quarantine.According to the Department for Transport: you need to show written evidence from a United Kingdom or English national governing body for your sport of your status as an international elite sportsperson or essential support staff attending the specified event.The news that a Covid-19 vaccine will soon be rolled out across the UK has prompted a surge in holiday bookings for 2021, says luxury tour operator Scott Dunn.The company has confirmed the November was its strongest trading month since February, marking a high point for the business since the pandemic was declared back in March.Families are proving the most eager to get away next year, followed by multi-generational groups, with Christmas, February half-term and Easter the most in-demand travel periods.The Seychelles is among the most popular holiday destinations for 2021The most popular destinations largely – although not entirely – revolve around the travel corridor list, with the Males, Seychelles and Caribbean all high on customers\u0027 wishlists.Several countries yet to receive air bridges with the UK, including South Africa, Kenya and the USA, are all seeing a surge in interest from mid-2021 onwards.In a year of insignificant weekends, Thursday has become the travel industry’s new favourite day of the week, says Simon Parker. And when 1700 rolls around, we refresh our Twitter feeds, over and over and again, until travel flirt Grant Shapps makes our brains go giddy with words ending –land, –ia and –ica. But those of us expecting a bumper edition of travel bingo this week were left jilted, deflated and puzzled by 1705. “There will be no new countries added this week,” he announced. At least, getting all his spelling in order this time, and going easy on his favoured Caps Lock. He could have given us some real “corridors” to trot down, rather than those previous black holes of disappointment. Instead, this announcement – that wasn’t really an announcement – felt more like a kick in the teeth than a boost in the arm. \u0026#34The shoulders of British travellers, tour operators and airlines sunk last night\u0026#34 Read the full articlePaul Charles, CEO of travel consultancy The PC Agency, who has been campaigning for quarantine changes, said: Business confidence is as shattered as it can be right now – while the ending of quarantine for some will help, it’s important now for governments to focus on rolling out the vaccines quickly, giving them reason to end quarantine for all and open up their economies faster.A few eyebrows were raised yesterday at the curiously non-specific term \u0027high-value\u0027, although the Deparment of Transport has since clarified who benefits from the new quarantine exemption:Top executives at foreign firms who are visiting business branches based in EnglandUK executives returning from business deals abroad which will create of preserve at least 50 jobs, or lead to £100,000 in investment or ordersFlybe could take to the skies soon, with its new owner having now applied for a operating licence.Thyme Opco, which bought the failed airline in October, has put in its application with the Civil Aviation Authority, which could see domestic services resume in the UK.Flybe was previously the largest independent regional airline in Europe, but was forced to file for administration back in March.Its stock, equipment and brand were acquired by Thyme Opco, which now plans to relaunch the airline in 2021.Flybe filed for administration in March 2020While the Government will waive quarantine rules for business travellers in the hope of boosting a vital part of the economy, restrictions in other countries could prove a significant sticking point.These are the top 10 business travel destinations from the UK based on spending (data supplied by Statistica):Republic of IrelandOf these, only the UAE and India are both open to UK travellers and quarantine-free.There have been growing calls for the Government to open up business travel for some months now, with industry experts throwing a  spotlight on the billions of pounds it contributes to the UK economy each year.Tracey Edginton, Head of Press at Visit Britain, has posted a helpful summary:Heathrow is planning to charge drivers £5 to drop off loved ones from next year in what they claim is part of a “green initiative,” writes Oliver Gill.Airport bosses claim the new charge will encourage travellers to use public transport and help it reach its sustainability goals. In a move that threatens to enrage legions of travellers as Britain re-emerges from the pandemic, the airport is set to impose a “Forecourt Access Charge”.Heathrow said the charge would protect the business financially after racking up £1.5 billion of losses in 2020, while preventing a “car led airport recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic” Manchester, Stansted and Birmingham airports already charge drivers from drop-offs. Gatwick has announced plans to introduce a tariff in the future.Read the full storyThe vast majority of people are being discouraged from booking holidays by the complex and often conflicting Covid rules that now govern international travel.Skyscanner\u0027s global marketing, brand and content senior director Jo McClintock said: “People want to travel and we know there is pent-up demand from the searches we are seeing for flights and for more information, but confidence has been hit by the lack of consistency between countries worldwide regarding measures and restrictions. “Consumers just do not understand the complex rules and are crying out for transparent, detailed information.”As might be expected, the business travel industry has welcomed the move to open up travel for some workers, although Clive Wratten, CEO of The Business Travel Association (BTA) has urged ministers to extend quarantine exemption to other sectors. However, business travel takes many forms and all should be exempt. Engineers, humanitarian workers, retail buyers and many other professionals travelling for work are all crucial to the UK economy.Here\u0027s yesterday evening\u0027s travel update from Grant Shapps, confirming the groups who will be exempt from quarantine restrictions from tomorrow:Before we start, here are yesterday\u0027s top travel stories:Business travellers, along with a clutch of other professions, will be exempt from quarantine after December 5No new travel corridors, howeverTravel to Wales from Tier 1 and Tier 2 areas of England and Scotland is permitted againDespite a vaccine, industry insiders fear travel will not return to normal until 2022Matt Hancock\u0026#39s \u0026#39step-grandfather\u0026#39 who died of Covid-19 was his step-father\u0026#39s ex-wife\u0026#39s second husbandCaving to Brussels on fish and level playing field risks leaving UK a \u0026#39permanent client state\u0026#39, Boris Johnson warnedBoots runs out of Covid tests in six cities as public rushes to get swabbed before ChristmasGovernment sets up secret \u0026#39green nudge unit\u0026#39 to persuade Britons to  install smart meters, drive less and cut down on meat Three quarters of pubs not reopening due to tier restrictions, poll findsComment: I love the EU but I\u0026#39ll vote for Boris\u0026#39s Brexit deal and so should the rest of the Labour PartyOld Etonians accused of launching smear campaign against Head MasterLabour will be \u0026#39putting two fingers up\u0026#39 to voters if it fails to back Brexit deal, Sir Keir Starmer warnedBrexit deal: what has been agreed, and what happens next?Gynaecologist struck off after filming sex with camera hidden in his glasses, tribunal hearsComment: How the \u0026#34moonshot\u0026#34 rapid testing plan could free us from Covid purgatory even before a vaccine Exclusive: Rail passengers set to ignore five-day Christmas window amid overcrowding fearsExclusive: Tory rebels plot to block new homes on climate grounds in planning algorithm rowLeading charity facing legal action over claims of anti-Christian discriminationCovid vaccine will have \u0026#39marginal impact\u0026#39 in next three months, chief medical officers warnUS House of Representatives votes to decriminalise cannabis, hurdles remainEmmanuel Macron would rather see Brexit talks founder than agree to a bad deal, sources sayLiverpool Mayor Joe Anderson arrested in bribery investigationCovid vaccinations in Wales and Northern Ireland to begin on TuesdayBrexit Negotiations: the sticking points explainedRSPB to recognise female founder with new statueBack to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"worlds first sea roundabout open faroe islands","story":"When driving between the Faroese islands of Eysturoy and Stremoy, heavy traffic is rarely a consideration.But commuters can rest assured that even at the height of rush hour their journeys will be smooth thanks to the world\u0027s first undersea roundabout.The sub-sea traffic circle sits inside a new 11km tunnel that is set to dramatically reduce journey times between the capital Tórshavn and the key fishing port of Klaksvik. The Eysturoyartunnelin, as the Faroe Islands’ largest ever infrastructure project is known, is budgeted at just over 1 billion Danish Kroner (approx £120million) which works out at around £25,000 per islander. The costs will be recouped by a toll of just under £10 per car. The roundabout gives drivers the option of surfacing at two separate points on the island of Eysturoy. The tunnel will be 189 metres below the Atlantic, and final safety tests and fire drills will be carried out next week.Currently, road journeys between Tórshavn and Klaksvik take around 70 minutes via a bridge between the two islands further north, but this will be cut to under forty minutes. Foreign tourism and a rising population have seen Faroes develop significantly in the last decade with the island’s own airline Atlantic Airways expanding rapidly internationally.The new sub-sea tunnel is likely to be something of a tourist attraction in its own right, and the prominent local artist Tróndur Patursson has created an eighty metre long steel sculpture for the roundabout.Representing interlinking human figures it represents the unique Faroese ‘ring dance’ where unlimited numbers of people join hands and keep time with simple side to side steps to a traditional ballad.The tunnel marks the precise geographical centre of the Faroes’ archipelago of 18 inhabited islands halfway between Shetland and Iceland. NCC has already started drilling on another tunnel of similar length linking Streymoy with the small island of Sandoy – population 1,200. One aim of the sub-sea tunnels is to prevent the depopulation of smaller villages. It is hoped that reliable road links will reduce dependency on inter-island ferries which are frequently disrupted by Faroes’ extreme winter weather.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus tiers map england restrictions rules","story":"Article bookmarkedFind your bookmarks in your Independent Premium section, under my profileDon\u0026#x27t show me this message again✕Most of the country will be under tougher rules than before the lockdown after government scientists warned previous measures were not effective enough to stem rising Covid-19 infections.The Department for Health published details of which tiers areas would be in on Thursday as Matt Hancock outlined the plans in the Commons.Only a handful of areas have been placed in tier 1, where the restrictions are the most limited.

This and the other vaccines are a huge step forward in the fight against coronavirus and could save tens of thousands of lives. So is the vaccine safe  Who’ll get it first  And will it mean ato normal le  Our  of medical experts - made up of Deputy chief medical officer Professor Jonathan Van-Tam, Chief Executive of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency Dr June Raine CBE and Head of Immunisations at Public Health England Dr Mary Ramsay - are here to answer all your questions...  Q. Vaccines usually take years to develop, so how can the Covid- vaccination be safeit’s ready in months  Professor Van-Tam: These vaccines have been through phase one, phase two and phase three, just like ordinary vaccines. With the Pfizer vaccine, I think the total clinical trial size is something like , the AstraZeneca results so far reported are based on just over , volunteers – there’s at least another , to follow, and the number size for Moderna is very similar. These are very, very big studies. The numbers involved were essentially the same as you’d expect for a normal peacetime vaccine, and on top of that the safety assessments and the assessments of effectiveness at the end are the same. Dr Raine: The public can be completely confident that Covid- vaccines will only be available once they have met robust standards of safety, quality and effectiveness. As Covid- is a public health emergency, scientic evaluation and approval is being done in the shortest time possible while complying with established and robust safety, quality and effectiveness standards. Extensive knowledge on vaccine development with existing vaccines is applied. Safety is our watchword. Everyone can be absolutely clear that the standards that need to be met, will be met. I am completely confident that there has been no pressure whatsoever on the agency and our expert staff to pass the vaccine. None at all. Q. How have you decided who gets the vaccine first  Dr Ramsay: We looked at a lot of data showing who was getting infection and who was dying from infection. The primary thing the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisationlooked at was death rates by age, by clinical factors, and by any other factors that GPs could measure, such as deprivation, geography or ethnicity. It’s very clear the death rate is much higher as you get older, particularly over . That’s why we’re prioritising people in older age groups, then coming down in age, picking up people who are clinically vulnerable and those who have underlying conditions along the way. Those working in health and social care will be high on the list as well – they are at risk because they’re getting exposed to infection every day and they may be spreading it to others. The same goes for care home workers – they’re a very high priority.  Q. Will the vaccine prevent disease or just reduce symptoms   Professor Van-Tam: If you’re going to prevent transmission you need a vaccine that is taking out the illness and also the asymptomatic infections. There are some signs from AstraZeneca that this might be the case. That does not mean the other vaccines where results have already been announced or that are or are still in development, don’t also reduce transmission it’s just we don’t know at this point in time. We hope they will because they’ll have a bigger effectthey can take out transmission. Q. Are there any side effects  Dr Ramsay: All the side effects are predictable – the kind of thing you get with other vaccines: a sore arm, bit of a temperature or feeling a bit fatigued, so we’re expecting it to have a similar safety profile to other vaccines. Professor Van-Tam: Every single vaccine authorised for use in the UK has been authorised by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency . The three components of authorisation are a safety assessment, an effectiveness assessment and a manufacturing quality assessment – all three need to be ticked before anything is authorised. But there is not a single medicine without side effects. Is it possible that rare side effects could come to light that you’d never pick up in a clinical trial of ,-, patients  Yes, it is – but that’s no dferent from any other medicine.  Q. How will the vaccine be rolled out  Dr Ramsay: The actual act of giving the injection isn’t particularly skillful – all nurses are trained and most vaccines are given by nurses, but with the flu jab we use health care assistants. The key thing is they work under the supervision of nurses. I think there’s going to be a lot of dferent models used because, for example, with elderly, frail people they’re clearly not going to drive to the nearest centre – you might have to take vaccine to them in their home. The hospitals will probably be doing their staff, then there will potentially be these vaccination sites which will probably be more important for the slightly younger population who can drive there. Q. Is there anyone who shouldn’t have it   Dr Ramsay: A reason to defer a vaccination is being pregnant – that’s just being precautionary. We don’t expect there to be a problem, but without having the vaccine tested on pregnant women we’ll probably recommend they wait until after they’ve had the baby. Similarly, it hasn’t been tested in children, although a teenager would probably respond similarly to a young adult so they could likely have the vaccine. Q. Will it be available privately  Professor Van-Tam: I don’t know, but I think it would be a bad thing for public healththe rich and privileged were able to pay their way to the front of the queue, leaving someone at very high risk and not wealthy low down the list – and they would be there’s going to be a global shortage of these vaccines. So I’m opposed to that. Q.

Research shows unemployment is a third higher in “aviation communities” compared with regional averages. The jobless claimant counts in constituencies which include the UKaposs five biggest airports – Heathrow, Gatwick, Manchester, Luton and Stansted – have rocketed by an average % since March compared with surrounding areas. Air travel ground to halt in March as the pandemic swept the planet. The industry has struggled to recover amid tight restrictions on international movement. Shadow Employment Minister Seema Malhotra said: “Aviation is far more than airports and airlines the sector supports communities theand breadth of the country.  “We are in the midst of a jobs crisis, with aviation communities hit hard and facing rising levels of unemployment. “The Government must act now to deliver an aviation sector deal that responds to the specic needs of aviation businesses and their supply chains. “Not acting now will be devastating for our recovery and future growth.” According to the Commons Library figures, the unemployment claimant toll in Hayes and Harlington, West London, which includes Britainaposs busiest airport, Heathrow, climbed from , in March to , in October – a % surge . In London as a whole, the rise was %.A Heathrow spokeswoman said : “These figures demonstrate the devastating impacts Covid- has inflicted on communities that are reliant on their local airport for jobs and livelihoods.

The Unite union backed Labour calls for an “aviation sectoral deal”.National officer for civil air transport Oliver Richardson said: “The failure of the Government to provide a comprehensive package of aviation sector specic support is a major contributory factor to these huge numbers of job losses, both in aviation itself and in the connected communities and supply chains. “Sector specic support from the outset would not only have saved many of the jobs lost but would also have protected the skilled, experienced staff needed to rebuild, and been more cost effective to the Treasury than paying out benefits. “If the Government had acted earlier, then far fewer families would have found themselves facing a bleak Christmas this year.” Airlines UK chief executive Tim Alderslade said: “The industry has lost tens of thousands of jobs and unless we can comprehensively open up aviation many more will be lost once the furlough scheme comes to an end. “The Government has made a good start with its test and release scheme but we see that very much as stage one of the process of removing quarantine, which is the real inhibitor to passenger demand.

The retail goliath, criticised over its track record on paying corporation tax in the UK, has been one of the big winners during the lockdown. Business has boomed as many high street shops have been forced to close.Chancellor Rishi Sunak gave many businesses a year-long holiday from paying business rates to help them survive the crisis.The move did not benefit Amazon’s network of depots and warehouses. However, the tax break does apply to Amazon-owned upmarket supermarket chain Whole Foods Market, which specialises in organic and natural food. Rates experts Altus Group says Whole Foods was entitled to just over £million in relief this financial year on its seven shops in London. They include a large store on Kensington High Street which. according to Altus, is entitled to more than £million of relief. Labour MP Dame Margaret Hodge said: “Amazon’s record on paying tax on the money its makes in Britain is abysmal. “They have made a mint out of the pandemic and the idea that a company has the gall to take further in grants in the form of rate relief is unconscionable and shocking.

Pictures released by Chinaaposs National Space Administration show the flag, which was specially-designed to survive on the lunar surface. It was placed there by the unmanned Changapose- space probe, which was last night ing to Earth after collecting rock samples. Experts hope the mission will help shed light on how the Moon has evolved, and where water sources came from. The solar-powered probe spent  hours on the surface, picking up samples which will be examined by scientists - the first time this has happened since a Soviet spacecraft brought back rocks in the s. Although China has previously sent two missions to the Moon, it has never left a permanent flag on the surface. Until this week the US was the only country to have done so. Project leader Cheng Chang told Chinese state media that the flag had to be adapted to survive cold temperatures. An ordinary national flag on Earth would not survive the severe lunar environment, project developer Cheng stated.

Unread newspapers from  lie around covered in dust and the walls of each room have paper peeling away with age. One picture shows a deserted childrenaposs playroom with an elegant rocking horse poignantly standing alone and untouched. All the furniture is typical of post-war era fashions, such as carpets with a rose floral pattern, and the ceiling-to-floor duck egg blue curtains. The farmhouse, built in the s by architect Thomas Thornton, lies on the outskirts of Fleetwood, Lancs. It is believed to have been left deserted after a family feud between two brothers who were banned from the property by other relatives after their mother, Mary Cowell, died.Urban explorer Dean Slader, who went inside, said: Iaposve been all over the UK with my photography.  Once inside the property, there were many possessions including vintage childrenaposs toys including a rocking horse and vintage pram.

Teah Vincent, , spoke to the Sun and revealed how she feels embarrassed by the case, feels it has wrecked her le and led to her being targeted online. She earlier took to Facebook as a jury found she had not known the child was underage, the Daily Record reported. She also posted a picture of her outside court celebrating the not guilty verdict, according to the Sun. Her post no longer appears on Facebook. The mum argued that she believed the child was over  when she initiated the sexual encounter with him. She told the Sun today: This has wrecked my le. “It’s also wrecked any chance I would have had of a career. I’m too embarrassed now to do anything. “I feel hot-headed and emotional. I just want to put all my energy now into my children and look after them. Writing on Facebook, she said: Not guilty. Thank you everyone that stood behind me and believed me. Itaposs been the hardest two years off [sic] my le. Wellcome [sic]  for me and my kids. But the mum also told today how the not guilty verdict has not stopped her being abused on social media. She referred to the abuse as being extreme and causing her hurt. She believes the abuse is wrong, and accusations that she is a bad mum are particularly hard to take as her children mean the world to her. Strangers are firing accusations at her on Facebook, she claims - and says she wishes people would respect the juryaposs decision to acquit her. Vincent expressed a desire to rebuild and get on with her le now the case is over. Over the four-day trial at Gloucester Crown Court, the mum-of-three admitted to initiating sex with the teenager at her home in Woolaston, Gloucestershire but told she believed he was over .  The court heard that the boy and another -year-old were playing football near her home on October st , when she invited them in for a soft drink. She then allegedly took one of the boys upstairs to her bedroom, stripped naked and pulled him down onto her bed where she straddled him and had sex. The jury of eight men and four women found Vincent not guilty of knowingly having sex with an under-age boy, leading to Judge Ian Lawrie QC discharging her. The verdict came after late evidence emerged in the trial on Wednesday about the  date of birth the boy had given on his Facebook profile. The youth was recalled to the witness box and explained that he had entered the  date of birth after being given a new phone for his th birthday.  Pressed about what age he told Ms Vincent he was he said: I definitely did not tell her I was  going on . During her evidence to the jury yesterday Ms Vincent said Iaposm sure he told me he was  and I felt he looked much older. It didnapost occur to me that he might be underage He definitely didnapost tell me he was in Year , or that he was only , before we had sex. Defence barrister Catherine Flint, in her final speech to the jury before they retired to consider their verdict, said: Can you be sure he told her she was  before they had sex or had he lied about his age  "},{"url":null,"title":"pub goers slam crazy tiers","story":"NewsPub goers slam \"crazy\" tiers as one boozer stays open while another m away shutsA driveway separates Joe Joe Jims and The Old Hare and Hounds but it also acts as a boundary line which means they are in dferent counties so under dferent restrictionsmirrorShareCommentsByLorraine King:,  DEC Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror incoming video england-enters-three-tier-system-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

Sahra Mahammed, , is facing eviction along with her five children, from their new BB home after being prohibited from having access to the property during the day. The family, including four-year-old Karim who has autism and Bashara, , who has tuberculosis,have been searching for a home in Hull since . Sahra says Hull City Council have moved the single mother and her kids from one place to another for over  years. The stress of the upheaval is something that Sahra believes is the reason for her miscarriage. Most recently, Sahra and her family were moved to temporary accommodation at Donnington Court hostel in Derby Street. However, she claims they have been told they must now move to a BB which have told the family they must leave the premises after an early breakfast and notuntil pm. She claims the previous stress put on her caused her to have a miscarriage and last week she fainted under the pressures of having to move again. Sahra said: I asked the BB where my family and I will go. It’s winter and extremely cold, I have an autistic child, where am I supposed to go all day with my kids  I already feel like the health conditions of my children are worsening. “I was working part-time but these days I can’t be due to the situation. The acute stress is unmanageable, I fainted when in Donnington court, my kids thought I was dying.” “The tiny three bedroom flat that all five of us have to share is smelly. The staff haven’t let me throw my rubbish out which has made the flat stink, they forced me to store it in the kitchen for  days, it has the kidsapos nappies in it. On her experience in the hostel, she said that many of the lights don’t work which has led to the family having to use a torch most of the time. There is no television, and the kids have no toys available despite paying £ per month for utility bills, something that greatly cuts into Sahra’s monthly benefits of £.  She went on to say that: A social worker was called by the hostel who accused me of having severe mental health issues, and that my kids should be taken away from me. I have now been toldI don’t find a house before a certain date, I will have my kids taken away from me, I have been on the housing list since  and there are no houses available. “My autistic son is screaming all the time, he needs a bigger place to play and relax. The people at the hostel won’t even let his father visit him.” After reporting the conditions at Donnington Court to Hull City Council, she has been told that she must leave on Monday. She will then get a taxi to the BB but has no idea what will happen to her and her family over the Christmas period. Explaining one of the other Hull properties she was given, she said: “It was a house where I had to pay double in bills because of the damp.

The Strictly presenter has struggled to sleep and is worried about how her hubby is coping with the cold and lack of food. Speaking to Lorraine earlier this week, she said: Oh my goodness, it feels like he has been away forever.

She found an L-shaped five-seater sofa complete with ottoman online for an incredible price of £, saying she hoped it would be big enough for herself, her fiancé Joseph, and the five children to squeeze onto for the time being. After patiently waiting  weeks for it to be delivered by Wayfair, Pinky became a little concerned when Jospeh told her the package that had arrived look a lot smaller than he expected. My fiancé was in when it arrived and he said it seemed small, but I thought maybe it needed to be assembled to make shipping easier, she said. But it wasnapost until they unboxed it that Pinky discovered she had accidentally ordered a sofa for toddlers, which was just  inches tall - and posed for hilarious photos on the furniture she hoped would fit all seven of them. I had to laugh, itaposs literally a baby sofa, said the -year-old property manager from Florida. I would never have dreamed I was buying it for a child. I thought it was going to be an actual sofa, big enough for my living room. It didnapost say anywhere that it was for a child and it was listed in the living room section on the website. It said it seats five so I thought at least the five kids would be able to squeeze on it and me and my fiancé could sit on the beanbags for now. I was looking forward to it arriving because we donapost have any furniture and I waited ten weeks for delivery. Itaposs annoying because now I have no furniture in my living room but Iaposve had a sad childhood and Iaposve been homeless. Iaposve been able to buy my own house now so Iaposve been given too many lemons to complain, I just found it hilarious.

Chocolate lovers have had been forced to tuck into a Bounty bar for the fourth day in a row - and theyaposre furious, reports Daily Star. For the last two years, the popular Celebrations calendar has caused uproar for putting the controversial chocolate behind door number one. Last year, the calendar, which is owned by Mars, took it a step further as it put the chocolate behind door number two too. But this year, fans say the cruel joke has gone too far, with some saying itaposs ruined Christmas. A number of people complained about their disappointment on Twitter, with one saying: Hi @UKCelebrations please could I have a written apology for you ruining my advent    My legal team will be in touch . A second said: I have a Celebrations advent calendar andI open that thing tomorrow and there’s a Bounty, well that’s just gonna be  summed up, while another asked: Is this some sick joke @UKCelebrations my kids have been mugged off with  Bountys in a row! I hope there’s not a th one tomorrow! #Cancelchristmas, exclaimed a fourth.  And one said: Youaposre killing my Christmas spirit at this point. It has even been accused of ruining Christmas. Cunning makers Mars replied to angry tweets with a number of creative memes using Bounty, one of which included aposLOLapos spelled out with the chocolates.  A spokesperson for Mars said: We all have our favourites. Bounty might be the last chocolate left in the tub for some people, but for others, two advent Bounty treats in a row get their season off to a great start!

But the new study from South Korea looks at how, under specic conditions, coronavirus could be transmitted across far longer distances than previously thought possible for  specic cases. The research, published in the Journal for Korean Medical Science, is based on three outbreaks in the country, including one in a restaurant with no windows and poor ventilation. It comes after fears Rishi Sunakaposs Eat Out, to Help Out, scheme may have lead to an increase in coronavirus due to the risk of having people sat relatively close together in restaurants.  The Korean report was highlighted by a US epidemiologist on Twitter who warned: there is no way to make indoor restaurants or bars safe, including those outside structures that are essentially indoor and stressed the importance of wearing masks.Although it only looks at a relatively small number of cases on a country not hit as hard by  Covid- as others, the team behind the study conclude that better guidelines are needed to deal with the potential risk. The current official UK government advice in restaurants is to “remind your customers to wear face coverings in any indoor space or where required to do so by law, for instance using signage or a verbal reminder”. The official figures for South Koreaaposs pandemic toll suggest the country has fared far better than the UK, and much of the rest of the West.  South Korea is said to have seen  deaths and , cases since the outbreak began there with its first infection on January . That compares with more than , deaths and .m cases in Britain to date. South Koreaaposs early lockdown, and test and trace system have been credited with suppressing the early outbreak and the country was more prepared than most after having previous experience with viral diseases. The study was sparked after a number of outbreaks in the country were associated with long distance droplet transmission, which merited further investigation.

Jessica Camilleri, , is accused of stabbing her mother Rita, , more than  times before her decapitated head was found on the footpath outside the Sydney home. Ritaaposs mutilated body was found on the kitchen floor when emergency services arrived to the bloody scene. The jury heard a phonecall made by Camilleri to a neighbour asking them to call police and an ambulance. The accused allegedly said her mother had gotten a kne and tried to stab her, before Camilleri grabbed it off her. Prosecutor Tony McCarthy said the jury would hear the phonecall in which Camilleri said: I just kept stabbing and stabbing and stabbing her, I took off her head. Camilleri allegedly also took the decapitated head to show a neighbour, reports Knewz.The court heard how Camilleri allegedly had a history of harassing and repeatedly threatening random people over the phone, including threats to cut off their heads with a kne. The jury were also told to expect evidence from Camilleriaposs sister to include details on her fascination with violent films, including The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Jeepers Creepers. Mr McCarthy said: The accused had a y history of assaulting people. Some involved random victims and others family members.A previous hearing also included details about how Rita was so desperate to help her daughter that she paid a medium ,to “get the demon out” of her. A friend of Rita and her other daughter, Kristy Torrisi, said she took her to a female “spirit communicator” in a desperate attempt to help her.

The Tangerines can take something from this one.Verdict: One point.The - defeat in Ayrshire back in August will go down as the low point of United’s season so far.It’s a result the players will be eager to put right and give themselves and the fans an early Christmas present.They dominated Killie at Rugby Park in the summer but silly inidual errors cost the Tangerines on the day.IAN ROACHE: Why it’s time Dundee United fans acknowledged fine job Micky Mellon is doing – and how  points from  league games should be judged\" title\"#IAN ROACHE: Why it’s time Dundee United fans acknowledged fine job Micky Mellon is doing – and how  points from  league games should be judged# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp ian-roache-why-its-time-dundee-united-fans-acknowledged-fine-job-micky-mellon-is-doing-and-how--points-from--league-games-should-be-judged embed # secretIucqcTBoN\" data-secret\"IucqcTBoN\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"Thankfully, those kind of mistakes are no longer associated with a team that’s screwed the nut in recent times.The defence is standing firm, Nicky Clark is taking his chances while Marc McNulty and Lawrence Shankland will be hoping to join him.Going up against a mid-table rival on home soil and under the floodlights, United should need no further motivation to win this one.Verdict: Three points.Boxing Day brings the Steelmen to town as Stephen Robinson pits his wits against Mellon and his men.Neither side are particularly potent in front of goal but, after a dreadful start to the campaign, the ’Well have found their feet in recent times.Tony Watt and Mark O’Hara are key for Robinson’s side going forward, while Scotland centre-half Declan Gallagher won’t give United’s frontline an inch.The Lanarkshire side are another who’ll have aspirations of making the top six and will come to Tannadice for what will, no doubt, be an even contest.At Fir Park back in August, United ran out deserved - winners and should have enough to edge Motherwell, not what they once were, out again.Verdict: Three points.Who knows what the situation will be at Parkhead at the turn of the year as boss Neil Lennon’s future hangs in the balance.What is for certain, though, is a trip to the East End of Glasgow is always daunting with the players they possess.Arguably, however, it’s a good time for United to play the champions, with the Hoops having won just twice in their last  games in all competitions after being dumped out of Europe and the Betfred Cup.The night-time clash will also represent Celtic’s eighth game of the month and comes just before the second Old Firm derby of the season on January .The picture will likely be very dferent, though, as the Celts focus fully on the Premiership, with the Scottish Cup Final out of the way, and cutting Rangers’ lead at the top.There’s just too much riding on this for Celtic and I expect they’ll show up on the night.Verdict: No points.Total:  points.EXCLUSIVE: Dundee United kid Lewis Neilson on living next door to Stuart Armstrong, EPL ambitions and why he’s every inch a star in the making\" title\"#EXCLUSIVE: Dundee United kid Lewis Neilson on living next door to Stuart Armstrong, EPL ambitions and why he’s every inch a star in the making# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp dundee-united-lewis-neilson-stuart-armstrong-interview embed # secretxuZZoeYJ\" data-secret\"xuZZoeYJ\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\" vw, px\"  Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_sub_data  ,\"evening-telegraph-first-epaper--month\": today for unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  nThis offer will auto renew monthly at the price of  ua., you can cancel at any time. n\",\"free_trial\":,\"evening-telegraph-web-pack--month\": today and get unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite. nThis offer will auto renew monthly at the price of  ua., you can cancel at any time. n\",\"free_trial\":,\"plan_ids\":[\"cancelation-offer-evening-telegraph-web-epaper\",\"evening-telegraph-first-epaper--month\",\"evening-telegraph-web-pack--month\"],\"subscribe\": ua. per month  u recurring subscription n\",\"label\":\"\",\"highlight\":,\"recurring\":\"\",\"has_multi\":,\"editions\":true,\"durations\":true,\"free_trial\":,\"benefits\":[\"Enjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.\",\"Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

He asked me to write an article for his testimonial programme which I was delighted to do.“Then I had done one for Rab Douglas when he did a charity fundraising dinner at the Invercarse so I already had a couple of them done.“And lockdown gave me the chance to finally write the whole thing.“Going back through history there are so many wonderful anecdotes and stories.”Some of the profiles hark back right to the beginnings of the club in , taking in the World Wars and right up to the glory era of the s and s.Mentions of Bill Shankly’s famous boot room at Liverpool as well as one of the club’s greatest managers are included.There’s also a family tie with Courier columnist Jim Crumley writing the profile of his grandfather Bob Crumley.“Going right back there were ‘Crumley’s Boys’ as the team in the early part of the th century were known – Bob Crumley was the goalkeeper,” Kenny said.“His profile is written by his grandson, Jim Crumley. So that was a very personal piece written about Bob Crumley who went blind and suffered from shellshock from World War One.“If you go right back to the start of the club and the first-ever season, Dundee had three players capped for Scotland and one was goalkeeper Francis Barrett. Then in the s Dundee were runners up in the league three times and the goalkeeper then, Billy Muir, was capped.“There’s also George Anderson, who was most famous as one of the club’s great managers, winning the League Cup with guys like Billy Steel in the team.“He was a goalkeeper in his playing days and played for Dundee in  . Aberdeen didn’t play during World War One so Anderson joined on loan and ended up winning every competition Dundee entered into.“There’s also Reuben Bennett, who was part of the famous boot room of Bill Shankly’s Liverpool. He won the B Division in his time at Dundee.“There is also a great Bennett story he used to tell of being a hardman at Dundee.“He said he was knocked unconscious in a game at Dens and was taken to hospital.“He tells that he woke up in the DRI, left the hospital, ran up the Hilltown and then paid to get back into Dens and finished the game!”The book includes every goalkeeper to have worn the shirt – great and not so great – until the end of last season, including young Harrison Sharp who made his debut against Elgin last year.It is available from the club shop, Amazon and eBay. vw, px\"  Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_sub_data  ,\"evening-telegraph-first-epaper--month\": today for unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  nThis offer will auto renew monthly at the price of  ua., you can cancel at any time. n\",\"free_trial\":,\"evening-telegraph-web-pack--month\": today and get unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite. nThis offer will auto renew monthly at the price of  ua., you can cancel at any time. n\",\"free_trial\":,\"plan_ids\":[\"cancelation-offer-evening-telegraph-web-epaper\",\"evening-telegraph-first-epaper--month\",\"evening-telegraph-web-pack--month\"],\"subscribe\": ua. per month  u recurring subscription n\",\"label\":\"\",\"highlight\":,\"recurring\":\"\",\"has_multi\":,\"editions\":true,\"durations\":true,\"free_trial\":,\"benefits\":[\"Enjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.\",\"Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

There’s a bit of time before the Scottish Cup comes around and that is hugely important to the club when it’s been so long without winning it.But right now it’s time to take a firm grip of third spot in the Premiership and restore some good form.The Dons are more than capable of reeling off a number of wins in quick succession, but they need to prove it now.Striker Sam Cosgrove hasn’t managed to find peak form yet since hisfrom a knee injury.The Englishman had some catching up to do on his team mates when it came to fitness, but he should be up to speed with the games he’s played.But other than his first appearance of the season in the draw with Celtic and his display in the win over Hibs, he hasn’t looked like reaching the levels we’ve seen previously.The Dons need him back and firing because he gives the team a dferent dimension.By the same token,things aren’t falling for Cosgrove, he needs to put the hard work in to turn things around.You might not be having the best of games, but you can still make an impactyou press defenders and try to force mistakes, hold the ball up well and link the play.Hopefully Cosgrove and the team show what they’re capable of this weekend.Lewis Ferguson being available again tomorrow to face St Mirren is a great boost to Aberdeen.The midfielder has missed the Dons’ last three games having been in self-isolation and the team has badly missed him.Connor McLennan is also back this weekend and his pace, physicality and direct style will also be welcomed, while Ross McCrorie remains unavailable.Although he’s only , Ferguson is already an inspirational figure within the Reds’ squad.He’s a winner, he drives the team on and intensity is something that is never lacking from his game.I know Joe Lewis is Aberdeen’s captain, but in my opinion, there’s no doubt Ferguson is a future skipper in the making – he’s already one of the main leaders within the team.I’m a fan of Lewis, he’s been a great goalkeeper for the club and shouldn’t be hung out to dry for his mistake against St Mirren, because he’s saved the Dons a lot more than he’s cost them.But in time somebody will succeed Lewis as captain and, although that time may be some way off, Ferguson would be the obvious choice.Although he is still a young player, captaincy wouldn’t be a burden to Ferguson.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. vw, px\"   blaize_sub_data  ,\"evening-express-epaper--month\":This offer will auto renew monthly at the price of  ua., you can cancel at any time n\",\"free_trial\":,\"evening-express-web-pack--month\": today and get unlimited access to the Evening Express website. nThis offer will auto-renew monthly at the price of  ua., you can cancel at any time. n\",\"free_trial\":,\"plan_ids\":[\"cancelation-offer-evening-express-web-epaper\",\"evening-express-epaper--month\",\"evening-express-web-pack--month\"],\"subscribe\": ua. per month  u recurring subscription n\",\"label\":\"\",\"highlight\":,\"recurring\":\"\",\"has_multi\":,\"editions\":true,\"durations\":true,\"free_trial\":,\"benefits\":[\"Unlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

Saints, however, failed to harness the wind advantage and it was the home side who looked the more threatening in the early stages.Skipper Lewis Buchanan registered Saints first effort on goal in the th minute, cutting in from the right to send a well-struck shot just wide of the postage stamp corner.Saints manager Donald Black made early use of the agreed rolling substitutes policy, sending on Fraser MacFarlane in the th minute to replace Alan Buchanan in the centre forward#s role.It didn#t take MacFarlane long to make an impact and his neat turn on the edge of the D created the space for a right foot volley which arced away from the Red Star keeper#s right hand to nestle in the bottom corner and give Saints a st minute lead.Red Star cancelled out the Saints advantage on the stroke of half-time after good work on the right from Chris Hart took him all the way to the bye-line from where his cutback picked out Stuart MacLean on the six-yard line for an easy finish.With the wind gathering pace, a long second half was in prospect for Saints and it took the hosts just four minutes to capitalise on their controlled first half performance when central defender Ben Forbes poked home an Andy Weir right wing corner through a sea of legs.After Lewis Buchanan had headed a th minute Andy Weir left wing corner off the line, Weir#s follow up delivery from the opposite flank picked out right full back Coll McCallum eight yards out for the home side#s third goal.Red Star stretched their advantage still further on the hour mark when Ben Forbes whipped a wind assisted free-kick from the halfway line into the postage stamp corner giving Murdo MacKenzie no chance.After keeping the hosts at bay for  minutes, Saints conceded a fth goal with almost the last kick of the ball. Murdo MacKenzie did well to parry a dipping -yard Aaron Moore shot, but luck deserted the Saints keeper when the ball broke to Ewan Litster, who chipped over the stranded keeper into the unguarded net.With the rain coming horizontally, both sets of players were delighted to hear referee Jimmy Litster#s final whistle immediately after the restart signalling a stampede for the sanctuary of the ious cars and vans in the school car park."},{"url":null,"title":"ghoulish goings on across mid argyll","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

We know that our early ancestors split from chimpanzees, our closest ape relative, around - million years ago , and that the first near-humans of our genusevolved in Africa at least . Myr.These forerunners eventually gave rise to us , but our knowledge of what happened between these dates is very limited, largely because fossilised remains are extremely rare.Common illustrations depicting how our upright posture, facial features and lack of body hair gradually evolved are based on few skeletons of ancient ancestors. Most notable is that of Lucy, a young female skeleton dating back to . Myr.Lucy was discovered in the Afar depression, Ethiopia, in , and was assigned to a species more primitive than ours , and named A. afarensis after her location. In the s a few teeth and bone fragments were found that proved to be similar to, but even older than, Lucy, dating from ^ Myr and called A. anamensis. it was assumed that Lucy was directly descended from this ancient primate.Not surprisingly, there was much excitement in the field when anthropologist Yohannes Haile-Selassie discovered a near-complete skull of A. anamensis dating from approximately . Myr. He found the skull, simply known as MRD for now, during his fieldworks at Woranso-Mille, Ethiopia, in . As the oldest and most-complete skull of A. anamensis, this find allowed detailed comparison with Lucy’s species.There was general agreement that, like the illustration, our ancient ancestors descended one from another in a linear fashion. So most experts assumed that A. anamensis evolved directly into Lucy’s species.Haile-Selassie’s detailed study of MRD suggests, however, that the two species co-existed in Africa for at least , years, presumably with the potential for interbreeding. This undoubtedly shakes up previous thoughts and reshapes our understanding of Homo evolution.But only time will tell Haile-Salassie says he hopes to find the rest of MRD’s skeleton # and even earlier members of our Homo genus # which should certainly help unravel our deep past."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast episode 17 congratulations and jubilations","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Some applicants do not have English as their first language and Citizens Advice Bureauoffices have experience in obtaining advice via interpreters.Outreach clinics, centred in local area job centres, are also a feature of the CAB service and enable job centre staff to refer clients directly to a CAB Advisor based there for a day.Any cuts will increase the workload on CAB offices exponentially as thousands more may be made redundant, find they have no income of any kind, and turn to CAB for advice. Cuts will undoubtedly affect the vulnerable in our society immediately, with theIn cities such as Glasgow, the closure of offices would mean that many claimants could find it impossible to travel to other parts of the city and, in any case, with an already growing list of applicants those offices would soon be overwhelmed,they are not already.Several members of CAB staff have already been made redundant. I believe that more may follow without additional funding.In Glasgow alone, five offices face closure, though it is estimated that in excess of , people in Glasgow sought advice from these offices in the last year. This is likely to be the case in major cities around Scotland.Our petition calls on the Scottish Parliament to urge the Scottish Government to provide urgent funding to Citizens Advice Scotland. It can be found on the Scottish Parliament website # petition number PE: Urgent funding for Citizens Advice Bureaux.Alistair S Stephen, by emailSir,The Covert Human Intelligence Sources Bill currently going through Westminster, dubbed the Spy Cop Bill, gives agencies including police, armed forces, HMRC, and even the Food Standards Agency permission to break the law with impunity.These agencies will be permitted to break international and domestic law in direct contravention of the Geneva Convention on human rights.Why is this legislation being brought in, and why are HMRC and the Food Standards Agency being given such powers  It is beyond belief that the majority of MPs actually voted for this bill.A clue may come from recent comments made by the home Secretary and endorsed by the prime minister about #leftie lawyers# and #do-gooders#, referring to human rights lawyers and refugee organisations.As for the Food Standards Agency, clues might come from the other very concerning bill in process at present which is the Internal Market Bill which contravenes the Good Friday Agreement and the devolution settlements for Scotland and Wales by undermining the authority of the devolved governments, as well as breaking an international treaty signed less than a year ago.This bill contains some deeply concerning clauses which would come under the remit of The Food Standards Agency which normally only has jurisdiction south of the border, but this bill would enable a UK trade minister to unilaterally overrule Scottish legislation on food safety standards to allow for a trade deal with the US, and the importation of sub-standard foods and food products.It is also the case that any UK minister or appointee would be able to overrule any Scottish legislation. This could affect all aspects of our lives.The Spy Cop Bill is a means of enforcing the Internal Market Bill by using the threat of underhand means. Thus piling illegality on illegality with regard to international law.We need to be very concerned on both counts.Amnesty International has already voiced its grave concerns, as have other international bodies and governments.Surely independence is now the best option for Scotland, where we can build a better, fairer nation for ourselves one that obeys international laws and respects the basic human rights of all its citizens, with a written constitution to ensure that no future Scottish government could ever impose such draconian legislation on the people of Scotland.Cecilia Rees , Lochgilphead.Sir,The Covid- pandemic continues to be exceptionally dficult for all of us, but has also led to crisis levels of #pet poverty# in the UK.PDSA is a charity that provides free and low cost vet care for those who struggle to pay treatment costs for their sick and injured pets.Since the first UK lockdown began, we’ve seen an overwhelming number of additional enquiries from pet owners who have hit hard times.

Martin Bonar replaced Scott Johnston for Saints while Chris Hart made way for Innes Meikle for the hosts.The deadlock was broken in the th minute from a quickly-taken free kick by Cammy Hill after Martin Bonar had been brought down in the centre circle by James McGuiness.Hill spotted Aaron McKay in space on the right and sent him scurrying forward. McKay cut into the box and picked out the run of Craig MacEwan who was foiled from six yards by Ally Lewis.The young keeper#s good work was undone when he couldn#t hold MacEwan#s shot allowing the ball to spin away from him.Ben Forbes was on hand with a sliding challenge to knock the loose ball away from MacEwan but only as far as Gavin Forgrieve, who gleefully tapped home from four yards.Lewis saved again from MacEwan three minutes later this time managing to hold onto the ball at the second attempt before a neat Matty Kelly turn on the corner of the Star -yard box wrong footed Ben Forbes creating the space for Kelly to curl a ball to the far post a matter of inches in front of the outstretched boot of Scott Maitland.Maitland got forward again in the st minute finding Gavin Forgrieve in front of goal. He took the ball down well only for Innes Meikle to get back with a vital challenge at the expense of a corner kick.Martin Bonar climbed well at the back post to meet Forgrieve#s delivery from the right but couldn#t direct his header on target.Despite being unable to hit the target himself Bonar was able to claim an st minute assist for the second and final goal.The big midfielder, a key member of Red Star#s  Scottish Amateur Football League Premier Division Two title winning side, won possession well in the centre circle and opened up his former team mates with a perfectly weighted pass for the forward run of skipper Craig MacEwan.Top marksman MacEwan comfortably beat stranded Red Star keeper Ally Lewis with a deft chip from  yards into the unguarded net.Referee Jimmy Litster, who ensured the two local rivals remained on friendly terms throughout, called time on proceedings after three added minutes with both sides satisfied to complete another  minutes while the majority of their respective league rivals remain side-lined."},{"url":null,"title":"in praise of john campbell factor mor","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The town on its present site would be taking shape by the time young Zachary began his schooling.His education, however, was said to be #rudimentary#, so young Zachary began teaching himself Latin and Greek as he absorbed English classic literature.Employed from the age of  in a merchant#s office in Glasgow, historical references describe him falling into #bad company# and indulging in excessive drinking.At the age of  in  he emigrated to Jamaica to take up a role as a book-keeper, effectively a slave overseer, on a sugar plantation. Such was his horror and disgust at the way in which slaves were treated on the plantation that he became an implacable opponent of the slave trade.He gave up his job in Jamaica # by this time a #model book-keeper# # and ed in  to Britain and secured a position in London. His sister Jean had married Thomas Babington of Rothley Temple, Leicestershire, a country gentleman and ardent evangelical. Babington took MacAulay under his wing and introduced him to the Clapham Sect # a group of Tories against slavery.Among them was William Wilberforce, founder and leader of the anti-slavery movement.Through working with the Clapham Sect, MacAulay was invited in  to visit Sierra Leone # the West African colony established to provide a home to emancipated slaves from the United States who came to Sierra Leone via Nova Scotia.In , aged , he was promoted to the post of governor and remained in the post until .Returning to England on a slave ship, he brought with him  African children, with the hope of finding them a better le in the Clapham Sect community.He settled in Surrey following his marriage to Selina Mills on August , .Having witnessed the misery of slavery, MacAulay became a member of the Society for the Abolition of the Slave Trade, working closely with Wilberforce, and soon became a leading figure in the parliamentary campaign. He later became secretary of the committee, which became known as the African Institution.The campaign succeeded in , with an Act of Parliament making the slave trade illegal throughout the British Empire. The practice, however, was to continue despite this victory.Many abolitionists had thought slavery would fade away once the slave trade was stopped, but that failed to happen.MacAulay continued in his activism, helping seize a slave ship in . On this act, William Wilberforce commented in a letter to MacAulay, #you really deserve a statue#.In the s MacAulay turned his attention towards securing the total abolition of slavery itself. He helped found the Society for the Mitigation and Gradual Abolition of Slaveryin , and was editor of its monthly publication, the Anti-Slavery Reporter from its launch in .His major contribution was the collection and collating of a huge volume of evidence showing the true scale of slavery # a role to which he was ideally suited as a skilled statistician with a meticulous approach and an exceptional head for figures.It was also during this period that MacAulay co-founded University College London.Publication of the Reporter continued until , but by the end the work had worn MacAulay out and he had got into debt.In  Selina died and, with his finances in disarray, MacAulay was exiled to Paris in  # the year the Slavery Abolition Act came into force which ended slavery throughout the British Empire.He ed to England once his debts were liquidated and died on May , . He was buried in a London cemetery, but after the site became a public park # St George#s Gardens # the exact location of his grave was lost.MacAulay is commemorated with a le-sized memorial bust in Westminster Abbey.To mark the th anniversary of his birth in , a memorial plaque was unveiled in the gardens, donated by the Royal Statistical Society, the Friends of St George#s Gardens, University College London and the Clan MacAulay Association.William Wilberforce said of Zachary MacAulay: #My sober and deliberate opinion is that you [Zachary MacAulay] have done more towards this consummation [abolishing slavery] than any other man.#For myself, I take pleasure in acknowledging that you have been my tutor all the way and that I could have done nothing without you.#"},{"url":null,"title":"a family passion for scotlands beauty","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Frances and Ross depict the ever-changing and often harsh weather conditions which frame their Argyll home.A Family Affair explores their shared artistic tropes as they both represent the landscape of Scotland’s islands and west coast, working in nature, directly inBoth use oil paint and other media, drawing with the brush or palette kne to make urgent, swt marks that capture the fleeting effects and drama of changing weather.They also share Crinan, where the Ryan family has run the Crinan Hotel since the mid-seventies, from where Ryan left for school, then art school and set out on extensive travels. But the beauty of Argyll # and his boat Sgarbh # drew him back.Earlier this year Ross held his second solo exhibition with The Scottish Gallery, but due to lockdown not a single person was able to attend.Frances has been a regular exhibitor with the gallery for years with her distinctive Hebridean seascapes and landscapes showing the repeated mots of Iona, The Mull of Kintyre, the bays around Crinan and the view across to Jura and the Corryvreckan.Like a good modernist Frances is reluctant to give any commentary on her works but Ross, on the other hand, makes extensive notes on his journeys allowing others to understand how hard-won the paintings are, particularly in winter when the harsh conditions create privations and huge physical problems. Each painting becomes a manestation and record of time and place.His affinity with the natural world is reflected in his long-term project of setting messages in bottles on the ocean, which brings him encounters as he journeys to meet the people who find them, and make new works at the location of the find.A Family Affair will be presented concurrently with Mark Hearld’s Menagerie, which will transport visitors to an animal-filled world with a series of prints, woodcut and linocuts inspired by the artist’s love of British flora and fauna.A Family Affair and Mark Hearld’s Menagerie will be at The Scottish Gallery in Edinburgh between Saturday November  and Wednesday December ."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column november 20 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Hill spotted Aaron McKay in space, who cut into the box and picked out MacEwan, who was foiled from six yards by Lewis. The keeper couldn#t hold the shot, and the ball eventually fell to Gavin Forgrieve, who tapped home from four yards.Nine minutes from time Saints midfielder Bonar, a key member of Red Star#s  Premier Division Two title-winning side, passed to MacEwan, who beat the keeper with a deft chip from  yards.Match report and photographs: Derek Black"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor november 20 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

All representatives who are isolating or unable to attend must be able to speak up for their voters.We noted as early as June that the abrupt shut-down of remote participation was bound to leave communities unrepresented as the pandemic continued to rage. The Commons took a step backwards in ending this too early.MPs and voters need consistency and transparent standards for how these crucial democratic decisions are made.We can#t have ato the conga line chaos we saw in June, or the decisions simply being made on a whim by a minister.MPs need clarity about how they can continue to represent their voters during this stark second wave and beyond.There must be far greater transparency over how these decisions on participation are made, rather than ministers being forced to act at the last moment.Since some MPs may be isolating or not safe to travel in person, there’s a real threat for democratic representation and political equalityremote participation continues to be strictly limited or indeed denied. Virtual proceedings in the summer were a real success in bringing parliament into the st century. Let’s learn from that and ensure all voters are heard.Darren Hughes, chief executive, the Electoral Reform Society.Sir,SNP ministers must outline how they are planning for a Covid- vaccine rollout across Scotland.People are understandably feeling positive about a potential vaccine for coronavirus, which is why it is critical for the SNP government to lay out the detail of its roll-out plans as a matter of urgency.We can ill-afford to repeat the same mistakes we saw with the flu vaccination earlier this year.Ministers need to set out what infrastructure is being put in place right now so they are ahead of the game when it comes to rolling out any vaccine across Scotland when it becomes available, and doing so fairly and effectively.Getting this right will be particularly important for the Highlands and Islands with our dispersed population and challenging geography.We must be assured that our region does not end up playing catch-up with the central belt which is an understandable concern locally, given the track record of this government in other matters affecting us.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSP and Shadow Health Secretary.Sir,In the recent storms  houses at Bruach Gorm, Port Charlotte, using the communal West Highland Housing Association satellite dish lost half their sky channels including BBC  and STV.As I write, it#s been  working days since at least three of us that I know reported the issue to West Highland, but not a word of a fix date.The dish has done well for  years, but things degrade over time. I had an inkling this year there would be a dish problem and in the summer I bought a TV aerial kit for £ # a lot cheaper than fitting a dish.I put the aerial in the loft and there is a good reception, with BBC  and STV back. It is storm proof in the loft, though was disappointed with the lack of channels from the Bowmore transmitter.I Googled it and the mast is a Freeview Light and lacks channels other UK areas enjoy. I use Sky HD freeview channels but with Sky you have to navigate the TV guide through all the blocked subscription channels to find the one you want to watch. Via the Bowmore mast the TV guide just lists the the Freeview channels, which is great.Freeview said that there were more channels available on main transmitters than there was on relay transmitters, which play a vital role in providing more remote areas with TV coverage.There are a lot of aerials on houses and I think Islay#s TV transmitters should get an upgrade to the same channels as other areas expect.I will also raise this issue with those elected to improve our lives, including our MSP, MP, council leader Councillor Currie and Councillor Horn.Colin M Campbell, Port Charlotte, Isle of Islay.Sir,I think we all need a boost of positive news, so I would like to appeal to your readers to give a brave and special young person in your area the credit they deserve by nominating them for the  WellChild Awards.We are looking for inspirational children and young people who have defied the odds in the face of serious illness and the selfless nurses, doctors, brothers, sisters and friends who help care for them.This is your opportunity to give them the recognition they deserve at a prestigious event regularly attended by WellChild Patron, The Duke of Sussex.Nominations are open now so please get yours in before the closing date on Monday December  at noon.

The current bus stop and car park at the head of Glen Croe would also be bypassed. This is an important public transport link for local residents.The consultation launched by the Scottish Government’s Transport Secretary, Michael Matheson is a muddled exercise. It confuses the urgent need to decide on an alternative route for a new road through Glen Croe with the much longer-term strategic transport options for improving connectivity between Argyll and west-central Scotland.Most of the strategic options involve a number of new civil engineering challenges including the construction of bridges over Loch Long and Loch Fyne and extensive road building, both new and upgraded. For reasons of cost and complexity, none of these options are likely to be implemented within this decade.Whatever long-term strategy options may be investigated for their feasibility, there remains the urgent need to build a new road in Glen Croe. It will always be necessary to link the communities of Arrochar Tarbetwith Loch Goil, Cairndow, north Loch Fyne, Inveraray and beyond with the A.I note that both my local community council in Loch Goil and Argyll and Bute Council support the route that follows the existing forest track on the opposite side of the glen from the Rest and Be Thankful without a similar risk of landslides. Compared with the strategic options, this is a modestof road to construct.The sooner that steps are taken to realise this solution the better it will be for all who currently suffer the increasingly frequent road closures due to climate change and the unstable hill.Alastair R Moodie, LochgoilheadSir,Every year thousands of children contact Childline about being bullied online and tell us that they feel it is hard to escape from.Lockdown has intensied these feelings for many and since April we’ve counselled more than , children and young people across the UK about online bullying.Children have told us about people sending threatening or abusive messages and being pressured into engaging in sexual conversations. Others have shared that they’ve been excluded from online games by other children, while some spoke of online identities being stolen to embarrass or cause trouble while using their name.Before lockdown measures were first introduced this year, the average monthly number of counselling session with children about online bullying was . Between April and October that value increased by  per cent to a monthly average of .This is worrying, particularly as we continue to adhere to strict social-distancing restrictions across Scotland and children continue to spend more time online. Bullying can have a long-term impact on the mental wellbeing of a child and, as we mark Anti Bullying Week this month and beyond, it’s important to ensure that every child knows who they can turn to for support.If a parent thinks their child is being bullied online, it can be hard to remain calm, but it’s crucial not to overwhelm a child with questions. Taking their device away is likely to make them feel like whatever has happened is their fault instead, it’s helpful to listen to their worries, suggest they take some time away from certain apps, and provide them with reassurance.Adeniyi Alade, service head of Childline at NSPCC ScotlandSir,Boris Johnson’s comment that devolution has been #a disaster north of the border# and #Tony Blair’s worst mistake# should hardly come as a surprise to anyone.The Tories have never been great supporters of devolution, vehemently opposing both the referendums in  on establishing a Scottish Assembly and in  on the Scottish Parliament.Most recently the devolution power grab that is highlighted in the Internal Market Bill simply reinforces this stance.The Scottish Social Attitudes surveyon constitutional preference found that only seven per cent favour abolition of the Scottish Parliament and it found that trust in the Scottish Government sits at four times that of the UK Government. This points to it hardly being a disaster.For those accused of scaremongering that there is a threat to Holyrood, Mr Johnson’s comments are clear vindication. The irony of all this being that devolution has given new le to the Scottish Conservatives after its wipe out in  and it is now the opposition in the Scottish Parliament.Be under no doubt that the Scottish Parliament, which was hard fought for, is under threat and we must do all in our power to defend it.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures november 27 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Businesses need to act now! This is true for retail, those trading in consumer goods, services and investment, construction and housing as well as vehicle and haulier firms. The UK Government has put a raft of measures in place for all firms across England, Scotland and Wales. Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Michael Gove said: “We are leaving the EU single market and customs union. This will bring both new challenges and new opportunities for businesses. We recognise this is a challenging time for everyone. We are determined to support businesses to be ready for  January  and beyond. ”These are actions to take now#Procurement expert Laura Hobbs has led the way for the construction industry to prepare for the end of the UK transition period. Laura is the UK and Ireland One Procurement Programme Lead at Royal BAM Group, which is among the biggest construction firms covering England, Wales and Scotland. She said: “We have created a snapshot to give a clear picture for the industry where we believe pinch points are.” Laura explained: “I decided to pull my peers together, all the other main contractors that are part of the Construction Senior Leaders Group which I chair. We decided to write one set of questions for the end of UK transition and also share the workload – to go to all those dferent product categories key to construction.“As main contractors we deal a lot with sub-contractors so we need to ensure the message gets further into the supply chain.”The Construction Senior Leaders Group also includes representatives from Skanska, Costain, Murphys, Laing O’Rourke, housebuilders Berkeley and clients including Highways UK and Clarion Housing Group. Manufacturers are employing new customs experts to help them get in position for the new start, creating more strategic programmes to negate any currency fluctuations. Laura worked with Build UK, receiving useful information around imports and exports from the UK Government. “Information is the key and preparation is essential. The organisations we work with have been preparing for this for a long time so they are on their final rehearsal now. “To be able to give your own business the comfort you are going into this in a planned, coordinated way, it is key for people to start the exercise sooner rather than later,” stressed Laura. She said the new start will bring opportunities to invest in the UK supply chain. “We always see the positives and, definitely for the UK, there are opportunities coming.”"},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast episode 18 follow me","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Surely to goodness we should have a plan.#I am also quite annoyed that Fyne View has closed, because it cost a lot to get it up and running, so that is money down the drain.#The public want to have facilities in their area and we cannot have decisions made without proper focus on figures before us.#Fyne View was a Lochgilphead-based care facility for dementia sufferers which was revealed to have closed its doors in November.Caroline Cherry, head of adult services with the HSCP, responded: #I totally hear Ms Rhodick’s concerns. But the purpose of this paper is not to go over decisions that have been made, it is to look at the audit trail.#Ms Rhodick then said: #Councillor Gary Mulvaneyhas said that the decision has been taken and the report reiterates that.#But it didn’t matter how many times people pled with the board to listen and understand, especially in a smaller area like this.#The consultation was not a consultation. People were asked along for their views and officers turned and told the public what they were doing. They were putting the cart before the horse.#The community will be really angry as nobody is listening. The decision was made months ago with one public consultation. It should have been two or three to get proper feedback.#Officers said what was happening and it was an option that nobody knew about.#Everything has been massaged for the IJB’s benefit. They are not listening.#Councillor Mulvaney said in reply: #This paper is reiterating what we have already decided and we are reopening a debate we had a number of months ago.#We now have a board member going back through things to which officers are in no position to respond.#I know Ms Rhodick feels strongly about this issue but the decisions have been taken and you cannot make comments like those.#It is just not appropriate for a board member. I suggest we move on.#Ms Cherry’s report said it was produced with the aim of ensuring there is #clear oversight and assurance on decision-making# on Knapdale’s closure."},{"url":null,"title":"jads grand designs","story":"Kathie GrfithsUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

But, usually, it means yoursquoll find it more dficult to exercise your rights.This applies even where we see a rapid purchase of a company thatrsquos gone into administration, where on the surface it looks like itrsquos businesses as usual.Can Iitems to a retailer thats gone into administration It depends. Once a retailer goes into administration the administrators role is to try and save the company, and in doing so, it may take the decision not to accept s.But you could ask for a refundthe things you bought werent delivered, or you could claim for the cost of a repairthey were faulty.Do myrights still apply after a company has gone into administration If yoursquove been supplied with faulty goods and the company is placed into administration but is still trading, you may be able to get a replacement or a refund in the normal way under the Consumer Rights Act.If the company isnrsquot trading while itrsquos in administration, yoursquoll need to make a claim to the administrator as an unsecured creditor, so it may be unlikely that youll get a refund in this case.Butyou donrsquot submit a claim in writing to the administrators then it is highly unlikely that they will stand to get their money back. We think itrsquos worth at least trying.If you have a faulty item, you could register your claim with the administrators for the cost of fixing the item, or for a refundtheres still time to reject the item.Can I still use my warranty after a company has gone into administration If you bought an item thats faulty and it came with a warranty, you should be able to claim a refund or repair from the manufacturer under the terms of the warranty.You may be able to make a claim on an extended warrantythe cover was provided by a third party .If the retailer goes into administration and the goods are faulty, then your manufacturers warranty should cover you for at least the first year. Check your documentation to seethis is the case.Check the small print carefully to see who actually provided the warranty cover. Often itrsquos provided by a third partyin which case you shouldnrsquot be affecteda store ceases trading.If the cover was provided by the retailer in question, then it depends on what happens at the end of the administration period.If the retailer ceases to trade, then unfortunately you would lose the benefit of the extended warranty.Remember that youll usually get a manufacturerrsquos guarantee with an item that will provide some protection for the first year - sometimes even longer.Can I claim from my card company If you paid for goods that cost less than pound on a credit or debit card, you may be able to claim under chargeback.If youve bought something on your credit card costing more than pound, means the card provider is jointly responsible for any breaches of contract.You can claim under Section  of the Consumer Credit Actthe item is faulty.Write to your credit card company with details of your claim. You can use our template letter to claim a refund from your credit card companya retailer goes bust.Can I claimI only paid a deposit You dont have to have paid the full amount on your credit card ndash the card company is liable evenyou made only part of the paymenton your card.Its the value of the goods youre buying thats key, not the amount paid on the card.Under Section , as long as the value of the product is between pound and pound, then youll be covered, regardless of how much you paid on your card.So, for example,you ordered a new camera and paid a pound deposit with your credit card and paid the balance of pound by cheque, youd be covered for the whole poundthe company went out of business and you didnt get your camera.Can I still use my gt vouchers after a company has gone into administration A number of high street stores have refused to allow customers to use gt vouchers after going into administration. Unfortunately, this is within the law.But,the administrator takes this decision its worth waiting a few days to seeit will change its mind.If your gt vouchers are refused, you need to make a claim in writing to the administrators with proof of your vouchers.You can find the name of the administrator on the website of the retailer that has gone into administration.But theres no guarantee youll get all of your money back, and it could take up to  months to process the claim properly. And, not all administrators will take this approach.If you want to get your money back, you can use our template letter to claim a refund for vouchers from a bust company.Can I make a chargeback claim for gt vouchers If a company is accepting gt vouchers then chargeback claims will not be accepted.If gt vouchers arent being accepted and you bought gt vouchers on your card, you should be able to put in a chargeback request to your bank on the grounds that the vouchers are fundamentally dferent from what you paid for.This is because you expected to be able to exchange the vouchers for goods of a certain value and instead theyre worthless.If the vouchers were given to you as a gt, its trickier to make this argument. The person who received a voucher as a gt cant make a claim.But the person who bought the vouchers could put in a chargeback request to the bank. You can use our letter template to help you make a chargeback claim.Its worth noting though, that theres no guarantee the administrators will accept chargeback claims.Can I get my cashback If you were supposed to get cashback as part of your purchase, it depends on how the cashback offer was set up - you may still receive it.Check the terms and conditions to see whether the offer is backed by the manufacturer , or whether the cashback claim should be made to the retailer.If the manufacturer is providing the cashback, your claim shouldnt be affected.If its the retailer, you could still put in a claim and they would be in breach of contractthey didnt send the cash.If you didnt get the cash, unfortunately, you couldnt take court action against the retailer while its in administration.If at the end of the administration the retailer stopped trading, youd need to lodge your claim for unpaid cashback with the administrators."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-borders-recorded-nearly-300-cases-past-month","story":"NEARLY  cases of coronavirus have been recorded in the Borders over the past month.Data published by the Scottish Government at pm todayshows the Borders has recorded  new cases in the last  hours, bringing the regional total since March to .On November , a total of  cases had been confirmed since the beginning of the pandemic, meaning that, in the space of a month, the Borders has recorded  new cases.:Coronavirus: Borders school announces positive caseIn Scotland, the total number of cases since March now stands at ,.In the last  hours across Scotland, there have been  deaths where COVID-has been mentioned on the death certicate.In the Borders, the number of patients in hospital with the virus has increased since yesterdayfrom nine to ."},{"url":null,"title":"hawick-mcdonalds-reveals-number-jobs-available","story":"McDONALDrsquoS has revealed the number of jobs that will be created once its new Borders site opens.As reported last week, a new restaurant and drive-thru will be coming to Hawickafter plans were approved by Scottish ministers.The fast food giant has now revealed that ldquoat least  new jobs will be created.:Galashiels loses crown as happiest place to live in ScotlandA McDonaldrsquos spokesperson said: ldquoWersquore delighted that our plans for a new drive-thru restaurant in Hawick have been approved.ldquoWe look forward to opening our doors in the near future, bringing signicant investment to the local community and creating at least  new jobs.The Hawick site on Commercial Road, where the McDonaldrsquos is to be built, will also see a BM store added.There is currently one McDonaldrsquos store in the Borders, which opened in Galashiels in .You might also be interested in:Coronavirus: Borders recorded nearly  casesin the last monthTwo Borders high schools in top  in Scotland, says Sunday TimesCoronavirus: Borders school announces positive case"},{"url":null,"title":"selkirk-knowepark-primary-school-announces-coronavirus-case","story":"AN ENTIRE class at a Borders school has been forced to self-isolate following a coronavirus case.On Sunday , parents of pupils in the P P composite class at Knowepark Primary School, Selkirk, were informed of a positive case at the school.The NHS Test and Protect team identied the whole class as being in close contact with the case, and all pupils were therefore required to self-isolate.A spokesperson for Scottish Borders Councilsaid that three other schools in the Borders have also reported cases recently.:Two Borders high schools in top  in Scotland, says Sunday TimesHawick High School and Galashiels Academyhave each announced a single case, while Ayton Primary School has \"a small number of cases\", according to the spokesperson.The spokesperson said cases associated with Ayton Primary School have \"implications for a number of iniduals within the school\".\"Currently no [Ayton] pupils [are] required to self-isolate,\" the spokesperson added.Parents at Hawick High School and Galashiels Academy were informed of cases on November , and parents of children at Ayton Primary School were told about cases on November ."},{"url":null,"title":"covid-scotland-scotrail-offers-students-50-per-cent-discount-get-home-christmas","story":"SCOTRAIL has announced that students travelling home over Christmas will benefit from a fty per cent discount on tickets from Scotlandrsquos Railway.A mass testing programme of students planning to head home over the festive period is currently under way, in a bid to limit risk of transmission and provide reassurance to those travelling home to their families and loved ones.And now students will only need to pay half price for travel, on any ScotRail service until December .The train operator, run by Dutch firm Abellio, hopes the move will help students worried about getting home to their families under the current coronavirus travel restrictions.Students will first need to record a negative Covid- test before travelling, which could make it dficult to book specic train services due to testing appointments and the time spent awaiting results.Herersquos a little Christmas cheer for all of Scotlandrsquos university students.

This really is it. Nothing .An alternative is to mix up a saltwater solution, soak a towel in it and leave the towel on the windscreen overnight.You might also want to leave the engine running while you de-ice your car, but this poses safety issues and may also be in breach of the Highway Code which states you must not leave a vehicle engine running unnecessarily while that vehicle is stationary on a public road.Theres also the risk the vehicle could get stolenthe keys are left in the ignition.The AA says:Get up at least  minutes early to give you time to prepare the car.Donrsquot drive off like a tank-commander, with a tiny hole cleared in the windscreen.Clear all windows using a scraper and de-icer. Use a cigarette lighter to warm a key for a frozen lock.Plan routes to favour major roads which are more likely to have been cleared and gritted.Allow extra time for winter journeys but be prepared for the inevitability of being late for work due to unexpected delay.Can I be fined for not clearing my windows before driving away Short answer - yes.There isnt a law that says it is illegal to drive with snow on your car, however the Highway Code says that you must be able to see out of every window clearly during bad weather.If you fail to do so you could incur a fine, but more importantly could place your le, the lives of your passengers and the lives of those around you in danger.As for snow on the roof, while, again, there is no law stating it is illegal to drive with snow on your roof,it falls off onto your windscreen while driving or flies into the path of another car then you could be penalised for such offences as driving without due consideration or using a motor vehicle in a dangerous condition and again, not worth the risk.For more information visit the AAand RACwebsite.Please be careful when on the roads this week."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-borders-records-seven-new-cases-24-hour-period","story":"THE Borders has recorded seven cases of coronavirus in the last  hours, taking the overall figure since March to ,.The Scottish Government published updated statistics at pm today .There are currently  people in hospital in the Borders after positive tests.

It cost the lives of  British servicemen and severe injuries to many more but it made Blair a rich man, resulting from his popularity in America where many of my friends still think the sun shines from his posterior.I would agree, however, that allowing the electorate in Scotland to vote in favour of devolution, was undoubtedly Blair#s second biggest mistake.His motivation was to placate those crying for Scottish independence, following the discovery of North Sea oil, but the irony was that it led to a series of disastrously incompetent Labour Lib Dem coalition governments.These in turn resulted in the electorate choosing, in , a minority SNP government, enabled by support from the Greens.My letter would be far too long were I to dwell on all the areas of incompetence in Holyrood government since , so I#ll confine my evaluation to education, upon which the future of Scotland depends.In , Salmond#s election promise was primary school class sizes of under  but, two years later, Fiona Hyslop changed that target to fewer than  pupils. That was just before Salmond sacked her and Mike Russell admitted smaller class sizes might not be possible before .Those councils that did enforce the limit of  only did so by refusing places to children whose siblings were at the same school.The #attainment gap# between children from poorer backgrounds and those from more affluent areas has continued to widen rather than diminish, as Nicola Sturgeon promised, while older students cannot find places at Scottish universities because these have to be allocated to foreign students, whose fees are a necessity to fund the universities.Meanwhile, I hate to think what Scotland#s deficit is now. It was around eight per cent of GDP before Covid decimated so many areas vital to Scotland#s economy.Doubtless, Alex Orr will remind me Scotland cannot legally have a deficit, but an independent Scotland could and it would prevent the dream of Scotland rejoining the EU from ever being attained.Brian Gee, Carradale East.In the recent storms,  houses at Bruach Gorm, Port Charlotte using the communal West Highland Housing Association satellite dish, lost half our Sky channels, including BBC  and STV.As I write, it’s been  working days since at least three of us that I know reported the issue to West Highland, but not a word of a fix date.The dish has done well for  years, but things degrade over time. I had an inkling this year there would be a dish problem and in the summer I bought a TV aerial kit for £ – a lot cheaper than fitting a dish. I put the aerial in the loft and there is a good reception, with BBC  and STV back. It is storm-proof in the loft, though I was disappointed with the lack of channels from the Bowmore transmitter.I Googled it and the mast is a Freeview Light and lacks channels other UK areas enjoy. I use Sky HD freeview channels but with Sky you have to navigate the TV guide through all the blocked subscription channels to find the one you want to watch. Via the Bowmore mast, the TV guide just lists the freeview channels, which is great.Freeview said that there are more channels available on main transmitters than there is on relay transmitters, which play a vital role in providing more remote areas a TV coverage.There are a lot of aerials on houses and I think Islay’s TV transmitters should get an upgrade to the same channels as other areas expect.I will also raise this issue with those elected to improve our lives, including MSP, MP, council leader Councillor Currie and Councillor Horn.Colin M Campbell, Port Charlotte, Islay.I think we all need a boost of positive news, so I would like to appeal to your readers to give a brave and special young person in your area the credit they deserve by nominating them for the  WellChild Awards.We are looking for inspirational children and young people who have defied the odds in the face of serious illness and the selfless nurses, doctors, brothers, sisters and friends who help care for them.This is your opportunity to give them the recognition they deserve at a prestigious event regularly attended by WellChild Patron, The Duke of Sussex.Nominations are open now so please get yours in before the closing date on Monday December  at noon.

This time it was to Perth to compete in the novice section of the Scottish Youth Championships, arriving in Perth on Saturday for Sunday’s competition.And on Sunday, playing third out of  bands, they had to leave before the results were announced. So there was much cheering and celebrating on the West Coast Motors bus on the journey home when the news came through that they had done the town proud and received a gold award and first place.This was an amazing feat for such a young and inexperienced band the youngest member Erin McLellan celebrated her eighth birthday on Sunday and the oldest member was only .TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGONo pledge on munitions dump surveyThere are no immediate plans for a survey of underwater munitions dumps in the Clyde and North Channel areas.Scientists from the marine research laboratory at Torry last week completed their survey of the area between the Beaufort’s Dyke dump and the nearby site of British Gas pipe laying operations.The operation has been blamed for disturbing thousands of Second World War fire bombs which were washed up on beaches in Kintyre, Mid Argyll, Islay, Jura, Gigha, Arran, North Ayrshire and Northern Ireland.But Scottish Office minister Raymond Robertson told MPs last week that the evidence connecting the pipe laying with the firebombs was ‘circumstantial’.Mr Robertson refused to commit the government to carrying out any further sea bed surveys in the areas around other munitions dumping sites off the west coast of Scotland.FIFTY YEARS AGOCriomaganMr Donnie Ronaldson, of the Argyll Arms Hotel, Southend, was host to a number of hoteliers and restauranteurs at a display of micro-wave cooking by the Scottish AGH Vending Company of Dundee which is the selling agent for Philips Microwave.Mr Robert Beveridge, the sales representative, gave a comprehensive demonstration on micro-wave cooking.Middleton discusses Common Market with fishermenMr George Middleton, chairman of the Herring Industry Board, revealed at a press conference last week that the board had been in touch with the Secretary of State for Scotland about the widespread alarm among fishermen about possible Common Market entry.Mr Gordon Campbell has replied: #It is not possible to make anything like the final assessment of the likely effect until we know in detail the regulations the European Economic Community proposes to make in implementation of the Common Fisheries Policy, and until our negotiations for entry have gone much further.#Mr Middleton assured fishermen on the pier during the discussions that the board existed to protect fishing interests and to fight any policies potentially harmful to the industry. He assured the fishermen that the board was well aware of the dangers entry into the Common Market presented.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGONews from Islay # honouring Mr and Mrs Anderson, CarnainOn the evening of Friday November   a concert was held in Newton School, the object of which was to give material expression in honour of Mr and Mrs Anderson, Carnain, who lost their two sonsin the Great War.The concert was remarkably successful, people being present from almost all parts of Kilchoman as well as from Kilarrow and Kelmeny, and the accommodation was taxed to its utmost capacity.Mr Cullen, Bridgend, in his own inimitable manner, occupied the chair and voiced the feelings of an enthusiastic audience in an excellent speech.He said they were gathered there that night to do honour to Mr Angus Anderson, an old soldier and the father of soldiers # of two sons who gave their lives for their King and Country.Mr Anderson joined the nd Argylls in , just  years before the Great War broke out. He was, for five and a half years, orderly to Captain M’Neill of Colonsay, latterly Colonel M’Neill # the much-loved Commanding Officer of the th Argylls.Mr Anderson’s two sons were buried in France # John at Mailly Wood and James in an unknown soldier’s grave.The chairman announced that the proceeds amounted to £ s dand this was augmented by a handsome cheque from Mr Morrison of Islay House."},{"url":null,"title":"leader november 27 2020","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

So there will be one window on st December , two windows on December  and so on – and they should stay in place until Twelfth Night.Everyone is invited to walk or drive around the parishes and spot the decorated windows. A guide will also be available in the village shops.In this way, we hope to brighten the preparation for Christmas for everyone.More than , children are admitted to hospital every day in the UK and it has never been a scarier time for them.With unfamiliar wards, health professionals in additional PPE, only being able to have one parent with them, and no visits from their brothers or sisters during the pandemic, it can be very worrying and lonely.That is why play and distraction services in hospitals are now more vital than ever. Having access to toys and entertainment, when recovering or waiting for treatment, or using play as a distraction for procedures can help to alleviate pain, aid recovery and bring joy back into children’s lives.At the children’s charity Starlight, thanks to our supporters, we provide hospitals with boxes filled with toys, games and puzzles to be used on wards.This year, Starlight’s fundraising income has fallen due to many cancelled events, which is why we have started our Time to Play campaign. Our goal is to raise £, before the end of the year to help , children get access to play in hospital and limit the negative effects of illness on their childhood.It’s easy to support and our website has fun ideas of how to take part, including our Stream for Starlight fundraiser for computer gamers.Or,you are able to, please considering making a simple one-off donation. However big or small, it will help Starlight to continue to be there to support children and their families this Christmas.I’m hoping your readers will join together and help support Starlight, to bring back joy into the lives of the , seriously ill children living in the UK this Christmas.Please visit www.starlight.org.uk time to help us. Thank you.Every year thousands of children contact Childline about being bullied online and tell us that they feel it is hard to escape from.Lockdown has intensied these feelings for many and since April we’ve counselled more than , children and young people across the UK about online bullying.Children have told us about people sending threatening or abusive messages and being pressured into engaging in sexual conversations. Others have shared that they’ve been excluded from online games by other children, while some spoke of online identities being stolen to embarrass or cause trouble while using their name.Before lockdown measures were first introduced this year, the average monthly number of counselling sessions with children about online bullying was . Between April and October that value increased by  per cent to a monthly average of .This is worrying, particularly as we continue to adhere to strict social-distancing restrictions across Scotland and children continue to spend more time online. Bullying can have a long-term impact on the mental wellbeing of a child and, as we mark Anti Bullying Week this month and beyond, it’s important to ensure that every child knows who they can turn to for support.If a parent thinks their child is being bullied online, it can be hard to remain calm, but it’s crucial not to overwhelm a child with questions. Taking their device away is likely to make them feel like whatever has happened is their fault instead, it’s helpful to listen to their worries, suggest they take some time away from certain apps, and provide them with reassurance.Adeniyi Alade, service head of Childline at NSPCC Scotland.Boris Johnson’s comment that devolution has been #a disaster north of the border# and #Tony Blair’s worst mistake# should hardly come as a surprise to anyone.The Tories have never been great supporters of devolution, vehemently opposing both the referendums in  on establishing a Scottish Assembly and in  on the Scottish Parliament.Most recently the devolution power grab that is highlighted in the Internal Market Bill simply reinforces this stance.The Scottish Social Attitudes surveyon constitutional preference found that only seven per cent favour abolition of the Scottish Parliament and it found that trust in the Scottish Government sits at four times that of the UK Government. This points to it hardly being a disaster.For those accused of scaremongering that there is a threat to Holyrood, Mr Johnson’s comments are clear vindication. The irony of all this being that devolution has given new le to the Scottish Conservatives after its wipe out in  and it is now the opposition in the Scottish Parliament.Be under no doubt that the Scottish Parliament, which was hard fought for, is under threat and we must do all in our power to defend it.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.While this year Christmas is going to be dferent from usual for many of us, it is still a time for preparations and extra food.

This is true for retail, those trading in consumer goods, services and investment, construction and housing as well as vehicle and haulier firms. The UK Government has put a raft of measures in place for all firms across England, Scotland and Wales. Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Michael Gove said: “We are leaving the EU single market and customs union. This will bring both new challenges and new opportunities for businesses. We recognise this is a challenging time for everyone. We are determined to support businesses to be ready for  January  and beyond. ”These are actions to take now#Procurement expert Laura Hobbs has led the way for the construction industry to prepare for the end of the UK transition period. Laura is the UK and Ireland One Procurement Programme Lead at Royal BAM Group, which is among the biggest construction firms covering England, Wales and Scotland. She said: “We have created a snapshot to give a clear picture for the industry where we believe pinch points are.” Laura explained: “I decided to pull my peers together, all the other main contractors that are part of the Construction Senior Leaders Group which I chair. We decided to write one set of questions for the end of UK transition and also share the workload – to go to all those dferent product categories key to construction.“As main contractors we deal a lot with sub-contractors so we need to ensure the message gets further into the supply chain.”The Construction Senior Leaders Group also includes representatives from Skanska, Costain, Murphys, Laing O’Rourke, housebuilders Berkeley and clients including Highways UK and Clarion Housing Group. Manufacturers are employing new customs experts to help them get in position for the new start, creating more strategic programmes to negate any currency fluctuations. Laura worked with Build UK, receiving useful information around imports and exports from the UK Government. “Information is the key and preparation is essential. The organisations we work with have been preparing for this for a long time so they are on their final rehearsal now. “To be able to give your own business the comfort you are going into this in a planned, coordinated way, it is key for people to start the exercise sooner rather than later,” stressed Laura. She said the new start will bring opportunities to invest in the UK supply chain. “We always see the positives and, definitely for the UK, there are opportunities coming.”"},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast episode 18 follow me","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Both schools have demonstrated rich, engaging and ied STEM experiences for learners.#Science Minister Richard Lochhead said: #Many congratulations to those schools who have achieved STEM Nation Awards.#The efforts of those schools to offer pupils the chance to develop skills and awareness of STEM subjects will open up fantastic career opportunities to them and help to make sure that the workforce of the future is equipped to protect Scotland’s reputation as a true science and technology nation.#Argyll and Bute Council’s policy lead for education, Councillor Yvonne McNeilly, said: #Here in Argyll and Bute, we have a track record for excellence in STEM learning experiences in our schools. With local key sectors that include creative industries, aquaculture and renewable energy, it’s important that our young people are well-equipped with skills our economy needs for the future – either at home or further afield.#So, congratulations to Port Ellen and Bowmore primaries, and good luck to North Bute Primary which I know has just completed the first step in achieving this award.#"},{"url":null,"title":"down memory lane december 4 2020","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

There are probably no more than half-a-dozen casks of -year-old Scotch whisky in existence.It is the habit at Springbank to reserve small quantities of whisky for longer than normal maturity. Although  years is not so very uncommon,  years is exceptional.The particular cask was ‘refill sherry hogshead’ which was filled on December  , with Springbank at a strength of . over proof .It originally contained the equivalent of . proof gallons but more than  years later, maturation had taken most of the spirit away: there was only the equivalent of . proof gallons left, and the strength had dropped to . proof.The out-turn of the bottling operation was  cases and one bottle. These will have a special label and each numbered bottle will carry a certicate inidually signed by the company’s chairman Mr Hedley G Wright, whose great-grandfather founded the present company. Unfortunately it is improbable that any of this whisky # after all there are only  bottles # will be seen by the retail trade the price would be astronomical anyway.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOIslay distilleriesLast working season was a prosperous one for the Islay distilleries, as well as for Highlands distilleries generally.During the summer great activity has been seen in the numerous arrivals of vessels with coal and barley and preparations were made for a resumption of distilling.Wet weather, scarcity of labour and a scarcity of carts made the securing of peats very dficult, and only the dry autumn relieved the situation and allowed the peats to be got home. At Ardbeg, Lagavulin, Laphroaig, Port Ellen, Port Charlotte, Bruichladdich, Bunnahabhain and Caol Ila work is now actively going on, and large deliveries are leaving the district.Highland distillers, however, have now to face the competition again of the distillers of grain whisky, which is now plentul on the market. The Distillers Co Ltd quotes its grain whisky at five shillingsper gallon and with all the high costs of wages, coal repairs etc which encumber the malt distillers, the competition is likely to be severely felt."},{"url":null,"title":"law book not just for legal eagles","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

What started as a personal challenge for David Brown has motivated not only himself but many others to raise money for charity as they keep fit.Many members of the charities for which David has raised money in  have supported him by completing their own runs and walks, the latest being Tom Donnachy, who features on our back page.The fundraising efforts of the three young girls who completed a K walk last weekend also inspired two businesses # Deliciously Scottish Eggs and Jura Community Stores # to donate money to Children st.Finally, it is heartening to hear of the community coming together to help dog Rogan who suffers from cancer.No matter what le throws at us, we can be sure our community will support us."},{"url":null,"title":"letters december 4 2020","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

This is especially dangerous when lorries are on the road as they take much longer to stop or slow down.This has frustrated me for some time but enough is enough.

The town#s heart was broken earlier this year, as it has been many, many times before.#As a community we have all pulled together and slowly but surely we are healing and showing the strength that comes from within such a tight-knit and loving community.#So many people have been helping one another to get through this as well as those who have worked in a iety of occupations, every single day # and so hard # throughout this strange time for us all the volunteers who have given their time freely to help so many of the community everyone who has kept this wee town going # you have all been amazing.#This has been the toughest of years that our young generation has seen. They have been affected in many ways, some of which have still to appear, and many have really struggled.#Everything became virtual # what a blessing technology has been for all of us to keep in touch and stay connected.#For all these reasons above, this is why it was so important to us, that although we would not be able to have our usual ‘switch on’, we had to make sure the lights were up and Santa came to see the wee ones. It was wonderful to see so many people out on the street. Everyone needed a bit of cheer and a bit of magic.#The group thanked the following iniduals and companies for their assistance: RDS Forestry, P McKerral and Co, Kevin McCrae, Jack Campbell, McKinven and Colville, Clark Lafferty, Stevie Gorman, Barry Colville, George MacMillan, Ryan McLachlan, Kintyre Hire, Jim McPhee, Graeme Harvey, Community Service, Helen Gilchrist, Campbeltown Coop, Tesco, The Original Factory Shop and the one and only Santa and his helpers.#Without you all, this would never have happened,# the spokesperson added. #Thank you from the bottom of our grateful hearts.#Santa is toto Kintyre tomorrowevening, to visit children in some of the villages surrounding Campbeltown so keep a look out for him."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week december 4 2020","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

But, usually, it means yoursquoll find it more dficult to exercise your rights.This applies even where we see a rapid purchase of a company thatrsquos gone into administration, where on the surface it looks like itrsquos businesses as usual.Can Iitems to a retailer thats gone into administration It depends. Once a retailer goes into administration the administrators role is to try and save the company, and in doing so, it may take the decision not to accept s.But you could ask for a refundthe things you bought werent delivered, or you could claim for the cost of a repairthey were faulty.Do myrights still apply after a company has gone into administration If yoursquove been supplied with faulty goods and the company is placed into administration but is still trading, you may be able to get a replacement or a refund in the normal way under the Consumer Rights Act.If the company isnrsquot trading while itrsquos in administration, yoursquoll need to make a claim to the administrator as an unsecured creditor, so it may be unlikely that youll get a refund in this case.Butyou donrsquot submit a claim in writing to the administrators then it is highly unlikely that they will stand to get their money back. We think itrsquos worth at least trying.If you have a faulty item, you could register your claim with the administrators for the cost of fixing the item, or for a refundtheres still time to reject the item.Can I still use my warranty after a company has gone into administration If you bought an item thats faulty and it came with a warranty, you should be able to claim a refund or repair from the manufacturer under the terms of the warranty.You may be able to make a claim on an extended warrantythe cover was provided by a third party .If the retailer goes into administration and the goods are faulty, then your manufacturers warranty should cover you for at least the first year. Check your documentation to seethis is the case.Check the small print carefully to see who actually provided the warranty cover. Often itrsquos provided by a third partyin which case you shouldnrsquot be affecteda store ceases trading.If the cover was provided by the retailer in question, then it depends on what happens at the end of the administration period.If the retailer ceases to trade, then unfortunately you would lose the benefit of the extended warranty.Remember that youll usually get a manufacturerrsquos guarantee with an item that will provide some protection for the first year - sometimes even longer.Can I claim from my card company If you paid for goods that cost less than pound on a credit or debit card, you may be able to claim under chargeback.If youve bought something on your credit card costing more than pound, means the card provider is jointly responsible for any breaches of contract.You can claim under Section  of the Consumer Credit Actthe item is faulty.Write to your credit card company with details of your claim. You can use our template letter to claim a refund from your credit card companya retailer goes bust.Can I claimI only paid a deposit You dont have to have paid the full amount on your credit card ndash the card company is liable evenyou made only part of the paymenton your card.Its the value of the goods youre buying thats key, not the amount paid on the card.Under Section , as long as the value of the product is between pound and pound, then youll be covered, regardless of how much you paid on your card.So, for example,you ordered a new camera and paid a pound deposit with your credit card and paid the balance of pound by cheque, youd be covered for the whole poundthe company went out of business and you didnt get your camera.Can I still use my gt vouchers after a company has gone into administration A number of high street stores have refused to allow customers to use gt vouchers after going into administration. Unfortunately, this is within the law.But,the administrator takes this decision its worth waiting a few days to seeit will change its mind.If your gt vouchers are refused, you need to make a claim in writing to the administrators with proof of your vouchers.You can find the name of the administrator on the website of the retailer that has gone into administration.But theres no guarantee youll get all of your money back, and it could take up to  months to process the claim properly. And, not all administrators will take this approach.If you want to get your money back, you can use our template letter to claim a refund for vouchers from a bust company.Can I make a chargeback claim for gt vouchers If a company is accepting gt vouchers then chargeback claims will not be accepted.If gt vouchers arent being accepted and you bought gt vouchers on your card, you should be able to put in a chargeback request to your bank on the grounds that the vouchers are fundamentally dferent from what you paid for.This is because you expected to be able to exchange the vouchers for goods of a certain value and instead theyre worthless.If the vouchers were given to you as a gt, its trickier to make this argument. The person who received a voucher as a gt cant make a claim.But the person who bought the vouchers could put in a chargeback request to the bank. You can use our letter template to help you make a chargeback claim.Its worth noting though, that theres no guarantee the administrators will accept chargeback claims.Can I get my cashback If you were supposed to get cashback as part of your purchase, it depends on how the cashback offer was set up - you may still receive it.Check the terms and conditions to see whether the offer is backed by the manufacturer , or whether the cashback claim should be made to the retailer.If the manufacturer is providing the cashback, your claim shouldnt be affected.If its the retailer, you could still put in a claim and they would be in breach of contractthey didnt send the cash.If you didnt get the cash, unfortunately, you couldnt take court action against the retailer while its in administration.If at the end of the administration the retailer stopped trading, youd need to lodge your claim for unpaid cashback with the administrators."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-tiers-no-changes-east-lothian-remains-level-2","story":"That means neighbouring Midlothian will remain in Level  Covid restrictions for another week after the First Minister said no changes would be made this week.Speaking to the Scottish Parliament today , Nicola Sturgeon said that good progress was being made in pushing down the spread of coronavirus across Scotland.While East Lothian stays in Level , hopes that neighbouring Midlothian would join it were dashed as the First Minister saidthere was still a need to ldquostrengthen and solidy the progress made.She told MSPs: ldquoThe sacrices everyone is making are making a dference, they are getting case numbers down, reducing the numbers getting ill and needing hospital care, and so protecting the NHS and saving lives.ldquoAlthough we are encouraged by the impact current restrictions have had, the need to strengthen and solidy that progress means we should continue to take care and err on the side of caution.Ms Sturgeon said that no local authority would see a level change this week following a weekly review but indicated changes were likely to be brought in next week.That means Edinburgh also remains in Level  and West Lothian in Level ."},{"url":null,"title":"100-new-affordable-homes-delivered-east-lothian-year","story":"Tenants have been collecting keys to  new council houses which East Lothian Council took ownership of in Haddington in the last few months, with a further  on the same estate due to be handed over by the end of this year.However, the local authority has revealed that despite the closure of construction sites for large parts of the year, it has continued to bring forward affordable housing.SInce September, the council has also taken ownership of seven new homes in Dunbar and  at Pinkie, Musselburgh.And during the year, six homes at Dovecot, Haddington, and  new homes at Limeylands, Ormiston, were handed over to East Lothian Housing Association for social rent.An additional  new extra-care council houses at Elder Street, Tranent, are due to be handed over to East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership.The latest handover of  homes at Letham Mains in Haddington, one of the largest new developments in East Lothian, includes two wheelchair-accessible homes.Justine Holmes, who got the keys to her new home at Letham Mains in September, is delighted and says the move has been le-changing for her and her two children.Justine, , said: ldquoWe have had a hard three years.

I was with St Andrewrsquos until October.ldquoI was approved to begin applying for my first charge just as the UK was entering lockdown in March.ldquoIt was clear there wasnrsquot going to be anything normal about the process of looking for a church.ldquoBut Northesk was actually the first parish profile on the Church of Scotland website at which I looked.ldquoI was moved by their expression of care for their ministers.

I like listening to people and hearing their stories. If anyone sees me in the street, please stop me, introduce yourself, and say hello. Irsquod be delighted to meet you.ldquoMy plans for the church will be made in conversation with the congregation after spending time with them and listening to where they have been, where they are now, and where they want to go. We know there is a lot of work to do but I am personally very excited for the possibilities that are before us.ldquoRight now, wersquore looking forward to the season of Advent and Christmas. I know things will feel very dferent this year at Christmas because of the pandemic but Irsquom hoping that Northesk can continue to be a place where people can come and celebrate joy and the hope of the birth of Jesus, whether at home or in person.In her free time, Ms Cohen enjoys bird-watching and is delighted to be so close to Levenhall Links.She said: ldquoI enjoy walking with my husband.

Regroup your greensA quick and easy way to make a dramatic display is to gather up houseplants that might usually live in separate rooms of your house and group them together, either in the middle of the dining table or on a hallway side table.Rather than repotting the plants, buy pots which will fit the plant with its existing pot, meaning that when its time to take down the decorations you can simply pop them out andthem to their usual home.. Add some sparkleTwinkling fairy lights instantly add magic and they are the ideal way to bring some sparkle to houseplants. Drape lights around branches and foliage as you would do with your traditional tree, making sure that the set is suitable for your plant.Avoid anything too heavy that the plant wont be able to comfortably hold the weight of. Choose battery-operated fairy lights so you dont have to worry about placing plants near a power source - the battery pack is easy enough to subtly hide below the top of the pot.If you are looking for an alternative tree with eco credentials that wont take up too much room, the Araucarialooks like a mini tree. Unlike the cut iety though, you can keep it all year round as it can go outside through the summer months then brought back in each Christmas.. Wrap it upWrapping paper doesnt need to be saved for concealing gts. Instead, use it to dress your plants and their pots, rather like giving your houseplants Christmas jumpers! Create a cone-like shape around your houseplant to give it a speedy transformation - simple, sleek and stylish, its cost-effective too.. Frame your plantAs well as adding decorations to existing houseplants, you can frame plants to give them a festive look. A wire frame planted over a miniature Christmas tree with added lights will add a Scandinavian vibe. Choose one which is small enough to be easily portable, so you can use it to bring festive cheer to ious parts of your home, from the dining table to your home office desk.. Add festive accessories to terrariumsSelf contained and mess-free, terrariums can be easily updated so they become part of your festive decor. Wrap a ribbon around bottle-shaped containers, pop in a few mini baubles or add a lightweight set of warm white micro lights within the glass dome.The trick is to not over-complicate, as terrariums look best styled more simply to avoid detracting too much from the plants on display inside.. Keep it greenOne of the easiest ways to lt a room is the addition of some greenery. Consider a large plant such as Fiddle-leaf figwhich can grow to more than ft and is sure to make a statement. An all year-round star of the show, it might even be an alternative Christmas tree of choice for unconventional decorators.Mix up plants of dferent sizes, from cheese plantsand overhead hanging plants like Curly Spider, or String of Pearls. For an organic look, accessorise plants with natural colours and materials like wood and rattan. To go the extra green mile, frame windows with a garland of fresh foliage and string lights. A celebration of all things green, your living space will feel like a cosy indoor garden oasis."},{"url":null,"title":"Rosemary Goring  Mower is less when it comes to making your garden bloom","story":"DEATH to the lawnmower, dump the leaf blower, ditch the power hose. Such is the controversial message from Francesca Osowska, the chief executive of NatureScot, formerly known as Scottish Natural Heritage. In some quarters shersquoll be preaching to the converted.

If parks were kept less like Centre Court at Wimbledon and more like a stretch of meadow or marsh you might find in the heart of the countryside, towns and cities could soon be alive with the sound of birdsong and bees.Osowskarsquos ambition is to spark a radical sht ndash you might call it a renaissance ndash in the way we see parks and gardens. Changing our perspective, she hopes, will not only help wildle but signicantly benefit humankind too. She believes the Covid  crisis, for instance, can be directly linked to the shrinking acreage allowed for nature. As she explains: ldquoThe increasing intensity of livestock farming, deforestation, crop monocultures, globalisation and large urban environments all make viral transference more likely and rapid once viruses enter human populations. Give more room to the wild, she suggests, and as balance is restored, the risk of viruses crossing barriers from animal to human, as in the recent case of Danish mink farms, will be reduced.Whatever the science of pandemics, and the validity of Osowskarsquos conclusions, for most of us the idea of letting things run amok at the bottom of the garden already makes sense. We donrsquot need the carrot or stick incentive of warding against another global pandemic to commit to a bit of scrubland. In fact, the wilding memo has been in circulation among gardeners for decades. Many were fighting a rearguard action against climate change and loss of bioersity long before it became fashionable. This silent army, in fleeces and wellington boots, has been largely unsung, but the rewards have been rich. The abundance of flora and fauna that populated their gardens turned them into a communal space in the widest sense.Reshaping our ideas of civic parks might be a bigger challenge. Irsquove always found immaculate flowerbeds and bowling green grass faintly depressing, a pale imitation of the countryside and its teeming fields and woods. A pale imitation, indeed, of my own garden, where unkemptness has been elevated to an art form. Yet for some, the word park is synonymous with symmetry and order, with every begonia in its place, like an immaculate table setting, and the lawns to be admired but not trodden.Even so, Irsquod say Osowska is pressing on an open door. Formality, in almost every sphere of le, is becoming a thing of the past. The days of parkies yelling at those who stepped off the path now seem almost comical. Most of us, I am sure, would prefer a more casual landscape, less geometrical, more random. How much more relaxing to take a stroll in a place where grasses and bushes sway in the wind, shrubberies are tangled and dense, and the sound of birdsong and of children running through the long grass drowns out the strimmer or chainsaw.Itrsquos amazing how swtly new ideas about outdoor space take hold. A century ago, most peoplersquos gardens were more like allotments, primarily for growing fruit and veg, with flowers and shrubs a decorative indulgence. Lawn for leisure or aesthetic pleasure was a luxury. When the mood changed, and gardens became an outdoor room, the lettuce bed and potato drills were banished. Now, as the pendulum swings back to a point somewhere between the two, awareness about giving nature more space is catching on. Butthe prospect of untamed grass and weeds dismays you, there are countless other ways of nurturing nature.When it comes to green spaces, the climate emergency has opened peoplersquos eyes to the importance of creative mess, of not sweeping and tidying every inch asit were our kitchen, but allowing it to breathe. Something as simple as a heap of undisturbed leaves, a bundle of sticks or wall of logs, allows hedgehogs and other mammals to survive the winter. Rotting foliage and flowers run to seed are a breakfast buffet for birds and insects, who in turn are prey for other hungry wildle. In spring and summer, therersquos nothing richer for flying insects than nettles which, being so quick to replenish themselves, are also good for soup. Or so neighbours tell me.But in case you are about to throw away the key to the garden shed, this is not an excuse for letting nature take over. Some husbandry is essential, to ensure plants and trees thrive to the best of their abilities, and are not overpowered by the thugs of the undergrowth.So the lawnmower is by no means the greatest threat to our future. Itrsquos not something I can get rid of, since we donrsquot own one. Butwe did not have the grass trimmed throughout the summer by a roving gardener whose machine is tough enough to cut a path through heather, it would be thigh-high by the start of June. Green-fingered friends who regularly trim their grass use the cuttings for compost, thereby improving the soil. In other words, all grass is good. And no matter how you let yours grow, whether it is buzzcut or left to its own devices, it is infinitely better than covering the ground in concrete or stone. Soon we will look back on gardens turned into car parks with disbelief. How could we suffocate the land like this  In the meantime, long may your weeds and wallflowers grow ."},{"url":null,"title":"mark-smith-opinion-farewell-debenhams-dont-blame-pandemic","story":"But no, because it was the same before all this happened, wasnrsquot it  Let me think.

But the department store had become less and less part of my le. How often do I visit one now  Twice a year maybe  Once You see the problem, donrsquot you  Debenhams hasnrsquot gone bust because of the pandemic, the pandemic has merely caused it to go bust sooner. The trends that killed it ndash inevitable trends ndash were there already. Department stores had become expensive compared to the internet. Young people in particular had stopped going. Even older people like me had got out of the habit. We still liked department stores, or the thought of them, but we werenrsquot shopping in them.But could Debenhams still have been saved,things had been dferent  The signs say no. The Glaswegian Instagrammer Abbie Blyth is  and actually worked in Debenhams at one point, but she says women in her age group didnrsquot go. ldquoI feel like my mum and my gran go to Debenhams for a day out and work their way through all the dferent levels, she says, ldquowhereas I didnrsquot feel like anyone my age would do that. I wouldnrsquot think, lsquoIrsquom going to Debenhamsrsquo unless there was something in particular that I could only get there.This is not necessarily a fatal wound: old people spend money too. But even here, the trend was bad. Before the pandemic, older people were increasingly shopping online. And then, the enforced close-down and the enforced wearing of masks, and the concern about the virus that goes with it, meant that fewer and fewer people were going into town centres. If you donrsquot believe therersquos been a change, ask your postie, who has to lug all the parcels.But, irresistible though these trends are, we are twisting the kne in other ways. Millions have been spent on trying to keep shops and businesses viable, through furlough, in the hope that one day we might go back to the way things were: landlords, governments, and councils earning millions from high-street businesses in rent, and parking fees, and business rates.However, that system ndash the one wersquove been trying to maintain through furlough ndash was creaking a long time before the pandemic. Businesses like Debenhams and Philip Greenrsquos Arcadia could no longer afford to pay the rent and taxes on their network of stores. But the landlords, and the governments, and the councils would not budge. They thought they could keep squeezing and more money would come out, but they have squeezed some businesses to death.Glasgow, for example. In the middle of the crisis, the city council refused to consider a long-term ban on car parking charges to encourage people into town, even though we know one of the reasons people use out-of-town malls is because the parkingrsquos free.There is the same counter-productive attitude on taxes. The  Barclay review into business rates was supposed to make the system better and to some extent it will ndash reviewing the rates every three years instead of five for instance. But even at three years, rates are not reviewed often enough, and the problem is even more acute now that the pandemic has shown us how quickly things can change. City centre rates are also still way too high compared to the rates for out-of-town.And there isnrsquot much sign that wersquove learned the lessons. The Scottish Governmentrsquos budget watchdog the Scottish Fiscal Commission has projected that the business rates burden is likely to rise by % by  . You can hear the sound of squeezing.Cutting these taxes would not change the other underlying trend ndash most of us are shopping on the high street less than we were. But it would at least acknowledge that we cannot continue behaving asit were  or  even. Councils and governments can keep on squeezing businessesthey like.

I have seen first-hand that for many men and women who have left prison, or are in the process of transitioning out, their first point of call is SISCO. This transition from incarceration is unstable, and the statistical evidence of re-offending within Scotland is one of the highest in Western Europe. To combat this, we have placed a whole-person approach to recovery initiatives at the core of our charity model, where multiple pathways are offered to iniduals caught up in the cycle of addiction. Recovery Cafes are an integral component of this approach, and are primarily peer-led and self-policed for prisoners, by prisoners, in order to ensure that they are at the heart of every decision that is made, and to offer a safe environment to address complex needs and the traumas associated with addiction.For many small third sector organisations, the pandemic has developed an adverse charitable climate rooted in a lack of public awareness, a lack of Government support, and extreme competition for charitable grants and funds. Grants and funds are few and far between, and alongside being highly competitive, large multi-million pound charities and organisations often monopolise them ndash meaning that smaller charities, have to fight even harder for an even smaller piece of a grant or fund. This paradigm of monopolisation is further exacerbated by obscure Government priorities and policies. Upon contacting several MSPs and ministers, including the Cabinet Secretary for Justice, we have been met with broken promises and an overall disinterest in our cause. Governmental support is vital to a cause like ours, support from MSPs and ministers offer direct connections to ious grants, funds, and most importantly to the general publicrsquos awareness. Without grants or ministerial support, the rate at which we can engage the wider public about our cause moves at a slower pace. Ultimately, this leads to a lack of public donations, awareness, and the stigma commonly attached to the men and women who have experienced imprisonment is left unchallenged.To ensure the future of our charity ndash and most likely many other small third sector organisations ndash the way economic, political, and social spheres interact with these organisations needs to change and adapt to the new conditions laid out by the pandemic. Grants and funds need to become more transparent in where funding is directed, which can be done by preventing the grant from pooling at the top, and instead, taking a trickle-down approach where the grant spreads to smaller organisations more effectively. MSPs and ministers need to demonstrate a more visible support for third sector organisations, and emphasise inclusivity in regards to what causes are deemed a priority. By addressing these issues, engagement and public awareness will increase which actively increases donations, discourse, and challenges the stigma attached to the experiences of incarceration.Samuel Marriott-Dowding is communications officer with SISCO"},{"url":null,"title":"TV REVIEW   Marr names his movers and shakers in New Elizabethans  Any surprises ","story":"BBC iPlayer***WATCHING popular history can be a perilous game. The viewer has to keep an eye out for a gimmick-hungry presenter who might suddenly appear in fancy dress , or lurch into creeping Jesus mode .No such worries during New Elizabethans with Andrew Marr. Or so you might have thought.There he was at the despatch box in the Commons, telling us about Churchill addressing the house on the death of George VI. The PMs voice rang out in audio.Good old Andy. Class act. You can rely on him not to do anything so cheesy as a Churchill impersonation. And then he did. It was a cautionary reminder that no presenter can resist hamming it up given half a chance.Marrrsquos central idea, to be set out over three episodes, was that the ascent to the throne of Queen Elizabeth in  ushered in an era of huge change that led to the UK as we know it today. The transformation was led by iniduals he called ldquochange-makers or ldquonew Elizabethans.The first episode, shown last night, was titled ldquoBuilding a new Society. Step forward Jan Morris, Nancy Mitford, Diana Dors, Ruth Ellis and others. Marr promised to avoid the usual suspects in favour of ldquocurious and creative characters and for the most part he made good on that.But there were still some disappointingly obvious selections, such as Mary Whitehouse , and there was no-one to alarm even the most skittish of horses.A swaggering Weegie in the shape of Alan McGee was as rock and roll as the first episode could muster.McGee left school at  with one Orsquolevel, Marr told us. But like others during the Thatcher years he knew a good deal in the Enterprise Allowance when he saw it. Under this scheme the Government paid pound a week to anyone starting their own business.McGee used the money to found Creation Records.ldquoFor me, said Marr, ldquoAlan McGee is a true Elizabethan, both a product of the time and a powerful influence on the age. [He] tells us a lot about the shts to class and opportunity that were happening in Scotland and much of the rest of Britain during the s.The son of a mechanic and a shop worker, McGee came of working age when the old industries were gone and the new, service and leisure sectors were starting to boom.ldquoBy his early s he was a self-made millionaire, said Marr. After a night in King Tutrsquos in Glasgow he signed a popular beat combo by the name of Oasis. McGeersquos fame grew to the point where he was ldquowarmly embraced by the new, cool Britannia establishment led by Tony Blair. Cue *that* embarrassing footage of Noel Gallagher and McGee at a Downing Street reception.Another Scot makes an appearance in the final instalment, airing on December . Jimmy Reid is introduced as ldquothe shop steward with Elvis Presley hair.Marr recently named him as one of his top six New Elizabethans. He does not hide his admiration, telling viewers: ldquoJimmy Reid was one of the most compelling, charismatic and well-educated New Elizabethans of them all hellip He was determined to be a voice for the working classes and to recty what he saw as the deep injustices of British society.There is a clip from Reidrsquos famous ldquono bevvying speech and film of Billy Connolly, welder as was, turning up to show his support, as well as footage of the mass march to Glasgow Green.There are connections to Scotland where in the list, including Roy Jenkins, courtesy of his stint as MP for Hillhead, and the architect Zaha Hadid, the architectural visionary behind the Riverside Museum in Glasgow.Where Marr excelled was in creating a bigger picture, forging links through the ages. Thus a line was traced from Reid to Hadid via the Clyde, and from anti-nuclear campaigner Helen John to the march against the Iraq war.Surprisingly, given the title, the person least covered was the Queen herself. There were many shots of cheering crowds, though.Marr insisted there had been change in the monarchy, too. To film of the family on the balcony at Buckingham Palace, he says, ldquoIf you look carefully the Buckingham Palace balcony today seems a little less remote. Really Overall, a glitzy zip through seven decades with captivating footage and a poptastic soundtrack.

Whilst a proportion has an anti-vax agenda, I suspect that many are simply fearful of being asked to take a vaccine that is based upon new technology and whilst testing has been undertaken it has been truncated and we have no idea what the medium to long-term implications will be,any.The Government and the scientic community reassure us that it is safe and have pushed through approval at breakneck speed.Sadly, history is pockmarked with numerous examples of safe medicines that have turned out to be far from that and we also know that governments are capable of leading us to war for the flimsiest of reasons. Trust needs to be earned.The television media uses vox pops to marginalise concerns by focusing upon the Jimmy-from-Glasgow types and their \"Ahm no takin the vaccine coz its made by aliens an ma heidll faw aff.\" Give us some credit for considered opinions, please.Like them or not, the daily party political health broadcasts have become the most important vector for communicating updates to the public and attract high viewership.It seems logical to me then to propose that the BBC and other news channels host a live debate where Government and state and corporate scientists can explain the science, what is in the vaccine and exactly how it works.It would only be fair to permit those within the scientic community who have concerns over safety and efficacy, assuming such exist, to have a formal  for their views with a respected member of the civil rights lobby also being permitted to balance the political narrative.Live debates are used for far more mundane purposes than a vaccine that will have implications for the whole nation.Equally,Government and science is sure that the vaccine is entirely safe then what do they have to fear by exposing the matter to full scrutiny Fraser Kelly, Glasgow G.WHAT a splendid article by Helen McArdle . It clearly explains that in medicine, as in le, nothing can be  per cent guaranteed. But had William Jenner not set in motion the principle of vaccination  years ago, we might still be living with the scourge of smallpox and many other diseases.During the summer, there occurred an event which should have made banner headlines throughout the worldndash the eradication of polio from the continent of Africa, due in no small part to the efforts of Rotary International and Bill Gatesrsquo money in the worldwide vaccination programme.Because of the lack of regulation and control over social media, the anti-vaxers exert undue influence over those who have had, who believe they have had, or who believe they might get, an adverse effect from a vaccine. It is obviously no consolation to those who have tragically lost loved ones in the current pandemic, but the actual death rate is only .% of the population. The Spanish flu it ainrsquot.Hopefully, everyone will be lining up to get the vaccines when they become available. The country cannot stay shut down indefinitely.John NE Rankin, Bridge of Allan.WITH many manufacturers of a Covid- vaccine at ious stages of development and testing, the winner may prove to be the one which can produce a safe and effective vaccine which will require only a single injection and which can be stored and distributed at temperatures at which other vaccines are usually handled.The logistical challenges which will be encountered in a global vaccination using any of the recently announced vaccines should not be underestimated. The uptake in less developed countries with scattered populations in remote areas served by limited transport make the search for an approved single-dose vaccine of great importance.

Businesses need to act now! This is true for retail, those trading in consumer goods, services and investment, construction and housing as well as vehicle and haulier firms. The UK Government has put a raft of measures in place for all firms across England, Scotland and Wales. Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Michael Gove said: “We are leaving the EU single market and customs union. This will bring both new challenges and new opportunities for businesses. We recognise this is a challenging time for everyone. We are determined to support businesses to be ready for  January  and beyond. ”These are actions to take now#Procurement expert Laura Hobbs has led the way for the construction industry to prepare for the end of the UK transition period. Laura is the UK and Ireland One Procurement Programme Lead at Royal BAM Group, which is among the biggest construction firms covering England, Wales and Scotland. She said: “We have created a snapshot to give a clear picture for the industry where we believe pinch points are.” Laura explained: “I decided to pull my peers together, all the other main contractors that are part of the Construction Senior Leaders Group which I chair. We decided to write one set of questions for the end of UK transition and also share the workload – to go to all those dferent product categories key to construction.“As main contractors we deal a lot with sub-contractors so we need to ensure the message gets further into the supply chain.”The Construction Senior Leaders Group also includes representatives from Skanska, Costain, Murphys, Laing O’Rourke, housebuilders Berkeley and clients including Highways UK and Clarion Housing Group. Manufacturers are employing new customs experts to help them get in position for the new start, creating more strategic programmes to negate any currency fluctuations. Laura worked with Build UK, receiving useful information around imports and exports from the UK Government. “Information is the key and preparation is essential. The organisations we work with have been preparing for this for a long time so they are on their final rehearsal now. “To be able to give your own business the comfort you are going into this in a planned, coordinated way, it is key for people to start the exercise sooner rather than later,” stressed Laura. She said the new start will bring opportunities to invest in the UK supply chain. “We always see the positives and, definitely for the UK, there are opportunities coming.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Those who have worked tirelessly to make it a reality so quickly, including volunteers for the testing programme, deserve our profound gratitude. “However, attentions must now turn to the practicalities of distributing the vaccine to all corners of the country in what will surely be one of the largest public health exercises in history. It is vital that our islands are not left behind and that appropriate steps are taken to guarantee equal access to the vaccine.“The Pfizer vaccine requires freezer storage and that presents practical dficulties in our island and rural communities.  I was therefore pleased that the Health Secretary was able to give me a categoric assurance that freezer storage will indeed be available in the islands and that priority groups in Orkney will form part of the initial roll out.“Further details about how this process will work in practice, including how any subsequent vaccines might be incorporated in the programme, are obviously needed.

Time is in very short supply and we are at a very dficult point in the talks.ldquoWhat is certain is we will not be able to agree a deal that doesnrsquot respect our fundamental principles on sovereignty, fishing and control.ldquoOur negotiating team is working extremely hard in order to bridge the gaps that remain.We agreed to pause the talks in order to brief our Principals on the state of play of the negotiations. President @vonderleyen and Prime Minister Johnson will discuss the state of play tomorrow afternoon.mdash Michel BarnierDecember , After months of circling round the same key issues, there had been hopes that this weekend would be the point when the two sides would finally make the moves needed to get an agreement over the line.At the same time there had been an expectation that Mr Johnson and Mrs von der Leyen would have to come together to resolve the most problematic issues.With little time left for the two sides to raty any agreement before the end of the year, the pressure exposed underlying tensions within the EU.Irish premier Micheal Martin, whose country is expected to be among the biggest losersthe two sides failed to reach an agreement, said he ldquofervently hoped there would be a deal.In comments apparently aimed at the French, he said the negotiators had to be given the space to conclude their discussions. vw,vw,px, px\"Taoiseach Micheal Martin says he lsquoferventlyrsquo hopes there will be a deal ldquoI have faith and trust in the EU negotiating team, in Michel Barnier and in president Ursula von der Leyen, he said.ldquoThere have been some countries putting pressure on wanting to seek additional information ndash  states canrsquot negotiate collectively.ldquoWersquove got to allow them the space to conclude their talks and hopefully achieve an agreement out of this.Meanwhile, Mr Beaune, an ally of President Emmanuel Macron, told Europe  radio that France will not accept a deal with ldquobad terms.ldquoIf a good agreement cannot be reached, we will oppose it. Each country has a veto right, so it is possible, he said.If there is an agreement in the coming days, it could be signed off by EU leaders at a two-day summit in Brussels starting on Thursday ndash their last scheduled gathering of the year.In a further complicating factor, the UK Government is bringing back to the Commons legislation enabling it to override elements of Mr Johnsonrsquos ldquoorce settlement with Brussels in breach of international law.On Monday, MPs will vote on whether to overturn amendments by the House of Lords which removed the provisions in the UK Internal Market Bill relating to the Irish border.The legislation has infuriated the EU and ndashit is passed ndash could sour the mood in the negotiations making a deal harder to reach.copy -.

We#re not at the end of this yet and, of course, we cannot and must not let up on our efforts to control it.#But today does feel like it may well be the beginning of the end of this horrible experience.#For that reason, I#m sure I#m far from the only one who feels a lightness of heart that I haven#t felt in quote some time.#The first doses will go to those who are carrying out the vaccinations, followed by other health and social care workers .Those deemed most clinically vulnerable, such as elderly care home residents, are also in line for the first phase of the roll-out.However, due to the need to store the Pfizer vaccine at -C, questions have been asked as to whether rural areas may not receive the doses as quickly as urban areas, due to transportation issues.Highlands and Islands MSP Jamie Halcro Johnson issued a statement this morning, welcoming the vaccine news, but also calling for the roll-out to take into accountthe challenges of delivering the vaccine to island and rural communities.Chief medical officer Gregor Smith gave assurances at today#s briefing that the infrastructure was in place to ensure the vaccine would be deployed #right across Scotland#.#It doesn#t matter whether to are in a rural area or an urban area,# he said.#So every health board has the ability to store the vaccine and will be able to provide it to their local populations.#And my expectation is that, barring any logistical hitches, we will be able to deploy those vaccines next week at the same time.#However, when quizzed further about reaching islands, in particular, Dr Smith conceded the logistics were #complex and huge#.He highlighted the prospect of dferent vaccines which were expected to be approved in the near future, which are easier to store and transport.Dr Smith also acknowledged it may take longer to determine how doses could be transported within communities, for instance to reach care home residents.Everyone receiving this form of the vaccine will need to take two doses - days apart, which will mean the first people to complete it will do so in the early New Year.It will take longer for the vaccine to be rolled out across the wider population.Ms Sturgeon said the military had been brought in to help with its deployment.She described it as the the #biggest logistical peacetime challenge this nation has ever taken#Addressing concerns raised by some that the vaccine had been approved too quickly, Ms Sturgeon and Dr Smith both insisted it was safe and encouraged everyone entitled to it to take it without hesitation.Whilst welcoming the prospect of greater normality ing, they also reminded folk to stick with the guidance in the meantime...Ive been a reporter since  at newspapers in Lincolnshire and East Anglia.

Another would involve a change to soft drink sales.She added: “We have a drinks chiller at the front but were looking at introducing a bar restaurant-style system where fizzy drinks come from mixer taps.“If we could get something like that, we would be saving not just on bottles but also the water used for these which is transported around the country and is another waste.“That is quite a big investment, though, so I wouldn’t be able to consider that without a grant.”Zero Waste Scotland has said it will administer a total of £, in grant funding provided by the Scottish Government and European Regional Development Fund to empower island shops to take the next steps in the war on waste by ditching single-use packaging and moving to reusable options.It says that the new scheme would see cash made available to existing small and medium-sized enterprises in the isles to make the transition to package free dispensers.“My shop is so small, it is not just about fitting in the new stuff but also about moving everything  around so I don’t lose the things that I sell which enables me to pay staff and support the local community,” she said.“We have tried to do what we can within our budget. We do glass milk bottles for people, we have dispensing units for refills for washing up liquid and laundry liquid.“There are things that I have looked at that we can do, and sothey had just given us that money I applied for then I would have been really happy!”The scheme opened on th October, but Nancy stressed that wasn’t a great deal of time for small business owners like her.“It sounds like a lot of time but when you are running a shop it isn’t very long. We had to get three dferent quotes for some of these things,” she said.“I’m in the shop five and a half days a week — and my afternoons off have been spent on the phone and the internet scoping out possible projects. I don’t really have the extra time it takes to do it.”She added: “If I can’t come out with a scheme then we don#t get anything is my understanding at the moment.“I know it is worth putting a bit of effort in, though, becauseit does work I can really make a dference to the shop and the environment.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/kate-forbes.jpg","title":"summit on future of gaelic as a community","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe summit on Tuesday st December, pm, will be co-chaired by Kate Forbes, constituency MSP for Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch.

There are still plenty of people in Skye and Raasay with Gaelic, and it can still be heard throughout the island.“Urgent work is required to save Gaelic, but as a living language it won’t be politicians, bureaucracy or tokenistic gestures that make the dference.

Everyone needs to think very carefully about the risks posed to them, and their loved ones, by coming together over the Christmas period, particularly to those who are vulnerable.

Pancakes and tea for pre-school breakfast, check. School run done, check.Arriving home again just as Mrs B leaves for work, two cats and a dog sit patiently at the door awaiting their morning run in the garden. They#re actually in a queue, not a squabble between them.In the peace and quiet of an hour before work, the fresh laundry which has been gathering in baskets in the hall since last weekend is sorted. Once again there are several single socks. They#re added to the growing lonely socks club pile. Two more loads of washing are underway. A little of the old normal penetrates the new. There#s no concrete developments on the who#s visiting who over Christmas saga, but the options might just have been reduced by one to make things easier.Mouse trouble is escalating at my sister-in-law#s house. The queue to visit her is getting short.Three casualties upstairs, two in the kitchen in the past couple of days.She doesn#t help herself by googling the mating habits of mice and finding out that they breed up to ten times a year, and do so all year round. She#s getting a calculator out to work out the mathematics of the situation and how many more traps she needs to buy before she can find a cat and posting the results on the family whatsapp group to a response of several vomiting emojis. We all decide thatwe do have to visit, we#ll be off to the shop for a packet of elastic bands to keep the trouser legs tight.The Galaxy Caramel minis have overtaken the Snickers in popularity as the tub of Celebrations continues to diminish. I#ll have to wait until Christmas before I get my hands on a Malteaser or Twix then.Just when I think the drama of le is something happening where today, a crisis develops with an SOS message from Belfast. We have a mobile phone down. And -year-old lad without a phone is a crisis to behold. A crack in the screen has quickly developed into a full blown disintegration. It#s going to be a ring round all the repair shops I can find to seeany are open.They should be deemed essential shops, Rowan laments. Several phone calls later I find one. He can probably see it from his flat just off the Lisburn Road. The gods can stop their chuckling.Later, the kitten and the dog square off over the last sausage roll. The dog foolishly sets it down to bark in triumph. The kitten snatches it, races around the kitchen and shoots off up the stairs with her prize. I#m reminded of a certain eye-gouging Game of Thrones scene fans may recall. Gloating doesn#t pay, but at least there was no death involved this time. The dog hunts forlornly around the sofa in the hope she hid something there before. Her hidden treasures have long since been removed. All she can do is stand at the bottom of the stairs and bark her disapproval. To think we used to pay for dinner and a show.

Despite urging from teachers, unions and politicians the DUP MLA is adamant schools will close on December  as planned. It is disappointing that despite my clear statement on November  that schools will not close early, there continues to be widespread rumours about this matter. I will once again stress that there are no plans to extend the Christmas holidays for schools, Mr Weir said.Speculation has also emerged that schools may close for an elongated holiday period in January.

Current support schemes also remain in place for businesses unable to reopen.Will there be any more restrictions introduced before Christmas  First Minister Arlene Foster has said that there would be no more restrictions introduced in Northern Ireland before Christmas.We#re trying to make sure people have a good Christmas and can come together in a safe way, she saidWhat are the rules around Christmas  Families in Northern Ireland will be reunited for five days over Christmas after ministers from across the UK agreed to relax coronavirus restrictions.Up to three households will be allowed to mix in bubbles from December  to  and families can travel from one part of the UK to another.The households will be allowed to come together in domestic settings, outdoor public spaces and places of worship.

I will once again stress that there are no plans to extend the Christmas holidays for schools.Mr Weir reiterated that message in response to a Belfastquery.But Ms Dawson told this newspaper that she believed schools should close on December .Schools need to close to pupils and staff on December  as any confirmed cases in school after that date could and would result in pupils and staff having to self-isolate over the Christmas holidays - and even on Christmas Day, she said.December  is a day we have longed for to see loved ones and be with family, a day to play with toys Santa has brought and to show them to grandparents, a day we have just longed for even more so than ever in this pandemic.Ms Dawson said teachers aren#t asking for time off and suggested remote learning from December  to .Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClosePrincipal Diane Dawson FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":truePrincipal Diane Dawson We just want us, and our pupils, to have Christmas, she said.My staff, my pupils and their families need Christmas more this year than they need five school days at the end of term that would be normally filled with Nativity and Key Stage performances, Christmas art, a DVD morning, parties, etc, and that will allow confirmed cases to arise in that time.The primary school principal said Mr Weir#s refusal to close schools early could put teachers and pupils at risk of missing Christmas.Should the Minister#s current stance of no early closure remain and, confirmed cases from December  cause staff and pupils to isolate up to or on Christmas Day, it appears that #The Grinch who stole Christmas# may very well be the Minister this year, Ms Dawson said.And she urged him to reconsider closing early in these unprecedented times so that no one is denied ChristmasLet#s look carefully at when those doors should open and close this year so families can enjoy the festive period, she added.Mr Gault, who is president of the National Association of Head Teachers, said parents were worried about potential disruption to their Christmas plans in the event of children testing positive for Covid in the last week of term.Understandably, the main concern voiced by many of our parents is that they won#t be able to spend Christmas with their loved ones should their child be identied as a close contact, he said.We have been telling them that Minister Weir has claried that schools will not be closing early before Christmas.Mr Gault also called on the Ministers of Health and Education to make a joint statement so that families can have certainty over the holiday season.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClosePrincipal Graham Gault FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":truePrincipal Graham Gault I have written to the Minister of Health to askhe foresees any risk to the Christmas plans of families andhe can make a joint statement with Minister Weir with regards to this so that families can have certainty in respect of expectations over the holiday season, he said.Mr Gault also praised school children for having been amazing throughout this pandemic and have made their principals so proud.In response to the Belfast , a Department of Education spokesperson said schools should not change or extend their Christmas holidays or close early this term.Children should continue to attend school until the last day of term unless they have been told to self-isolate. Remote learning should only be usedchildren have been told to self-isolate.The change to social restrictions over Christmas does not require children to be taken out of school prematurely.The statement added: The Minister considers that further unnecessary time away from the classroom will only cause greater disruption to children#s education and lead to an increase in levels of stress and anxiety.His main priority is to guard children#s education, mental health and well-being.The Department of Health was also approached but did not wish to comment.

While restaurants will reopen, she said social distancing of two metres will be in place along with an pm curfew as nothing is done without risk.Giving an example of how the family gathering rules would work, she explained that she was currently in a support bubble with her mother.This means they will be allowed to come together with two other households at Christmas.Asked about the latest disappointment for wet pub owners, Mrs Foster said the decision had been based on evidence, but that details of a new support scheme worth £.m would be announced next week.It#s very important that we support those people who we have had to close because of the medical advice but I think overall most people will welcome the fact that non essential retail will be open again, that our churches will be open again.Reacting to the news, Horatio Group boss Stephen Magorrian said he was disappointed for #wet# pub owners but welcomed news of financial support.It needs to be adequate because those guys haven#t been open all year and they#ve invested a lot to be open, and it needs to be timely because they are desperate and they need support now, he said.Mr Magorrian said more clarity was needed on the need for two metres social distancing inside hospitality venues.I#m disappointed with the curfew... because we have a real fear that people will leave and go to house parties.He said financial support for the hospitality sector so far had not been adequate. While grants were announced at the start of the recent lockdown, he said businesses lost money through the new furlough scheme.So for us for example with  employees, it#s costing us £, a week to keep them on furlough so I#ll be glad to get them back next week and try get some funds in, he said.Belfast Most ReadBangor#s green post box mystery solved as Royal Mail explains colour changeMP Hannah Bardell tells of death threats over Lord Maginnis rowHorrying photos show Coleraine man shot in head #lucky to survive#Northern Ireland#s Hollywood Hills: Millionaire pumps entire fortune into row of dream homes near BangorCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Most lockdown restrictions to be lted next weekLatest NewsNI will need Christmas restrictions ‘ virus spread rises signicantly’Directions #confused gran Mona Maye killed in wrong-way crash#, inquest findsCoronavirus pandemic has sparked poverty crisis in Belfast, charity warnsIrish premier ‘fervently’ hopes Brexit deal will be struckHospitality sector gears up for Christmas reopening,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

it comes to the Finucane family and he is adding to their distress by saying what he said and he is only saying it because a person who has passed away cannot be defamed in law or libelled.“I am astounded that he would say that.”Mrs Kelly urged Mr Storey to “reflect” on his remarks.The SDLP representative was also highly critical of Mr Lewis’s handling of the Finucane case.“I really do object to Mervyn’s comments,” she said.“We want to see all victims to get to the truth and justice that they campaign for and that which they deserve.“And we regret the fact, very much so, that the police have been brought in once again by the Secretary of State into the Finucane inquiry and the failure of the British government to uphold its international agreements and obligations, as the Supreme Court judgement reflected on.“We think the Secretary of State has behaved woefully far short of anyone in public le in any level of integrity in relation to victims of the conflict.”\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland ae .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_cbafa-d-c-bbb-caa_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland ae .ece AUTOCROP w

“Overall it reminds us of the dficulties of policing the past and the pain and anger and suspicion that often goes with the investigation of legacy related deaths.“It’s fair to say the previous investigations and reports satisfy us that there remain no viable lines of inquiry.“We will begin the first step of a review process next week after careful consideration, but it’s also worth

said time and again about there should be alternative means of dealing with these issues because they are complex, they are so emotive for all sorts of reasons and it’s an issue that we would prefer

The man bringing the stout-fed trees to your door is Aaron Cleary, who runs FirTreeNI in Belfast.I#d normally have spent the year managing an events company, but all that has been very thin on the ground because of Covid, he said. The events industry and festivals have been gutted.But when I was askedI#d be interested in getting involved in tree deliveries, it was an easy choice. You need something to keep you going.The trees are grown on a farm in Co Wicklow, and when you see them there#s no comparison. You know they#ve been fed on good stuff.He added: There must be something magical in the Guinness - but the only swaying they do is in the breeze before they#re delivered.You always hear old tales of pregnant women being fed Guinness in hospitals to help them stay strong and healthy. There must be a bit of truth in it. And who doesn#t like a good feed of Guinness at Christmas It produces a beautul tree, though - sturdy, lush and green.I don#t think there#s any others out there to match them.And in further proof that the cream really does rise to the top, they have been named as the #Best Trees in Ireland# by The Irish Christmas Trees Growers Association. Aaron added: They#ve been delivered around the Republic of Ireland for the last eight years or so.I#d been asked a couple of times beforeI#d be interested in handling them in Northern Ireland, but usually by the end of November the year has been so busy that I just need a rest. This year has been a little dferent, though.His Guinness-fed trees have already found homes at some local hotels, including The Culloden in Holywood and The Harrison in Belfast.They#re proving really popular, and they#re in the right placethey need a top-up, added Aaron.They#ve also won fans in Northern Ireland football legend Gerry Armstrong and we Debby after they turned up at Rockport School in Cultra to play Santa and Mrs Claus for the kids.Aaron#s Covid-secure delivery and installation team have been putting the trees in place and making sure they don#t #tip-sy# over. When the festive season ends they#ll make sure you don#t end up with a post-Christmas hangover by collecting your tree for recycling.And with Covid closing pubs across Ireland, the trees have been drinking in an extra helping of the famous beer.Since the start of lockdown the Guinness Brewery at St James#s Gate in Dublin has been taking back unsold barrels and redistributing the contents to Christmas tree plantations.Aidan Crowe, the brewery#s director of operations, estimated that hundreds of thousands of kegs had been ed, with the black stuff finding a new role in the soil.Basically, what we#ve been doing is taking all the keg beer back and we decant it and we disperse the product through a number of environmentally sustainable routes, he said.The vast majority of the beer goes to willow and Christmas tree plantations, it#s used as nutrients in those farms.We#ve also erted some product through to anaerobic digesters, where it produces a bio-gas. Actually, we#re quite optimistic that, in the long-term, that bio-gas can be a suitable fuel source for us to use here in the brewery.Anyone who does go down the Guinness-fed, environmentally friendly tree route will also be helping a homeless charity, as the business has paired up with Extern Ireland to support its important work in local communities.Grace O#Neill of Extern said: In the last year Extern has supported over , people in Northern Ireland who have been living with or facing homelessness, and provided over , bed nights for people in our temporary and emergency accommodation. Since the first lockdown in March our staff has continued to work tirelessly to ensure that our doors are never closed. Sadly, we are also seeing on the ground that many people are facing rising poverty and homelessness as a result of the impact of the current pandemic. We are immensely grateful to FirTreeNI for their support, because this year, as well as delivering beautul, sustainable Christmas trees across Northern Ireland, they will also be helping Extern to deliver hope.Visit firtreeni for further details  Belfast   Related ContentNorthern Ireland PremiumTyrone farmer Finnegan is making the cut with his Christmas tree businessDeep in the heart of Tyrone, you should know, there#s a magical place where the Christmas trees grow.

They were far from it”.Justice Minster Helen McEntee and Finance Minster Paschal Donohoe also made calls on Friday for Mr Stanley to appear before the Dail.Ms McEntee herself has had to come before the Dail to answer questions on the appointment of Seamus Woulfe to the Supreme Court following pressure from Sinn Fein.Aside from the tweets, other controversies have come to light this week in relation to the Sinn Fein TD for Laois-Offaly.In a radio interview in March, Mr Stanley suggested that people should not buy chicken from China because of the coronavirus pandemic, despite having little evidence to support the claim.Mr Stanley’s we Dwane Stanley, a Sinn Fein councillor, was condemned by the National Union of Journalists on Friday over a post she made on Facebook.In it, she suggested that the national broadcaster RTE should be defundedSinn Fein gets into government.She wrote: “When SF get into Government one of the first things it should do is remove all public funds from RTE.”NUJ Irish secretary Seamus Dooley said: “While she is entitled to her view on the media, her demand for defunding of RTE based on coverage of matters of legitimate public interest is irrational and should be disowned by Sinn Fein.“Ireland has largely avoided the Trump-like attempts to intimidate the media and Sinn Fein should make it clear that it does not approve of this stance.”On Thursday, Mr Stanley said he had “no apology to make” over the  tweet.Mr Stanley has rejected accusations of homophobia over the tweet he sent when the Tanaiste was elected Fine Gael leader.I don’t have any apology to make to anybody. The point I was making was it’s great that we have achieved the right for gay people and for women and ‘yippee to that’.Brian Stanley, Sinn FeinIt read: “Yippee  d tory. it’s Leo. U can do what u like in bed but don’t look  a pay rise the next morning.”Speaking at the launch of a PAC report on Thursday, Mr Stanley said that his record on campaigning on LGBTI issues “stands for itself”.He added: “I don’t have any apology to make to anybody. The point I was making was it’s great that we have achieved the right for gay people and for women and ‘yippee to that’.“But the point I was making was that we still had the missing piece.

The approval for the Pfizer BioNTech coronavirus vaccine was issued by the Medicines  Healthcare products Regulatory Agency .

Health and social care workers – including care home staff - will be amongst the first priority groups as will care home residents. Further groups will then be added to the programme throughout  based on age and clinical vulnerability factors.

Four more deaths were reported across NI yesterday. googletag.cmd.push The local death toll now stands at . Altnagelvin Hospital has  Covid inpatients, three of whom are in the Intensive Care Unit . Responding to news that the UK has approved the use of the Pfizer BioNTechcoronavirus vaccine, Dr Tom Black, BMA Northern Ireland council chair, said: “This is most welcome and marks an incredible achievement of modern science, given less than a year ago we hadn’t even heard of Covid-, never mind a vaccination against it. “It offers hope that we will finally start to bring the pandemic to an end, but we have never tried to deliver a vaccination programme of this size, and at this speed,and there are many practical hurdles to consider and overcome.     “It’s hugely important that frontline healthcare and social care workers – at the forefront of fighting this terrible virus - are given every opportunity to get the vaccine as quickly as possible, with those at most risk getting it first. “There is no doubt that rolling this vaccine out will be a challenge for our already stretched health service but just as everyone has worked above and beyond for the last few months I am sure that staff will now put as much effort into the vaccination programme rolling out in Northern Ireland. “We will need as much support and unity of purpose as we can muster to ensure that it is a success.” Dr Alan Stout, BMA-NI GP committee chair, added: “Today is a signicant step towards overcoming Covid- and GPs share in the optimism of the rest of the nation as a future beyond the pandemic comes more clearly into sight. “Already practices across Northern Ireland have begun preparation to make sure they can deliver the vaccination to the wider public as soon as it is feasible to do so. “We are working with the Department of Health to make sure that we have clear guidance form them as to how we can best deliver a successful programme across Northern Ireland.” He continued: “We would urge the public to be patient, this will not be delivered overnight and in the meantime we would urge everyone to continue to be vigilant in terms of social distancing, washing hands and wearing a face covering. “This news is not a signal that Covid is over, it is just the beginning of the next stage in our fight against it.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Annemarie Bell’s father, Hugh, died suddenly while showing a worker from The Resource Centre his famous Christmas garden on December , . He was  years of age at the time and had experienced a tough year with infections but remained fit. Hugh loved to decorate the family home at Moyola Walk in Shantallow at Christmas time where there was a ‘real sense of community’. He became known for his impressive festive displays and was hailed as the ‘King of Christmas’. googletag.cmd.push  Just prior to his death, Hugh taught daughter Annemarie how to wire the plugs but, she says, ‘little did I know, I would have to do it again so quickly’. He was well-known in the local community for his walks to Knock and charitable work with the Foyle Hospice, and also helped to organise the first Derry marathons. Annemarie said: “My daddy has been the king of Christmas from I can remember. “When we were young my mother and father smoked and they wrapped fag packets up with wrapping paper and hung them up on the tree. “That’s the tradition that I grew up with and shoe boxes at the bottom of the tree for fake presents. googletag.cmd.push “Our crib was always the centre piece of our home and the main focus of our celebrations.” When the family moved to Mount Vernon in Culmore, Hugh became even more invested in the Christmas season, lighting up hedges and setting up inflatable reindeers in the garden. “I’ve just followed suit now and added new features the past two years,” Annemarie explained. As a youth worker in Pennyburn she erected the Christmas tree as soon as Halloween ended. The spiritual side of Christmas is of most import to the family and as such they would have attended a Christmas nativity event at Thornhill.     The year Hugh died they had around  nativities but Annemarie continued gathering and now has  around the house. A nativity picture is the oldest item in the family’s collection. Sadly, some decorations have been consigned to the past, Annemarie explained: “We had this big inflatable snowman and it was really, really strange. “A big fat giant snowman, we must’ve had it for at least  years and my daddy died on the th and that just went kaput on the st. So, it was strange, it was probably one of his first.” This year, Annemarie says, many people have experienced hardship in the city with a further announcement this week of job cuts. She believes it is important for everyone to get back to basics and think about family and the true meaning of Christmas.  With the pandemic it felt strange for children to be locked indoors all day long. Annemarie reflected: “I think this Christmas is going to be more special for people, we’re more used to living with one another during the pandemic, and young people won’t be looking to run here, there and everywhere. “I’d imagine this year will be more traditional, that family board games will come back. “And people won’t want their children going to other houses. “When you look at the row of houses lit up in Shantallow right now, that is community. “I was driving around after work last night and you see houses lit up that weren’t before and you think to yourself, isn’t that so beautul, so much hope and joy in the community. “For me, that’s why my daddy wanted to do it, to spread some joy.” She added: “The wains are at school at the minute but the binmen were shouting to me, ‘your garden is class, I’m so glad you followed on in your daddy’s footsteps!’ “Those kind of comments from someone out doing his job, that’s what it’s all about.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Dr Anne Kilgallen, Chief Executive, said the Trust is preparing to roll out the COVID- Vaccination Programme – Phase , which is for Health and Social Carestaff. The plan at the moment is to begin on December . The programme is for HSC employees, plus workers in the Independent Sector, Domiciliary Care, Nursing Home Staff, Care Home Staff, Community Pharmacists, Opticians, Dentists, Hospice, GPs and staff. Dr Kilgallen said: “We will be using Pfizer ‘Courageous’ vaccine which requires two doses to be administered. googletag.cmd.push “We will operate from  venues: Foyle Arena and the Leisure Centres at Omagh and Enniskillen, but not every venue will operate every day. “Our plan is to deliver the vaccination programme using  vaccination teams, operating  days per week, excluding Christmas and New Year and to have both doses administered by the end of January .” ‘HUGELY SIGNIFICANT’ Seeking to assure the public about the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine, Chief Medical Officer Dr Michael McBride and Chief Scientic Advisor Professor Ian Young released a joint statement today. They said vaccines have changed our world andexplained that they have been successfully deployed against a wide range of diseases including smallpox, polio, measles and flu. googletag.cmd.push Dr McBride and Prof Young commented: “They have saved many millions of lives. “So the confirmation of the UK’s first regulatory approval for a Covid- vaccine is hugely signicant. “The decision by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agencyhas only been taken after rigorous assessment of both safety and effectiveness. “The decision on the Pfizer BioNTech coronavirus vaccine was made with advice from the Commission on Human Medicines , the government’s independent expert scientic advisory body. “As the MHRA has emphasised strongly, public safety has always been the overriding priority. “It is important to stress that the MHRA is globally recognised for requiring high standards of safety, quality and effectiveness for any vaccine.”     They added: “The pace at which Covid- vaccines have been developed is unprecedented. That’s a reflection of the global emergency which the virus caused – and the scale of the response from scientists, supported by massive public and private investment. “We were already living in an age of unparalleled and rapid technological advancement. The scientic community has just raised the bar even further. “An unprecedented vaccination programme can now begin, involving a massive logistical exercise that will span many months.” LARGE CENTRES Strict conditions on vaccine deployment will be set by the MHRA, while the JCVIwill guide on which population groups should receive the vaccine first. The roll-out will take up a large part of . The JCVI recognises there will have to be some flexibility in terms of operational constraints, due to the characteristics of inidual vaccines. The Pfizer BioNTech vaccine poses particular logistical challenges and is likely to be best suited to large scale vaccination centres, the medical chiefs said.

Essentially, the reason for this dichotomy boils down to nationalists wanting a United Ireland and unionists wanting to stay within the United Kingdom. Back in , Northern Ireland’s population split was roughly % Catholic and % Protestant. Nearly a century later official statistics show a very dferent demographic. Catholic pupils, from nursery school through to sixth form, for example, now amount to % of all pupils enrolled in Northern Ireland schools and colleges. This changing picture could be perceived to blow wind into the sails of those advocating Irish unity. googletag.cmd.push However, before anyone loses the run of themselves, a component woven into the  Good Friday Agreement described as an un-intended outcome cannot be dismissed. A new identity called ‘Northern Irish’ emerged from the Good Friday Agreement, which for the first time in the history of these islands permits people born in Northern Ireland to choosethey want to be British, Irish or both. Something  that can’t be dismissed is the changing attitudes amongst those born into emerging peace. The young appear to be rejecting rigid national and religious identities. It would, therefore, appear the old assumption that all Catholics support re-unication and all Protestants support the Union no longer holds water. googletag.cmd.push This evolving mind-set is borne out by a recent LUCID TALK poll, which found % of Sinn Fein voters and % of SDLP voters would vote for a united Ireland while % of DUP and % of Ulster Unionist voters would vote to remain in the UK. Analysis of these October  statistics entitle the pollsters to comment: ‘neither those advocating Irish Unity or those advocating the status quo had anything close to a majority.’ While accepting opinion polls are never an exact science and, on occasions, can be all over the place they still serve, to some degree, as a barometer for public mood.     Moreover, by observing prevailing demographic trends in tandem with the results of ious polls, it must to be reasonable to assert a united Ireland in the near future is anything but a done deal. But, despite having access to all the pollsters predictions and awareness of a very dferent population structure, one side looks asit’s in a hurry to alter the constitutional landscape of Northern Ireland while the other side seems content to bury its head in the sand. Nationalists want to talk about little  while unionists prefer not even to mention the elephant in the room. Neither position, to be fair, is either acceptable or desirable and could, in the end, serve to weaken the ability of a devolved administration in Northern Ireland to mature. More now than ever, both traditions should be working as partners to make Northern Ireland the kind of place that makes le on earth worth living the kind of place that enables people to grow in hope and build a better future, regardless of their creed or culture. The hard-won peace, in place since , represents a sweeter music that is superior to the discords of ision. That being so, nothing should be hastily brought forward that risks putting our widely celebrated peace process in jeopardy. Change is often a slow fuse. So why rush  The quick fix, the short-cut, the on-the-spot-solution could, in the long run, turn out to be detrimental. Choosing to take the time to appeal to the nature of our better angels would, according to Charles Dickens, point out how the shadow of our own desires can eclipse the brightness of our better angels and this could adversely affect future outcomes. Beyond all reasonable doubt, there is a need for both the Orange and the Green to go beyond what comes easily and to live in a way that’s more enlightened. Dr King, in his letter from Birmingham jail, reminds us how we don’t walk the journey of le alone. None of us is an island we are all part of something bigger, which means there should, at all times, be a unity of purpose and a willingness to work for the greater good of all without fear or favour. French philosopher Albert Camus got it so right when he said: ‘Don’t walk in front of me I may not follow. Don’t walk behind me I may not lead. Just walk beside me and be my friend.’ This ought to be the aspiration of every Member of the Legislative Assemblyat Stormont. Showing to themselves, the electorate and the world their determination to progressively build bridges of co-operation and friendship across frontiers of memory, grief and pain. At some point in the future, when it becomes clear that a mandatory coalition of erse political figures are selflessly committed to making government ‘work’ for everybody in the Six Counties, regardless of where they live, how they pray or who they love. Then, and only then, should consideration be given to cautiously stepping out onto a road less travelled to begin exploring potential models and possible permutations for north, south, east and west relationships.    --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Education Minister Peter Weir tweeted a picture of the paintings after he visited the school last week, and the portraits quickly went viral, appearing on BBCs The View programme. Titillated Executive ministers praised the childrens artwork on social media, with Justice Minister Naomi Long adopting the painting as her Twitter profile picture. The Alliance MLA felt the work captured her essence perfectly. “I love my wonky eyebrow! It looks like Im a bit cross about something which I usually am! Fantastic work and say thanks to all the young artists!” she said. googletag.cmd.push Finance Minister, Sinn Feacuteins Conor Murphy, took time to write to the pupils and express his gratitute, saying the painting was an improvement on the real thing. Mr Murphy also told the children that one of their local heroes had held pride of place in Stormont for years. “The late Martin McGuinness, who was Deputy First Minister, had in his office a large photograph behind his desk in Stormont Castle of someone who attended your school,” he wrote. “It was of the  All-Ireland winning captain, Henry Downey. In an office which had photographs of world leaders including Nelson Mandela, the photo of Henry Downey of Lavey had pride of place.” googletag.cmd.push After the paintings were beamed around the airwaves, requests began to make their way to South Derry and the children have been busy. The Blame Games Tim McGarry, Jake OKane and Colin Murphy got the full treatment from the Mayogall Monets, along with local councillor Sean McPeake, who helped arrange the visit. Principal Mary OKane said the paintings, and associated publicity, had created a great feeling of positivity around the school. “Its created a great buzz, which is very important at this time,” she said. “Following lockdown and the long period of absence from school, its important that children get a wee boost now.     “Its important for the whole school, but particularly those children who are getting a real buzz out of it at the moment. They see themselves as being pretty famous artists.”  Another famous local artist, Kilreas Conor Larkin, agreed to give the childrens paintings a professional artists scrutiny for us this week – and he was very impressed!  Aoe and Charley Arlene Foster: The artist has captured Arlenes ‘lockdown cofure’ – a large, thick plumage of black hair. Arlene is looking away from the viewer, maybe deep in thought or dreaming of an easier time. They have captured a fantastically sombre and meditative state that many artists strive for!  Lisa and Maria Michelle O’Neill: The subject has been caught in a moment of contemplation or reflection. She appears to be gazing just below the viewer’s eye-line. Thinking hard and remaining very tight-lipped, giving no clue to her inner-thoughts. Her hands are clasped, asplaying her cards close to her chest.  Isabelle, Christopher and Charlie Naomi Long: The artist has gone for a bold palette of contrasting colours. The subject is looking a little bewildered or deflated. She appears to have one hand behind her back, asnot wanting to show the viewer her crossed fingers. Or have we purposely been left wonderingNaomi’s hands are tied   Ella, Shannon and Dara Nichola Mallon: The subject appears very happy or comfortable in her own skin. She stands up straight with her hands by her side, portraying a certain pride. This could be the Mona Lisa of political portraits, with her confident gaze following the viewer around the room.  Serena and Chloe Caraacutel Niacute Chuiliacuten: Simple and effective brush strokes have been used to capture the subject’s vibrant hair and expressionless face. The subject stares directly from the canvas, almost straight through the viewer. The artist has done well to capture this moment of determination.  Anna, Riacutean and Molly Conor Murphy: The artist has captured this subject well, leaving the viewer wondering ‘what has he just been asked ’. His bottom lip juts out in a moment of deep concentration, staring past the viewer in search of an answer, as the viewer begs to know what exactly the question is.   Emily Rose and Isla Diane Dodds: A subtle palette of greys has been used to portray the subject’s face, perhaps an indication as to how she is feeling. The subject appears to be smiling, but also looks panicked as she scans her surroundings.  Charley, Don and Seamus Oacuteg Peter Weir: This subject is portrayed as being happy and almost laughing, leaving the viewer asking ‘what is so funny ’. But, looking behind the glasses and gazing further into his eyes, the viewer soon realises there is no joke here.  Amber and Riacuteonach Robin Swann: The artist has really taken the time to depict someone under extreme pressure. His fists are clenched tight, his mouth opened wide asshouting for someone to listen. But, his eyes look sad and his cheeks tear-stained. His gaze is directed straight at you, asto say ‘I have more bad news.  Johnny, Callum, Cathal and Conan Edwin Poots: This painting shows someone who appears to be very happy with themselves, but look deeper into the subjects eyes and you can see that one eye is looking hard at the viewer for approval and the other is looking back at himself in some doubt.  Sean, Conor and Donnacha Sean McPeake :The Artist has captured the subject wide eyed, maybe in disbelief. The pale hue used for his lips, blend into his skin tone – perhaps the artist is sending the subliminal message that the subject is lost for words. The silvery grey hair gives the subject a ‘worldly wise’ appeal.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In my view, the little magician was the greatest footballer the world has ever had the pleasure of watching. Its as simple as that. But, he was more than a footballer. He was an icon and it was fitting when the worlds greatest ever team, the New Zealand All-Blacks, recognised that. They carried out a black number ten jersey with his name emblazoned on it before last weekends meeting of the nations. Its just a pity Peter Shilton, a world-class goalkeeper in his own right, didnt have the same class. Yes, Maradona cheated with his hand of God goal against the England stopper. Some might say honesty is the best policy, but there is a time and a place to twist the dagger. And last week wasnt that time. googletag.cmd.push He may have had his problems off the pitch, but sporting stars should always be judged for what they do in the colosseums in which they perform. Maradona wasnt born with a silver spoon in his mouth. Of the nine mouths that needed fed in their home in the Villa Fiorito area of Buenos Aires, his father was the only earner, allowing his family to focus on study. It was Diegos ability to control the ball like it was an extension of his body that alerted the scouts of the local Argentinos Juniors. And so the roller-coaster was taking off. He bagged goal after goal and soon he was in the blue and gold of Boca Juniors. In their La Bombonera stadium, which shook with sheer atmosphere on game day, he led them to the Primera Divisioacuten. But, after just  games he was off to Europe as Barcelona came calling. googletag.cmd.push The fact that he moved to one of the Catalan giants, who were Mes Que Un Clubwas one thing. What defined him for me, was how he carried the national team. That wonder goal against England in  was a letime in the making. If you watch footage from his time at Napoli, that was the perfect grounding. Diego dragged an unfancied horse to two league titles, Italian and UEFA Cups, he was kicked black and blue. As he was in that  clash with England. Like the streets of Buenos Aires, Naples was the school of hard knocks. He literally had to dance his way around potential leg-breaking tackles and making a mockery of England was a by-product of it all.     Maradona is just one of those players that youd love to watch in the flesh. The viral video on social media of him juggling the ball is part of his legacy. He was just at one with the ball...oozing class. I remember trying to watch the  World Cup Final from a distance in the Bushtown Hotel. On the way home from the Port, we called in for grub. I pleaded to get away from the table. By that stage, the Germans had levelled the game at -. Maradona huffed and puffed all during the game, but he made the crucial play. His through ball played in Jorge Luis Burruchagafor the winner. Its that type of instinct that separates the good from the great. And the thing about it, much of that craft is self-taught away from the training field. I was chatting to Dermot Heaney during the week, for a feature in next weeks paper. His ball-winning ability was honed from endless hours kicking the ball against a gable wall. Unbelievable – like legend - is an overused word. It should only be used for occasions like last Sunday to describe Joe Cannings four sideline cuts over the bar. For all the great coaching hed had access to, Id say it was perfected on the family farm or at Portumna pitch. Eoin Bradleys goal in Derrys  qualier clash with Down. Owen Mulligans wonder goal against the Dubs the same year. All moments of magic. I remember chatting to a defender who had played against Glenullin one evening. How was he supposed to know what Skinner was going to do next, when the man didnt know himself. Thats the x-factor that makes all the dference. It was encouraging chatting to Damian Cassidy this week about the new proposals for Derrys coaching plan. In particular, it was the committees research around Go Games and making them five-a-side for the very young. Why  To promote decision-making and flair. Alleluia. This is what we have been missing. Back to the days of jumpers for goalposts and playing in the back field until either it got dark, or somebody huffed and went home with the ball. Once you realised that the big boys were going to kick you instead of the ball, it was time to figure out a wat to play around them. The great players learn on the job, away from regimented systems where they are forced to play with one hand tied behind your back. Thank God for Maradona. For those too young to remember him, the constant barrage of footage should inspire the next genius.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Covid has hurt millions, whether it be in terms of health, or financially. I think a really serious issue moving forward is going to be hunger, and it absolutely breaks my heart to think of parents lying awake at night worrying about feeding their kids the next day. It breaks my heart to think of kids going hungry, and Santa being something that is simply not on the cards. It’s not fair. As well as selling the calendar Damian asked his fans to donate what they could afford and has raised just under pound,. googletag.cmd.push This will go a long, long way, said Damian. We can make a families Christmas a little bit better, and that’s a light the world needs right now. I wanted to try and use my  to make a dference as it’s been a tough year for so many and my followers helped me do that and I want to say thanks, so, so much. Last week, Damian joined Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council, Cllr Brian Tierney, for hislatest of his Covid- video appeal. Ive been really concerned to see the number of Covid cases across Derry and Strabane in the last few months – its really worrying, and the threat hasnt gone away, he commented.     I havent been home since Christmas and for me thats been quite dficult because I have never gone that long without visiting home in my le, and I miss it a lot. I know the community back home is full of amazing people that care about each other so Im appealing to everyone to do what they can to get us back to where we were and where we will be again. Mayor Tierney said that Damian is one of many people making sacrices for the greater good. I was delighted thatDamianjoined me in this message and has shared his personal experience to show why its important that we all follow the guidelines in place.

The pensioner fell in the Greenwalk area of Creggan on Friday evening. Local people and family members who came to her aid did not want to move her, so they tried to keep her warm and dry after calling for an ambulance. However, local independent councillor Gary Donnelly said it took two hours for ambulance to arrive. Cllr Donnelly described the scene as shocking. He added that residents in Greenwalk have been trying to get improved street lighting for years but without success. googletag.cmd.push The family of the local woman said she suffered a broken shoulder in the fall. After being contacted by the Derry News, a NIAS spokesperson apologised for how Fridays call-out had been handled. “We apologise for any distress or discomfort suffered as a result of her prolonged wait for an ambulance,” the spokesperson said. “NIAS seeks to provide the quickest possible response to meet the clinical needs of any patient who contacts us as a result of having suffered illness or injury. “However, regrettably some patients are currently waiting longer than we would wish due to the demand for our service and the impact of the Covid- pandemic on our staffing levels.” googletag.cmd.push The NIAS spokesperson said the call in relation to the Creggan incident was received at .pm on Friday. “Based on information passed to ambulance control, it was prioritised as a Category  call with a performance target of  minutes. “A crew did not arrive at this scene until : which was  minutes outside of the target response. “NIAS recognises the distress and discomfort a wait of over two hours for an ambulance is to an elderly patient who is lying in the cold and wet, or to those who are caring for her at that time. “The delay in this case was as a result of crews in the area responding to calls which were more pressing in terms of clinical need.     “NIAS regrets that the patient had to endure this delay and once again offers a sincere apology. “We would have liked to have provided a more immediate response, particular given the age of the patient and the conditions in which she had to wait.” The NIAS spokesperson said they receive more than  calls each day through the  system. “To enable us to target our resources to those whose clinical condition is most urgent, each call is triaged and categorised accordingly. “Against each of the categories is a performance target for response times which NIAS aims to deliver. “Category  calls are those calls which are immediately or potentially le-threatening and to which NIAS seeks to despatch an immediate response with an average performance target of  minutes.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Breandaacuten McNally, from Greenlough, died last week and many tributes have been paid to him since. Fr Seamus OConnell told mourners at St Oliver Plunketts Church that the -year-old was a proud Greenlough man. “Brendy was quiet, good mannered, good looking and liked fun,” he said. “Brendy was born in Greenlough, baptised in Greenlough, went to school in Greenlough and played football with Greenlough boys. “Were celebrating the funeral mass of a Greenlough man, where he was well-respected and had fun.” Local GAA club, St Oliver Plunketts GAC, led the tributes paid to a sorely missed club man. googletag.cmd.push “Brendy as we all knew him liked nothing more than lining out for the wee reds on a Sunday afternoon and was a regular on the scoresheet for our reserve team too,” they said. “His passion and infectious smile will be sorely missed but never forgotten by all involved with Greenlough GAC. “We would like to pass on our sincere condolences to the McNally and Downey family circles at this sad time.” The widespread nature of the tributes paid to Breandaacuten highlighted how many les he had touched throughout the world. Breandaacuten celebrating success with Wolfe Tones GAC, Melbourne. He spent time in both Australia and America, and local GAA clubs with whom he was involved posted messages of support for the family on social media. googletag.cmd.push St Pats Donegal GFC in Philadelphia said there was deep sadness within the community following news of his death. “It is with deep sadness that we learn of the passing of Breandaacuten McNally. Brendy had a great summer in Philadelphia in  and enjoyed some great times with the club,” they said. “We extend our deepest sympathy and condolences to Brendan, Patricia, Ruairiacute, Aoe and extended family and friends at this sad time.” Wolfe Tones GAC in Melbourne, where Breandaacuten starred for their football team in , also extended their condolences. “Everyone at Wolfe Tones has been saddened to learn of the passing of one of our former players, Breandaacuten McNally,” they said.     “Breandan played for the Wolfetones men’s team last year and was a huge part of the team and all their success throughout . “On behalf of everyone at Wolfe Tones GAC we would like to extend our deepest condolences to all of Breandans family and friends.” The McNally family business, B McNally  Sons Car Sales, are former sponsors of Watty Graham GAC, Glen, who also sympathised with the family. “Watty Grahams are saddened to learn of the untimely passing of Breandaacuten McNally, son of our former senior football team sponsor, Brendan,” they said. “Condolences to Brendan, Patricia, Ruairiacute, Aoe and the entire McNally family at this very sad time.” Everywhere he went, the young Greenlough man has touched lives, Fr OConnell told mourners at his funeral mass on Friday. After Breandaacuten travelled to America to receive treatment for his condition, he made such an impression on the hospital staff that they kept in touch. “The trip brought a host of new friends, real, caring people and was unbelievable the care that the family received and especially their son,” said Fr OConnell. “It was delightful, so delightful that the nurses and one of the surgeons kept in touch, so impressed were they by Brendy and his family, and his mother in particular.” Mourners heard how family was so important in Breandaacutens le. Fr OConnell also paid tribute to Breandaacutens familys devotion to him at his funeral mass last Friday, and described them as extraordinary. “All of them were in America at one time or another, supporting one another. Thats how the family became known. “As far as Im concerned, his family were pretty normal people. They did ordinary things and did them well, but truthfully, they had become extraordinary.” The night before his funeral, Breandaacutens sister Aoe appealed to friends and family to write down their memories of him along with any photos to be posted in a special memory box at the chapel. Fr OConnell ended his homily with a story that summed up the relationship between the McNally siblings. “Wed a concert one time in Greenlough. There were all kinds of people involved and Patsy was there with this wean on her knee,” he said. “Low and behold, when her brother appeared on stage, off she went like a scalded cat, leaving granny wondering where she was going. “Where did she go  She didnt settle until she got onto the stage and claimed her brother. Aoe was that wean. “She now claims him even more than ever. Family is important. Family is signicant,” he added.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The deferral by Causeway Coast and Glens Councils planning committee is to allow an alternative application to progress to the same stage so a decision can be made. The controversial proposal would see a single storey McDonalds restaurant with car parking and drive through facilities erected at a section of the existing Asda site alongside the towns Ring Road. Representatives of the Lodge Hotel, which backs onto the proposed site, have stated their objection to the application. After the initial application was deferred at Octobers Planning Committee meeting, a second application was lodged showing the location of the restaurant on the East side of the car park. googletag.cmd.push At a meeting of the Planning Committee, Causeway Coast and Glens councillors heard objections from a representative of the Lodge Hotel which is situated close to the proposed site. The spokesperson said noise and disturbance from the development would have an adverse impact on residents at the hotel and the knock-on effect could cause the hotel to go out of business. Representatives of the Lodge Hotel have raised objections to the proposal. The points were echoed by some councillors, with Alderman William Duddy citing anti-social behaviour arising from the existing McDonalds site in Coleraine. “Some residents have told me they can hear the revving and the music, and some of those are three quarters of a mile away,” said Alderman Duddy. googletag.cmd.push “We cannot leave the hotel out of this. Its  years in operation and is the only tourist asset we have in this town in regards to accommodation. “We have an obligation to secure and maintain that as a planning committee. The noise, the smell, the fumes, the litter and the strong likelihood of anti-social behaviour taking place in that car park. “The police have yet to be able to resolve the issues at Riverside, which has been ongoing for years. It is imperative to take into account the impact on those using the hotel.” The committee have voted to defer the current application until the alternative planning application reaches a stage where both can be reviewed at the same time.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

One of the questions asked for the Ministers assessment of the risk to drinking water, river quality and wildle from the lack of ‘engineering controls’ at the Mobuoy waste dump.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

One local councillor described the news as a Christmas present for Derry City and Strabane District Council. Details of the financial support secured were outlined during a meeting of the councils Governance and Strategic Planning committee on Tuesday. At the meeting, Alfie Dallas, the councils Lead Finance Officer, presented a report on the situation faced by the council in the first half of this financial year from April  to September . Mr Dallas said the councils planned budget for   was poundm, with % of that money coming from rates collected. googletag.cmd.push However, Mr Dallas said the councils finances had been very signicantly impacted by the Covid crisis. He said that the council had lost approximately pound.m during the first half of the financial year. These losses included: - pound.m as a result of the closure of council facilities, including leisure centres- pound, due to the closure of council-run car parks- pound, as a result of the loss of building control income- pound, loss of income from cemeteries due to non-charging during the pandemic Mr Dallas said the council had also faced huge unplanned costs as a result of having to respond to the pandemic. googletag.cmd.push These included health and safety costs, costs associated with new working arrangements, communications and IT costs to enable home-working. However, Mr Dallas said that thankfully the councils losses had been completely mitigated by the financial support received from a number of government departments. He said the council had recouped pound.m of its losses from the Job Retention Scheme Furlough. He said the Department of Finance had provided support of pound.m as part of a package for all  councils in Northern Ireland, while the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs had allocated pound, to the council for waste management losses. Mr Dallas said the government had also provided pound.m to cover the losses at City of Derry Airport which means that this financial burden will not fall on the council.     Government support has therefore been critical in ensuring Council finances have remained stable and has enabled signicant decisions around services to be avoided, said Mr Dallas. However, he added that there remained signicant risk and uncertainty over the councils finances because of its reliance on rates income for its annual budget. Speaking at Tuesdays meeting, Sinn Fein councillor Mickey Cooper said that back in March April of this year, the situation had been scary in relation to the financial situation facing the council. Given the government support, he welcomed that the council could continue to look at major infrastructure projects that had been planned pre-Covid.

One local councillor described the news as a Christmas present for Derry City and Strabane District Council. Details of the financial support secured were outlined during a meeting of the councils Governance and Strategic Planning committee on Tuesday. At the meeting, Alfie Dallas, the councils Lead Finance Officer, presented a report on the situation faced by the council in the first half of this financial year from April  to September . Mr Dallas said the councils planned budget for   was poundm, with % of that money coming from rates collected. googletag.cmd.push However, Mr Dallas said the councils finances had been very signicantly impacted by the Covid crisis. He said that the council had lost approximately pound.m during the first half of the financial year. These losses included: - pound.m as a result of the closure of council facilities, including leisure centres- pound, due to the closure of council-run car parks- pound, as a result of the loss of building control income- pound, loss of income from cemeteries due to non-charging during the pandemic Mr Dallas said the council had also faced huge unplanned costs as a result of having to respond to the pandemic. googletag.cmd.push These included health and safety costs, costs associated with new working arrangements, communications and IT costs to enable home-working. However, Mr Dallas said that thankfully the councils losses had been completely mitigated by the financial support received from a number of government departments. He said the council had recouped pound.m of its losses from the Job Retention Scheme Furlough. He said the Department of Finance had provided support of pound.m as part of a package for all  councils in Northern Ireland, while the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs had allocated pound, to the council for waste management losses. Mr Dallas said the government had also provided pound.m to cover the losses at City of Derry Airport which means that this financial burden will not fall on the council.     Government support has therefore been critical in ensuring Council finances have remained stable and has enabled signicant decisions around services to be avoided, said Mr Dallas. However, he added that there remained signicant risk and uncertainty over the councils finances because of its reliance on rates income for its annual budget. Speaking at Tuesdays meeting, Sinn Fein councillor Mickey Cooper said that back in March April of this year, the situation had been scary in relation to the financial situation facing the council. Given the government support, he welcomed that the council could continue to look at major infrastructure projects that had been planned pre-Covid. DUP Alderman Hilary McClintock said given the doom and gloom earlier in the year, the news that the councils losses had been completely mitigated was like a Christmas present. This is an absolutely fantastic outcome, she said. SDLP councillor Martin Reilly paid tribute to the council officers for their efforts in recent months. It is such a good position to be in in comparison to where we thought we would be six months ago, said Cllr Reilly.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

You enjoy playing and you take any opportunity you can get.ldquoI was nervous going into it but I probably had one of the best games I ever played. I was going out an expressing myself and I was named player of the match.However, her world came crashing down when she suffered an injury while playing for the NI U- team when what looked like a normal stress fracture in her foot was to keep her out of action for four years.ldquoIt should have healed naturally within eight to  weeks and I kept getting told it would heal with rest, she recalled.ldquoIt came to a year but it hadnrsquot healed fully, so I got a second opinion and the consultant said I should have had surgery straight away on it.ldquoI had the operation and went through the full rehab period, but I was still having quite a lot of issues, so I had a second surgery and it was back to square one.Caragh recalls ldquocrying day after day at the prospect of never playing football again and said every time she took a step forward ldquoit felt like five steps back again.She went on: I had thought about going to England or America when I left school, but being injured at that age there was no point trying to chase that.ldquoHaving a lot of success at a young age, I just didnrsquot know le without football.Caragh made herto action almost four years on from her injury and after a year with Glentoran she spent a season in Iceland with Fylkir.She says Reykjavik was an ldquoamazing place to play and live and after being introduced to CrossFit in her rehab, it was in Iceland her interest in the sport grew.ldquoI was totally hooked on it and progressed quite quickly in it. I started to do a few local competitions and for a while I was balancing the two.ldquoBecause I enjoyed CrossFit so much, my love for football waned slightly. I got to the point where I didnrsquot have the same desire as before.She ed to Glentoran after her year in Iceland, lting the Irish Cup with the east Belfast side and representing Northern Ireland before halting her time in the sport to focus on CrossFit.In her break from football, Caragh said her priorities changed away from the pitch when she married her husband, Michael, in .At the turn of  she was set to compete at high-level CrossFit competitions in Asia, Egypt and the Netherlands before the Covid- pandemic intervened.ldquoI hadnrsquot planned to come back to football. Gail Redmond at Glentoran heard the competitions were scrapped and saw it as an opportunity to get me back playing, she explained.ldquoInitially I was a bit hesitant but she said about the Glens challenging for the title.

Once more they have gone right to the business end of the competition, but this time they are determined to carry off the silverware.ldquoFrom a neutralrsquos point of view, it should be a really exciting match, the Castlewellan woman said. ldquoIt is also great for Ulster camogie that two northern teams are in the final.ldquoWersquove been so close over the last few years and it would be great to be able to get over that final hurdle now.With Down teams performing strongly at schools level in camogie for a while, it was always felt that would ultimately translate to success higher up the age groups. And so it has proven to be. McMullan says a number of factors have come together to allow Down to prosper, including manager Derek Dunnersquos influence.ldquoDerek has been brilliant for us, she said. He is passionate and committed to the team. In his preparation, he leaves no stone unturned. He has definitely gone above and beyond the call of duty for us.ldquoHe has brought the best people into the off-field team around us, and he has invested in us. When someone does that, it makes you want to repay their faith by bringing success. It is a time-consuming role for him too, he does a lot as well away from the matches and the training ground, so the fact we have made it to the final is brilliant for him too.In what has been a year when sportsmen and sportswomen have been left unsure about what would happened because of the coronavirus, Karen and her team-mates are revelling in being able to anticipate the excitement around an All-Ireland final.ldquoWersquore delighted to be there, first and foremost. We are buzzing with excitement. And the other thing is too, especially with the dficulties that so many people are going through, we are able to feed off the excitement of others.ldquoSo many people have been affected badly by Covid-, but you can see the dference sport can make.It can help communities come together and that is certainly something we can feel heading into this game.Down booked their spot in the final with a - to - semi-final success against Meath in Clones. It was a match where the Mourne girls looked fairly comfortable and had a gear or two to spare.McMullan concurs, saying they could have racked up an even more convincing winning margin.ldquoWe should have scored more, and could have done. But Meath held out well, and then it became more of a case of seeing the game out and protecting the advantage. We knew Meath are a very dficult team to overcome.ldquoBefore the match, we spoke about how close we had come before going all the way. We absolutely did not want to experience those feelings again. A lot of players, to be honest, were not over last yearrsquos loss to Westmeath. It hurt a lot.ldquoSometimes it can take you to lose a game of that importance to toughen you up, make you ready to go that bit more the next time. There is no doubt the girls have the hunger and are driven to win this now. As for the challenge posed by Antrim, the Down camp are certainly not under-estimating the task at hand, as Karen admits.ldquoItrsquoll be a tough one against Antrim. They are a very young, very fit, quick team. They have some of their top players from the likes of Loughgiel and Ballycastle. Itrsquos a local derby which obviously adds a bit more spice to things. Honestly, on the day, it is anyonersquos game.Anyonersquos game indeed, but Down will know they have weapons in their team that they will look to on the day to make the dference between the pain of coming runners-up again, and the glory of being crowned All-Ireland champions.Paula OrsquoHagan is someone the team will certainly be looking towards to presenting a threat in front of the Antrim goal. She was a constant thorn in the side of Meath in the last four, accounting for seven points.Sarah-Louise Graffin is also a threat going forward. She ably dovetailed with OrsquoHagan in the last four, weighing in with three points. When those two click going forward, they can be a handful for even the most miserly of back-lines.Fionnuala Carr is the glue that held that line together so well in the success over Meath, and no doubt she will be the bedrock that Down will try to build their success on again.As well as that, Dougan has the team well-drilled in defence. And ahead of them, they have a midfield prowess that can take a grip on a game against the best. Niamh Mallon is a constant danger to the opposition, full of busy running and creativity. Alongside her, Saoirse McCartan is another wily operator.Undoubtedly, Down possess the tools in their armoury to carry off the title this time around. In terms of talent, and the experience of being there before and knowing what to expect on the big occasion, they know the drill.Now Dougan, and the players will be hoping they can shake off the lsquonearlyrsquo tag and be crowned camogie queens of Ireland.The throw-in for Saturdayrsquos final is .pm. It will be broadcast live on the RTE News Channel and also on the RTE Player International.

In these strange and dficult times, even the strongest and most resilient among us are not exempt from occasionally feeling weary and despondent.During the early months of lockdown back in the spring, how many of us enjoyed the slowing down of the hamster wheel of le and took time to enjoy nature at its finest and to reflect on what our priorities really are It all seems much harder this time around as people face the harsh reality of a huge economic downturn and the virus pandemic takes on a dferent guise.We need all the help we can get to keep ourselves as positive and hopeful as possible. This is where mindfulness can come in. It is a term that has become popular in recent times and often is wrongly used.It can get a bad press and seem shrouded in mystery mdash something that requires a knowledge of Zen beyond the reach of lsquoJoe Publicrsquo while others claim it to be some kind of panacea that can cure all ills. It is neither of these things.As a practitioner for several years and a Mindfulness in Schools Project trained teacher for five, I can honestly say it is a tool that can help some peoplefocus on the present and not let the mind wander into unnecessary places, whether that be worries or distractions.The analogy of thoughts being like buses is one I like. We donrsquot need to jump on every single one, instead just watch them pass by.An example of a mindful experience could be when a musician is playing a piece and sensing the music, rather than reading the notes.It is flowing completely naturally and no thinking is involved. Sport is another great example. Novak Djokovic and Jonny Wilkinson are two advocates of mindful practice and both claim their focus and steady performance can be attributed to the discipline.Interestingly, two of the most mindful sports are golf and cricket. Being at one with the little white ball as it gets smacked about the greens is said to be as good for mental health as much as physical.Our own Rory McIlroy summed it up well when he said: ldquoIrsquom not about to go and live with the monks in Nepal or anything like that, but Irsquom making sure that I centre myself and put my head in the right place.Cricket is similar.When you are bowling an over, the focus is on the line of the ball, the position of the field and the feel of the wicket under foot. The batsman is equally focussing on the ball and the fielders woe betide they lose their concentration.The halcyon days of local cricket as a mainstream sport appear to be over at the moment and there are multiple reasons offered for the demise mdash schools having less time for summer sports in the final term, the attention span of young players not being what it was and fewer people willing to commit to what could be a full day.Which leads me nicely back to the beginning.Remember those lovely, slower days of lockdown when we realised being busy wasnrsquot necessarily all it was cracked up to be and that many of the things on our mental lsquoto dorsquo list are not that important after all Maybe we really need to take time to smell the autumn leaves, the way we did for the daffodils of spring. Maybe we need to slow it down and find things to hope for.Local cricket clubs donrsquot have the crowds around the team boards any more on a Thursday evening after the selection committee when the team lists were pinned up.There isnrsquot that excitement of ldquodid I make it from the thirds to the seconds   or for me, ldquowhere am I serving the sandwiches It is a dferent era for the game, but those who love it, really love it. If anyone reading this has their whites from a bygone time hidden in an attic somewhere, why not retrieve them and dust them down for next spring If you played a bit at school and just feel like revisiting the sport for a bit of exercise and a bit of craic with new people, then please do it.Evenyoursquove never played, but have walked down the Strangford Road and loved that beautul setting, then it might be worth a go.We all need things to look forward to and we all need hope. Downpatrick Cricket Club needs that hope too.Maurice Irvine, a dear friend and colleague and master of cricket at Down High School, is also a former player for the school and the club.He strongly recommends anyone to take up the bat again or try it out whatever level you are at.When I asked him how he felt at the possible closure of Downpatrick Cricket Club, he said:ldquoIt is with great sadness that I learn of this possibility. I have many memories of playing there under the guidance of Roy Briggs, Ken McCammon and many others, developing my love of the game. ldquoCricket is a great game educating young people especially in respect, fair play, how to win and lose with dignity and team spirit.ldquoDownpatrick Cricket Club, along with Saintfield and Dundrum, is also a great place for Down High cricketers to gain valuable experience and the opportunity to learn from more experienced cricketers.ldquoDownpatrick have also been very generous to Down High, allowing us access to nets when they were not available at school and I would add my encouragement to anyone in the area to become involved to help the club at this dficult time.For me, the Linehan family are synonymous with cricket in Downpatrick.Alfie and Hugh will remain heroes of mine always, while current club chairman Paul Linehan hopes thatanyone can assist to keep the club going they will contact him on   or email paul.k.linehan@gmail..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd December 2020 Drumaness.jpg","title":"Drumaness green space plans  ","story":"A NEW amenity area is to be created in Drumaness by Newry, Mourne and Down Council.An area known locally as the lsquoBack Fieldrsquo where a play park was located a number of years ago is to be redeveloped.The news has been welcomed by Slieve Croob councillor, Cathy Mason, who is pleased that a raised area made of bricks and concrete is to be flattened and reseeded with GAA and football posts and nets to be provided.The local politician, who has been lobbying for the work to be carried out, said it is now possible as the village has two play parks, explaining that the remnants of bricks and concrete at the back field can now be removed, with this particular work long over due. ldquoThe area will be flattened and seeded so it can be safely used, with a set of GAA and soccer nets provided, said Cllr Mason.ldquoWe all know how vital it is to get outside into the fresh air, especially our children during these unprecedented times.

Progress is at last being made, but the money required to finance the scheme is the final piece in the development jigsaw, he said.ldquoThis scheme is good news for the people of Ballynahinch and the wider district and what everyone is keen to see is a timetable for delivery.Cllr Walker said the bypass had been talked about for  years and was now literally within touching distance.He added: ldquoWhat we require is a definitive timetable and confirmation from the roads minister that the money to build the new road is there. The scheme is finally moving in the right direction and now is the time to commit the money to ensure its delivery.Cllr Terry Andrews also welcomed progress in the bypass which he said can make a signicant dference for not only Ballynahinch, but the wider East and South Down areas.Rowallane councillor, Robert Burgess, said people in Ballynahinch look forward to the delivery of the scheme, urging consideration be given to farmers whose land has ben set aside for  years to accommodate the planned bypass.ldquoThese farmers have been unable to do anything with these areas of land which will probably be vested.

When a bubble is formed it is fixed, and must not be changed or extended further at any point.bull Each Christmas bubble can meet at home, at a place of worship or an outdoor public place, but existing, more restrictive rules on hospitality and meeting in other venues will be maintained throughout this period.It is important that everyone respects and abides by the rules of each nation wherever they choose to spend the festive period.Where there are any iations in our approach, these will be communicated by each administration accordingly.Further guidance will be provided in due course.The winter holiday period is a time often spent with family and friends, with schools and offices closing and people travelling over the bank holidays.Many have already begun making their plans, and we are today providing clarity to help people make the right choices for them, and enjoy time with those closest to them while staying within the rules to protect us all. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

These centres have already been decided by health boards and are in the process of being prepared.The development process for coronavirus vaccines has been as stringent as any other but the process in the face of the pandemic has been sped up by prompt, world-wide funding and a reduction in paperwork.Theof the trials have not been shortened, and the usual safety measures remain in place.The vaccine will not be mandatory and people will be able to choose whether they take up the vaccine or not.Information will be provided to people before vaccination to reassure them about patient safety and robust consent processes will be in place.Vice-chairman of the Covid- Vaccine Programme Board, Richard Roberts from Public Health Wales, said: ldquoIt is a signicant achievement that only  months after WHOannounced the global pandemic that we now have the first safe and effective vaccine available for use in Wales, and other vaccines to follow.\"Everyone has been preparing for months to deliver the Covid- vaccine programme, and it is very exciting that we will be able to begin, once the final steps have been put in place so that the programme can be delivered safely. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Shops, hairdressers, restaurants, places of worship and hotels are among the places that will be able to re-open from December . Pubs selling drink onlywill remain closed and an additional financial package will be put in place. The Executive has also agreed Christmas household bubbling arrangements from December -. Three households will be able to come together for this period in domestic settings, outdoor public spaces and places of worship. One of the households will be able to include their existing household bubble. First Minister Arlene Foster said: “Through our collective efforts over recent weeks we gained enough space in the transmission of the virus to relax a signicant number of restrictions, including the opening-up of non-essential retail, close contact services, sport and leisure activities and our places of worship at the end of next week. “These decisions will give families, businesses and employees some much-needed certainty and comfort in the run-up to Christmas and beyond. “This is a special time of the year and we want to support people to have a good Christmas, but also a safe one. “Signicant work has been completed with business sectors, faith groups, local government and police on new mitigation measures to reduce the risk of transmission. “I urge everyone to be Covid-aware and to make careful and sensible decisions when out and about or mixing with others. We need to make sure we continue doing all we can to protect ourselves and our loved ones.” Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill said: “The Executive wants to give people as much notice as possible on what the situation will look like from next Friday when the current circuit breaker comes to an end. “We have given detailed consideration to which restrictions need tobe maintained, and what we can open up, in light of the scientic and medical advice. “A package of measures that will see signicant relaxations to the current restrictions has been agreed, with maximum mitigations in place to minimise risks to the greatest extent possible. An additional support package will be put in place for traditional drink-only pubs that unfortunately will not be able to reopen at this time. “We appreciate how important Christmas time is for many families and the Executive has agreed arrangements that will allow families and friends to come together in a limited way between  and  December. “It’s important for people to understand that with any increased contact comes increased risk. Everyone needs to think very carefully about the risks posed to them, and their loved ones, by coming together over the Christmas period, particularly to those who are vulnerable. Some may choose not to form a Christmas bubble but for those who do, we encourage them to keep their bubbles small and limit the numbers of people gathering, as much as possible.”  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_aaafbfbd   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_fbaebfbeedbedecc   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
