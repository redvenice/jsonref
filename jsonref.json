The veterans are not asking for a change in the law. We are asking them to include us within the law.\u0027Two elderly ex-soldiers – known as A and C – face a murder trial in April over the 1972 death of IRA commander Joe McCann, who at the time was suspected of being involved in the killing of a soldier.One veteran has been charged with the murder of a 15-year-old boy in Londonderry and another, known as Soldier F, is accused of killing two men and attempting to kill four others in Londonderry on Bloody Sunday in 1972.A sixth defendant, former soldier David Holden, is charged with manslaughter over a shooting at an Army checkpoint in 1988. There are fears more veterans could face charges.Tory MP Jack Lopresti, who has raised Mr Hutchings\u0027 case in the Commons, said: \u0027It is nothing short of a national disgrace that John Downey, the IRA terrorist responsible for the Hyde Park bombing in 1982, which killed 11 soldiers, received a \u0027letter of comfort\u0027 from the Government and his trial collapsed.\u0027We mustn\u0027t let this politically motivated witch-hunt continue, which hounds and ruins the lives of former servicemen who have served our country bravely in Northern Ireland and who should be enjoying a well-deserved retirement.\u0027John Ross, a former paratrooper in Ulster added: \u0027The prosecutions are disgusting. It was a very dangerous situation during the Troubles. It was worse than a war zone in many ways.\u0027I was in the Falklands and at least you knew who the enemy was. In Northern Ireland you went out on patrol and you were on edge. There were people hell-bent on killing you.\u0027Unlike some of the other veterans, Mr Hutchings has been publicly identified since his first appearance at Omagh Magistrates\u0027 Court five years ago.His trial in Belfast will be before a judge sitting alone.The former coal miner, who was in the Life Guards, was first cleared in 1974 following a five-month investigation and again in 2013. But the case was examined once more by a \u0027legacy\u0027 team with the Police Service of Northern Ireland after the Government apologised for Mr Cunningham\u0027s death and Mr Hutchings was arrested at home in 2015.Mr Cunningham\u0027s nephew, Charlie Agnew, has previously said: \u0027If Hutchings is adamant of his innocence he should attend for trial and clear his name.\u0027A Government spokesman said it \u0027remains determined to deal with the past in Northern Ireland by bringing forward legislation which focuses on reconciliation, delivers for victims and ends the cycle of investigations that has failed victims and veterans alike\u0027. "},{"url":null,"title":"Barnier claims PM agreed Britain tied European human rights rules Brexit","story":"Share this article And Home Secretary Priti Patel last month announced proposals to close a loophole that has been exploited by murderers, rapists and other serious criminals.UK negotiators have now won a clause giving either side the right to suspend or terminate the final deal if there are serious concerns about protection of fundamental rights and the rule of law.And Downing Street was last night playing down Mr Barnier’s claim to MEPs that Britain had changed its stance.A spokesman for the Government said: ‘The UK remains committed to the ECHR – we have been clear on that time and time again, including in Parliament.‘We agree that co-operation with the EU should be based on our shared values of respect for fundamental rights and for the rule of law.‘The UK’s approach to these issues in the context of law enforcement is based on precedent for EU third-country agreements in this area.’The compromise comes as British and EU negotiators race to try to agree a trade deal within days.Ireland’s foreign minister Simon Coveney told the BBC yesterday: ‘I do think a deal is possible, but it needs to be finalised this week if possible, because we really are running out of time in terms of ratification and preparation.‘But I think a deal is possible because the consequences of no deal are so costly and so disruptive, particularly for the UK and for Northern Ireland, but for the Republic of Ireland as well. So I think there’s a big incentive to get a deal done.’He said the negotiating teams need to find a compromise ‘that both sides can live with’ on the sticking points of fishing rights and ‘level playing field’ rules.Environment Secretary George Eustice suggested talks could continue for another ten days, leaving very little time for a deal to go through the British and European parliaments.He told Sky News: ‘This is the crucial week when we need to get a breakthrough.‘I really do think we are now in the sort of, final week, or ten days. Of course if great progress were made this week and you were nearly there, it is always possible to extend those negotiations.’"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c901a69f19276b4548ef34b62fbd3fdef9942c7a/0_98_2953_1772/master/2953.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fe2b275b1b445d06ec23cd2ca3123340","title":"10 ways to maintain all round wellbeing this winter","story":"With the temperature dropping and the nights drawing in, it’s time to take extra good care of yourself and prepare for a fresh start in the new year As we stare down the barrel of winter with the added pressure of new lockdown restrictions, there’s never been a more pertinent time to focus on our wellbeing. For many, the unprecedented nature of this year has had a negative effect both physically and mentally, but with the end of the year fast approaching and the promise of a fresh start in 2021, now is a great time to give mind, body and soul a much needed overhaul.“This year, few of us have looked after ourselves the way we deserve to be looked after,” says personal fitness and strength trainer Matt McCormack (@mattmccormackpt). “Due to no fault of our own, we’ve neglected to give our bodies what they need, and anxiety and stress levels for many have been understandably sky-high. The temptation may be to put off making changes until the new year, but now is actually the ideal time to toughen up our bodies if we want to face the winter and life’s next chapter in the best possible shape.”So whether your aim is to feel trimmer, stronger or happier, the time is now – and yes, whatever the weather.1 Give booze a breakIf that sounds like a ridiculous suggestion with the festive season just around the corner, you don’t have to go completely dry as a bone, but a more mindful approach to how much – and what – you’re drinking could make a huge difference to your physical and mental health. “We all know that drinking to excess isn’t great for our bodies, so implementing some small changes to your drinking habits is really beneficial,” says nutritionist and founder of LunchboxDoctor, Jenny Tschiesche.“Try swapping some of your weekly alcoholic drinks for something like kombucha, which still feels special, treat-like and is very on-trend.”When choosing a non-alcoholic drink, keep an eye out for the sugar content – check the label and choose those drinks that are green for sugar when you can. It’s also a good option to aim for some entirely alcohol-free days throughout the week, so try downloading Public Health England’s Drink Free Days app, which can be found on the Apple App Store and Google Play.2 Keep a journalMove over meditation, there’s a new tool in town to achieve a clearer, happier mind: writing. According to some mental health professionals, keeping a journalis one of the best ways to release mental blocks, understand your feelings and attain your goals. You may have kept a daily gratitude list to remind yourself of things to feel thankful for, but trying a more expressive approach to writing can be a way of hacking into the deepest parts of the brain, helping us recognise our needs.Invest in a nice notebook and aim to write for 10-15 minutes each morning. Think of how you’re feeling, what you’re worried about, someone you’re angry with, hopes for that day – and see what comes out.3 Download a fitness appSometimes we all need a helping hand, so why not lean on an app? Whether it’s to track your diet, plan a workout or record your daily physical activity, checking in with your phone or smartwatch is a great way to help you keep on top of your health and fitness goals – and set new ones when the time is right. “I see it all the time with my clients, especially during this time of the year,” says McCormack.“They lose track of what they’re eating or drinking, which then spirals into bad choices and habits, quickly followed by negative thoughts. But using a fitness app is a brilliant and simple way to regain some control and keep your health and fitness in order.”Apps such as MyFitnessPal are free to download and can help you keep an eye on what you’re eating, the number of steps you’re doing, and even make everything feel more manageable, which is often half the battle.4 Get a flu jabWith the spread of Covid-19, it’s easy to forget that it’s also important to protect yourself against the flu – especially so if you’re in a high-risk category for coronavirus, as research has shown you’re more likely to get seriously ill if you get the flu and contract coronavirus at the same time.The good news is that by getting a flu jab, you’ll help reduce pressure on the NHS and social care staff who may be dealing with the pandemic. Changes including social distancing, hand washing and wearing protective equipment have now been made to ensure it’s safe to get your flu jab at GP surgeries and pharmacies, so go and book one in for peace of mind.5 Seek out supportWinter can be lonely. Anything from weather conditions to potential restrictions due to the pandemic could keep us from loved ones this festive season. Plus the reduced sunlight can reduce our body’s production of serotonin, potentially making us feel low and more alone.Kate Lucey, author of Get a Grip, Love, says that right now we need to make the effort to talk to each other – but with our voices and not just a WhatsApp or text message.“We’ve become a bit scared of phone calls,” she says. “Don’t plan it, just dial. Send a voice note if they don’t answer, and even if you have to play phone tag you’ll get there eventually. Voice action is so much more nourishing than a message.”Conversation keeps us feeling connected so make a list of three people a day that you could contact – and make it happen. If you’re not able to get in touch with someone, or you’d just like to find out more about managing your mental health and wellbeing, head to nhs.ukoneyouevery-mind-matters.6 Invest in supplementsIt’s that time of year when we can’t make vitamin D from sunshine. To keep your bones and muscles healthy it’s best to take a vitamin D supplement every day between October and early March. This is especially important as many of us have been indoors more than usual this spring and summer.“The majority of us don’t get the sufficient amounts of vitamin D through our diet, and with sunlight limited at this time of year, in my opinion, we should all be supplementing,” says Tschiesche.You can get vitamin D from most pharmacies, and supermarkets and other retailers. Just 10 micrograms a day is all you need – it’s the same for the whole family.7 Stop smokingThinking of knocking smoking on the head in the new year? Why wait? By quitting now, you’ll reap the rewards almost immediately. Longer-term benefits include reducing your risk of lung problems, heart problems and various types of cancer. In the short term, if you stopped now you would be free of nicotine, finding it easier to breathe and have a pocket full of surplus cash by the time you’re singing Auld Lang Syne. Plus, you’ll have the hard bit out of the way.“Quitting smoking is always a fantastic idea,” says Dr Catherine McCullagh, a trainee GP. “But people don’t realise that you can feel the benefits immediately. Contact your GP or pharmacist about the various options available to help you quit – often they can refer you to a smoking cessation clinic where you will receive specialist advice.”8 Get outdoorsThe great outdoors might be wet and wild right now, but a winter walk (find one near you at walkingbritain) is the best way of blowing away the cobwebs. Fresh air has higher levels of oxygen than indoor air, so getting outdoors for a brisk 20-minute walk each day is good for your lungs, blood pressure, circulation and heart rate. Plus, more oxygen is thought to result in greater brain functioning, improving energy and concentration skills – perfect for anyone working from home.Entice your kids out with a homemade scavenger hunt. Make a checklist of 10 things – such as acorns, feathers, yellow leaves – and head to the woods, only returning when you’ve found them all. Not close to woodland? No problem. Even a walk around the streets with a list of items to spot – a black cat, three buses, Christmas trees in windows – can turn exercise into a fun, and free, game.9 Light a scented candleBurning a scented candle doesn’t just achieve peak winter ambience, it can also do wonders for your wellbeing. The combination of essential oils in some aromatherapy candles – such as lavender, rose or lemon balm – can relieve anxiety and reduce stress.And there’s more ... stuffy noses and congested chests can be eased by burning peppermint or eucalyptus. Sleep can be helped by a chamomile or sandalwood candle – just remember to blow it out before your head hits the pillow – and energy may be boosted by the scent of bergamot, cinnamon or ginger.10 Treat yourselfWhen it comes down to it though, 2020 has been hard enough. For long stretches of this year, we haven’t been able to enjoy a sit-down meal at a restaurant or the comforts of a Sunday roast at the pub. While it’s important for us to take care of our bodies, this winter really isn’t the time to start feeling guilty and deny ourselves a little taste of the good stuff. We’ve missed out on enough this year, thank you very much.So have a treat and reach for the chocolate when you want to, whether it’s milk chocolate, or dark chocolate – which is generally a bit lower in calories and sugar – just enjoy. Of course, moderation is key, but as Francesco Petrarch said: “A little bit of sweetness can drown out a whole lot of bitterness.”This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

There are three all-Premier League ties: Wolves v Crystal Palace, Arsenal v Newcastle United and, most intriguingly of all, Aston Villa v Liverpool, a game that finished 7-2 in the league. And that concludes the draw for the third round of the FA Cup.The balls are out of the bag. Here we go...“The FA Cup only does alphabetical order for those entering at that stage,” says Iain Brown. “Every other number relates to when they were drawn out last round. The winner of whoever is drawn out for the first match will be number 1 when the fourth round is drawn and so on.”“Is there rhyme or reason to the numbering beyond 44?” asks Simon McGrother. “As an OAFC fan, I’m a bit hurt by the number 64 in case this is some kind of seeding. Praying for a big pay-day. If we bang them in like we did against Bradford, nobody is safe.”It looks like the first 44 teams are the ones who qualified automatically, ie from the top two isions. I presume the rest were numbered before the second-round ties took place, so it wasn’t possible to do them alphabetically. Either that or someone at the FA supports a giant that Oldham slayed in 1989-90, and still hasn’t got over it.Hello and welcome to live coverage of the draw for the FA Cup third round.

All you need is a dollop of butter to make your festive dishes shineThe American TV cook Julia Child adored cooking with butter and once told viewers: “With enough butter, anything is good.” Today, how many of us would venture to disagree? There really are few foods, sweet or savoury, that aren’t vastly improved by a dollop, a dash or a swirl, and watching this most luscious of ingredients melt into a pool of gold atop your Christmas Day veg is one of the most satisfying sights on Earth.The festive season is the perfect time to ramp up your cooking efforts, and adding just the right amount of butter to some of your most mouthwatering treats can elevate them to perfection. We’ve discovered 10 Christmas favourites that can be made even more delicious with a bit more butter, so grab a napkin and tuck in ...1. Eggs BenedictA glass of champagne and a plate of smoked salmon eggs Benedict makes a sophisticated start to Christmas Day – so much so that you won’t care a jot if things unravel later in a whirlwind of wrapping paper. A perfectly-creamy hollandaise sauce can be tricky to master, but its reputation is more fearsome than necessary: with a little patience, you can avoid the dreaded curdling. Spread muffins thickly with Kerrygold Softer Butter, and top with layers of smoked salmon, a poached egg and lashings of hollandaise made with butter, finished off with a few snips of chives.2. TurkeyNow on to the highlight of the day … achieving the perfect golden sheen on your turkey is where butter really excels. Smother the outside of your bird with Kerrygold Salted Butter and a sprinkling of herbs, and achieve an extra hit of flavour by gently pushing more rich and creamy Kerrygold between the breast and the turkey skin, along with slivers of garlic. Smooth the butter into every corner, and the resulting meat will be juicy, delicious and mouthwateringly tender.3. StuffingThanks to Kerrygold, your turkey has emerged from the oven golden and triumphant, and the stuffing you serve alongside it has to be equally epic. In the US, turkey is often elevated with the addition of brown butter stuffing – a glorious marriage of cubed bread, browned butter, aromatic garlic and herbs, and a dash of stock. It’s a twist on the usual sage and breadcrumbs that’s well worth trying.4. Brussels sproutsOnce you come round to their taste, you may possibly be persuaded that brussels sprouts are the best veg on the table – and one we should embrace well beyond Christmas. Convert even the fussiest members of your family by making garlic-butter glazed sprouts: cut in half, add to a pan of melted garlic butter (one bashed clove to 100g of salted butter), cover and cook until tender, finishing off with a sprinkling of finely chopped cooked bacon and a grating of parmesan. Vegetable heaven ...5. Mashed root vegA hot bowl of mashed swedes and parsnips, livened up with a butter-breadcrumb topping, is a delicious addition to your festive table. It’s a truth universally acknowledged that the more butter you use, the better mashed veg becomes, so use Kerrygold Unsalted to keep things silky smooth, then fry breadcrumbs and thyme in salted butter for a contrasting crunchy topping. Totally tasty.6. Mince piesMince pies are a staple of any self-respecting Christmas table, despite your uncle’s insistence on calling them “mint spies” – and adding a dollop of brandy-butter frosting takes them to a whole new level. Whip together icing sugar, salted butter, double cream and brandy, and you’ve got a sensational sweet topping, made in moments. It will sit proudly on mince pies and Christmas puddings, and makes an excellent illicit dip for toffee (I won’t tell, if you don’t).7. Hot spiced buttered rumForget mulled wine and eggnog: this is the drink that will make your home smell of Christmas and your mouth thank you forever. With butter a key ingredient, it’s smooth, silky, warming and delicious – which means you can get through a few glasses far too easily. The tastiest versions feature apricot brandy as well as rum and (of course) plenty of unsalted butter and a grating of nutmeg.8. Christmas tree breadFast becoming a festive staple, pull-apart bread in the shape of a Christmas tree is perfect for sharing, as well as being devastatingly moreish. And a great way to finish off Christmas day. It can come stuffed with cheese, pesto or ‘nduja sausage meat (although there’s nothing to stop you making all three). Ensure yours pops by glazing generously with garlic butter – simply bash a clove of garlic and mix into 100g of softened salted butter. Scrumptious!9. Baked potatoesBaked potatoes are the ideal vehicle for Christmas Day leftovers. Pile on some turkey, sliced pigs in blankets, shredded brussels sprouts, and sit in a pool of gravy, and you’ve got Boxing Day dinner sorted. Of course, a baked potato unadorned with butter is a sad sight indeed, so don’t forget to nestle a generous slice of salted butter in your spud’s fluffy depths before piling on your toppings.10. Boxing Day curryA twist on butter chicken, butter turkey curry is a stunning way to use up your leftover meat. A delicately-spiced, creamy-buttery sauce is the most delicious place your turkey can go for a post-Christmas dip. Serve with fluffy rice and baked naan with a generous spread of salted butter, for a feast that kicks all other leftover dishes to the kerb.Going for goldPush out the boat this Christmas with a buttery feast of flavoursome treats.

Each neighbourhood is composed of its own intimate social network, and travelling through them with a camera makes you a significant suspicion.“You’re caught between the two sides of the conflict: the rulers of Gaza limit what you can photograph and write about, imprisoning and torturing those who disobey. At the same time, the Israeli army sees you as a potential threat that must be eliminated, as has been the fate of many Palestinian journalists.”Now living in the US, Saftawi’s book My Gaza is a very personal account of an upbringing in a difficult and violent environment, with abuse from inside his own family as well as life in a conflict zone.“I’ve put my memories and dreams into these pages. I’ve shared the view from my window.“For years, I clung to the idea of fleeing my country for the western world. In 2016, I managed to leave Gaza for New York, and soon after began the process of seeking asylum in California. People wanted to know how they could help my wife and I, aside from offering financial assistance. Then I received the opportunity to publish my photographs. It’s an opportunity so many of the refugees arriving in the US every day aren’t afforded: the chance to share one’s experience.“My story is in part the story of my father, Imad al-Saftawi, who raised me with violence and fear, and who, after his 18-year imprisonment in Israel, was set free in December of 2018.“My parents cared for their children and wished us the best, but we were constantly berated. My siblings and I were made to feel guilty about our soft hands. We were threatened and punished if we didn’t go to the mosque for the five daily prayers. We were forced to wake at 5am to go with my father to pray the Fajr (dawn prayer).“I’m now seven thousand miles away from him, from Gaza, and I walk as a free man.“Standing behind the camera, your hands shake as you document the suffering.“These photographs are visual memories that explore the lives behind the headlines. This work is dedicated to all those trapped in the hardships of this life, surviving in the hopes of a better tomorrow.”Jehad al-Saftawi is a documentary journalist, photographer and videographer dedicated to social justice and human rights storytelling.

But reports of conditions in some of its huge warehouses have brought a new level of scrutiny, as John Harris explainsBefore the pandemic struck, high street retailers were already struggling to stay competitive with online companies that offered low prices and rapid deliveries. When Covid-19 forced shops to close and consumers to stay at home, online retailers, particularly Amazon, were ideally placed to capitalise.   columnist John Harris tells Anushka Asthana that having spoken to several Amazon workers in recent weeks and months, it is clear that rising demand is placing a huge strain on the workforce. While Amazon temporarily raised its wage rates, workers allege that only in April did masks become mandatory and warehouses over the summer were often uncomfortably hot.  One worker, Courtenay Brown, says the Amazon Fresh warehouse in New Jersey where she works has had a big increase in hiring and that workers would take breaks in their cars to avoid overcrowding. Amazon said in response that it “prioritised the safety and health of its employees”, and spent “over $800m on safety measures in the first half of the year alone, including personal protective equipment, enhanced cleaning, staggered and flexible shifts, revisions at workstations and developing in-house Covid-19 testing capabilities.” Meanwhile, Tim Bray, a former company vice-president, is now what the New York Times calls “Amazon’s highest-profile defector”. He says Amazon can appear to treat its workers as interchangeable and that he sees the controversies swirling around Amazon as being symptomatic of much deeper issues, which can only be resolved by governments."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c2faf821d571cb448fa5f75f48609549aba770c/0_74_2368_1420/master/2368.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=04a901a79c9b95c6d9c75a7c9ad11413","title":"is former elite boss gerald marie the harvey weinstein of the fashion industry","story":"Wendy Walsh was 17 when she moved to Paris to be a model. Within weeks of arriving, Walsh alleges, she was raped by Gérald Marie. She is one of 16 women who have spoken to the investigative reporter Lucy Osborne, who has spent the past year looking into whether Marie was a sexual predatorWhen Wendy Walsh moved to Paris in 1980 to work as a model, she was excited about what the future held for her. But within weeks, she alleges, the former Elite Models boss Gérald Marie had raped her. Walsh is one of 16 women who have made sexual misconduct allegations against Marie, who for three decades was one of the most powerful men in the fashion industry. Marie was married to the supermodel Linda Evangelista between 1987 and 1993. Evangelista has praised the “courage and strength” shown by a growing number of women accusing her ex-husband of sexual misconduct and rape, saying she believed the women’s accounts of their experiences with Marie. “During my relationship with Gérald Marie, I knew nothing of these sexual allegations against him, so I was unable to help these women,” said Evangelista. “Hearing them now, and based on my own experiences, I believe that they are telling the truth. It breaks my heart because these are wounds that may never heal, and I admire their courage and strength for speaking up today.” The investigative reporter Lucy Osborne talks to Anushka Asthana about the women’s stories and how Marie was allegedly able to abuse models for decades. Some inside the modelling world have told Osborne that Marie may be the Harvey Weinstein of the fashion industry. Marie firmly denies the allegations and his lawyers have said he is “extremely affected” by the accusations. They said he would fight a French criminal case that was opened in September after prosecutors received allegations from four women: “He intends to actively participate in the manifestation of the truth within the scope of the opened criminal investigation,” they said. The Elite modelling agency went bankrupt in 2004 and split in two. Both new corporate entities have sought to distance themselves from alleged past abuses and have condemned the sort of behaviour covered in this podcast. Oui Management said Marie was not currently an employee."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a4e96a4fd5c23c998e19bfe7b57b8940f3254fc/0_116_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026amp;height=630\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026amp;overlay-width=100p\u0026amp;overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026amp;s=6fe5d8e2f0fb7e7bdd7a8f02e1c87353","title":"no way to assess costs of covid tiers against no action tory mps told","story":"Report argues in favour of tiers on grounds that letting NHS be overwhelmed is ‘intolerable’It is impossible to know whether the economic cost of the new coronavirus tiers system in England will be greater than that of taking no action, a government analysis has concluded, arguing instead that allowing the NHS to be overwhelmed would be “intolerable for our society”.But in a section about what would happen to the economy if limited or no action is taken and coronavirus cases start to rise exponentially again, the document says it is “not possible to know with any degree of confidence”.The report seemingly contains no new data, instead citing existing statistics and forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility, the Office for National Statistics and other bodies.Arguing that the new tiers are needed to get the R number below one, the document notes that limited restrictions would “allow many people and businesses to operate as normal, if they chose to do so.”It adds: “On the other hand, more widespread infections and the consequences of pressure on the NHS would affect spending in the economy due to voluntary social distancing, effects to confidence and impacts on businesses, including through high levels of employee sickness.“Given the unprecedented nature of both the virus and the restrictions that have been required to mitigate it, it is not possible to assess the balance of these effects.”Instead, the analysis primarily argues in favour of the tiers on public health grounds, saying that a failure to control the R number would swamp hospitals, putting at risk the lives of not just Covid patients but others, and would lead to routine operations being cancelled.It cites scientific estimates that on 1 October, infection numbers were doubling every 8 to 14 days, and growing even faster in some areas.“It is particularly important to consider this eventuality during the winter months, when the NHS is under additional non-Covid -19 winter pressures, so in comparison to the spring and summer periods, action to prevent the NHS being overwhelmed is even more critical.“A stable and fully functioning health system is one of the pillars that underpins our society and our economy. The government’s view is that the severe loss of life and other health impacts of allowing the NHS to be overwhelmed would be intolerable for our society.”It remains to be seen whether this satisfies the rebel Conservatives, who are believed to number up to 70. Several have asked for assurance that the benefits of imposing the new tiers will be greater than the costs.If many Tory MPs rebel, the government could need to rely on Labour MPs backing the plans, or at least abstaining.The Tory MP Mark Harper, who chairs the Covid Recovery Group of MPs sceptical about the pandemic restrictions, said he was disappointed at the delay in publishing the data but said MPs mulling whether to vote against the tiers plan would decide on Tuesday before the vote.“I am disappointed MPs, journalists and the public have been given so little time to digest information of this magnitude,” he said. “We are, after all, talking about imposing some of the most severe restrictions on our constituents and the way they lead their lives and run their businesses. This information is what ministers should have been insisting on before they made their decisions, so it surely could have been made available earlier.“As I have said before, I and a number of colleagues are particularly keen to understand the likely impact of the restrictions on Covid and the full extent of some of the non-Covid health implications they have, as well as the undoubted impact on livelihoods. So we will read and analyse this data tonight and report back on our findings later tomorrow.”The report says the complexities of the spread of Covid and any actions to mitigate it mean it is “not possible to know” exactly what would happen in different circumstances, adding: “Any assessment of a given change to restrictions is therefore unavoidably only partial in nature.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/febc0642bcd49e4e964b768c0559ddf019a4e81e/0_353_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=a39bc09762b5e6cebdbdbda863c52343","title":"share your experiences of uk home visits during the coronavirus pandemic","story":"We’d like to hear from people giving and receiving home visits about how they have been impacted by the pandemicMany healthcare services outside of coronavirus treatment have been badly disrupted by the coronavirus pandemic, both in hospitals and in the community.According to guidance from the British Medical Association and Royal College of Midwives, home visits should only be conducted where absolutely necessary.We’d like to learn more about the impact of the pandemic on home visits from midwives, district nurses, carers and other healthcare professionals.

Details of how the Ashton Gate operation will work were set out in a report to directors of a local health board on Friday.The report said the immunisation programme was to be delivered via mass vaccination centres (MVCs), community sites and a “roving model” for care homes and the housebound.It anticipated delivering 75,000 to 110,000 vaccinations per week to residents of Bristol and the two neighbouring local authority areas starting as early as 7 December and lasting until April next year.Vaccinations are expected to be given 12 hours a day, seven days a week and £2.3m has been allocated to support the workforce and sites. The report warned it was a “complex and evolving programme”.It is understood that personnel from all three armed forces are to be involved in setting up and helping to operate the Ashton Gate site and others like it, and the football and rugby teams will continue to play at the stadium because the concourse can be sealed off from the rest of the ground.It is believed that other sport stadiums and venues in other parts of the country may be used as vaccination sites, with Cheltenham racecourse in Gloucestershire and Epsom in Surrey both thought to be preparing to help.Such sites have the advantage of wide open spaces that can easily be converted, with good car parking and access. It is thought there will be dozens of MVCs.Asked about the preparations taking place at Ashton Gate, the prime minister’s spokesperson said only that details would be set out “in due course.”The NHS in Wales, meanwhile, has carried out a “large and successful test” of practical matters that need to be in place once a vaccine is given the go ahead.The Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford, told a press conference in Cardiff on Monday: “That could be as early as this week and we will be ready for it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/81e4c6692c5a1d516bcc0b4c4ffb61a871980d8c/0_293_5255_3155/master/5255.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c1387f28d11228301604d948dea46bde","title":"pubs and cinemas may turn away people not covid vaccinated says minister","story":"Nadhim Zahawi, in charge of UK rollout, says technology could help track who has had jabCustomers who have refused a Covid-19 vaccine could be turned away by hospitality and sports venues, the government’s vaccine minister has suggested, as he discussed the idea of using technology to reopen the economy.Nadhim Zahawi, who was appointed on Saturday to be responsible for overseeing the rollout of the jab, said that while having the vaccine would not be compulsory, businesses such as pubs and restaurants might require proof that people have been vaccinated before allowing them in.It raises questions over whether the government might use immunity passports as a way to get people back into shops and hospitality venues after a vaccine is licensed. They are already used by some countries to see whether people have protection against yellow fever or polio.“I think that in many ways the pressure will come from both ways. From service providers who’ll say: ‘Look, demonstrate to us that you have been vaccinated.’ But, also, we will make the technology as easy and accessible as possible.”The MP for Stratford-upon-Avon and minister for business and industry said people would have to “make a decision” on whether to get vaccinated, and said if they chose not to they could face severe restrictions.The health secretary, Matt Hancock, told a Downing Street press conference: “For a long time now we’ve been looking at the questions that minister Zahawi was talking about and the question of what’s the impact on the inidual in terms of what they can do.“Firstly, we do not plan to mandate the vaccine. We think that by encouraging the uptake of the vaccine, we will get a very high proportion of people in this country to take up the vaccine, because of course it protects you but it also helps to protect your loved ones and your community.”Ilan Kelman, a professor of disasters and health at University College London, said care needed to be taken for those who were unable to receive a vaccine for medical reasons."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5088aa2fb3fdebd5130c14582553edd540b8d365/0_216_8064_4839/master/8064.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0a2c9ccc90253b941426ce4822f2ed47","title":"twickenham bars shut fans return for england v france autumn nations cup","story":"England supporters are set to go thirsty at Sunday’s Autumn Nations Cup final against France with the Rugby Football Union keeping the Twickenham bars shut when fans return for the first time since March.It is understood the RFU has decided alcohol will be available only “in restaurant-style facilities and be served to the table with a substantial meal”, in line with government regulations on hospitality venues in tier 2. As a result, the bars around the stadium will stay closed with just one stall – offering food, soft drinks and tea and coffee – open. Supporters, who are ordinarily allowed to drink in their seats, will also be banned from bringing alcohol with them.The RFU has already acknowledged that Sunday’s match will be loss-making, viewing the opportunity to host 2,000 supporters as a test event in the hope that more will be able to attend the three home Six Nations games next year.The RFU has sold out its £299 hospitality packages for Sunday’s match and is donating 400 to local NHS workers via a ballot. Around 1,000 of the remaining tickets are on Tuesday set to go on sale to local residents, members and debenture holders, with the vast majority of those attending coming from the local area, London and the south-east. Anyone living in a tier 3 area is not allowed to attend, according to the RFU’s protocols.All supporters who attend will have to agree to a spectator code of conduct and face ejection from the stadium if they do not adhere to it.Other stadium protocols – which the RFU says go above and beyond guidance from the government and the Sports Ground Safety Authority – include that face masks must be worn at all times, except when eating and drinking, while supporters are encouraged to walk, cycle or drive to the match rather than take public transport.One-way systems will be in operation around the stadium and supporters will be given staggered arrival times to minimise the buildup of large groups.The 20-year-old Alfie Barbeary has been called up by England for the first time by Eddie Jones for Sunday’s match. Barbeary was among the try-scorers for Wasps at the weekend and has established a burgeoning reputation as an all-action forward – able to play either at hooker or flanker. He has made only two starts for Wasps and seven appearances in total but has evidently impressed Jones, winning a place in England’s 33-man squad.In the backs, Jonathan Joseph has been ruled out with a calf injury but Ollie Lawrence returns to the squad after missing Saturday’s victory in Wales. All told, it is largely the strongest squad available to Jones, even though England will face a desperately depleted France side.Due to an uneasy compromise between the French federation and Top 14 clubs, France players can play only three matches this autumn, leaving Fabien Galthié without 20 front-line players, plus those who are absent through injury. It was announced on Monday that the scrum-half Baptiste Couilloud will captain the side while making his first Test start and winning only his fifth cap.Meanwhile, the RFU has revealed that the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport has given its approval for the return of adapted 15-a-side contact rugby in the community game. The changes include no scrums – with a free-kick taking their place – and no mauls."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/912ec4608d1e2a7467a3b191fb0e3f62d5c6d889/0_150_3690_2215/master/3690.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=c0930da272a9814de35564c1778e3237","title":"one knight only judi dench maggie smith ian mckellen derek jacobi theatre anecdotes zoom","story":"In an event for the theatrical charity Acting for Others, Dench, Smith, McKellen and Jacobi spoke about their highs and lows, superstitions and acting tipsThey are, according to their pal Kenneth Branagh, the “greatest quartet of Shakespearean actors on the planet”. And on Sunday evening, for the charity get-together For One Knight Only, hosted by Branagh on Zoom, Dames Maggie Smith and Judi Dench joined Sirs Ian McKellen and Derek Jacobi to share acting anecdotes, tell Christmas cracker jokes and speak a bit of verse. It was pure thespian gold – here’s a handful of revelations.Ian McKellen shared the stage with a ghost …At least, that’s what Patrick Stewart told him. When they were midway through Waiting for Godot at the Theatre Royal Haymarket 10 years ago, Stewart turned to look at McKellen and “his face was ashen and he stopped acting”, remembered McKellen. “He said afterwards he had seen a man standing next to me in a brown overall jacket.” They decided it was a deceased stage manager. Apparently, Stewart often sees ghosts and before he does he always smells bacon. (Perhaps it’s ham, suggests Dench.)Judi Dench’s parents couldn’t have been prouder …When Dench starred in Romeo and Juliet in 1960, her parents came along to watch. It was a landmark production directed by the celebrated Franco Zeffirelli at the Old Vic. In act three, scene two, Dench’s desperate Juliet asks the Nurse: “Where is my father and my mother?” At which point, proud Reginald Dench called out: “Here we are, darling, in row H!”Maggie Smith was once an usher …In those days plastic cups weren’t the nuisance. “They had pots of tea,” she remembered, “and you had to balance these trays – teapots, cups and saucers, and some very dreary biscuits. A lady once said to me, ‘I would like a lightly boiled egg.’” In later years, Smith might have delivered a trademark withering putdown, but she duly relayed the request. “They more or less told me to go and tell her to stuff herself.”Derek Jacobi had “glorious, glorious” hair …McKellen says he felt “instant love” for Jacobi when they met at university. He was a dapper dresser, sporting tight trousers and “glorious, glorious hair”. Combed round the back in a duck’s arse, with a spectacular quiff, it was a Tony Curtis cut and cost Jacobi all his spare cash to maintain it with trips to his Italian barber. Jacobi dreaded going to bed for fear of messing it up.Ian McKellen nicked a beermat from the Rovers Return …This was during his 10-episode stint on Coronation Street in 2005. The mat was nailed down to the set so it took some elbow grease. After a guilty night’s sleep, he returned the next day and nailed it back. (Maggie Smith longed to nab a goblet from the Harry Potter films but didn’t fancy smuggling it past security.)Judi Dench hates people whistling backstage …It’s a theatrical superstition, along with “the Scottish play”. Macbeth inspired her to become an actor. When she saw her older brother playing Duncan in a production of the tragedy, she was gripped when he declared: “What bloody man is that?” Dench knew “this is for me,” she said. “Shakespeare and swearing!”Derek Jacobi got a copy of Hamlet from Peter O’Toole …In 1963, Jacobi was Laertes to O’Toole’s prince. One day, O’Toole presented him with a book of Hamlet that once belonged to celebrated Victorian actor Johnston Forbes-Robertson. Jacobi later passed it on to Branagh who, in 2017, gave it to Tom Hiddleston when he directed him as Hamlet at Rada.Ian McKellen wants to act on stage with Meryl Streep …In 1985 they were in a film of David Hare’s play Plenty. “I said, ‘Could we do a play together?’” McKellen remembered. Streep told him that she was “having a little bit of a film career at the moment”.

Neither are the parents of children who have been told to self-isolate. Small business owners, sole traders and self-employed workers also appear to be excluded.Councils also say the government “vastly underestimated” demand for the payments, which were introduced in September to support those who cannot afford to take time off work to self-isolate, and has provided insufficient funding.The scheme is critical to the government’s coronavirus strategy because the disease will continue to spread unless infectious people and their close contacts go into quarantine for between 10 and 14 days.Leaders say the high number of rejections is mainly due to strict eligibility rules, rather than people applying for the fund fraudulently. Alistair Cromwell, the acting chief executive of Citizens Advice, said gaps in the safety net meant people were facing an “impossible choice” between obeying the law to self-isolate or paying the bills.Several councils told the  the government is refusing to increase their allowance of “discretionary” funds, which were made available for people on low incomes who did not receive universal credit or other benefits.This means that in practice only people who receive benefits will be eligible for the scheme in some areas, creating what local leaders in Yorkshire and Humber believe is a “postcode lottery”.Judith Blake, the leader of Leeds city council, said: “It’s clear that demand for this type of support is currently out stripping supply, and with many councils already in financial crisis, we need the government to urgently provide more funding to address this.”Oldham council, which has had one of England’s highest infection rates for months, has paid out £210,000 to 421 people – almost double its allocation from the government.Arooj Shah, the deputy leader of Oldham council, urged the government to expand the scheme to include parents whose children have to self-isolate. She said: “As a society we cannot make people choose between paying their bills and putting food on the table and following government guidance.”Eamonn O’Brien, the Labour leader of Bury council, which also has one of England’s highest case rates, said it had used up the allocation provided by the government and was having to transfer money from a hardship fund to cover the cost. He described it as “short-sighted penny-pinching from government”.Susan Hinchcliffe, the leader of Bradford council, said it had paid out £420,000 in support payments by 25 November, far more than its government allocation of £311,500. It had paid out a further £184,000 in discretionary payments, £500 short of its allocation, she said, adding that the government had refused to increase the “meagre” funding.Alice Wiseman, the director of public health at Gateshead council, said the £500 payment “doesn’t meet the needs of real humans” and that its eligibility should be widened. “Behavioural science says if we want people to do what we ask them to do we need to ensure that they are not financially penalised as a result. I don’t think we’re there yet,” she said.A Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said: “We have given local authorities an initial £50m to cover the costs of the scheme which includes money for discretionary payments to people told to self-isolate who fall outside the scope of the main scheme but who may still face hardship as a result of having to self-isolate. This is in addition to other support that people may be able to access when they are required to self-isolate, such as statutory sick pay. ”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fccf623acb9d4a33ee75d35b8ed69cd1ee70f436/0_0_5016_3010/master/5016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a5ce697ec1d30dc3955b4dfd8b45b2f0","title":"the rubber duck revolution in pictures","story":"Ducks have become a symbol of Thailand’s pro-democracy protests in Bangkok after demonstrators used them as shields against police water cannon and teargas "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/46348ab523b750648423d897f294ea301ba07cac/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1717e8bfbfcc2607bfbd294e4902f9a7","title":"coronavirus live news us may begin vaccinations before christmas vietnam sees first case in three months","story":"WHO ‘will do everything’ to find Covid origin Mexico and Brazil seeing ‘alarming’ case surge Opec to hold a second day of talks on TuesdayAfter a Thanksgiving weekend when the number of people traveling through US airports reached its highest since mid-March, a top government official said on Monday some Americans could begin receiving coronavirus vaccinations before Christmas, Reuters reports. US Health Secretary Alex Azar said Pfizer Inc’s Covid-19 vaccine could be authorised and shipped within days of a Dec. 10 meeting of outside advisers to the Food and Drug Administration tasked with reviewing trial data and recommending whether it warrants approval.Samoa’s two positive Covid-19 cases have been declared historical cases and not infectious.The cases were detected in a 70-year-old who had travelled from Melbourne in Australia, and a sailor repatriated from Italy. Both Samoan citizens arrived in Apia on a repatriation flight on November 13, and subsequently tested positive for the novel coronavirus.But further examination of their cases has found they were both historical: the sailor had the virus in May and the Australian-based man in August.Blood samples from the two cases were sent to New Zealand: results showed low viral counts for both, and the cases were deemed not to be infectious.Samoa’s director-general of health, Leausa Dr Take Naseri, said the two positive cases, and the rest of the 274 passengers who arrived in Samoa on the same flight, will have to remain in quarantine for an additional seven days as a precaution.Leausa said all front-line workers at the airport, including health staff, police, and airport crew had been tested and cleared of the coronavirus.Samoa has recorded no other cases of the coronavirus.Elsewhere in the Pacific, the Mariana Islands has recorded 106 cases, 80 of which have been imported to the islands, mainly from the US mainland and the US territory of Guam.Fiji has recorded four more cases, all in border quarantine.But French Polynesia, one of the worst affected territories in the Pacific, has surpassed 14,000 cases, and 73 deaths. 82 people remain in hospital, including 21 in intensive care. France has flown out additional medical personnel to assist with the surge in cases.All but 62 of the 14,096 confirmed cases across French Polynesia came after the archipelago re-opened its borders in July and abolished mandatory quarantine. Vietnam reported its first local transmission of Covid-19 in nearly three months on Monday, with officials scrambling to prevent a wider outbreak in the country’s most populous city.The communist nation was applauded earlier this year for controlling the pandemic with strict restrictions on movement, extensive quarantine measures and a robust track-and-trace regime.But late on Monday the health ministry announced that that it had detected coronavirus in a 32-year-old man in Ho Chi Minh City, a relative of a Vietnam Airlines flight attendant who tested positive on the weekend.“A temporary lockdown has been made on locations (in the city) where the patient had visited,” the ministry said in a statement, adding that dozens of people in contact with the latest case had been put under quarantine.Vietnam has recorded just 1,347 coronavirus cases and 35 deaths across a country of 95 million.Life has almost returned to normal in the country over the past almost three months, despite a summer outbreak centred on the beach resort city of Danang that put health authorities back on high alert.Hello and welcome to today’s live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic with me, Helen Sullivan.

It is also going to be a challenging time for shoppers, as they try to get organised for a Christmas like never before with more than 40 shopping days taken from them almost overnight.We know the problems all too well, but we know the solution, too, or at least part of it. The internet. But,\u0026nbspas we have said before and will say again,\u0026nbspshopping online comes with a caveat.

Back to topAs many businesses struggle to survive the global pandemic we highlight the supports available to companies and look at the innovative solutions some firms are adopting to stay afloat"},{"url":null,"title":"what s it all about online learning terms explained","story":"The arrival of coronavirus to these shores prompted a swift pivot away from the traditional face-to-face style of teaching most students were familiar with since the first day they attended primary school.Students nearing the end of their time in college had their finals to look forward to while others had essays, assignments and end-of-year exams to contend with. That all changed with the lockdown.“The move to emergency remote teaching, learning and assessment was a huge challenge, but one which all academic staff engaged in overnight. The response by both the staff and students, to such a dramatic transition to remote online space, was phenomenal,” says Dr Mary Fitzpatrick, head of the Centre for Teaching and Learning at University of Limerick (UL).As colleges began moving their programmes online for the final semester, educational priorities quickly changed. Gone, all of a sudden, were the classes, lectures, tutorials, trips to the library and group-work meetings.In came video conferencing, online quizzes, virtual learning platforms, specialised simulations, asynchronous and synchronous teaching.The shift to online does have its benefits.“Some of the benefits of course delivery online include flexibility: students can work at their own pace, supporting independent and self-directed learning, and allowing them to fit learning around the rest of their lives and unlimited access to practice and revision resources,” says Dr Alison Hood, dean of teaching and learning at Maynooth University.Many will be unfamiliar with some of the terms associated with distance learning, blended learning and remote learning but this is likely to change in the coming months and years as these learning strategies grow in popularity. Many of these concepts are interrelated – and they all involve learning – but what do they mean inidually and how do they relate to each other?Distance learningA 1960s Australian children’s television series might not be the first thing that springs to mind when we consider the merits of distance learning. Yet for many, Skippy the Bush Kangaroo is where they first came across the practice.The series told the story of a young boy called Sonny and his adventures with his pet kangaroo friend Skippy. Sonny lived in a remote national park and had to use a two-way radio to connect with his teachers in order to receive his education. Thanks to the development of internet technology, distance learning has advanced quite a bit since then. The tools and methods traditionally associated with it such as correspondence courses, educational television and, in the case of Sonny, two-way radios, have now largely been replaced by online learning platforms. In many cases, the interactive online learning environment used to deliver distance learning courses is now the very same platform used by students who attend the face-to-face courses traditionally associated with third-level education.Colleges and universities have improved their ability to deliver distance learning programmes while at the same time offering comprehensive support for students. In short, distance learning is when students don’t attend classroom lessons in person. Instead, they receive instruction, and learn and study from home.Classes are usually conducted over the internet and students can submit assignments remotely. As distance learning offers students the flexibility and convenience of not having to be physically present in the learning institution, the advantages are numerous. Students can access class resources from a single location, they can save substantially on transport and fees as courses offered through distance learning are usually significantly cheaper than traditional classroom-based pedagogy.Blended or hybrid learning This is where the traditional form of face-to-face learning converges with the newer methods of remote and online instruction. Blended learning uses technology to improve the learning process and is the model most likely to be adopted by third-level institutions as ongoing social distancing requirements limit the possibility of traditional in-person lectures taking place in the medium term.Blended learning is customisable and, as a result, a wide range of approaches to the method means the balance between in-class teaching and the use of technology varies from programme to programme. Advocates say it offers the best of both worlds. The curriculum is usually delivered through a combination of classroom-based lectures, online lectures and the use of other online resources. Ideally, these course components complement each other to strengthen the overall outcome.Blended learning also offers students the benefits of in-class engagement with instructors with the flexibility of online learning. The degree to which the course is blended depends on the course programme and the institution in question. Most Irish colleges and universities offer a suite of blended learning courses across undergraduate, graduate and professional level categories. This is likely to continue even when social distancing measures are in place.eLearning Short for electronic learning, eLearning is a term that essentially means learning with the aid of digital tools. It has its roots in distance learning. The internet has contributed greatly to a marked growth in the use of technology for the delivery of education over the past decade and has helped the development of new models of teaching, improved instruction methods and the possibility of better student outcomes.Technology is at the centre of eLearning and without it the programme could not be delivered. Students use computer and internet technology to access the curriculum from outside the traditional classroom.It is widely seen as a flexible and efficient way of delivering the curriculum as most people with a stable internet connection can access these tools and participate in some form of online learning.It is also efficient. Students no longer have to worry about attending a lecture or class at a set time, they can review lecture videos as often as they like, there is no commute time and it can help develop time-management skills. Unsurprisingly, it is often the preferred option for students who are working or who have other constraints on their time.This form of learning is also used in a wider context. In recent years we have seen a sharp growth in demand for online digital courses. Courses called Moocs (Massive Open Online Courses) first appeared in the late 2000s and were seen as a disruptor which would widen access and lower the costs associated with traditional modes of learning.Critics sometimes cite poor student engagement as one of the greatest drawbacks of eLearning. In traditional classroom settings, students can raise their hand and engage in face-to-face interaction with their instructor but it is not as easy to raise the hand digitally in an eLearning environment.The very nature of the approach means students will invariably spend a lot of time on their own in front of the computer screen and the lack of social interaction can lead to a sense of isolation.Tools do exist to facilitate better communication however and the development of video software now means students can interact directly with instructors through video-link. Depending on the type of course undertaken, practical assessments can be difficult to cater for well.Emergency remote teachingNot to be confused with distance learning or online learning, emergency remote teaching is a measure that is adopted in response to a crisis where the curriculum has to be rapidly moved to a virtual online setting.The unintended consequences of emergency remote teaching can include a failure to meet the expectations that students had at the outset of the course. Simply broadcasting a lecture with the aid of a video conferencing tool or uploading a presentation to a virtual learning environment is not the same as presenting course content that has been planned, developed and designed for delivery via a framework that best enables learning to take place.The sudden change in delivery model can mean a change to how course material is absorbed by students and it can also mean a change to the assessment model which can be disruptive for those students who had prepared for another format entirely over a lengthy period of time.The needs of all students might not be met by sudden change, and unexpected barriers such as the digital ide and other inequities can arise. There is also the danger that in the absence of a coherent emergency plan that teaching objectives can shift from the achievement of pre-defined learning goals to enacting a crisis management approach instead.While the process of moving from an established teaching method to an unfamiliar new platform can be difficult, emergency remote teaching can be a useful learning experience as instructors quickly learn to apply what works and discard what doesn’t.Synchronous learningSynchronous learning is a term used to describe a method where students engage in learning at the same time but not in the same place. Synchronous learning usually involves the use of online tools such as chat and videoconferencing where students and teachers can interact in real-time during class. Class activities typically take place through the use of dedicated virtual learning environments (also known as learning management systems) such as Brightspace, Moodle or Canvas.Asynchronous learningAsynchronous learning is a term used to describe a method where students engage in learning at different times and locations. Asynchronous learning often utilises elements such as email, pre-recorded video and other tools such as online discussion forums that facilitate the sharing of information.Learning management systemSometimes referred to as virtual learning environment or virtual learning platforms, learning management systems are web-based software platforms which facilitate the delivery of course content. Platforms provide teaching tools and supports but also allow course instructors to track student performance over time.Multiple formats such as video, audio and text are catered for and students can be assessed through tools such as online quizzes and questionnaires.They are in widespread use at third level and can be used to deliver asynchronous or synchronous-based courses. Systems such as Brightspace, Canvas, Moodle and Blackboard have built-in tools that allow instructors to deliver lectures by video or audio, facilitate discussions and even track student performance.Virtual classroomA virtual classroom is an online learning environment where students interact in real time with the instructor and with each other. Usually delivered via videoconferencing tools, virtual classrooms are also a feature of learning management systems. Students can also usually interact and ask or answer questions by using a chat window. Presentation tools such as PowerPoint or whiteboard tools can usually be utilised by the teacher during class. It is also possible during a class or lecture to operate break-out rooms where students can work together or where the instructor can interact directly with an inidual student.WebinarA webinar is a class in which participants view the same screen at the same time. Very useful in a classroom setting, the instructor controls proceedings and participants can communicate through the use of interactive features such as chatrooms, polls and quizzes.Collaborative toolsThis is usually a reference to materials such as PDFs, slideshow, spreadsheets, presentations, images or text documents. These tools are usually found as a feature within the learning management systems.Flipped classesA feature of some blended learning approaches where lectures are replaced by classes or tutorial-type settings. Students consume content – perhaps by viewing a lecture video or completing an assignment – at home before engaging in analysis and discussion in the live class setting. The practice results in more face-to-face time and affords the instructor greater flexibility in being able to engage directly with students during class, and it can help increase student engagement as they are required to prepare material ahead of the class."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Case taken by a group of young people against 33 countries including IrelandOnly 3.2 million of the estimated 10 million lightbulbs sold in 2019 were recycledGreen ministers insist Government is responding to climate and bioersity crises"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4423799.1606767274!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"public health doctors plan three days of strikes in january","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Health Stephen Donnelly said it was disappointing that a strike could happen during a pandemicPublic health specialists, who are playing a key role in dealing with the pandemic, are to hold three days of strikes in January in a dispute over pay and contracts. Members of the Irish Medical Organisation (IMO), the doctors, who will hold the stoppages on January 14th , January 21st and 22nd, say they are prepared to escalate their action later. Last Friday, 94 per cent of them voted to strike.The doctors, mostly female, insist they should enjoy better-paid, higher-ranked consultants posts , and complain that the Department of Health has avoided proper talks for the last five months.Regardless of qualifications, no serving public health doctors has consultant rank, though the strike is not just about pay, said Dr Ina Kelly, who chairs the IMO’s public health committee. “It really is time for Government to step up to the plate and recognise their own ethical obligations and to honour agreements,” she said, criticising the Government “misleading commentary” about the reasons for the dispute.Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly said it was disappointing that a strike could happen during a pandemic, saying more progress had been made in five months than was previously made in years to settle the row.The Department of Health said on Monday that it and the Minister were disappointed at the planned public health doctors’ strike.It said the Minister hoped the issue of consultant status could be resolved through engagement and that industrial action could be avoided. “The creation of consultant level roles in public health medicine is a priority for the Minister as public health specialists have waited for many years for consultant status,” it said. “The Department and HSE were working on the future framework for public health in recent months and have now finalised a detailed framework for a future public health model, to include consultant level roles, while also considering the important health protection requirements necessary in managing the current pandemic in the medium term. The business case, outlining the proposed framework, was submitted by the Minister for Health to the Minister for Public The Department of Health has proposed to the Department of Public Expenditure that about 80 public health consultant posts should be created, filled by open competition, earning between €189,000 and €227,000 annually.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4416064.1606051322!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ancestors of biden obama jfk reagan left ireland within some 10 years of each other","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFiona Fitzsimons presenting her research to the Bidens during their 2016 visit to Ireland. Photograph : White House Press OfficeIt is “not surprising” that descendants of Irish emigrants who left during the Famine are now becoming “part of the establishment” in the United States, a genealogist who researched the Irish connections of Joe Biden and Barack Obama has said. Fiona Fitzsimons, researcher with the Irish Family History Centre, said descendants of former US presidents John F. Kennedy, Ronald Reagan, Mr Obama and president-elect Mr Biden all left Ireland for America “within about 10 years of each other”. “It’s the 500lb gorilla in the room that you can’t ignore the Famine. In six years the Irish population was depleted by about a quarter,” Ms Fitzsimons said. “Every fourth person either died or emigrated in a six-year period . . . there’s a flood of Irish into America. So it’s not surprising that from the 1960s through to the present that you’re seeing the descendants of that generation of Irish, who have now become part of the establishment. “These were poor Irish flooding in that weren’t the well-connected, well-educated middle classes with resources who came and settled. It took them a number of generations to establish a foothold and to get an education and work towards becoming the establishment.”Ms Fitzsimons, along with her colleague Helen Moss, were commissioned to research Mr Biden’s Irish connections ahead of his visit to Ireland in 2016 while he was serving as vice-president. Two of Biden’s great great grandfathers were originally from Ireland – Patrick Blewitt from Ballina in Co Mayo and Owen Finnegan from the Cooley Peninsula in Co Louth. The Blewitts and the Finngeans eventually ended up settling in Scranton, Pennsylvania, having left Ireland in the late 1840s. Ms Fitzsimons said although Biden was raised with “a keen sense of being Irish”, Mr Kennedy’s links to Ireland were stronger. A number of the late president’s great grandparents were from Ireland. “I think at this stage there’s something like 22 Irish-American presidents,” Ms Fitzsimons said. “We don’t think about most of them because they are Ulster-Scots. The narrow way that we defined what it was to be Irish in the 20th century – rural and Catholic – that tends to exclude our heritage which is kind of ridiculous when you consider how important that connection with the United States has been to us. Ms Fitzsimons added she believes the “scramble to find a politician’s roots”, such as American presidents’, is “a way to try and claim common ground with them”.The Irish Family History Centre publishes a free magazine every quarter which is available at https:irishlivesremembered.ieUS presidential election: Read more of our coverage of the transition to the Biden White HouseStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4423651.1606752173!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus what s allowed and what to avoid this christmas","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPeople are being advised to wear a mask when cooking and serving food this Christmas, and the amount of people in the kitchen should be limited. Photograph: Drazen ZigiciStockAdvance booking for Mass, no sitting on Santa’s lap and off-peak shopping are among the Government suggestions for navigating Christmas safely as the country prepares to open up for a festive season like no other.Speaking at a Government briefing on Monday, Liz Canavan, assistant secretary general at the Department of the Taoiseach, reminded people that “every contact counts” when it comes to spreading Covid-19. “When meeting people over the period, there will always be an incidence of risk,” she said.With that in mind, here’s what we know about Christmas activities, and life under Level 3 in general.Christmas at homeUnavoidably, people will come together as families over Christmas, and the Government has relaxed the guidelines on household visits, allowing two visiting households to another house, without a limit on numbers attending.Within that context, people are being advised to:Visits to SantaThe Cabinet agreed to examine guidelines specifically drawn up for “seasonal events” such as this, and Ms Canavan indicated on Monday that specific advice on visiting Santa may be forthcoming, saying there had been dialogue with the chief medical officer on this. However, the basic ground rules are clear, she said, with an emphasis on outdoor activities and the usual protective measures, such as hand washing and social distancing. “I think it’s self-evident that you won’t be sitting on Santa’s lap and those types of things,” she said.Christmas marketsOutdoor food markets have been open throughout Level 5, so there won’t be any changes there, as long as social distancing and crowd control measures are in place.Religious servicesUnder an exemption to Level 3 rules, gatherings in churches and other places of worship are permitted for up to 50 people at a time. This is coming in on December 1st and will be reviewed in January. Where the size of a premises allows for more than 50 people, this is allowed so long as it can be ided into different sections with no more than 50 in each, and they are four metres apart at a minimum, with their own entrance and exit. Services should not exceed an hour, and there will be guidance published on choirs, chanting and congregational singing.Face coverings should be worn, and no congregations should take place outside churches before or after services. Ms Canavan said on Monday that there will be demand for services over the Christmas period, and measures will be put in place to address overcrowding. These could include additional services, increased stewarding or the use of advance booking systems should be considered, she said.As under Level 5, funerals with mourners of up to 25 and weddings with guests of up to 25 are allowed.ShoppingPeople are being encouraged to shop during off-peak hours, when they can. Opening hours will be decided by retailers themselves, but the Government is advising that going off-peak will reduce crowds, as well as reducing the load on public transport, and making things easier for those who due to work or other commitments have to shop in peak hours.Visits should be “fairly planned” with people not “meandering around for hours on end”, Ms Canavan said. “So just be kind of focused when you’re in the shops, and also I suppose mindful that people may be queuing to get in.”Eating outFrom Friday, indoor dining is permitted in restaurants and gastropubs. Meals must be prepared on site and inside the premises, with a maximum of six people per table. This includes access for non-residents to restaurants in hotels. Social distancing rules apply, with time limits relaxed when gaps of more than two metres between tables can be facilitated.Cultural venuesMuseums and galleries can open from Tuesday, as can cinemas when protective measures are in place, but no organised indoor events, such as theatre performances, training, conferences or business events can take place.General adviceFor sports, non-contact training in groups of up to 15 can take place, but only inidual training can take place indoors – this includes gyms, where group exercise classes are not permitted. Matches except for professional and elite sports are not permitted. Gyms, leisure centres and swimming pools are reopening.Wet pubs remain closed except for takeaway services, while nightclubs, discos and casinos remain closed. Public transport is limited to 50 per cent capacity, so people are being urged to walk or cycle when possible. Household mixing is not permitted until the 18th, but two households can meet outside. Face coverings should be worn in crowded places, even outside.People are being urged to think of the options available like a credit card limit – that they should be seen as a limit, not a target to be hit. “Being at a lower level of restriction means a greater onus on all of us to manage that risk, to consider it, and to do our very best to mitigate it,” Ms Canavan said.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4422783.1606661723!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"northern irish businesses horribly exposed by brexit mess","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tWith less than six weeks until Brexit, many businesses in Northern Ireland remain underprepared. File photograph: Bloomberg Newry wine merchant Anjo Wines has been supplying hotels, bars and restaurants in Northern Ireland since 1985. It is run by brothers Kevin and Garrett O’Reilly and the business has managed to survive the pandemic, largely thanks to its network of off-licences. “We’re lucky to have our own shops, otherwise we’d be shutting the doors,” says Kevin O’Reilly. But with the United Kingdom’s transition period before leaving the European Union ending on January 1st, he sees bigger problems ahead. His wine providers in England say a shipment that takes four days could take four weeks next year due to new checks and regulations. “It’s a mess,” he says. “Come the new year, with the pandemic and Brexit, it’s going to be a double kick up the backside.” He is also concerned about increasing prices for customers. “Prices are going up and incomes are coming down. Our issue is explaining that to the guy who comes in for his French or Spanish or Italian wines.”Anjo Wines is not alone in its concerns. With less than six weeks until Brexit, many businesses in Northern Ireland remain underprepared for change or uncertain on what that change will mean for them. The Northern Ireland protocol, which will require some checks on goods coming from Great Britain into Northern Ireland, will come into effect on January 1st regardless of whether the UK reaches a trade deal with the EU or not.But Northern Irish firms do not know how these checks will work, business leaders told Westminster MPs last week. “We have a transition period, but we do not know what we are transitioning to with six weeks to go,” Ulster Farmers’ Union president Victor Chestnutt told a committee meeting at House of Commons. A survey by the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce last month found that just 39 per cent of members are preparing for Brexit, compared to 60 per cent in the first quarter of the year.The Covid-19 pandemic has also made businesses more vulnerable than they were at the start of the year.Stephen Kelly, director of lobby group Manufacturing NI, said a third of the manufacturing workforce has either been made redundant, is at risk of being made redundant or is on furlough, making preparations difficult. “This time last year, you had people stockpiling to minimise disruption,” he said. “Now, we are horribly exposed.” As a result, many businesses, particularly in the agrifood industry, are scaling back. One Fermanagh food producer, for example, said it will focus on its Northern Irish business instead of expanding further in the UK and Republic of Ireland until it sees “what way things are going”. Such food producers are part of what Michael Bell, director of Northern Ireland’s Food and Drink Association, calls a “delicate eating ecosystem”. The agrifood industry accounts for more than 100,000 jobs, a fifth of Northern Ireland’s private sector employment and more than a third of its manufacturing output.Its supply routes are particularly vulnerable. About half of Northern Irish food exports are shipped through Dublin to the UK, says Mr Kelly. “If you have a food producer in Newry, for example, up to 90 per cent of their produce is going through Dublin.”Due to potential disruption, businesses are looking at other routes. Mr Bell says “previously unpreferred options” – such as shipping to Scotland via Belfast – are being evaluated. “Any alternative is inevitably going to be more expensive for customers,” he adds.Maintaining access to EU marketsMr Bell and Mr Kelly have welcomed some of the measures introduced by the UK government to prepare Northern Irish businesses. Boris Johnson’s government is funding the expansion of Northern Irish ports to process British goods travelling into the country after Brexit, at a cost of £40 million (€44.5 million). Also, because Northern businesses will continue to enforce EU customs rules, they will also maintain access to EU markets, notes Mr Kelly.“There are competitive advantages from the Northern Ireland protocol that my competitors elsewhere in the UK would break their arms to have.”A £200 million trader support service launched in September will also support businesses trading under the Northern Ireland protocol. However, only 2,000 of the estimated 10,000 eligible businesses have signed up, treasury minister Lord Agnew told a treasury committee last month. Business leaders were unimpressed when treasury minister Theodore Agnew also said they have their “head stuck in the sand” about Brexit readiness, coronavirus and an economic recession.“Our reaction is that Lord Agnew seems to have his head stuck somewhere else,” says Mr Kelly. Talks with the EU continue, but Kevin O’Reilly is unconvinced that Boris Johnson’s government will protect Northern Ireland’s interests. “We know there’s bad times ahead,” he says. “With our politicians, we’re well used to being an afterthought.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

"},{"url":null,"title":"analysis rocky year australian chinese relationship doctored","story":"Australia-China relations have been in a downward spiral for well over a year, with recent clashes only the latest in a series of disputes. However, Monday’s row over a senior Chinese official sharing a mocked-up image purporting to show an Australian soldier cutting the throat of an Afghan child may mark the lowest point yet.The image shared on Twitter by deputy director of the Foreign Ministry’s Information Department, Zhao Lijian, showed a child with its face covered by the Australian flag as what appears to be a special forces soldier holds a knife to their throat.“Don\u0027t be afraid we are coming to bring you peace,” the caption states. Mr Zhao commented: “Shocked by murder of Afghan civilians \u0026amp prisoners by Australian soldiers. We strongly condemn such acts \u0026amp call for holding them accountable.”The image referred to the recent revelations of the Brereton report, implicating Australian forces in the murder of 39 Afghan civilians or prisoners.Australian prime Minister Scott Morrison said the image was “truly offensive” and repugnant”.“The Chinese government should be totally ashamed of this post. It diminishes them in the world\u0027s eyes… It is an absolutely outrageous and disgusting slur. Australia is seeking an apology from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and we are seeking it be removed from Twitter,” he said.However, Mr Zhao showed no sign of backing down, and made the tweet his pinned tweet, the first one people will see on his page.  The day before the official online trolling began, Australian trade minister Simon Birmingham said the government had “sought to engage in good faith” by working through China\u0027s domestic processes to overturn China’s barley ban and limit the impact on the A$1.5 billion (£830 million) barley trade, and flagged a likely challenged through the World Trade Organisation.“We are disappointed that all the evidence, as compelling as we are confident it is, was rejected by the Chinese authorities and that appeal was unsuccessful,” he told local media.While China and Australia have long been close trading partners, Australia has also been the key United States ally in the region – accommodating a significant American military presence and hosting an intelligence facility at Pine Gap. The tension between these two relationships has grown significantly in recent months.In September two senior Australian reporters, the last in China working for Australian news outlets, left the country abruptly after being questioned by Chinese officials.In August, Australian journalist Cheng Lei, who was working as a high-profile anchor for China\u0027s state-run English news service, CGTN, was arrested in China and accused of “suspected criminal activities endangering national security”.That same month, the Australian Government announced it would provide free unlimited English classes to migrants and work to encourage “Australian values” as part of a move to combat what it calls an “unprecedented” level of foreign interference in the country.While officials did not name which state or states had sparked the counter-measures, Australian authorities had previously made clear they are concerned by the activities of Chinese government bodies in the country.Two days earlier, the deputy head of mission of China’s embassy in Australia, Wang Xining, said Australia’s push for an inquiry into the origin and spread of Covid-19 had been “shocking” and had hurt China’s feelings, and dismissed the suggestion the Chinese government was trying to interfere in Australia’s internal affairs or influence Australian society.Last year, Australia\u0027s spy agency began investigating the death of Bo Nick Zhao, an Australian citizen who died mysteriously after claiming that a Chinese espionage ring offered to fund him running for parliament.Mr Zhao was found dead in his Melbourne hotel room on 3 March, 2019. Asia Pacific expert, Professor Mark Beeson, told The  that both governments had played a role in the deterioration of relations between the countries.“I don’t think the Morrison government has handled it fantastically well, they have gratuitously irritated the Chinese, but to be fair it is not hard to irritate China at the moment - they have fallen out with almost everybody and do take offence easily,” he said.What it will do for China’s long term standing in the world is another question. At some level, particularly if countries like Australia don’t cave, and move to ersity their economies so they make themselves less dependent on China, it undermines China’s leverage and is counter-productive for China.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"chinas vaccine diplomacy builds ties pakistan","story":"As cases of coronavirus once again soar in Pakistan, volunteers are accepting shots of an experimental Chinese vaccine.Thousands of volunteers are being recruited to trial a vaccine from Chinese manufacturer CanSinoBio as part of an agreement that will reportedly see Pakistan receive millions of doses of any finished shots.Pakistan and other countries in Asia and Africa are used to receiving huge Chinese investment to build highways, ports, railways and powerplants.Now, the Covid-19 pandemic has provided Beijing with a new soft power tool, as it uses its medical expertise to bolster its global ambitions.Under this vaccine diplomacy, countries are helping Chinese scientists host vaccine trials in return for sharing the finished drugs when they are available.China has also joined a United Nations-backed global scheme for the distribution of Covid-19 vaccine, which has been shunned by America.Recent polling has shown growing public suspicion of China in the West, partly amid accusations it bungled or covered up the early stages of the pandemic.There has also been growing scepticism of China\u0027s Belt and Road initiative to build a twenty first century Silk Road across Asia.The country\u0027s vaccine programmes offered a new opportunity to build trust in the developing world, and also secure its own people, said Yu Jie, senior research fellow on China at the Chatham House think tank.“We know from this pandemic, that no country is alone, China itself cannot completely eliminate Covid-19. Imported cases always come from neighbouring countries of China. In a way yes, China is conducting vaccine diplomacy, but to some extent China is also helping itself because if all the neighbouring countries get out of this pandemic, then China will be safer.”China\u0027s early success quashing the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan has also left vaccine developers with the problem of needing to conduct efficacy trials in countries where volunteers stand a chance of catching the disease.Trials of Chinese vaccines are underway in Pakistan, Brazil, Russia and Saudi Arabia. Pakistani officials have said they will in return receive millions of doses on a priority basis.China has a well established drug manufacturing sector, but until now has not been a leading vaccine maker, said Ben Cowling, professor of public health at Hong Kong University.He said Chinese Covid-19 vaccine development had stuck to tried and tested methods of using inactivated virus, rather than some of the new genetic technologies used by Pfizer, Moderna or AstraZeneca.As a result, its vaccines may not work as well, but they were likely to be cheap and straightforward to make. “They really do represent possibilities in terms of vaccinating in Pakistan, other parts of the world, Asia, Central Asia, the Middle East, South America.“I think a lot of countries will be very interested in getting hold of these Chinese vaccines and Chinese vaccine manufacturers will be very interested in opening up those markets to their vaccines.”China\u0027s manufacturing might will be needed to creating the vast volumes of vaccine needed in the coming months, he said. As many as 10 billion doses could be needed in the next two years and Western manufacturers would not be able to cope, he said.“So the Chinese manufacturing capacity is going to be valuable, not necessarily for Europe, but for places, like Pakistan, Africa and other parts of the world.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"clan chief first rewild estate plans transform beautiful not","story":"A Scottish clan chief plans to be the first to rewild his estate as he hopes to transform the beautiful but not natural Isle of Skye with a broadleaf forest.Hugh MacLeod, the head of the clan, hopes the Medieval fortress Dunvegan Castle will overlook a landscape filled with native trees, red squirrels and beavers.His project, which has been in the works for years, has just received a £1million grant from the Scottish Government.A total of 371,875 trees will be planted with different species mixtures to suit the land’s terrain and ecology. The carbon offset is estimated to exceed 40,000 tons over a 65 year period. Instead of the pine forests which have come to cover much of Scotland, the focus will be on planting trees which used to grow on the fertile peat soil, including birch, rowan, cherry, willow, hawthorn and sycamore.While many travel to the Isle of Skye to marvel at its sweeping landscapes, Mr MacLeod argues that the island is effectively a wet desert, devoid of wildlife and unnatural.He told The : This is a small start, but my hope is that this will encourage others to take on rewilding initiatives to restore Skye’s unnatural ‘wet desert’ landscape which is the legacy of centuries of depredation caused by over grazing and human activity.Mr MacLeod, who inherited the title of chief in 2009, said the landscape shows that it was an ancient woodland before human activity and over-grazing by animals caused it to become barren.He explained: After all, the extensive peatbog on the island is clear evidence of ancient and widespread woodlands. In common with other areas of the Highlands, Skye’s current lunarscape appearance is beautiful, but it is not natural. This project aims to restore this piece of land and it will have a positive ripple effect on the local community beyond the obvious ecological benefits, creating more jobs in sustainable eco-tourism and more rewilding initiatives.His clan has called the castle home for 800 years, and his project may make the grounds more closely resemble the landscapes his ancestors strode through centuries ago. Mr MacLeod inherited the castle in a state of disrepair and has worked to turn it and the grounds into a successful tourist attraction. Now, it is hoped rewilding can make it both an important carbon sink and bioerse habitat, as well as improve tourism to the area.Rewilding enthusiasts have found somewhat of a foothold in Scotland, which still has some native species now lost to most of the UK, including the rapidly-declining wildcat and red squirrel. Beavers were also reintroduced as a trial in 2009 and have now populated the River Tay. Controversially, while beavers now have protection as a native species in Scotland, the government hands farmers licences to kill them if they get in the way of agriculture.Country estates have been at the forefront of rewilding efforts, with many across England putting in bids to get beavers in the rivers which go through their land. Many estate owners have looked to Knepp Castle in Sussex for inspiration, which has reintroduced animals including the White Stork.Rewilding advocate Ben Goldsmith, who sits on the Defra board, said: “Politicians, communities and landowners across Britain are coming to the realisation that restoring the terribly depleted natural fabric of our landscapes offers a pathway for ecological, economic and social renewal. Hugh MacLeod’s ground-breaking nature restoration project at the historic Dunvegan Castle on Skye is one of the most exciting rewilding stories in Britain today.”Sarah-Jane Laing, CEO of Scottish Land \u0026amp Estates, commented: “This scheme is testament to Hugh’s vision, drive and ongoing commitment to an environmentally and economically sustainable future, not only for the estate but for Skye and indeed the whole of Scotland. SLE members such the MacLeod Estate, continue to be at the forefront of innovative and progressive land management, making a huge contribution to Scottish prosperity and wellbeing.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"dispatch desperation ethiopian conflict slivers hope remain","story":"Four weeks ago, Isaac was just another bright young student in northern Ethiopia. He was due to graduate this year and had dreams of working on development projects which could help lift people out of poverty. But last week, the softly spoken man in his 20s - whose name has been changed to protect his identity - found himself in a craggy wilderness translating refugees\u0027 harrowing accounts of violence into English for me under the baking Sudanese sun. When I tried to pay him for his time with the small amount of Sudanese notes I had left, he put out his hand to stop me. “Please, I can’t take your money. I’m sorry to ask, but do you have a spare shirt and can I use your phone,” he said. “I need to call my father. I don’t know where he is. I think he’s still in Tigray.” He explained to me that he had not managed to contact his family in Ethiopia in three weeks - they did not know whether he was dead or alive.I glanced down at my iPhone. It was caked in sweat and dust. There had been no signal for hours. I shook my head and apologised. Then I remembered I had the satellite phone my editors had given me for emergencies in my car. We rushed back to the battered Toyota. I pulled phone’s antenna out, and Isaac leafed a crumpled paper covered with names and numbers out of his pocket, trickles of sweat running down his brow. He tried several numbers on the list. Nothing worked. He couldn’t reach his father and any of his family inside northern Ethiopia. I kept telling him to point the antenna out of the window, but it was hopeless.A few days before the Ethiopian federal army and allied-ethnic militias invaded the country’s northern Tigray region on November 4th to oust the powerful regional government there, the power had been cut. Reports of mass atrocities by government forces and forces loyal to Tigrayan People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) have been coming in thick and fast. But almost no one inside Tigray seemed to have any phone battery to take photos or make a phone call.Hundreds of people, like Isaac, have been separated from each other in the mayhem. Even if they miraculously had charged mobiles, Ethiopia’s government has cut the internet and phone lines in Tigray.  At the same time, local and international journalists have not been allowed independent access to cover the conflict - many are instead being harassed or intimidated - meaning that very little solid information is coming out of the world’s latest war zone. Instead, all we had to work with were dozens of accounts of refugees flooding out of Tigray into Eastern Sudan. The vast majority of refugees we spoke to were ethnic Tigrayan, which complicated the situation further. We only had one side of the story as fighting raged between one of the powerful and well-equipped armies in Africa and the TPLF, which boasts some the most battle-hardened fighters on the continent. I saw the desperation building up on Isaac’s face as his calls kept failing. He had kept his cool for hours while translating stories of people being killed by machetes and artillery strikes. But now his small bit of hope seemed to be slipping away. I felt the anxiety begin to build up in my chest. My photographer and I had barely slept for days, driven for hours on end and been threatened by both Sudanese secret police and an army of pro-Abiy online troll accounts. I frantically gestured Isaac out of the car and half-barked at him that we had to walk up the craggy hill overlooking Um-Rakoba camp in Eastern Sudan.  As we slowly marched up the hill across sharp rocks, an inch-long Sahelian thorn went straight through my left shoe and into my foot. “I have to live here now. Sudan is a tough place,” Isaac said grinning, as I supported myself on his shoulder to remove the intruder. When we finally got to the top, the satellite phone\u0027s signal went up to two bars. Isaac carefully typed the fourth number in and pressed call. There was an agonising 10 seconds of delay and dialling tones before the phone whirled into action. We heard the ring on the other side, and a voice answered almost immediately. It was Isaac’s uncle in Ethiopia’s capital Addis Ababa. A broad smile spread across the young man\u0027s face, as he slowly lowered himself onto a nearby rock and explained how he had made it out alive, dodging bands of armed men. Smiling with relief, I turned around to give him some privacy. Far below us, the sprawling refugee camp which once housed the victims of the Ethiopian famine in the Eighties was slowly filling up again.  More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"farmer want farm not curate countryside","story":"The Government’s preliminary announcement on future farm subsidies fills me with gloom. After the EU referendum, I had hoped that the UK would accomplish the radical New Zealand-style transformation of British agriculture needed to give farmers the opportunity to earn a fair wage in the global market place, and to do so by actually producing food. But Defra Secretary George Eustice’s template for English farm support – and farmers in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland should expect something similar – looks depressingly like EU-lite.Payments to farmers to maintain the environment are to be replaced with, er, different payments to farmers to maintain the environment, but with subsidies to be phased out in full by 2028. Don’t let Defra kid you that they are offering anything more than a slight change of emphasis, with a greater focus on producing “public goods”. For the last 20 years, I have been receiving payments for hedges, ponds, rushy pasture, water margins, wild flower meadows and winter stubbles. I have committed to various “schemes” because I view wildlife conservation on my farm as just as important as the food we produce.But the payments have never been quite enough to compensate for the loss of the income I would have received if I had farmed more intensively, and certainly not enough to compensate for the form filling and the stress of the battles I have had with the civil servants over the interpretation of ever-changing rules. The final straw came when I was made to keep a diary like a primary school child.The underlying thesis of the Government’s approach to farming is now the same as the EU’s: the patronising notion that farmers should be paid just enough to stay in business in order to curate the countryside within carefully prescribed and frequently illogical guidelines, while food leaves the farm gate at or below the cost of production helping to boost the profits of quasi-monopolistic food processors and supermarkets. The result also looks like being the same: consumers growing obese on the illusion of cheap food, corporate interests in the rest of the food chain growing bloated on the profits, farm incomes continuing to fall in real terms and – because something has to give – the whole farmed environment suffering despite the token bits that will attract subsidy.I use the word depressingly advisedly. There is a mental health crisis in British agriculture. One farmer commits suicide each week. Farming charities cite cash-flow difficulties and red tape as the primary triggers. This is not going to be helped by less cash for more tape, even if the tape is green not red.Those of us who have farmed through previous subsidy cycles know what is coming next, despite Mr Eustice’s pledge to reduce regulation. Farmers will need to jump through certain hoops in order to qualify for support. A hoops roadshow will take to the highways to consult “stakeholders” about the design of the hoop and the hoop compliance regime that will require legions of civil servants to inspect the hoops and fine the farmers for not jumping high enough.Process will again take priority over outcomes. The hapless farmer will find that, as just one of many stakeholders, he will be accorded parity at best with the noisy demands of green quangos and charities. The taxpayer will be ripped off because the administrative cost will dwarf the sums that eventually filter down to farmers in subsidies. Meanwhile, the “progressive” social engineering implicit in the “small farms good, big farms bad” approach to the tapering of future subsidies sounds good politically but will in reality just mean that medium sized farms like mine will have to farm more for profit and less for nature.The Brexit vision, articulated during the referendum campaign, appears to have been hijacked by the green blob. The radical thinking by Tim Lang, about restructuring our food system from plate back to field, quietly shelved by the civil servants.

The great majority of MPs believe that will happen, as do the financial markets that have remained unperturbed by the stops and starts of the negotiations. Hopefully, even as you read these words, Lord Frost and Michel Barnier are reaching a breakthrough, smiling through their face masks and doing a celebratory elbow bump to confirm the belief that they will come to an agreed conclusion.Yet it seems more likely that such a happy outcome will require something additional, in the form of talks at the highest level between Boris Johnson and EU leaders, and that some fresh decisions will be required to make a deal attainable. Otherwise, it is still possible that January 1 will come round with no framework for cooperation and trade in place at all.The reason most people assume an agreement can be reached is that the arguments in favour of arriving at one are so overwhelming. This is true for both sides, and since it is so obviously the case, reasonable people must surely be able to do a deal. Even keen Brexiteers in the 2016 referendum were clear that free trade with the EU would be possible and desirable. Leading figures in Brussels have repeatedly called for a comprehensive deal, and Europe’s most influential leader, Angela Merkel, has said “where there is a will there is a way”.The EU has free trade agreements with countries as varied as Albania, Lebanon, Tunisia and Vietnam. The UK has just concluded its own with Japan and Canada. In the Asia Pacific region last week, a new trade deal was announced encompassing several historic foes, such as China, Japan and South Korea. Yet the UK and the EU nations, after 47 years of close partnership and while being military and political allies, are finding it extraordinarily difficult to come to terms. An unsuccessful end to the talks in the coming days would represent a historic failure, with potentially deep damage to future relations and to millions of citizens on both sides.The economic damage of a failure would be serious. The Bank of England has said that the long-term consequences of no deal being made would be more serious than those of the Covid pandemic. In certain industries that would be subject to high tariffs, such as the automotive and agricultural sectors, there would be very serious problems. That applies in both directions – German carmakers would be hard hit as well as factories in Britain, and agriculture in Ireland, Denmark and the Netherlands would suffer just like sheep farmers in Britain. In countries already suffering their sharpest downturn in 300 years, this would represent additional and completely unnecessary hardship.These problems would be measured in lost jobs and output. But there is a further great danger that cannot be quantified, which is the risk of a downward spiral in relations between London and other capitals that makes the damage that would accumulate steadily harder to repair.A no-deal outcome would make the Northern Ireland Protocol far more complex and controversial to implement, as the furore over preparations by Downing Street to break international law has shown. With no agreement on fishing rights, there could easily be confrontation at sea as UK waters were closed to EU boats. The absence of agreement on sharing data or treating financial rules as equivalent would quickly mean the adoption of new national rules in Britain, which Brussels would regard as a threat. Meanwhile, the incoming Biden administration would take a dim view of all concerned.With time running out, the next few days are the most important for the Brexit process since the referendum itself. The problem is that while both sides genuinely want a deal, they each believe the other side needs one so much that they will offer the crucial concessions at the last minute. They are clearly far apart on fishing rights, and at the time of writing are apparently making only slow and “incremental” progress on the “level playing field” issues of fair competition.For national leaders not to assert themselves and force a solution later this week – if none is forthcoming from the talks – would be a failure of statesmanship. The British Government has been good at playing hardball in the talks but not so good at getting its position and arguments understood around Europe. Control of the negotiations has been so tightly held that the Foreign Office has not been fully utilised to put the case around EU capitals and to European media. The flirtation with breaching international law and a rigid opposition to state aid rules has erted attention from the UK’s completely reasonable case on the outstanding issues.Fisheries are the most intractable issue, and one on which the British side has very strong arguments. The UK will become what is known as an independent coastal state, entitled to control of its own sovereign waters. Its boats are currently restricted to a tiny proportion of the fishing catch in certain products, such as 7 per cent of cod in the Celtic Sea, while it is thought 40 per cent of the cod in that region are in UK waters. Seen in that light, EU offers to increase the British share of the catch by small percentages do not amount to very much.Furthermore, it is a perfectly normal arrangement for close neighbours to conduct annual negotiations on fish quotas. This approach, which the EU already follows with Norway, respects national sovereignty but allows flexibility all round. Compromises have been suggested of a transitional phase to maintain existing catches for several years before a new approach in keeping with the new situation kicks in. But the EU delegation is held back by a hardline stance from France and other coastal states.President Macron and others might easily misjudge how much room Boris Johnson has for manoeuvre on this issue. History will not judge them kindly if there is no agreement over an insistence that fishing rights in another country’s seas can barely ever be changed. It is surely time for the Prime Minister and his EU counterparts to talk, and to resolve the remaining differences in a way their people are entitled to expect.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"nowhere eus hostile intransigence clearer absurd demands fish","story":"A little known line in Monsieur Barnier’s CV details his tenure as the French government\u0027s minister for the ecological transition. It sounds as gratuitous as the many working groups in the European Parliament that produce more hot air than the carbon emissions they purport to tackle. Yet it means he has had to handle the hectoring of French fishermen, known for their mercurial propensity to fight for the right to fish, whatever and whenever, or turn their fleet into navires de guerre, particularly in the Channel. If there’s one thing the French do with aplomb it’s to coordinate a grève.So it is hardly a surprise that the negotiator should do the bidding of his compatriot Macron, scarred by the Gilets Jaunes, facing fractious unrest in Paris over policing rules and pandemic policy and looming elections next year. When it comes to poisson, one country will dig its heels in, exposing the farce of a project where policy is determined on a catch-all basis.The London-centric media is filled with dismissive incredulity at the perceived blockage in negotiations coming down to fish, which they like to remind us represents only 0.12 per cent of GDP, never having sported a sou\u0027wester nor bothered to set foot in the likes of Grimsby to see first hand the social deprivation that the destruction of an island nation’s fishing industry has wrought on coastal communities. The sneering is typically focused on the UK, rather than what this percentage of catch laughably represents to a political bloc of 500 million citizens where four landlocked member states receive millions in fishing subsidies. To us, the debate orbits around the future of entire coastal communities and the optimism of what sovereignty over 630 miles of coastline could entail. To Brussels, it is sheer profligacy and mercantilism. Under the EU’s Common Fisheries Policy, UK fishermen are limited to just over a third of the total catch from their own waters. The fact that the British fleet’s net profit is still the EU’s highest and second only to Spain in terms of tonnage serves to demonstrate the potential profitability in retaking our seas. The UK fleet has declined by about 30 per cent over the past two decades, while the EU takes six times more fish from our waters as we do from theirs. Meanwhile independent Iceland and Norway land well over three quarters of catch from their own seas. The £580 million price tag on the fish the EU is eyeing up is dwarfed by the £900 million a day we are currently throwing at our pandemic response, but British fish processing is actually a £4.2 billion pound industry. Multiply that if our catch were to triple, and suddenly a boom business emerges.The UK wants to reassert a 200 mile economic exclusion zone around its coastline, as is the norm under the UN’s Law of the Sea, and has already managed to negotiate reciprocal access with non-EU Norway, exposing Brussels’s position as an aberration in international protocol. Yet when it comes to fish, the EU is rarely one to back down. One need only look at multiple Economic Partnership Agreements and conditions of aid with the world’s poorest countries to realise that Brussels’s appetite for ocean fare is grotesque gluttony. The indiscriminate trawling of seas around the Horn of Africa has directly contributed to the rise of piracy while just last year, the EU happily broke international law and jeopardised a UN peace process to hammer out a fishing deal with Morocco in the disputed territory of Western Sahara. The opening gambit of Barnier’s negotiating team that the bloc would accept a cut of 15 to 18 per cent in its share of catch in British waters is risible and far from the 80 per cent UK control tabled by Lord Frost, in line with our Scandinavian neighbours. The Conservatives are doubtless aware, too, that 186 coastal constituencies make a Brexit-backing ring around the country, while the aptly named Nicola Sturgeon would be forced to explain to Scottish fishermen, whose North East fleet accounts for half of the UK industry, why she would want to hand newly gained fishing rights back to Brussels. But perhaps above all is the startling symbolism of sovereign sacrifice in casting aside national dominion over our seas. British fishermen, I am sure, would be more than happy to see North Sea cod land on continental plates. But it is surely their prerogative to sell it.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"rail replacement buses expected rolled christmas","story":"President Emmanuel Macron on Monday pulled the plug on controversial legislation on sharing images identifying police officers, after tens of thousands marched this weekend in France for free speech and against police violence.The decision came as four French police officers were charged with beating and racially insulting a black music producer - the latest in several alleged instances of police brutality caught on camera in recent days.The shocking attack on Michel Zecler, footage of which has racked up more than 15 million views online, appears to have sounded the death knell for article 24, the most controversial part of a bill aiming to provide better protection for French police forces.Mr Macron, who wrote this weekend that the images “shame us”, was reportedly furious during a council of ministers meeting on Monday morning in which he demanded the clause be re-written to “restore confidence” between police and the population.Hours later, Christophe Castaner, head of Mr Macron’s LREM party in parliament announced:  We propose a total re-write  of article 24.”Part of a wider “global security” bill, the article had stipulated that it would become a crime punishable by a year in prison and a €45,000 euro (£40,000) fine to publish, by any means and in any medium, the face or any other identifying feature of a police officer with the aim of causing them physical or psychological harm.Critics of the bill would allow police to get away with brutality, as citizens would not be able to film and publish their actions. Mr Castaner denied the re-write was a U-turn.We acknowledge that there are doubts, that some people consider that the right to inform is under threat. The bill has not been understood by everyone and there were doubts among journalists, the French people, and even within our own majority. That is why it is necessary to clarify it, he said.Opponents demanded to know how the government intended to do so, given that the clause had already been approved by the National Assembly, though it still requires approval from the Senate.On Saturday, more than 133,000 people demonstrated against the draft security bill in marches across the country. A Paris brasserie was set alight, cars torched and stones thrown at security forces, who responded with tear gas and anti-riot manoeuvres. Some 98 officers were hurt.Quizzed by a parliamentary commission over the law on Monday night, France’s interior minister, Gérald Darminin, denounced the “unspeakable” acts by certain officers who attacked Mr Zecler.But he said the force must not be attacked as a whole, and denied there was a orce between the French people and their police.“There are lots of lesson-givers, but few who would take the risks that police and gendarmes take every day,” he said.He argued that article 24 should not be scrapped altogether, saying police are not protected enough ... We must absolutely keep it.He insisted the controversial article was not a hindrance to the media.Protecting the police and protecting the press are not in competition, said Mr Darminin. There is no victory of one without the other.He did agree, however, that the police’s internal inspection unit, IPGN, required reforming, with stronger powers and more independence, seeing “no reason” why it couldn’t be run by someone not appointed by himself.The move came as a Paris investigating magistrate charged all four officers involved in the Zecler case with assault by a person holding public authority. Three were also charged with fabricating their statements on the incident. Two of the accused were remanded in custody.Mr Zecler welcomed the charges, saying that he was “satisfied” with the reaction of the justice system.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"2020 best year ever","story":"NewsopinionCoronavirus, George Floyds murder, Donald Trump refusing to admit he lost:  has been the best year everThe things we once took for granted are now treasures beyond price, says Fleet Street FoxmirrorShareCommentsSubscriptionsSign OutByFleet Street FoxColumnist:,  NOV Newsopinion\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

But Tory Nadhim Zahawi insisted the vaccine wouldnapost be compulsory. Asked whether people who get the Covid- jab will receive some kind of immunity passport to show they have been vaccinated, Mr Zahawi said: We are looking at the technology. And, of course, a way of people being able to inform their GP that they have been vaccinated. But, also, I think youaposll probably find that restaurants and bars and cinemas and other venues, sports venues, will probably also use that system - as they have done with the app. I think that in many ways the pressure will come from both ways, from service providers whoaposll say aposlook, demonstrate to us that you have been vaccinatedapos. But, also, we will make the technology as easy and accessible as possible. Askedthat meant people who did not have a vaccination would be severely restricted in what they could do, the minister said: I think people have to make a decision. But, I think youaposll probably find many service providers will want to engage with this in the way they did with the app. He added: I think it is right that it is voluntary. People have to be allowed to decide for themselves whether they want to be vaccinated or otherwise. But, I think the very strong message that you will see, this is the way wethe whole country, and so itaposs good for your family, itaposs good for your community, itaposs good for your country to be vaccinated. And, ultimately people will have to make a decision. It was reported earlier that the NHS Test and Trace app could be used as a ‘Covid- passport’ - allowing people who have been vaccinated toto ‘normal le’.

He said: “I urge all MPs to vote for the tiered system. Unfortunately, we do have to have the higher restrictions so we can have confidence we can keep getting this virus down, then keep it under control. “That is the best way to avoid a third lockdown. And it is the most proportionate way to take action we need to keep people safe, and stop the NHS being overwhelmed.” Cabinet minister George Eustice confirmed no Tory rebels would be “sanctioned in terms of having the whip removed”. But he admitted there was “great frustration” about the new measures – under which % of England faces major restrictions on operating hospitality and mixing with other households when the national lockdown ends tomorrow. Despite being offered another chance to vote on the restrictions early next year, many MPs still have reservations. The Government yesterday published an economic impact assessment of its new tier system that was demanded by the Covid Recovery Group of Tory MPs.  The -page document acknowledged a “signicant” impact but said letting the disease run unchecked would be “much worse”. But it gave little detail, saying: “It is not possible to precisely estimate the impacts of any specic restrictions, for inidual areas.” Treasury select committee chair Mel Stride said it was “frustrating”, adding: “There is little here that sets out how the dferent tiers might impact specic sectors and regions.” Covid Recovery Group chair Mark Harper added: “We are seeing that, once again, the wheels are coming off the Government’s arguments.” And Tory backbench chief Sir Graham Brady said: “The fact my constituency has been put in entirely the wrong tier makes it inevitable I would vote against.”  Mr Johnson said it would be wrong to “take our foot off the throat of the beast” as cases were falling. And he insisted that while “lots think they are in the wrong tier”, the new harder measures were essential. Ministers have published community testing plans to help local areas detect asymptomatic cases, suppress the virus and offer a route out of the top restrictions. Authorities in Tier  can apply for the new six-week mass-testing scheme to run with local measures. But claims areas in high tiers could escape via community testing were dealt a blow as the project leader admitted it was a big ask. General Sir Gordon Messenger said he was “alive to the possibility we will not be able to do this all at once” and some Tier  areas would not get mass tests until “January and beyond”. Britain’s biggest testing surveillance study shows Covid rates have plummeted in northern England and flatlined in southern regions. The West Midlands is now the region with the highest, REACT found. Positive tests in the most recent period, from mid-November, suggest England has an R rate of ..  There are fears family travelling to meet elderly relatives over Christmas could trigger a surge in cases as infection rates are stubbornly high in young people. Imperial College London study lead Prof Paul Elliott said: “Each family must consider how best to keep any- one vulnerable safe over Christmas.” Overall cases have dropped % since lockdown, setting the outbreak back six weeks. This was driven by a % fall in the North, including many areas previously in Tier  restrictions. Before lockdown, cases in London, the South East and West were low but increasing rapidly. This increase has stopped but the South’s R value is just below , which means the number of cases are barely falling.

This rose to % when people were given a half dose followed by a full dose at least a month later. Pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and its partner BioNTech also reported % efficacy for their vaccine.

He told reporters: This could - could,weaposre lucky,everything goes right - be available just in a few weeks. This could - and I stress could - really be the salvation for humanity, these vaccines, not just this one but obviously all the vaccines that are currently being developed. Mr Johnson said there would be extra cash so the nation was ready to create vaccines for the next pandemic. What we need now is the approvals, he added. It must be stressed that no vaccine has yet got MHRAapproval but weaposre obviously hoping that both the Pfizer BioNTech and Oxford AstraZeneca will get approved in the course of the next few days and weeks.

A council spokesperson has confirmed that the vaccination programme is being run by the NHS through local trusts. They said: Bristol City Council is providing advice and guidance and will help communicate the detail of the programme when ready. Last week those who are at very high risk from coronavirus and were made to shield during the pandemic, have been given the same priority as the over s in the queue to receive a vaccine. The provisional vaccine priority list published by Public Health England has placed people aged  or older who are deemed clinically extremely vulnerable in the same priority group as those aged  and over. It means people with conditions such as blood, bone or lung cancer, chronic kidney disease and Downaposs Syndrome have been placed in priority group four of nine.  Gemma Peters, chief executive of charity Blood Cancer UK, said: This is extremely good news. Putting people with blood cancer at the same priority level as those aged over  better reflects the fact that they are especially vulnerable to the coronavirus. She added: Any vaccine might not work as well in people with blood cancer, so vaccinating the people around them is a vital part of protecting them. We are very grateful to the Government for having listened to the voices of people with blood cancer and other health conditions on this. It is also important to remember that this is not definitely the final priority list.  No vaccines have been approved yet, and weaposre waiting for confirmation that any vaccine will be safe and effective for people with blood cancer. The updated list, which is subject to Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agencyapproval of vaccine supply, also lists the conditions that fall in priority group six for at-risk adults aged  to .

The council has issued Ms Quinn with fixed penalty notices totalling £, for trading during lockdown and served the closure notice on Saturday. Tahir Han, representing the council at Mondayaposs half-hour hearing, said Ms Quinn had refused to open the door to engage with enforcement officers.He said she had mentioned Magna Carta, telling council officers that coronavirus legislation does not apply to her and she does not consent to abide by these particular regulations.He said the conversations were recorded and posted on the hair salonaposs Instagram page, which received notoriety.Mr Han said the fixed penalty notices seemed to have no impact and Ms Quinn was given a final opportunity to comply last week but she continued to open. Chairwoman of the bench Rebecca Todd said she had concerns about the timing of the closure application, due to lockdown regulations coming to an end on December . Mr Han said it was accepted that the application should have been made sooner but said it was a last resort after Kirklees Councilaposs attempts to engage with Ms Quinn were unsuccessful and complaints increased.  He said: A decision was taken, notwithstanding the short period of time, a message had to be sent that this type of behaviour will not be acceptable. Ms Todd said: While we still have real concerns regarding the timing of this application, we are satisfied on balance that the order is necessary. We think it is necessary to prevent nuisance to members of the public and to safeguard public health. She is continuing in her behaviour, which is causing distress to the public in an already stressful and disturbing time.

Dexter failed to make the anti-drugs unit because he lacked focus and was “too gregarious”. But instead of leaving the force – along with other dogs who don’t make the grade – Dexter has been given a job helping officers deal with the stress and trauma of policing in London. Handler PC Mike Sheather said: “He’s got a really good nose on him, it’s just that his personality didn’t lend itself to being a drugs dog. “He’s just too good around people – he was too sociable. “He also started to show signs of distress in training. If a dog isn’t settling or isn’t happy in their role it’s our duty to take them out. “It was like one of my old school reports – lacked focus. They actually used the word gregarious.”  PC Sheather began taking Dexter out to meet staff in May as they dealt with the pandemic. He said: “They were going into the community, recording ‘le extinct’ and preparing the bodies for collecting. “They’d been doing it for two or three months.” "},{"url":null,"title":"lottery winners worth over 100m","story":"NewsLottery winners worth over £m knit angel mascots for charity to support NHS workersEXCLUSIVE: A group of  lucky punters – worth a combined total of more than £million – have spent the past month in lockdown crafting , angels for charitymirrorShareCommentsSubscriptionsSign OutByLouie Smith:,  NOV NewsJulie Jeffrey with some of the woollen angels she has knitted\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Our free email newsletter sends you the biggest headlines from news, sport and showbizWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Roy Curtis had his Government benefits stopped when he refused to attend a fit-to-work assessment in September . He wrote an email to his friends saying he was going to kill himself. He was then rushed to AE by police who were informed and discovered a -page suicide note. Mr Curtis became a patient at a specialist mental health treatment centre, where doctors managed to get his benefits restored, a coroner was told. After ing home, Mr Curtis was again informed that would need to attend a fit-to-work assessment, causing him to feel stress and pressure, the inquest heard. Mr Curtis, who had changed his name from Ayman Habayeb, asked his GP surgery for a note which would confirm he was anxious about being in open spaces, meaning he would not have to go into the city centre to attend his appointment, the Milton Keynes coroner was told. Although that letter was provided to him, Mr Curtis was not heard from after November . His landlords broke into his flat with a High Court bailf on August  last year to evict him after just over £, was owed in rent. Ian Wright, a bailf who attended Mr Curtisapos flat in Ashland, Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, told the inquest he had ventured alone into the flataposs bedroom, where he initially did not spot the occupant, only to find him dead. Mr Wright said: It was clear and obvious that the male was deceased and I stood and looked at the male for a few seconds before turning around and walking straight out of the address.  A post-mortem examination described the body as being in a state of advanced mummication and revealed there was no blood made available for a toxicological examination. Detective Constable Lucy Jareth: In a folder under the table in the lounge was a number of letters which had red handwriting across them. The words across the letters were asthe author was distressed about the situation that the benefits and allowances had been stopped. Dr David Marchevsky told how Mr Curtis, who had a mild diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder Asperger syndrome, had been sectioned for five days in  at the Campbell Centre. In September , he ed after sending out the email and Dr Marchevsky said the team had helped Mr Curtis get his benefits reinstated. The doctor said: He was very polite, well-mannered, very pleasant and a likeable person. He was not particularly happy to be admitted. His concerns were nothing to do with medication or psychological treatment, they were more practical things. He was quite angry that his le had been changed and turned because of the stopping of his benefits and the reason that he decided to commit suicide was because all his le he was very comfortable with the receipt of benefits and the things he was doing at the time. He had a group of friends he was in contact with, particularly electronically. All that was to disappear, so his world was to disappear too.  Dr Marchevsky said that doctors managed to get Mr Curtisapos benefits restored and payments backdated while he was still a patient, after which he was happy tohome. The inquest heard how the deceased had been discharged in October  from the Campbell Centre to the Home Treatment Team, which in turn discharged him to his local GP centre. However, it was later discovered that Mr Curtis had again been contacted by the benefits agency and asked to attend a fit-to-work assessment once again. Dr Marchevesky, who only found out about the benefit agencyaposs new request after Mr Curtisapos death, commented: I did not anticipate that the benefits agency were going to do this, particularly so quickly and I did not know until I learned about his death. They were told the reasons why he had been admitted, all that information was given to them. If I had envisaged that in November or December they were going to do that, probably we would have had a discussion about, aposplease do not do this, why are you going to do that  A referral note from a community nurse with the Acute Home Treatment Team said: Main triggers and stresses were his benefits, which were stopped. This has now been reinstated and payment backdated. RC expresses stress and pressure that he was placed under the employment activity, meaning he will need to attend the job centre. He feels this is a lot of pressure and he feels he should not be asked to work. He wants to discuss this with his GP.  Dr Romi Babatunde told the inquest that Mr Curtis had visited a GP at the Grove Surgery on November ,  and revealed his worries about the looming fit-to-work assessment. The doctor said: What he wanted was a letter from us stating that he could not attend another assessment. He had got a letter from the department saying that he had to come to the city centre and one of Royaposs symptoms was anxiety in open spaces. A letter was written for Mr Curtis by his GP but the inquest heard nobody from the surgery ever contacted the man, who was not on any medication, again to check on his condition. Dr Babatunde added: What was recorded was that the GP will follow up as required and that Roy will contact his GPhe had any problems. Following Mr Curtisapos death, a safeguarding adults review had been carried out by multiple agencies in Milton Keynes, including the council which was legally represented at the inquest. Tom Osborne, senior coroner for Milton Keynes, said: The review highlights the onus was very much on Roy to self-refer himselfhe had problems.

Leanne Forbes, , has donated  litres - more than  pints - of her own breast milk to other mothers in need through her local baby bank by the time she stopped breastfeeding her youngest child aged one. But the AE receptionist was so happy to have helped that she decided to volunteer her time to collect and drop off milk from other mums for the service. Now the mum-of-four collects and transports gallons of liquid gold from over-productive mums to those who are unable or struggling to breastfeed their neonatal babies every month. Leanne said: Everybody thinks Iaposm crazy when I tell them Iaposm sort of like a breast milk milkman. I know a lot of the women on my round because you do go to the same addresses each time. I say hello and have a laugh with many of them, just like a milkman would. Itaposs a very special and emotional thing to donate and share breast milk, so many mums are going through their own journey or troubles and I get to help them with a part of that.  Leanne, who lives at home in Barnstaple, Devon, with her four children, Jacob, seven, Evangeline, six, Henry, three, and Poppy, one, didnapost even know about breast milk donation until a midwe suggested it. After struggling with the mental and physical toll of breastfeeding her first two kids, the mum was forced to top up with formula and had to stop nursing when they were six months old. But with her second pair, Leanne produced more than enough milk to feed Henry and Poppy for a year, and asked her midwe for advice on what to do with the excess.  Having started volunteering to help with the collections last July, Leanne now has to carefully plan her timings to ensure that she collects and drops off all the milk within a five hour window, to ensure it stays fresh. After collecting the milk from the mothers and safely storing it in freezer boxes in her boot, Leanne takes it to the Healthy Baby Hub in Tiverton, Devon, where it is kept frozen until it can be pasteurised and distributed to premature babies in need. Leanne said: When I had my first two children I really struggled to breastfeed, I found it really painful and I didnapost want to use formula but I ended up having to.  But when I had my second two I had a huge oversupply, I was expressing myself all the time.My midwe suggested I donated it but I didnapost even know I could do that or that it was a thing. I ended up donating  litres in total and it felt like such a special thing to be able to do.

The body of -year-old Nora Quoirin was found  days after she went missing in the Dunsun rainforest resort in Malaysia. Nathaniel Cary, who is British and performed a second autopsy on the body of Nora in the UK, said he agreed with Malaysian officials that the teenager had died of intestinal bleeding due to starvation and stress.But he also told a virtual Malaysian inquest into the -year-oldaposs death that while there was no positive evidence she was sexually assaulted, he could not rule it out due to the severe decomposition of her body, Sky News reports.He said it made it dficult to determinethere were semen traces or the DNA of strangers. The forensic pathologist said: I think we can exclude very serious trauma to the genitalia ... but I wonapost be able to exclude minimal trauma because of the decomposition obscuring things. The dficulty here is because of the decomposition, the forensic evidence would be disadvantaged to an extent. Nora was staying with her family in a cottage at the eco-resort when she went missing on August ,  - the day after they arrived. Following a huge search, her naked body was found km away from their villa in rough terrain, with no shoes but with no cuts to her feet. Police boss, Datuk Mohamad Mat Yusop, said Nora was found lying face up at the bottom of steep rocky slopes by a stream. It was unclear what happened to her underwear, but police had previously said the autopsy showed no sign she was sexually assaulted. Police told the inquest there was no “foul play” and that Nora had climbed out of a window which had a faulty lock. But Noraaposs Irish mother, Meabh, and French father, Sebastien, say they believe their daughter was kidnapped because she had mental and physical disabilities and could not have wandered off on her own.However, police dispute this because of a lack of fingerprints and no ransom request. Mr Cary said the Malaysian autopsy had been thorough but that the decomposition made it dficult to ascertain in what circumstances the death occurred. He agreed with Noraaposs family lawyer who said that any foreign DNA,it existed, could have been washed away as Noraaposs feet and hands were immersed in water for a few days before her body was found. Responding to a question from the familyaposs lawyer, Mr Cary said he could not rule out the possibility that her body may have been placed there after her death.  Rescuers had previously searched the location where Noraaposs body was found when she went missing. He also agreed that there was no evidence Nora had suffered any major falls in the rough terrain despite her physical disabilities. But he said the multiple cuts and scratches on the schoolgirlaposs body indicated she had moved through dense undergrowth. He added: I see no reason to dispute thefindings, although like me, the Malaysian pathologists were clearly disadvantaged by the decomposition.

Angela Runswick made the claim to a jury at Liverpool Crown Court.The mum-of-threeaposs excuse was not accepted by them however, the Liverpool Echo reported. The jury convicted her of dangerous driving after she left ex-boyfriend Christian Robinson seemingly unconcious on the road. Judge Neil Flewitt, QC, said her defence was ridiculous, calling it the most obvious piece of dangerous driving. At around .pm on December  last year a witness heard a loud commotion outside in Wallasey, the court heard. The witness then saw the womanaposs former partner, Mr Robinson, in the street apparently unconscious. Runswick, , was behind the wheel of a car. According to the witness she was smirking as she called her ex a drama queen and admitted hitting him with her the vehicle. The judge said: Iaposve no doubt there was a considerable degree of provocation and that this was the last straw and she lost her temper. Stuart Mills, prosecuting, said that the prosecution accepted there was some provocation. He said there was no evidence of physical injury aside from a limp whenwalked away. The court heard Runswick, of Reeds Avenue East, Leasowe, has no previous convictions. Kyra Badman, defending, explained it was a bad example of dangerous driving and conceded that Runswick would not be entitled to credit for her guilty plea as she was convicted after a trial. Ms Badman explained Runswick is the sole carer for her three children who are five, six and . The court heard she shares two of the children with the victim but that he isnapost an active part of their lives at all at the moment and doesnapost contribute financially. Ms Badman explained the mum is the manager for a betting shop and told the court the mandatory driving disqualication will have an impact Judge Flewitt, sentencing, said: What you did on the occasion of this dangerous driving was truly dangerous. Your explanation that you were trying to go into reverse and slipped into forward was ridiculous and rejected by a jury. Judge Flewitt accepted the offence was committed after bad behaviour by Mr Robinson. The judge told Runswick he had no reason to doubt that he was abusive and no reason to doubt he raised his hand to you. Judge Flewitt said: You drove deliberately at him over a short distance and you struck him. Itaposs dficult for me to know whether he was truly unconscious or not - he was certainly put at risk of serious injury.

Akyra Holstein says she finally feels secure after so many years in the care system. She says she feels now that she has a family to fall back on. Akyra met her -year-old mum Katie when she came to her home for respite care in March last year. The pair hit it off instantly, and when she could no longer stay with her foster placement, Katie took her in so she could finish high school. To Katie’s surprise, after several months of living at the Holstein household, Akyra asked about adoption. The teenager was officially adopted by her new mum last month, putting an end to her -year-long search for a forever family. The self-employed data entry transcriptionist, also adopted one-year-old Michael Holstein on the same day, and the new family are settled in their home in Kentucky. Before they met, Katie had fostered  children, but she’d never looked after a child over the age of six. It’s far less likely for older children to be adopted, making Akyra’s adoption unusual - but Katie said it has been “so rewarding”.  Akyra said: I honestly thought after my last home put their notice in, I was done for. After so many years in the system I was just tired of it all - but then I came to Katieaposs and she was ready to take a chance on me. It hasnapost always been easy, but I know no matter what, Iaposll always have my family to fall back on. I finally feel secure - and itaposs the best feeling.  Katie added: “When I first met Akyra, I was quite nervous - looking after an older child is a lot dferent to a little one, and I’d never done it before. “Especially after she had so many years of trauma from being passed around dferent homes, it was a lot to take on. “It was definitely a challenge, because she already has le experiences and is an independent person – but that isn’t a bad thing.“But it’s great to have a daughter I can sit and watch Netflix with or send memes to throughout the day, and I can speak to her about everything.“I had never planned to adopt a -year-old, but it’s been so rewarding.”  Single mum Katie Holstein first began fostering in , because she ‘always wanted kids in her le’ - and has now fostered a total of  children, with some as young as three days old. But she’d never fostered a child older than six, until she got a call about Akyra, then , in March . After  years in the care system and  dferent foster homes, Akyra came to stay for a week as ‘respite’ for her then-foster parents. Akyra ended up staying with Katie for several short stints over , before Akyra’s previous foster parents put in their notice to end the placement. Katie agreed to let her stay until she finished high school in a year’s time. Katie said: “I was really quite nervous when Akyra came to stay, because I knew she’d had a long and quite traumatic history in the care system - but I knew I wanted her to finish high school.” Akyra joined Katie for a longer-term stay in March  - and fit straight into the family.  To Katie’s surprise, in July , after several months of living at the Holstein household, the teen plucked up the courage to ask Katie how she felt about adoption. Katie said: “I think that was an important moment for her, because that decision came completely from her. “After so many years of having no control over where she lived, she got a say in what she wanted. Akyra graduated from high school this summer, and rather than moving out, she had a family and somewhere to call home. The adoption ceremony took place on September  - marking an end to Akyraaposs , days in care.  Katie said: “Taking in a -year-old is completely dferent. You have to learn to parent someone who is almost an adult themselves. “Little children eat what I give them, wear what I dress them in and do what I tell them, whereas Akyra makes those decisions for herself. “The most important thing for us was compromise.

In a clip that has been widely shared on TikTok a woman can be seen sat behind another with long blonde hair on a plane. Her impressive mane is draped over the back of her chair, obscuring the television built into the seat. Seemingly annoyed that she cannot see the screen, the woman behind her starts putting chewing gum into the hair. With great focus she knots the strands over each other, ensuring that the gum is fully embedded.Do you have a story to share  Email webnews@mirrorAs she flicks the hair to either side of the screen a crew member walks along the isle, shooting a confused look the passengeraposs way. Apparently unaware of the hair based commotion going on behind her, the woman in front grabs her barnet, bunches it and tosses it back over the TV. This encourages her fellow passenger to start snipping strands off.  She then takes the lid off her coffee cup off and dunks a big wad of hair in it. At the end of the video the woman in front removes her headphones and walks down the plane, having realised that something is amiss. The video split opinion online. One social media user called Hayden wrote: At first I was with the lady in the front but after she kept throwing her hair back I feel like she got what she deserved.  Others questions whether the incident was real. One woman wrote: You would absolutely know someone is touching your hair.

The monolith was spotted on Batca Doamnei Hill in the city of Piatra Neamt in Romania’s north-eastern Neamt County on November . Authorities said the owner of the property is still unknown but whoever propped the monument up should have sought permission from the countryaposs Ministry of Culture. The metal structure was found a few metres from the oldest historical monument in the city - the well-known Petrodava Dacian Fortress. The fortress is believed to have been destroyed by the Romans in nd century AD but parts of the city wall can still be seen today. The shiny triangular structure has a height of about four metresand one side faces Mount Ceahlau, known locally as the Holy Mountain. It is one of the most famous mountains in Romania, and is listed as one of the seven natural wonders of the country.The unusual metal monolith resembles the one which recently reportedly disappeared in a desert in the US state of Utah.The metal obelisk had been embedded into the red earth.  Helicopter pilot Bret Hutchings, who was among the party that discovered it, described it as about the strangest thing that Iaposve come across out there in all my years of flying.He told local news channel KSL TV his best guess was that it had been put there by a new wave artist or a fan of : A Space Odyssey. Neamt Culture and Heritage official Rocsana Josanu said: “We have started looking into the strange appearance of the monolith.

Also coming in was goalkeeper Jack Hamilton with Adam Legzdins out with a calf problem while Jonathan Afolabi ed after injury.Former Dees Paul McGinn, Martin Boyle and Sean Mackie started for the home side who also had Ofir Marciano, Ryan Porteous and Christian Doidge back after they missed the previous meeting between the sides a fortnight ago.Five minutes in Hibs tested Hamilton with a fierce low effort from Kevin Nisbet. The goalie was down well to save and denied Doidge on the rebound with a super stop, though the flag was up in any case.The Dark Blues played their way into the contest as the half progressed with both sides looking dangerous in an engaging opening to the game.Clear-cut chances were at a premium, though, before Hibs again went close on  minutes. Boyle#s cross struck Hamilton#s front post and fell for Nisbet but the striker smashed the ball well over the bar.The home side did take the lead just before the break as Doidge set Jamie Murphy clear down the left and the Rangers loanee made no mistake with the finish, clipping the ball in off the far post.Dundee thought they#d equalised minutes after the restart as Jakubiak wheeled away in celebration only for the assistant#s flag to go up for offside.Shortly afterwards Lee Ashcroft had to be in the right place a the right time to clear a dangerous Boyle centre from under his own crossbar.With  minutes to go, Charlie Adam found space  yards out but dragged his effort wide of the post.Moments after coming on as a sub Drey Wright almost sealed Hibs# progress but saw his effort from inside the area stopped by Hamilton.The single goal was enough, however, as the home side saw out some late pressure from the Dark Blues to head into the quarter finals.Hibs: Marciano, P McGinn, McGregor, Porteous, Mackie, Boyle, Mallan , Newell, Murphy , Doidge, Nisbet .Subs not used: Barnes, Gray, Doig, Gogic, S McGinn, Bradley.Dundee: J Hamilton, Christie, Fontaine, Ashcroft, Marshall, Byrne, Adam, Anderson , McGowan, Afolabi , Jakubiak.Subs not used: Ferrie, Kerr, McGhee, Forster, Robertson, N Hamilton, Murray.Referee: Willie Collum vw, px\"  Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

That’s why there will be no Tory pay freeze in Scotland.#Kate Forbes, Finance SecretarySpeaking remotely from Dingwall, Ms Forbes attacked the UK Government’s approach, comparing it with the “austerity” economics of more than a decade ago.She said: “In the aftermath of the  crash, the Conservatives inflicted a decade of austerity, balancing the books on the backs of the poorest and most vulnerable. Last week, the Chancellor’s first actions to manage our public finances was to freeze pay and cut international aid. It’s the same Conservatives, with the same ideology.”Ms Forbes pledged there would be no public sector pay freeze in Scotland, arguing a strong economy depended on strong public services.“That’s why austerity will never be our answer. That’s why there will be no Tory pay freeze in Scotland,” Ms Forbes declared.The finance secretary also announced £, for Highlands and Islands Enterpriseto extend its Digital Enablement Grant to reach more businesses in Scotland’s remote areas.In total, an extra £ million would be provided to help , small and medium enterprises across the country invest in digital technology.The Data Lab, Scotland’s innovation centre for data at Edinburgh University, will also receive £ million to help businesses to invest in more advanced technologies such as data analytics and articial intelligence.The funding was announced ahead of next year’s Scottish budget, which Ms Forbes said will include a “five-year pipeline of investment in infrastructure to boost economic growth”.She stressed this will not support “pet projects like a Boris bridge to Northern Ireland” but will instead focus on the “essential investment our economy and public services need”.The Finance Secretary said: “The capital spending review will provide the funding for our infrastructure plan.“It will include almost £ billion for inclusive economic growth, including £ million to extend full fibre broadband to businesses and households in rural areas and £ million to support our islands.“It will see more than £ billion invested in our cities, towns, villages and rural areas, including £ million to revitalise our town centres and create vibrant neighbourhoods and nearly £ billion on health infrastructure and equipment.”She promised an “investment that transforms our country” and “creates jobs and supports society”, as well as seeking to tackle poverty and address the challenges of climate change. vw, px\"  Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

Saints, however, failed to harness the wind advantage and it was the home side who looked the more threatening in the early stages.Skipper Lewis Buchanan registered Saints first effort on goal in the th minute, cutting in from the right to send a well-struck shot just wide of the postage stamp corner.Saints manager Donald Black made early use of the agreed rolling substitutes policy, sending on Fraser MacFarlane in the th minute to replace Alan Buchanan in the centre forward#s role.It didn#t take MacFarlane long to make an impact and his neat turn on the edge of the D created the space for a right foot volley which arced away from the Red Star keeper#s right hand to nestle in the bottom corner and give Saints a st minute lead.Red Star cancelled out the Saints advantage on the stroke of half-time after good work on the right from Chris Hart took him all the way to the bye-line from where his cutback picked out Stuart MacLean on the six-yard line for an easy finish.With the wind gathering pace, a long second half was in prospect for Saints and it took the hosts just four minutes to capitalise on their controlled first half performance when central defender Ben Forbes poked home an Andy Weir right wing corner through a sea of legs.After Lewis Buchanan had headed a th minute Andy Weir left wing corner off the line, Weir#s follow up delivery from the opposite flank picked out right full back Coll McCallum eight yards out for the home side#s third goal.Red Star stretched their advantage still further on the hour mark when Ben Forbes whipped a wind assisted free-kick from the halfway line into the postage stamp corner giving Murdo MacKenzie no chance.After keeping the hosts at bay for  minutes, Saints conceded a fth goal with almost the last kick of the ball. Murdo MacKenzie did well to parry a dipping -yard Aaron Moore shot, but luck deserted the Saints keeper when the ball broke to Ewan Litster, who chipped over the stranded keeper into the unguarded net.With the rain coming horizontally, both sets of players were delighted to hear referee Jimmy Litster#s final whistle immediately after the restart signalling a stampede for the sanctuary of the ious cars and vans in the school car park."},{"url":null,"title":"combating covid but at what cost","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

We know that our early ancestors split from chimpanzees, our closest ape relative, around - million years ago , and that the first near-humans of our genusevolved in Africa at least . Myr.These forerunners eventually gave rise to us , but our knowledge of what happened between these dates is very limited, largely because fossilised remains are extremely rare.Common illustrations depicting how our upright posture, facial features and lack of body hair gradually evolved are based on few skeletons of ancient ancestors. Most notable is that of Lucy, a young female skeleton dating back to . Myr.Lucy was discovered in the Afar depression, Ethiopia, in , and was assigned to a species more primitive than ours , and named A. afarensis after her location. In the s a few teeth and bone fragments were found that proved to be similar to, but even older than, Lucy, dating from ^ Myr and called A. anamensis. it was assumed that Lucy was directly descended from this ancient primate.Not surprisingly, there was much excitement in the field when anthropologist Yohannes Haile-Selassie discovered a near-complete skull of A. anamensis dating from approximately . Myr. He found the skull, simply known as MRD for now, during his fieldworks at Woranso-Mille, Ethiopia, in . As the oldest and most-complete skull of A. anamensis, this find allowed detailed comparison with Lucy’s species.There was general agreement that, like the illustration, our ancient ancestors descended one from another in a linear fashion. So most experts assumed that A. anamensis evolved directly into Lucy’s species.Haile-Selassie’s detailed study of MRD suggests, however, that the two species co-existed in Africa for at least , years, presumably with the potential for interbreeding. This undoubtedly shakes up previous thoughts and reshapes our understanding of Homo evolution.But only time will tell Haile-Salassie says he hopes to find the rest of MRD’s skeleton # and even earlier members of our Homo genus # which should certainly help unravel our deep past."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast episode 17 congratulations and jubilations","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Some applicants do not have English as their first language and Citizens Advice Bureauoffices have experience in obtaining advice via interpreters.Outreach clinics, centred in local area job centres, are also a feature of the CAB service and enable job centre staff to refer clients directly to a CAB Advisor based there for a day.Any cuts will increase the workload on CAB offices exponentially as thousands more may be made redundant, find they have no income of any kind, and turn to CAB for advice. Cuts will undoubtedly affect the vulnerable in our society immediately, with theIn cities such as Glasgow, the closure of offices would mean that many claimants could find it impossible to travel to other parts of the city and, in any case, with an already growing list of applicants those offices would soon be overwhelmed,they are not already.Several members of CAB staff have already been made redundant. I believe that more may follow without additional funding.In Glasgow alone, five offices face closure, though it is estimated that in excess of , people in Glasgow sought advice from these offices in the last year. This is likely to be the case in major cities around Scotland.Our petition calls on the Scottish Parliament to urge the Scottish Government to provide urgent funding to Citizens Advice Scotland. It can be found on the Scottish Parliament website # petition number PE: Urgent funding for Citizens Advice Bureaux.Alistair S Stephen, by emailSir,The Covert Human Intelligence Sources Bill currently going through Westminster, dubbed the Spy Cop Bill, gives agencies including police, armed forces, HMRC, and even the Food Standards Agency permission to break the law with impunity.These agencies will be permitted to break international and domestic law in direct contravention of the Geneva Convention on human rights.Why is this legislation being brought in, and why are HMRC and the Food Standards Agency being given such powers  It is beyond belief that the majority of MPs actually voted for this bill.A clue may come from recent comments made by the home Secretary and endorsed by the prime minister about #leftie lawyers# and #do-gooders#, referring to human rights lawyers and refugee organisations.As for the Food Standards Agency, clues might come from the other very concerning bill in process at present which is the Internal Market Bill which contravenes the Good Friday Agreement and the devolution settlements for Scotland and Wales by undermining the authority of the devolved governments, as well as breaking an international treaty signed less than a year ago.This bill contains some deeply concerning clauses which would come under the remit of The Food Standards Agency which normally only has jurisdiction south of the border, but this bill would enable a UK trade minister to unilaterally overrule Scottish legislation on food safety standards to allow for a trade deal with the US, and the importation of sub-standard foods and food products.It is also the case that any UK minister or appointee would be able to overrule any Scottish legislation. This could affect all aspects of our lives.The Spy Cop Bill is a means of enforcing the Internal Market Bill by using the threat of underhand means. Thus piling illegality on illegality with regard to international law.We need to be very concerned on both counts.Amnesty International has already voiced its grave concerns, as have other international bodies and governments.Surely independence is now the best option for Scotland, where we can build a better, fairer nation for ourselves one that obeys international laws and respects the basic human rights of all its citizens, with a written constitution to ensure that no future Scottish government could ever impose such draconian legislation on the people of Scotland.Cecilia Rees , Lochgilphead.Sir,The Covid- pandemic continues to be exceptionally dficult for all of us, but has also led to crisis levels of #pet poverty# in the UK.PDSA is a charity that provides free and low cost vet care for those who struggle to pay treatment costs for their sick and injured pets.Since the first UK lockdown began, we’ve seen an overwhelming number of additional enquiries from pet owners who have hit hard times.

Martin Bonar replaced Scott Johnston for Saints while Chris Hart made way for Innes Meikle for the hosts.The deadlock was broken in the th minute from a quickly-taken free kick by Cammy Hill after Martin Bonar had been brought down in the centre circle by James McGuiness.Hill spotted Aaron McKay in space on the right and sent him scurrying forward. McKay cut into the box and picked out the run of Craig MacEwan who was foiled from six yards by Ally Lewis.The young keeper#s good work was undone when he couldn#t hold MacEwan#s shot allowing the ball to spin away from him.Ben Forbes was on hand with a sliding challenge to knock the loose ball away from MacEwan but only as far as Gavin Forgrieve, who gleefully tapped home from four yards.Lewis saved again from MacEwan three minutes later this time managing to hold onto the ball at the second attempt before a neat Matty Kelly turn on the corner of the Star -yard box wrong footed Ben Forbes creating the space for Kelly to curl a ball to the far post a matter of inches in front of the outstretched boot of Scott Maitland.Maitland got forward again in the st minute finding Gavin Forgrieve in front of goal. He took the ball down well only for Innes Meikle to get back with a vital challenge at the expense of a corner kick.Martin Bonar climbed well at the back post to meet Forgrieve#s delivery from the right but couldn#t direct his header on target.Despite being unable to hit the target himself Bonar was able to claim an st minute assist for the second and final goal.The big midfielder, a key member of Red Star#s  Scottish Amateur Football League Premier Division Two title winning side, won possession well in the centre circle and opened up his former team mates with a perfectly weighted pass for the forward run of skipper Craig MacEwan.Top marksman MacEwan comfortably beat stranded Red Star keeper Ally Lewis with a deft chip from  yards into the unguarded net.Referee Jimmy Litster, who ensured the two local rivals remained on friendly terms throughout, called time on proceedings after three added minutes with both sides satisfied to complete another  minutes while the majority of their respective league rivals remain side-lined."},{"url":null,"title":"in praise of john campbell factor mor","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The town on its present site would be taking shape by the time young Zachary began his schooling.His education, however, was said to be #rudimentary#, so young Zachary began teaching himself Latin and Greek as he absorbed English classic literature.Employed from the age of  in a merchant#s office in Glasgow, historical references describe him falling into #bad company# and indulging in excessive drinking.At the age of  in  he emigrated to Jamaica to take up a role as a book-keeper, effectively a slave overseer, on a sugar plantation. Such was his horror and disgust at the way in which slaves were treated on the plantation that he became an implacable opponent of the slave trade.He gave up his job in Jamaica # by this time a #model book-keeper# # and ed in  to Britain and secured a position in London. His sister Jean had married Thomas Babington of Rothley Temple, Leicestershire, a country gentleman and ardent evangelical. Babington took MacAulay under his wing and introduced him to the Clapham Sect # a group of Tories against slavery.Among them was William Wilberforce, founder and leader of the anti-slavery movement.Through working with the Clapham Sect, MacAulay was invited in  to visit Sierra Leone # the West African colony established to provide a home to emancipated slaves from the United States who came to Sierra Leone via Nova Scotia.In , aged , he was promoted to the post of governor and remained in the post until .Returning to England on a slave ship, he brought with him  African children, with the hope of finding them a better le in the Clapham Sect community.He settled in Surrey following his marriage to Selina Mills on August , .Having witnessed the misery of slavery, MacAulay became a member of the Society for the Abolition of the Slave Trade, working closely with Wilberforce, and soon became a leading figure in the parliamentary campaign. He later became secretary of the committee, which became known as the African Institution.The campaign succeeded in , with an Act of Parliament making the slave trade illegal throughout the British Empire. The practice, however, was to continue despite this victory.Many abolitionists had thought slavery would fade away once the slave trade was stopped, but that failed to happen.MacAulay continued in his activism, helping seize a slave ship in . On this act, William Wilberforce commented in a letter to MacAulay, #you really deserve a statue#.In the s MacAulay turned his attention towards securing the total abolition of slavery itself. He helped found the Society for the Mitigation and Gradual Abolition of Slaveryin , and was editor of its monthly publication, the Anti-Slavery Reporter from its launch in .His major contribution was the collection and collating of a huge volume of evidence showing the true scale of slavery # a role to which he was ideally suited as a skilled statistician with a meticulous approach and an exceptional head for figures.It was also during this period that MacAulay co-founded University College London.Publication of the Reporter continued until , but by the end the work had worn MacAulay out and he had got into debt.In  Selina died and, with his finances in disarray, MacAulay was exiled to Paris in  # the year the Slavery Abolition Act came into force which ended slavery throughout the British Empire.He ed to England once his debts were liquidated and died on May , . He was buried in a London cemetery, but after the site became a public park # St George#s Gardens # the exact location of his grave was lost.MacAulay is commemorated with a le-sized memorial bust in Westminster Abbey.To mark the th anniversary of his birth in , a memorial plaque was unveiled in the gardens, donated by the Royal Statistical Society, the Friends of St George#s Gardens, University College London and the Clan MacAulay Association.William Wilberforce said of Zachary MacAulay: #My sober and deliberate opinion is that you [Zachary MacAulay] have done more towards this consummation [abolishing slavery] than any other man.#For myself, I take pleasure in acknowledging that you have been my tutor all the way and that I could have done nothing without you.#"},{"url":null,"title":"a family passion for scotlands beauty","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

But the beauty of Argyll # and his boat Sgarbh # drew him back.Earlier this year Ross held his second solo exhibition with The Scottish Gallery, but due to lockdown not a single person was able to attend.Frances has been a regular exhibitor with the gallery for years with her distinctive Hebridean seascapes and landscapes showing the repeated mots of Iona, The Mull of Kintyre, the bays around Crinan and the view across to Jura and the Corryvreckan.Like a good modernist Frances is reluctant to give any commentary on her works but Ross, on the other hand, makes extensive notes on his journeys allowing others to understand how hard-won the paintings are, particularly in winter when the harsh conditions create privations and huge physical problems. Each painting becomes a manestation and record of time and place.His affinity with the natural world is reflected in his long-term project of setting messages in bottles on the ocean, which brings him encounters as he journeys to meet the people who find them, and make new works at the location of the find.A Family Affair will be presented concurrently with Mark Hearld’s Menagerie, which will transport visitors to an animal-filled world with a series of prints, woodcut and linocuts inspired by the artist’s love of British flora and fauna.A Family Affair and Mark Hearld’s Menagerie will be at The Scottish Gallery in Edinburgh between Saturday November  and Wednesday December ."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column november 20 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

All representatives who are isolating or unable to attend must be able to speak up for their voters.We noted as early as June that the abrupt shut-down of remote participation was bound to leave communities unrepresented as the pandemic continued to rage. The Commons took a step backwards in ending this too early.MPs and voters need consistency and transparent standards for how these crucial democratic decisions are made.We can#t have ato the conga line chaos we saw in June, or the decisions simply being made on a whim by a minister.MPs need clarity about how they can continue to represent their voters during this stark second wave and beyond.There must be far greater transparency over how these decisions on participation are made, rather than ministers being forced to act at the last moment.Since some MPs may be isolating or not safe to travel in person, there’s a real threat for democratic representation and political equalityremote participation continues to be strictly limited or indeed denied. Virtual proceedings in the summer were a real success in bringing parliament into the st century. Let’s learn from that and ensure all voters are heard.Darren Hughes, chief executive, the Electoral Reform Society.Sir,SNP ministers must outline how they are planning for a Covid- vaccine rollout across Scotland.People are understandably feeling positive about a potential vaccine for coronavirus, which is why it is critical for the SNP government to lay out the detail of its roll-out plans as a matter of urgency.We can ill-afford to repeat the same mistakes we saw with the flu vaccination earlier this year.Ministers need to set out what infrastructure is being put in place right now so they are ahead of the game when it comes to rolling out any vaccine across Scotland when it becomes available, and doing so fairly and effectively.Getting this right will be particularly important for the Highlands and Islands with our dispersed population and challenging geography.We must be assured that our region does not end up playing catch-up with the central belt which is an understandable concern locally, given the track record of this government in other matters affecting us.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSP and Shadow Health Secretary.Sir,In the recent storms  houses at Bruach Gorm, Port Charlotte, using the communal West Highland Housing Association satellite dish lost half their sky channels including BBC  and STV.As I write, it#s been  working days since at least three of us that I know reported the issue to West Highland, but not a word of a fix date.The dish has done well for  years, but things degrade over time. I had an inkling this year there would be a dish problem and in the summer I bought a TV aerial kit for £ # a lot cheaper than fitting a dish.I put the aerial in the loft and there is a good reception, with BBC  and STV back. It is storm proof in the loft, though was disappointed with the lack of channels from the Bowmore transmitter.I Googled it and the mast is a Freeview Light and lacks channels other UK areas enjoy. I use Sky HD freeview channels but with Sky you have to navigate the TV guide through all the blocked subscription channels to find the one you want to watch. Via the Bowmore mast the TV guide just lists the the Freeview channels, which is great.Freeview said that there were more channels available on main transmitters than there was on relay transmitters, which play a vital role in providing more remote areas with TV coverage.There are a lot of aerials on houses and I think Islay#s TV transmitters should get an upgrade to the same channels as other areas expect.I will also raise this issue with those elected to improve our lives, including our MSP, MP, council leader Councillor Currie and Councillor Horn.Colin M Campbell, Port Charlotte, Isle of Islay.Sir,I think we all need a boost of positive news, so I would like to appeal to your readers to give a brave and special young person in your area the credit they deserve by nominating them for the  WellChild Awards.We are looking for inspirational children and young people who have defied the odds in the face of serious illness and the selfless nurses, doctors, brothers, sisters and friends who help care for them.This is your opportunity to give them the recognition they deserve at a prestigious event regularly attended by WellChild Patron, The Duke of Sussex.Nominations are open now so please get yours in before the closing date on Monday December  at noon.

But it doesn’t need to be this way we live in a country that is abundant in wild food that can also act as our medicine.#While lockdown has been a challenge, many people found themselves able to spend their limited exercise time in nature.#The best thing about all this is that it’s free,# Lilia added. #Getting out into the woods, breathing fresh air, dipping in a loch or stream for that cold water natural high is something we can all do without too much dficulty.#Lilia, along with co-writer Clare Holohan, a medical herbalist based in Morvern, are seeking crowdfunding support to raise £, to cover print costs. Earlier this week the fund had passed the £, mark.Called #Scotland’s Wild Medicine: Reconnecting With Nature For Health, Well-Being And Healing#, the book offers a guide to foraging in Scotland throughout the seasons, covering three plants for each month throughout the year. Holohan describes each plant in detail for those new to foraging, what it’s good for in terms of food and remedies, and how it can be used.Sinclair concentrates on the feel-good side of things, introducing simple ways to improve health and wellbeing from cold water immersion to breath work and meditation, all firmly rooted in nature.Eilidh Cameron’s stunning photography intricately depicts each plant in the foraging section and reflects the beauty of Scotland in all her mercurial weather moods throughout the book.#I have a great passion for the Scottish landscape,# explained Eilidh.#It’s been a privilege to photograph our beautul country for this book, something I have developed from my usual wedding photography work where many people like to get married in special places outdoors, whether that’s a beach, an island or a glen. We are so lucky to live in the midst of all this stunning scenery. It’s good for the soul.#Lilia concluded: #We need to help people to understand that their health and wellbeing is in their own hands.#Please get on Kickstarter and search for Scotland’s Wild Medicine and pledge for one of our books, which start at just £.

The current bus stop and car park at the head of Glen Croe would also be bypassed. This is an important public transport link for local residents.The consultation launched by the Scottish Government’s Transport Secretary, Michael Matheson is a muddled exercise. It confuses the urgent need to decide on an alternative route for a new road through Glen Croe with the much longer-term strategic transport options for improving connectivity between Argyll and west-central Scotland.Most of the strategic options involve a number of new civil engineering challenges including the construction of bridges over Loch Long and Loch Fyne and extensive road building, both new and upgraded. For reasons of cost and complexity, none of these options are likely to be implemented within this decade.Whatever long-term strategy options may be investigated for their feasibility, there remains the urgent need to build a new road in Glen Croe. It will always be necessary to link the communities of Arrochar Tarbetwith Loch Goil, Cairndow, north Loch Fyne, Inveraray and beyond with the A.I note that both my local community council in Loch Goil and Argyll and Bute Council support the route that follows the existing forest track on the opposite side of the glen from the Rest and Be Thankful without a similar risk of landslides. Compared with the strategic options, this is a modestof road to construct.The sooner that steps are taken to realise this solution the better it will be for all who currently suffer the increasingly frequent road closures due to climate change and the unstable hill.Alastair R Moodie, LochgoilheadSir,Every year thousands of children contact Childline about being bullied online and tell us that they feel it is hard to escape from.Lockdown has intensied these feelings for many and since April we’ve counselled more than , children and young people across the UK about online bullying.Children have told us about people sending threatening or abusive messages and being pressured into engaging in sexual conversations. Others have shared that they’ve been excluded from online games by other children, while some spoke of online identities being stolen to embarrass or cause trouble while using their name.Before lockdown measures were first introduced this year, the average monthly number of counselling session with children about online bullying was . Between April and October that value increased by  per cent to a monthly average of .This is worrying, particularly as we continue to adhere to strict social-distancing restrictions across Scotland and children continue to spend more time online. Bullying can have a long-term impact on the mental wellbeing of a child and, as we mark Anti Bullying Week this month and beyond, it’s important to ensure that every child knows who they can turn to for support.If a parent thinks their child is being bullied online, it can be hard to remain calm, but it’s crucial not to overwhelm a child with questions. Taking their device away is likely to make them feel like whatever has happened is their fault instead, it’s helpful to listen to their worries, suggest they take some time away from certain apps, and provide them with reassurance.Adeniyi Alade, service head of Childline at NSPCC ScotlandSir,Boris Johnson’s comment that devolution has been #a disaster north of the border# and #Tony Blair’s worst mistake# should hardly come as a surprise to anyone.The Tories have never been great supporters of devolution, vehemently opposing both the referendums in  on establishing a Scottish Assembly and in  on the Scottish Parliament.Most recently the devolution power grab that is highlighted in the Internal Market Bill simply reinforces this stance.The Scottish Social Attitudes surveyon constitutional preference found that only seven per cent favour abolition of the Scottish Parliament and it found that trust in the Scottish Government sits at four times that of the UK Government. This points to it hardly being a disaster.For those accused of scaremongering that there is a threat to Holyrood, Mr Johnson’s comments are clear vindication. The irony of all this being that devolution has given new le to the Scottish Conservatives after its wipe out in  and it is now the opposition in the Scottish Parliament.Be under no doubt that the Scottish Parliament, which was hard fought for, is under threat and we must do all in our power to defend it.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"chough conservation effective but more action needed","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Children under the age of  do not count towards the total number of people in the bubble. Children under  do not need to maintain physical distance from others.You should not change the members in your bubble once it has been formed.What are the rules for bubbles If anyone in the bubble contracts Covid-, all members of the bubble will be required to isolate for  days.The Government says people should remain m away from those outside of their household as much as possible. Bubbles can only gather in a private home , outdoors or at a place of worship.An extended household can meet in line with the normal rules as just one household.Where parents do not live in the same household, children can move between their parentsrsquo homes in dferent bubbles, and this includes both supervised and unsupervised visitation.The Government says people within a bubble should NOT go to the shops together. ldquoWhere possible you should shop on your own, or only with children or those who need support, shop local, and use Click and Collect or Delivery services, the advice reads.Those who are part of a bubble should not stay in tourist accommodation. Only those not part of a bubble should plan on staying in tourist accommodation and should follow the tourist accommodation, socialising and travel rules in the local authority they are staying in.Those who have formed a bubble should only socialise in a hospitality, leisure or entertainment venue in your own householdfor the duration of the festive period.Bubbles are permitted to gather in a place of worship during the Christmas period, though places of worship are required to take special health measures.Should youform a bubble If you are isolating as a close contact, oryou have had a positive test and have not completed your isolation period, you should not mix with others outside your immediate household. If you have Covid symptoms you should isolate and ask for a test.If your household or the people you would meet in a bubble consists of elderly people or people who are clinically vulnerable, the Government says it is particularly important that you consider the risks, and you may wish to avoid mixing to reduce the risk of passing on the virus ndash particularlyyour bubble would mean younger people, particularly young adults, mixing with older people.Whatyoureshielding The advice states: ldquoIf you or someone in your family have been informed that you are at highest clinical risk from Covid- you should take time to think about what being a bubble means for you. Being part of a bubble would involve greater risks for you as you would be increasing the number of people you have contact with. It is important that you do not feel pressured to celebrate the festive season in an environment that makes you anxious.What about students or those in a shared flat Students who have ed home at the end of term form part of the household they have ed to. All students are being offered testing before ing home.Peoplewho live in a shared flat or house are considered a household and are ldquostrongly advised not to split up and enter separate bubbles over the festive period. If you do join dferent bubbles you should isolate from your flatmates both before and after joining your bubble for around a week.Travel restrictionsTravel restrictions will be relaxed from  ndash  December to allow people to travel between local authority areas and the four nations of the UK to join their bubble.If you travel to form a bubble, once you arrive you must follow the rules about travel that apply in that local authority area. Upon forming a bubble in a Level  or  area in Scotland, for example, you must avoid non-essential travel outside the local authority area in which you are staying. And in an area of Scotland at Level , , or  you must avoid unnecessary travel into any Level  or  area.Everyone planning to travel shouldhome by December . The only exception to this is where people are delayed as a result of travel disruption or ill-health, including self-isolating following a positive Covid test or as a contact of someone who has had a positive test. Those travelling to or from the Scottish Islands should do so within the five-day period,  ndash  December.What are the rules for carers You can still go into another household, which is not part of your bubble, to provide care and support for a vulnerable person. If I form a bubble can I continue to visit people in hospital, hospice or a care home The guidelines state that the safest way to spend Christmasyou want to visit someone in a care home, hospital or hospice would be to stay within your own household and not form a bubble with any other household.Can I visit someone in prison or detention You will still be able to visit a person detained in

holidays,according to a leaked COSLA document.Students across the country would potentiallyto school on January , instead of between January  or  as most students and teachers currently expect.Yesterday, council leaders discussed the proposal from Government Ministers at a Covid- Education Recovery Group meeting, as a way to limit the spread of coronavirus following gatherings over the festive period.The Daily Recordreported that the leaked document included a proposal to move schools into a \"temporary remote learning system\" over a period of five days in December, and that council leaders were \"asked for their thoughts\" regarding the winter holiday period between December  and January .The memo, published by The Daily Record, read: ldquoThe Scottish Government are exploring a national extension to Christmas holidays covering th December  to th January , either on the basis of schools remaining closed or the temporary introduction of remote learning.ldquoThe Scottish Government officials have indicated that the objectives of an extension would be to ensure that school staff are not involved in contact tracing into the Christmas period.ldquoAn extension would act as a lsquobreakrsquo following the wider relaxation of restrictions over the Christmas period.The document also detailed some of the concerns raised regarding the extension of the holiday period, including childcare for key workers, the calls fromtrade unions to move to remote teaching, exams and free school meals.It reads:ldquoEarly feedback from officers, SOLACE and ADES to the Scottish Government have raised the following points for consideration.ldquoThe need to understand the clinical advice and any modelling on the impact of wider relaxation of restrictions over Christmas on school staff and pupils.ldquoClarity on the links with the wider restrictions and levels as the context for schools remaining closed.ldquoEvidence to date from the Scottish Government has indicated that schools are low transmission risk.ldquoThis proposal may have implications for future considerations on schools remaining open, particularly considering the concerns of trade unions.ldquoThere would be no opportunity for emergency childcare as this was provided by school staff previously, and therefore there is an impact on key workers and vulnerable children and young people.ldquoIt remains unclearearly learning and childcare services will be advised to close during this period.ldquoConsideration over the potential loss of learning, particularly in the context of exams.\"The need for clarity on funding and ensuring that resources for free school meals etc are met.ldquoIf a move to remote learning is required, local authorities and schools will require time to prepare.ldquoPractical implications including leave entitlement,  contract time and potential implications for pensions, the status of other school staff, honouring of contracts in place for transport, cleaning and potentially calls for no detriment to supply staff as per initial period of lockdown.Remember to consider the risks of coming together over the festive period, especiallythere are vulnerable people in your household.If you choose to spend Christmas with family and friends, this guidance will help you stay as safe as possible.# https:t.co iQaIUGYpic iKhNlHhbfImdash Scottish

regarding gatherings over the festive period, in which it stated up to three households will be allowed to mix over a five-day festive period between December  and .The guidance also suggested thatthose planning to form a bubble should limit their social contact with others as much as possible before and after forming a bubble, to minimise transmission risks and to protect loved ones.A Scottish teacher, who wishes to remain anonymous, said: \"If the Government is advising families to isolate before and after the school break, then they should have taken schools into consideration.\"Teachers have been brought back to school a week early and have experienced multiple cases within school.\"They shouldnrsquot be made to feel like they should stay away from their families just because the Government hasnt put in enough planning or preparation to close schools earlier due to these circumstances.\"A decision is yet to be reached by officials.A Scottish Government spokesman told the Daily Record:ldquoQuestions have been raised in relation to the timing of the school holidays, in particular that some schools break up very close to Christmas.ldquoThis

Of course I was referring to the small playparks that were under consideration by Scottish Borders Council, and you will recall that two councillors in particular were most adamant that what I said was not infact correct.ldquoWell what I said was correct ndash the play parks under threat are Kingsway, Provost Melrose Place, Kingsland Square, Crossburn Farm Road, Glen Crescent junior, and the small play park behind the hedge in Hay Lodge Park. Eliotrsquos Park is not going to be decommissioned, the other six are.Tweeddale councillor Heather Anderson said that at an Area Partnership meeting, elected members were given the list of parks to be decommissioned, adding that it was presented as a proposal that was going to be passed lsquoon the nodrsquo.She revealed that officers hadnrsquot allowed a maintenance budget for the new destination play park which is the reason behind decommissioning the small parks.:Coronavirus:  new cases recorded in the Borders over weekendMs Anderson also told the meeting that the costs of maintenance and removal were challenged by councillors and they ldquodidnrsquot get any satisfactory answers.Mr Turnbull said he wrote to Scottish Borders Council about the associated costs and failed to get an answer. It was suggested that the closures should be halted until costs are produced.Community councillor Peter Maudsley said: ldquoI wouldrsquove thought that there shouldrsquove been a proper cost benefit analysis because in taking away equipment from play parks there is a considerable cost.ldquoThe actual ongoing maintenance of the play parks is probably quite small, so someone somewhere shouldrsquove done a cost benefit analysis, and I think we should see it. There should be a moratorium on the closures until they produce the cost benefit analysis because they might be very well wasting the ratepayersrsquo money.Ms Anderson said it was ldquopursued vigorously, adding: ldquoWe didnrsquot manage to get the decision overturned.It is hoped that a group in the town will come forward and take on the responsibility for the six play parks under threat.:The imaginative way two young brothers donated to a Borders foodbankMr Turnbull added: ldquoThere has been a lack of consultation and whatrsquos alarming is we, the community council, did do a consultation, we had over  responses which I think is quite signicant, and most people wanted to see these small play parks retained. Again I appeal to the people of Peebles,there is a group willing to take over these play parks under threat then the community council will help as far as we can to try and keep and maintain them.ldquoIf not, Irsquove had a conversation with councillor Tatler and asked him to ensure that beforeany decommissioning is done on these small play parks, that there is a wider consultation with us in the community to work out whatrsquos going to be best for those actual areas.You might also be interested in:Radio station helping to bring Christmasto Borders childrenOld bombs discovered outside Scottish hotelby metal detectoristsPlans to build  wind turbinesnear Borders town set to be proposed"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-galashiels-academy-announces-positive-case","story":"A BORDERS school has announced a coronavirus case.On Friday afternoon , parents of S and S pupils at Galashiels Academy were informed.An email, sent by head teacher Kevin Ryalls, said a small number of students would likely be contacted by NHS Test and Protect ndashdetermined to be a close contact.Mr Ryalls explained that it was unlikely that pupils in other year groups would be contacted.:A ft Christmas tree has been gted to a Borders tourist attractionHe reassured parents that pupils forced to self-isolate would receive home-learning support.The school has also enhanced its cleaning programme ahead of theto learning tomorrow , said Mr Ryalls.

This groundwork was vital according to Roger Draycott, who said: #Feedback from the meetings with shoots was very helpful. The sector needs to self-regulate effectively and, by securing support for the principles, we have confidence that these will be well adopted.#The principles are based on agreed UK industry codes of practice, such as the Code of Good Shooting Practice and British Game Alliance standards, the UK legislative framework, and align with international guidelines on sustainable use of natural resources, including the Bern Convention and the International Union for Conservation of Nature."},{"url":null,"title":"incredibly close scores in dunavertys october medal","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Thanks you for supporting us during this incredibly challenging timeFollowing on from recent comments in the local press, I would like to provide an update about MOWI’s application for a new salmon farm in Kilbrannan Sound.At the time of writing, there are  letters of objection and  of support. Of those , six are employees of MOWI and a further seven are employees of companies who directly benefit from contracts with MOWI. Only five would appear to have no direct personal financial interest in the application.Several of these letters are clearly copied from a template, perhaps instructed by their employer.It is hard for the  objectors, who are probably mostly local people or regular visitors, to compete with the money that MOWI is prepared to put behind its increasingly desperate attempts to force yet another fish farm on the unwilling local communities.Clearly almost the only people who want a salmon farm are those who stand to make personal financial gain from it. Can there be a clearer indication of how undesirable farms are I suggest local people who have the long-term interests of the region at heart # as opposed to the short-term economic interests that MOWI has # make their views known to the council, referring to planning application   MFF.Use your own words and make clear that you are not employed by any salmon farming company.Can I ask councillors, when considering the application, to attend to the views of the local people you represent, rather than overseas companies Ed Tyler, Scottish Green Party, Argyll and Bute Branch.It was very interesting to read that Argyll and Bute Council favours the Glen Croe option running adjacent to A to be a permanent solution to this ongoing threat.I really do hope this means using the forestry road on the opposite side of the valley #adjacent# to current A. This really does seem to be the ideal solution.Yes, it would no doubt cost a lot but the alternatives mean an ongoing struggle with no really sound final solution to this very serious problem.Argyll and Bute residents businesses have been amazingly patient over the years but we all live with the knowledge that the current road is so unsafe and dangerous, and the day could easily come that we hear of a fatal accident due to yet another landslide.Argyll has always been a very beautul, special part of Scotland. What a boost it would be to the economy for visitors to come here with no threat to their lives as they travel in.The expense of completing this major new road would be more than justied in a prosperous new outlook for our beloved Argyll.Scotland has boasted great engineers in its past history, let’s trust there are still those out there capable of the task.Moreen Moller, Clachan.A free online confidence-building course to help people in Argyll and Bute find their lives again after losing sight will be available later this month.Living with Sight Loss is being run by the charity RNIB Scotland over four Thursdays starting on November  until December .

We know only too well the fear and distress fireworks cause to pets, with  per cent of owners reporting their pets being affected # trembling, being physically sick and being too frightened to leave the house for days after.We would urge people to let their know neighbours knowthey’re planning to have fireworks and also to use low-noise fireworks and sparklers this year where possible for the sake of pets and people who may struggle with them across the country.Claire Stallard, animal behaviourist, Blue Cross.Key workers in Britain are rightly receiving the recognition and appreciation they deserve, with NHS staff, care workers and delivery drivers among the professions that have been praised for their heroic efforts this year.But, some of the most essential workers in developing countries worldwide are continually overlooked and neglected. Working animals play a key role in the world’s poorest communities and help provide a livelihood for more than half a billion people.An estimated  million working horses, donkeys, camels and elephants are relied upon to transport goods, food, water and firewood. By doing the jobs of trucks, tractors and taxis, this invisible workforce ensures the survival of poverty-stricken families.However, these animals often endure appalling conditions, with poor nutrition and no access to veterinary treatment when they are sick or injured.At the animal charity the Society for the Protection of Animals Abroad , we believe that working animals overseas should receive the respect, compassion and vital veterinary care they desperately need.On International Working Animal Day , please find out how you can show your support for these hardworking animals by visiting www.spana.org iwad.Geoffrey Dennis, chief executive, SPANA.This week marks Occupational Therapy Weekand I want to personally thank these unsung heroes who make a dference to so many lives.As someone living with a terminal illness, I am a day patient at the Marie Curie Edinburgh hospice and I never imagined occupational therapists would play a vital role in my le.Whether it has been attending relevant classes to ease conditions, such as fatigue, anxiety and breathlessness, to discovering what allowances I was entitled to and taking part in the ious day therapy sessions on offer, they have also made sure I can continue living independently at home too.Their constant support and advice has kept me safe in these unprecedented times and without occupational therapists, my le – like so many others – would be very dferent to what it is today.Thank you.Helen Hogg, Midlothian."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast episode 17 congratulations and jubilations","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

We predict there will be as many as , more pets eligible for our services over the months ahead, as a direct result of the economic hardship caused by the pandemic.For many sick and injured pets, whose owners are struggling financially, PDSA is their only emergency service.For more information on PDSA and the pet care crisis and how you can help, please visit PDSA.org.uk whywematterPaul Manktelow # PDSA VetVolunteers and staff from our NSPCC school service aren’t able to deliver our free Speak Out, Stay Safe assemblies in person at the moment, because of restrictions in place to reduce the spread of Covid-.But, so that we can continue to work alongside staff in primary schools to help children know what to do and who to speak tosomething is worrying or upsetting them, we have launched a virtual programme. We have teamed up with Ant and Dec to produce a virtual assembly, which can be shown in primary schools across the country.The assembly, which features our mascot Buddy, helps children to understand how to recognise dferent forms of abuse and identy a trusted adult should they ever have a concern.Since May, the monthly number of referrals from the NSPCC helpline to agencies in Scotland, because of concerns about the wellbeing of a child, has been more than a third higher than pre-lockdown levels.By signing up to the free virtual assemblies with the supporting teaching materials, which are also available in British Sign Language , primary schools across this region can help us to protect children.To sign up visit nspcc.org.uk speakoutAlan Stewart # Schools Service manager for NSPCC Scotland"},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week november 13 2020","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

It also followed a US decision to stop using RAF Machrihanish as an operating base for its maritime patrol aircraft.FIFTY YEARS AGOBronze Age skeleton uncovered in cistA tomb, believed to be about , years old, has been excavated in a field behind Highland Parish Church, Campbeltown.Dr E Peltenburg, the Glasgow University tutor in extra-mural archaeology for Argyll, excavated the Bronze Age burial cist at the request of Father James Webb, who discovered it recently.A badly crushed skeleton has been uncovered together with well-preserved grave goods, including jet beads and beautully worked flint blades.These finds are being carefully treated and studied at present.The excavation was a topic of conversation at recent Wednesday afternoon archaeology classes held in Argyll.Other extra-mural classes in the area include The Le Sciences of Campbeltown, Plant Le of Kintyre, which is held in Tayinloan and a course on western Scotland traditions at Bowmore, Islay.A new course, Introduction of Astronomy, will start in Campbeltown in January.Waterspout observed off Kintyre coastAn unusual natural spectacle, a waterspout, was witnessed last Thursday morning on the west coast of Kintyre.It was estimated by one observer to have been about , feet in height.Mr AC MacAllister, Tigh Na Baan, Glenbarr, first saw the waterspout about am and drove south keeping it in view.At one point he was travelling at mph, yet he did not succeed in drawing level with it.The waterspout was in sight for about  minutes before it was engulfed by a hail storm off Westport.Mr MacAllister said: ‘It passed down the coast about a mile offshore.

Thanks you for supporting us during this incredibly challenging timeBoris Johnson is wrong when he claims allowing Scotland to have a devolved parliament was Tony Blair#s biggest mistake.The decision to join the USA in the invasion of Iraq was Blair#s biggest error, a decision based on the #dodgy dossier# that anyone with half a brain could see had no validity. It cost the lives of  British servicemen and severe injuries to many more but it made Blair a rich man, resulting from his popularity in America where many of my friends still think the sun shines from his posterior.I would agree, however, that allowing the electorate in Scotland to vote in favour of devolution, was undoubtedly Blair#s second biggest mistake.His motivation was to placate those crying for Scottish independence, following the discovery of North Sea oil, but the irony was that it led to a series of disastrously incompetent Labour Lib Dem coalition governments.These in turn resulted in the electorate choosing, in , a minority SNP government, enabled by support from the Greens.My letter would be far too long were I to dwell on all the areas of incompetence in Holyrood government since , so I#ll confine my evaluation to education, upon which the future of Scotland depends.In , Salmond#s election promise was primary school class sizes of under  but, two years later, Fiona Hyslop changed that target to fewer than  pupils. That was just before Salmond sacked her and Mike Russell admitted smaller class sizes might not be possible before .Those councils that did enforce the limit of  only did so by refusing places to children whose siblings were at the same school.The #attainment gap# between children from poorer backgrounds and those from more affluent areas has continued to widen rather than diminish, as Nicola Sturgeon promised, while older students cannot find places at Scottish universities because these have to be allocated to foreign students, whose fees are a necessity to fund the universities.Meanwhile, I hate to think what Scotland#s deficit is now. It was around eight per cent of GDP before Covid decimated so many areas vital to Scotland#s economy.Doubtless, Alex Orr will remind me Scotland cannot legally have a deficit, but an independent Scotland could and it would prevent the dream of Scotland rejoining the EU from ever being attained.Brian Gee, Carradale East.In the recent storms,  houses at Bruach Gorm, Port Charlotte using the communal West Highland Housing Association satellite dish, lost half our Sky channels, including BBC  and STV.As I write, it’s been  working days since at least three of us that I know reported the issue to West Highland, but not a word of a fix date.The dish has done well for  years, but things degrade over time. I had an inkling this year there would be a dish problem and in the summer I bought a TV aerial kit for £ – a lot cheaper than fitting a dish. I put the aerial in the loft and there is a good reception, with BBC  and STV back. It is storm-proof in the loft, though I was disappointed with the lack of channels from the Bowmore transmitter.I Googled it and the mast is a Freeview Light and lacks channels other UK areas enjoy. I use Sky HD freeview channels but with Sky you have to navigate the TV guide through all the blocked subscription channels to find the one you want to watch. Via the Bowmore mast, the TV guide just lists the freeview channels, which is great.Freeview said that there are more channels available on main transmitters than there is on relay transmitters, which play a vital role in providing more remote areas a TV coverage.There are a lot of aerials on houses and I think Islay’s TV transmitters should get an upgrade to the same channels as other areas expect.I will also raise this issue with those elected to improve our lives, including MSP, MP, council leader Councillor Currie and Councillor Horn.Colin M Campbell, Port Charlotte, Islay.I think we all need a boost of positive news, so I would like to appeal to your readers to give a brave and special young person in your area the credit they deserve by nominating them for the  WellChild Awards.We are looking for inspirational children and young people who have defied the odds in the face of serious illness and the selfless nurses, doctors, brothers, sisters and friends who help care for them.This is your opportunity to give them the recognition they deserve at a prestigious event regularly attended by WellChild Patron, The Duke of Sussex.Nominations are open now so please get yours in before the closing date on Monday December  at noon.

Plans to secure accommodation for them had been put on ice due to the Covid- pandemic.Council planning officers have now allowed the plans to proceed after they received no objections from members of the public.In a statement to the council, reproduced in a handling report, a spokesperson for Balfour Beatty said: #The proposal involves self-contained sleeper units which have sleeping, living, cooking, washing and toilet facilities which will house Balfour Beatty staff for the duration of the project.#The spokesperson revealed that Balfour Beatty had found it #very dficult# to find accommodation in the area for #approximately  more people# who are due to travel to Argyll to work on the project in the coming months, adding that the company met with #strong opposition from locals# when it previously explored the option of developing areas of land near Whitehouse and Furnace.A council planning officer added in the report: #This proposal is aimed at keeping  residents safe from the potential impact of Covid and to facilitate the works.#In this instance, the proposal relates to essential infrastructure works and will have the added benefit of potentially protecting communities from Covid-.#Although it is accepted that workers will need to access facilities such as shops, petrol stations etc, measures are in place to ensure staff and other users are protected i.e. face coverings, hand sanitizer and social distancing.#"},{"url":null,"title":"down memory lane november 27 2020","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

This time it was to Perth to compete in the novice section of the Scottish Youth Championships, arriving in Perth on Saturday for Sunday’s competition.And on Sunday, playing third out of  bands, they had to leave before the results were announced. So there was much cheering and celebrating on the West Coast Motors bus on the journey home when the news came through that they had done the town proud and received a gold award and first place.This was an amazing feat for such a young and inexperienced band the youngest member Erin McLellan celebrated her eighth birthday on Sunday and the oldest member was only .TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGONo pledge on munitions dump surveyThere are no immediate plans for a survey of underwater munitions dumps in the Clyde and North Channel areas.Scientists from the marine research laboratory at Torry last week completed their survey of the area between the Beaufort’s Dyke dump and the nearby site of British Gas pipe laying operations.The operation has been blamed for disturbing thousands of Second World War fire bombs which were washed up on beaches in Kintyre, Mid Argyll, Islay, Jura, Gigha, Arran, North Ayrshire and Northern Ireland.But Scottish Office minister Raymond Robertson told MPs last week that the evidence connecting the pipe laying with the firebombs was ‘circumstantial’.Mr Robertson refused to commit the government to carrying out any further sea bed surveys in the areas around other munitions dumping sites off the west coast of Scotland.FIFTY YEARS AGOCriomaganMr Donnie Ronaldson, of the Argyll Arms Hotel, Southend, was host to a number of hoteliers and restauranteurs at a display of micro-wave cooking by the Scottish AGH Vending Company of Dundee which is the selling agent for Philips Microwave.Mr Robert Beveridge, the sales representative, gave a comprehensive demonstration on micro-wave cooking.Middleton discusses Common Market with fishermenMr George Middleton, chairman of the Herring Industry Board, revealed at a press conference last week that the board had been in touch with the Secretary of State for Scotland about the widespread alarm among fishermen about possible Common Market entry.Mr Gordon Campbell has replied: #It is not possible to make anything like the final assessment of the likely effect until we know in detail the regulations the European Economic Community proposes to make in implementation of the Common Fisheries Policy, and until our negotiations for entry have gone much further.#Mr Middleton assured fishermen on the pier during the discussions that the board existed to protect fishing interests and to fight any policies potentially harmful to the industry. He assured the fishermen that the board was well aware of the dangers entry into the Common Market presented.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGONews from Islay # honouring Mr and Mrs Anderson, CarnainOn the evening of Friday November   a concert was held in Newton School, the object of which was to give material expression in honour of Mr and Mrs Anderson, Carnain, who lost their two sonsin the Great War.The concert was remarkably successful, people being present from almost all parts of Kilchoman as well as from Kilarrow and Kelmeny, and the accommodation was taxed to its utmost capacity.Mr Cullen, Bridgend, in his own inimitable manner, occupied the chair and voiced the feelings of an enthusiastic audience in an excellent speech.He said they were gathered there that night to do honour to Mr Angus Anderson, an old soldier and the father of soldiers # of two sons who gave their lives for their King and Country.Mr Anderson joined the nd Argylls in , just  years before the Great War broke out.

So there will be one window on st December , two windows on December  and so on – and they should stay in place until Twelfth Night.Everyone is invited to walk or drive around the parishes and spot the decorated windows. A guide will also be available in the village shops.In this way, we hope to brighten the preparation for Christmas for everyone.More than , children are admitted to hospital every day in the UK and it has never been a scarier time for them.With unfamiliar wards, health professionals in additional PPE, only being able to have one parent with them, and no visits from their brothers or sisters during the pandemic, it can be very worrying and lonely.That is why play and distraction services in hospitals are now more vital than ever. Having access to toys and entertainment, when recovering or waiting for treatment, or using play as a distraction for procedures can help to alleviate pain, aid recovery and bring joy back into children’s lives.At the children’s charity Starlight, thanks to our supporters, we provide hospitals with boxes filled with toys, games and puzzles to be used on wards.This year, Starlight’s fundraising income has fallen due to many cancelled events, which is why we have started our Time to Play campaign. Our goal is to raise £, before the end of the year to help , children get access to play in hospital and limit the negative effects of illness on their childhood.It’s easy to support and our website has fun ideas of how to take part, including our Stream for Starlight fundraiser for computer gamers.Or,you are able to, please considering making a simple one-off donation. However big or small, it will help Starlight to continue to be there to support children and their families this Christmas.I’m hoping your readers will join together and help support Starlight, to bring back joy into the lives of the , seriously ill children living in the UK this Christmas.Please visit www.starlight.org.uk time to help us. Thank you.Every year thousands of children contact Childline about being bullied online and tell us that they feel it is hard to escape from.Lockdown has intensied these feelings for many and since April we’ve counselled more than , children and young people across the UK about online bullying.Children have told us about people sending threatening or abusive messages and being pressured into engaging in sexual conversations. Others have shared that they’ve been excluded from online games by other children, while some spoke of online identities being stolen to embarrass or cause trouble while using their name.Before lockdown measures were first introduced this year, the average monthly number of counselling sessions with children about online bullying was . Between April and October that value increased by  per cent to a monthly average of .This is worrying, particularly as we continue to adhere to strict social-distancing restrictions across Scotland and children continue to spend more time online. Bullying can have a long-term impact on the mental wellbeing of a child and, as we mark Anti Bullying Week this month and beyond, it’s important to ensure that every child knows who they can turn to for support.If a parent thinks their child is being bullied online, it can be hard to remain calm, but it’s crucial not to overwhelm a child with questions. Taking their device away is likely to make them feel like whatever has happened is their fault instead, it’s helpful to listen to their worries, suggest they take some time away from certain apps, and provide them with reassurance.Adeniyi Alade, service head of Childline at NSPCC Scotland.Boris Johnson’s comment that devolution has been #a disaster north of the border# and #Tony Blair’s worst mistake# should hardly come as a surprise to anyone.The Tories have never been great supporters of devolution, vehemently opposing both the referendums in  on establishing a Scottish Assembly and in  on the Scottish Parliament.Most recently the devolution power grab that is highlighted in the Internal Market Bill simply reinforces this stance.The Scottish Social Attitudes surveyon constitutional preference found that only seven per cent favour abolition of the Scottish Parliament and it found that trust in the Scottish Government sits at four times that of the UK Government. This points to it hardly being a disaster.For those accused of scaremongering that there is a threat to Holyrood, Mr Johnson’s comments are clear vindication. The irony of all this being that devolution has given new le to the Scottish Conservatives after its wipe out in  and it is now the opposition in the Scottish Parliament.Be under no doubt that the Scottish Parliament, which was hard fought for, is under threat and we must do all in our power to defend it.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.While this year Christmas is going to be dferent from usual for many of us, it is still a time for preparations and extra food.

Usually we look forward to the Christmas lights and decorations brightening up the dark winter nights and bringing hope and cheer.This year, we wait and wonder. We wonder what level our area will be in, we wonder what level our family and friends will be in, we wonderwe will be able to see them or have them in our homes or go to their homes.We wonder.

So we wait and watch and wonder – a bit like the shepherds of old, gathered on the hillside, waiting and watching and wondering.It has been a tough few months and for many it has been a gruelling and harrowing few months.How do we celebrate in such times Yet, I have heard so many people say: #Well I’m going to put up my tree and I’m going to do it early to bring some cheer into our lives.#We are a people of hope, even in the darkest days.We wait in the darkness for we know that even the darkest night has the first streaks of dawn to lighten the sky.So as we approach the time of preparing to welcome the Christ child once again, we will wait hopefully."},{"url":null,"title":"fundraising star lights up the night","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Bubbles can only gather in a private home , outdoors or at a place of worship.An extended household can meet in line with the normal rules as just one household.Where parents do not live in the same household, children can move between their parentsrsquo homes in dferent bubbles, and this includes both supervised and unsupervised visitation.The Government says people within a bubble should NOT go to the shops together. ldquoWhere possible you should shop on your own, or only with children or those who need support, shop local, and use Click and Collect or Delivery services, the advice reads.Those who are part of a bubble should not stay in tourist accommodation.

East Lothian is a particularly good place for short-eared owls as it offers the right habitat ndash such as lowland grazing marshes and rough grassland ndash that wintering lsquoshortiesrsquo need.During summer, short-eared owls are likely to be seen in moorlands ndash their preferable breeding habitat. As they nest on the ground, usually in the shelter of tall grass, the breeding site must have sufficient cover to conceal the nest.Shorties are unusual for owls because they prefer to hunt in the daytime. They can be seen hunting as they quarter an area looking for their prey. lsquoQuartering flightrsquo is a mixture of flapping and gliding sometimes they hover before dropping down onto the prey. It is not uncommon to see several shorties hunting over the same area. They occasionally hunt from a perch or while standing on the ground. Unlike other owls, shorties carry their prey in talons. They feed on small mammalsthat comprise around  per cent of their diet.Short-eared owls are ghostly as they soundlessly flit over the landscape. There is nothing more magical than watching an owl turns its head towards you whilst keeping the body still.My adventure with them started two years ago during a visit to Aberlady. It was a sunny and windless Saturday morning when I arrived at the reserve. I hung my camera over my shoulder and rushed over the bridge. The tide was slowly coming in, so the lagoon did not host many birds. There was no one around and I was so instilled with the surrounding silence that I could hear my own thoughts.As I walked further towards the coast, I saw a pale bird to my left. My initial thought was lsquoseagullrsquo however, after I looked through my camera, I realised it was an owl. I could not believe my luck! I know I say this a lot, but I really am a lucky person when it comes to wildle.Even though the ground was covered in frost, I decided to sit down in tall grass ndash no matter the sacrice, when it comes to wildle my priority is to remain invisible to avoid any disturbance.From my vantage point, I witnessed the owl freeze in mid-air for a split second and pounce with its head down. I must admit it looked quite comical at first. It did not catch anything the first time, so I kept watching, hoping for another attempt.Before long, I realised the owl was joined by another shortie. Could I have asked for more ! The second owl rushed towards the first one and as it got closer it straightened its legs and scratched the first bird with its talons.The owls were clearly manesting some disagreement but it cooled down fairly quickly. The second bird decided to retreat and, as it flew past me, it looked straight into my camera before it finally vanished from my sight. The moment when the birdrsquos eyes met mine was hypnotising. I was so entranced that I needed a while before I was ready to carry on with my photography.After this wonderful experience, I wanted toto the reserve a week later. But on that visit I found the owls further towards the coast where it was dficult to photograph them, although I still enjoyed watching them.

I felt the same way I did in the bookshop ndash I couldnrsquot stop reading.Light on Dumyat introduced the characters ndash Gavin, Clare, Michael and Mot ndash a group of children who call themselves the Clan Alliance and have adventures in the Scottish countryside. They are like the Famous Five but Scottish and not so posh. Gavin is English, but he is learning about Scotland and what it means to be part of a clan. The characters are very human ndash Michael and Mot can be a bit sarcastic with Clare, because she is their sister, and thatrsquos funny.In the first book, the children foil silver thieves in the second book, The White Stag Adventure, they are on the trail of poachers. The third book, The Day the Mountain Moved, took a dferent direction by introducing magic and that surprised me. The themes of survival and environment were still there and it did work well, but this was not my favourite book in the series.Magic and time travel continue into book four, Jewels on the Move and this time, it is much more exciting.Clare, the leader of the Clan, is quick-thinking. So when they meet an injured girl who has the Honours of Scotland, the Scottish Crown Jewels, in her bag and is fleeing from men who want to steal them, Clare knows that getting to safety is the most important thing to do, rather than stop and ask questions.One of the things I liked about the books is that the gang leader is a girl. When this was written, most books would probably have had male leaders. These books break down stereotypes.I liked the fact these books are set in Scotland, and are full of Scottish information and facts, like how to pronounce certain words and what they mean. The Clanrsquos war cry is ldquocreag an sgairbh which I would never have known how to pronouncethe author hadnrsquot told me. I learned a lot about the history of the clans, and how members used to have plant symbols to show what clan they belonged to. One of the best things about the books is the way the children try hard not to harm the environment ndash sothey have a fire, they make sure to clean up well after themselves and they donrsquot leave litter. Although these books were written many years ago, this is an important environmental message that we all need to understand now.Even though you are learning a lot, reading these books doesnrsquot feel like homework, because they are really exciting and fun. Even the modern covers are clever. I liked the woodland colours ndashyou left these books in a forest, they would be camouflaged. Jewels on the Move is funny and exciting. I thought the ending was a little sad, although I wonrsquot spoil it here for other readers. I think I found it even more sad because I know there are no more Clan books, and that is a shame ndash but I know Irsquoll read these books again and again.Jewels on the Move by Rennie McOwan, Rowan Tree Publishing, pound."},{"url":null,"title":"galleries-teenage-years-spent-farms-inspires-artists-lockdown-work","story":"Galleries: Teenage years spent on farms inspires artist’s lockdown workMark pictured in his Yorkshire homeIt is a motley menagerie, a carnival of incongruous bedmates, but a joyful one, too, and just the panacea for the grey days and thin winter sub-song of the city at large.Hearld spent the first lockdown in ldquosplendid isolation ndash dficult, he tells me,yoursquore ldquoan extrovert type who gets your energy from interactions rather than introspection.When lockdown eased, he went back to his shared studio in the centre of York, where he still works now, listening to baroque trumpet first thing in the morning, or some ldquolively Monteverdi ndash ldquoa bit of a studio joke, he grins ndash to energise the atmosphere.It has always been animals and birds for Hearld. Born in York, he moved to the outskirts as a teenager. ldquoIt was the s, and there were still working farms there, he tells me.ldquoI spent all my teenage time on farms with ponies, chickens, Muscovy ducks. I got fully involved in it. And I did lots of drawings from le of poultry. He tells me about the painting, Remembered Farm, which is part of the exhibition, a chaos of chickens and corrugated iron, which alludes to those years and the place that, now built over, no longer exists as he knew it.ldquoItrsquos no longer the magical, ramshackle farm, with sheds put up in the s, the s, no longer the mysterious place to explore.And yet lockdown, and walking the new family dog ndash a lively whippet which he shares with his parentsndash brought him back to that time, taking him out into the countryside for a few hours a day, minutes fromhis parentsrsquo door.ldquoIt was a complete joy. I noticed snipe displaying ndash things Irsquod not noticed since I was a teenager.Memory plays a strong part in Hearldrsquos work, and his sketches,once made from le, are now largely done from memory. ldquoI donrsquot sketch often enough, but I do look really acutely. I draw from memory mostly, and I do think you end up gettingmore of the spirit of the beast,whereasyoursquore using too much reference material it can be too flatly naturalistic, too slavish.But Irsquod love to find a fairytale farmyard and spend months drawing, revivying. I look long and hard at things, but getting back to doingsome spontaneous drawings again would be a good thing to do, I think. I should be more rigorous.Hearldrsquos work is collage, the intricate cutting out and putting together of disparate parts to make a whole, a rearrangement of material until the right form comes to le.ldquoItrsquos all about placement and flexibility. Itrsquos a wonderfully improvisatory medium, a moveable feast. You just have to know when to commit, he says. Hearldrsquos images are loose yet bold, full of painted splashes, cut-outs from exhibition posters, silhouettes.ldquoCollage is how I think creatively, but I didnrsquot do that at all at art college, he tells me. Hearld studied illustration at Glasgow School of Art, where one of his tutors was the illustratorMick Manning. ldquoThere was that nerve-racking thing about learning at art school, then Irsquod be at home on my own and doing it for myself, with the space to find my own voice. I did a collage and it was an epiphany moment. I thought, ldquothis is my medium.Whatrsquos wonderful is itrsquos an inherently abstract process. You want the piece of paper to still look like a piece of paper as well as a representation of a chicken, and I found the graphic-ness a great foil for expression and gesture.ldquoYou need to find clarity and sharpness, bring visual equivalents into the mix and add your own energy. Itrsquos really exciting.This freedom, now, has moved on to the frames of his collages, one of which Hearld is elaborately decorating as we speak.ldquoTheyrsquore getting wilder and wilder, he says, with some glee, telling me of the red paint he is daubing on the frame around a striking silhouette of a jay,ldquoan abstracted take on a fake tortoiseshell frame, using painted slip.It has but scant hours to dry for the following morning he will pack it and some  other collages into his Skoda Yeti for the four-hour journey to Edinburgh, a riotous envoy from another lockdown.Mark Hearldrsquos Menagerie, The Scottish Gallery,  Dundas Street, Edinburgh,    www.scottish-gallery, until Dec , Tues-Fri am-.pm Sat am-pm, by appointment only.

Great.And now there are other developments both good and also frightening.The two hospitals had a case meeting and decided treatment was working extremely well and buying more and more months of le. The tumours are still greatly diminished, thank God, and theyrsquore now adding to the three weekly immunotherapy infusions, daily preventative radiotherapy sessions for the next three weeks.These, too, carry potential side effects and every time I get any Irsquom right back to square one with the weak legs, the trembling and the desire to turn my face to the wall.But, worse, my time here is running out. They have already kept me in really longer than they should in this safe, pristine rehabilitation which costs a huge sum to my insurers and the health service per month.So, between the next two immunotherapy sessions andI am not brought low again, there is a window for me to leave. I almost vomited with fear when first told for, in truth, I have become institutionalised and to leave this security is like going away to school for the first time.They also believe I should now be close to my son as, although there will be help at my house for me and they will provide all they can, they believe my mental and indeed physical state was immeasurably improved by his three-week presence in the summer.I cannot praise enough their help. Theyrsquove sent scans and medical records ndash some written out in English to the Royal Marsden, London, where out-patient treatment will continue and Irsquove had everyone from psychologists to social security experts to see me. I have such faith in this system.With lockdown and quarantine, Pierce is unlikely to be able to come and get me and so they are seeking further help ndash ideally free ndash for medical assistance on the plane they believe is the way to travel. But I may have to do it alone.At the other end I will go into a small rented flat in Battersea, ideally just minutes away from Pierce ndash the lay-out of his town house makes it impossible for living there.I will have luggage ndash mainly clothes and a few precious photos and maybe a small, sneaked painting or two ndash and it could be a few weeks until the English system kicks in so, apart from his ministrations, I will be still alone.I donrsquot know how well Irsquoll be walking or feeling and there will be no buzzer to press in the night.ldquoItrsquos a bolt hole, he tells me. ldquoIrsquoll be minutes away ndash yoursquoll often be at our house or Irsquoll come and have lunch and wersquoll have dinner.

On bad days I cry, overcome with pride at how much hersquos doing and wanting to do for me.But mainly I cry, for itrsquos not fair he should have to, want to. He has a young family, a massively busy, intense and demanding working le, and now, for the first time ever hellip a dependent, no longer an lsquoah sod it allrsquo mother.I cry selfishly, too, for the loss of me ndash for the loss of my movement, my courage, my ability to face down any situation and not stop until Irsquove achieved my aimhellipor story as it usually was.I wonrsquot go back to LM before I leave. Miriam will turn the key and my le will drain into sepia on the walls.

Loves, loves, loves it. So much so that the Australian-born food writer has put together a collection of Yuletide recipes -  new,  swiped from her previous Little Library cookbooks - all cloth-bound in festive red, like a Dickensian classic, and interwoven with Christmas themed essays.Drawing on food from fiction - like the Turkish delight Edmund gorges on in The Lion, The Witch And The Wardrobe roasted nuts inspired by The Mill On The Floss, and Moomin-style eggnog - as well as her own Christmases, including many a Swedish Christmas Eve feast, The Little Library Christmas is full of festive cheer. Its also very sensitive to the fact not all Christmases are equal, let alone easy.\"I really love Christmas, but I totally appreciate that for a lot of people, its incredibly stressful,\" says Young, noting the annual flux in complicated family dynamics and at the other extreme, loneliness during a season where togetherness is seemingly mandatory. \"Its never as simple as Christmas is always great.\"And whether its great or not, its certainly going to be dferent this year. \"Im trying not to assume what Christmas Day is going to look like but the reality of the situation, I think were all painfully aware, is that we might all be restricted,\" says Young on the pandemic, which is set to outstrip even Scrooge in its disdain for Christmas wishes. \"I think its going to be a weird one. Ive talked to friends who are making a decision like, Were just gonna pretend its not happening. But I love it, and I cant pretend its not happening. So Im going to find ways to make it good.\"Food is one such way - an excellent one at that.Youngs split the recipes in her book into five sections, covering food as gts festive party fare Christmas Eve goodness all the December  trimmings and edible ways to see in the new year.\"I wanted to write a book that gives you ideas for that day, but also covers all the time around it,\" she explains, noting that yes, you may want to roast a whole goose, eschew turkey for chicken this year , or go Swedish and make Janssons temptation . But it is also \"completely fine, as we did a couple of years ago, to get a bunch of last-minute canapes for the freezer and just put them in the oven at ious points throughout the day and eat that\", she says.\"There is joy to be had in making an incredible Christmas dinner, butthat is not something youre going to find joyful, it does feel quite intense to have that pushed upon you. Theres always a chance to do it another way theres no right way for Christmas to look.\"Same goes for New Years Eve. Its easy to feel pressurised into thinking you have to drink all the champagne and dance until your tights wear through, but Young says theres magic in a low-key New Year. Especially when it involves making her cheesy orzo using the nubbly odds and ends of your Christmas cheeseboard.Now based in the UK, Young is rather used to Christmas shting shape and form. Growing up in the Nineties in Australia, Christmas Day was \"monstrously hot\" and sunny, and spent largely in the pool.\"Generally, we ate cold meat and potato salads, so wed have a ham, but wed have it cold,\" Young recalls. \"December is a beautul time of year for food in Australia - all the tropical fruit is out, so youd have mangoes it would be extraordinary. But we would still have plum pudding because my great-grandma made Christmas puddings every year. I still use her recipe, which is in the book, and we would still have that to finish, but not until the sun had set and it was slightly cooler.\"Sprouts were not really on the menu... \"I didnt eat them a lot until I came here and by then I was in my s,\" says Young. \"I loved them instantly because they are slightly bitter and savoury and good, andyou know how to cook them, theyre delicious. I didnt have any of that school dinners association, where theyve been boiled to oblivion.\"She even pickles them. \"Theyve become a thing thats cool again,\" she says. \"At Christmas, they sometimes receive a worse rap than they should.\"Christmas may be wroughtwith tradition, ritual and routine, but Young hopes The Little Library Christmas offers space and ideas, not festive mandates. \"I dont want it to feel like Im presenting a utopian version of Christmas,\" she says. \"I want the book to very much feel like a usable practical friend in the kitchen, but also a memory of the really good parts of Christmas, and an acknowledgement of the parts where its tricky as well.\"I want it to be a Christmas book for people who dont necessarily have to have completely uncomplicated feelings about Christmas,\" she adds.

This offer still stands today.The company said BiFab and its management were given no access or opportunity to address the BiFab Working Group set up by the UK and Scottish Governments and have not been contacted by it.BiFab added: ldquoScottish ministers also point to the lack of a long-term business plan as a secondary causal factor to the current situation.:Unions attack lack of accountability over ministers failure to explain BiFab U-turnldquoAgain, this is inaccurate. JV Driver prepared a long-form multi-phase business plan for Scottish ministers prior to acquiring BiFab.BiFab said many nations have local supply chain protections that limit the amount of international sourcing available to major energy infrastructure projects but that no such legislation exists in Scotland or the wider UK.And as a result, thousands of high-paying fabrication jobs are being lost to the Middle East and Asia and only Scottish and UK ministers have the ability to change this policy, according to BiFab.The company said ultimately it appears the NnG project will be lost to BiFab along with the  to  jobs it promised to create.It stated: ldquoAs a result of recent correspondence from Scottish ministers, it is apparent that creditor support from the Scottish ministers required to pursue critical solutions for BiFab will be unavailable.ldquoWhile incredibly disappointed, BiFab management continues to consider all options available to the business.The Scottish secretaries of the GMB and Unite unions, Gary Smith and Pat Rafferty, described the situation as a ldquogrowing scandal.They added: ldquoThe signal this sends out to the renewables industry is clear, itrsquos business as usual.ldquoThe jobs of the future will continue to be exported to the rest of world and subsidised by the billpayer to the tune of billions.ldquoAt best, Britain will get scraps off the table from its own offshore wind market but it looks like both Governments have buried any credible hopes for a meaningful green jobs recovery in Scotland.Scottish Greens energy spokesperson and Fe MSP Mark Ruskell said: ldquoThe Scottish Government cannot bemoan the fact that itrsquos a minority shareholder with no seat on the board while at the same time turning down opportunities to step up and become a majority shareholder.\"Bab urgently needs a recovery plan that can secure interim work and deliver promised green jobs while the Scottish Government works towards state ownership that is still in line with market rules it has to adhere to.The Scottish and UK Governments have been contacted for comment."},{"url":null,"title":"tom-gordon-alex-salmond-inquiry-block-shows-need-holyrood-reform","story":"Not my words, but those of SNP MP Peter Grant in the House of Commons on  December . A bit lurid from the partyrsquos then Brexit spokesman, perhaps, but you catch his drt.Governments that defy parliaments have forgotten their place in the pecking order, and bad things follow.Mr Grantrsquos speech was on the day the UK Government was found in contempt of parliament for refusing to hand over its legal advice on the EU Withdrawal Agreement, despite a vote by MPs to do so three weeks earlier.The issue of compliance with the will of parliament has been a big part of the Holyrood week, too, with the Scottish Government suffering a second defeat, also three weeks after the first, on whether to hand over some of its own legal advice.In its case, about its doomed defence of the civil action Alex Salmond won against it in . MSPs have voted twice to see it, the Government has refused, although it says it is belatedly thinking about it, but wonrsquot say when it will make up its mind.To recap, the former first minister won a judicial review against the Government after it botched a probe into sexual misconduct claims made against him by two civil servants.He showed the exercise was ldquotainted by apparent bias from the start, and taxpayers were left with a pound, bill for his legal costs.A cross-party inquiry has been trying to find out what went wrong since the Governmentrsquos case collapsed in January . At the time, Nicola Sturgeon promised the inquiry ldquowhatever material they request.Instead there has been a masterclass in foot dragging, smokescreens, and evasion. Evidence has been missing or late, deputy First Minister John Swinney is planning an unwanted, tangential court action guaranteed to waste time but deliver little , and Mr Salmondrsquos lawyers have been drowned in last minute, frequently irrelevant paperwork. In short, the Government has been at it.The biggest bone of contention has been its legal advice on the litigation.This is central to the inquiryrsquos work as it would allow MSPs to compare what the Government did with what it was being told by its legal team.Were the advice and the action in lockstep, or did Ms Surgeonrsquos administration depart from the advice to a perverse, even sinister, degree in its bitter fight with Mr Salmond It would allow the inquiry to test the theory that the Government knew its case was on the skids well before it conceded, yet it carried on, leading to punitive costs for the public purse.If, as the opposition suspects, the Government has something to hide, such as abusing its power and our money, the legal advice would go a very long way to clearing that up.But Mr Swinney has repeatedly refused to hand it over, arguing it would be against the public interest.It would damage the governmentrsquos ability to receive future legal advice ldquoin all candour, undermining all ministerial decision-making.The suggestion is thatlawyers knew their advice might be public one day - which is, in theory, already the case - they would fall down on the job and stop supplying the rigorous assessments they have been trained to offer, and take professional pride in, and hand in a lot of wishy-washy tosh.One might have thought the prospect of publicity would encourage them to up their game, so they didnrsquot lose face and business. Or spur the Government to use lawyers who donrsquot flinch. But, no, according to Mr Swinney, nothing lowers universal standards like sunlight. What rot.Mr Swinney even claimed on Wednesday that the ldquomaintenance of legal professional privilege, which has existed in law for all time, was at stakethe advice came out.Asa cornerstone of Scots law would crumble as a result of a single event. Ludicrous.Ms Sturgeonrsquos favourite get-out is the Scottish Ministerial Code, which says legal advice can only be releasedministers decide ldquothe balance of public interest favours it and the law officers agree based on ldquocompelling reasons for disclosure in the particular circumstances. But she is cherry picking, as the code also contains a presumption in favour of disclosure. It says ministers ldquoshould refuse to provide information only in accordance with FoI law and other relevant statutes.So is there a relevant law stopping them from disclosing this advice No, there is only a convention that it is secret, and conventions can be departed from now and again without the sky falling in. They are flexible by design. Democracy will cope.In her introduction to the Code, Ms Sturgeon also wrote: ldquoIt is essential to set and maintain the highest standards of propriety and openness for Government ministershellip I will lead by example in following the letter and spirit of this Code. If only.The Salmond inquiry has illuminated a deficiency in Holyrood.When the UK Government was found in contempt of parliament, and finally coughed up its legal advice, it was because it ignored a binding vote of the Commons, an archaic device known as a humble address.There is no equivalent at Holyrood. Scottish ministers must obey the law, but other votes, including those demanding to see legal advice, are not binding on it. They lack real teeth.As Mr Grant knows, shameless governments acting in bad faith can shrug off such gummy reprimands, and nasty things may follow. Thank goodness we donrsquot have one of those.But just to future-proof things, Holyrood might want to urgently consider how it can better hold an over-mighty executive in check."},{"url":null,"title":"blanket-schools-policy","story":"They warned that primary school children \"will disproportionately experience harm\"more is not done to take account of the dferences in

countries in EuropeIn Scotland face coverings are compulsory in the classroom and in communal areas, such as corridors, for teachers and secondary school pupils in years S to S in areas under Level Three or Four restrictions.Evidence suggests that younger children are much less likely to catch the virus or to pass it on.In the week ending November , there were  Covid cases among children aged five to , and  in those aged  to .: Grounds for cautious approach in secondary schoolsOn November  there were , pupils absent from school for Covid-related reasons, though this has previously exceeded ,.The researchers said \"evidence-based recommendations for primary school\" should be a priority \"to avoid young children unnecessarily missing signicant quantities of schooling this winter\".They add: \"Not only is there wide iation in recommendations across Europe, surprisingly few countries have implemented an approach that promotes upscaling or downscaling of their primary school recommendations in line with local prevalence.\"In addition, none of these countries suggest dferent measures for primary schools compared with secondary schools, except in the use of face covering and approaches to contact tracing.\"They note that young children experience frequent respiratory tract infections, averaging eight per year in pre-school and four per year in primary school.They write: \"If testing is dficult to access or slow, young children will inevitably miss signicant quantities of schooling this winter.\"In addition, the recommendation in some countries for the entire family of a symptomatic child to isolate while awaiting their test results will limit parentsrsquo ability to work and siblingsrsquo freedom to attend school...\"The default position for primary schools should be the implementation of less restrictive infection control requirements, in which young children are not made to wear face coverings, entire bubbles are not made to isolate following a single case and the entire family is not made to isolate awaiting the childrsquos test results.\": Where did it all go wrong  The data tells us the missteps which have led back to lockdownCovid vaccines should also be prioritised to teachers over primary school children and to children living \"with extremely vulnerable relatives within their household\".Measures could be tailored to pupils in this higher risk group,such advice to wear face coverings in communal settings, isolation in the event of any positive cases within their class bubble, and having a lower threshold for testingthey develop symptoms.In France and Spain, gastroenteritis is included among the Covid symptoms for children, who are more likely than adults to experience diarrhoea and vomiting as a side effect of infection.In the UK, a persistent cough, fever, and loss of taste or smell are the only official Covid symptoms.The researchers conclude thatmeasures such as social distancing should be escalated when local virus prevalence rises above a certain threshold to curbtransmission between teachers, and from teachers to pupils.They add: \"However, apart from in the event of sustained transmission of SARS-CoV- within a school, we do not feel that closure of primary schools can ever be justied.\"A spokesman for the Scottish Government said: ldquoWe are keeping the way guidance is being implemented in schools under close review, along with emerging scientic evidence.ldquoWhere there is a need to take further action, either by updating our guidance or supporting implementation, we will work with teachers, parents, trades unions, local authorities and young peoplersquos representatives to do so."},{"url":null,"title":"Iain Macwhirter  The Union cannot survive the impending post-pandemic financial cataclysm","story":"A hard rainrsquos gonna fall. The Government is borrowing eye-popping amounts of money to finance a pound billion budget deficit this year plus a poundbn spending programme on housing, broadband and rail. Not even Jeremy Corbynrsquos election manesto envisaged such a rapid expansion of the state.UK debt will rise to pound. trillion ndash thatrsquos nearly pound  trillion more than at the budget in . Unemployment is expected to rise to . per cent, or . million at a conservative estimate. In reality, it is likely to rise to over three million, much of it disguised, as workless people in their s and s drop out of the labour market entirely.And none of this includes Brexit. The Chancellor didnrsquot mention the B word in his spending review, even though the independent Office for Budgetary Responsibility said very clearly that a bad deal could make the financial situation considerably worse.Borrowing on this scale is only possible because of two contingent factors: uniquely low interest rates and the printing of money.The Bank of England is busy buying up Government debt with phoney funds ndash a total of poundbn has been printed so far. Quantitative easing serves to boost inflation. It also makes the rich richer because it inflates asset prices like big houses and boosts the value of shares, making inequality worse.It hardly needs to be said that this canrsquot go on indefinitely. That many EU countries are in an even worse state is little consolation. We are ing to the kind of wretched economic circumstances last seen in the s. Margaret Thatcherrsquos recessions then led to violent confrontation with the unions and to the destruction of much of Scotlandrsquos manufacturing industry.You canrsquot have mass unemployment without political upheaval. The s was the moment Scottish voters finally abandoned the Conservative and Unionist Party, which had dominated Scotland in the post-war period. This time a similar break is likely ndash only a more profound one, as the Union itself comes under unbearable strain.This Covid shock comes after a decade in which real wages in the UK stagnated. Many people are going to get poorer ndash which explains two of the more cynical measures in Rishi Sunakrsquos spending review.Why bother lopping % off the aid budget  This is a drop in the bucket, but sends a grim message to the world about Britainrsquos geopolitical standing. And why freeze public-sector pay  That only saves a paltry poundbn and there is an argument that pay should be kept bouyant as one of the stabilisers against recession  These moves had very little to do with fiscal policy or deficit reduction and were largely about politics. Many working-class voters think it is crazy to spend poundbn on foreign aid ndash more than was paid to the EU before Brexit ndash when Britain is in deep financial trouble. It doesnrsquot help that some of this money goes to countries like Pakistan and China which have little regard for Britain.According to a Savanta ComRes poll nearly two-thirds of voters support the Chancellorrsquos aid cut of pound.bn.Similarly, the vast majority ndash % ndash of British workers who are in the private sector are seeing wages slashed and jobs disappearing. Public-sector employees earn more, have better job security and generous pensions. A pay rise in the middle of the Covid crisis would have seemed unfair to many of the Governmentrsquos new supporters in the north of England. According to Savanta ComRes, % of UK voters support the freeze, % opposed.It is also convenient for Boris Johnson for Labour to appear to be more concerned about workers in China than in Workington, and more concerned about public-sector bureaucrats, than Red Wall grafters. NHS workers and public employees earning less than pound, are exempt from the public pay freeze.This puts the Scottish Government on the spot. At the time of writing, Nicola Sturgeon is not saying whether or not she will increase the pay of public-sector workers. If she does, she may have to consider increasing taxes to boost the pay of civil servants, teachers and council officials. Either way, she will blame Rishi Sunak.In her conference speech tomorrow, Sturgeon will accuse Boris Johnson of imposing a new era of Tory austerity on public-sector workers, benefit claimants and the low paid.Conservatives will respond that the Government has already given Scotland pound.bn and more spending is on the way. And, unlike in , the First Minister has the powers to increase public spendingshe wants.She will respond that she doesnrsquot have the right borrowing and tax powers to address the problem. The independent Higgins report on economic recovery said that Scotland needs poundbn in new borrowing powers.There is only so long that this dialogue of the deaf can continue, as Britain sinks below the waves. Something has to give: most likely the constitution.Sturgeon will also call tomorrow for a referendum on independence in the first half of the next Scottish parliamentary term ndash before .She will say that independence is the only way to protect Scotland from the predations of Boris Johnson who, as this column remarked last week, arouses profound loathing among Scottish voters.But loathing is a two-way street. There has been a distinct change of mood among Conservatives and Tory voters recently on the Scottish question. There is a growing realisation that the Barnett Formula, which provides Scotland with a block grant based on UK spending, is no longer working. It is effectively a handout and goes against Tory principles.Senior Conservatives, like Sir Malcolm Rkind and John Major, are calling for a radical reappraisal of devolution.Rkind wants a new kind of federalism, in which Scotland would have nearly all the powers of a state except for foreign affairs, defence and currency. If this happened, Barnett would be phased out and Scottish spending would be paid out of taxation.The logic is too compelling to be ignored. Fiscal autonomy is anyway the policy of the Scottish National Party. There has to be some kind of response from Westminsterand when the SNP win the expected landslide majority in the Scottish election in May. Nicola Sturgeon will call indyref and will have a firm electoral mandate to justy it.The UK may have no choice but to offer, instead of the status quo, a new constitutional settlement. It might well propose that Scotland takes effective control of its own economic affairs within a broad UK wrapper.This is not devo max, but it would appeal to the vast majority of Scots who favour self-government but want to retain some link to the United Kingdom.Fiscal autonomy would be no walk in the park since Scotland currently raises less in taxes than is spent by the Government. But change is definitely coming as this crisis cannot be resolved within the present arrangements.It seems highly likely that the Union, as we know it, will be one of the final casualties of Covid-."},{"url":null,"title":"Rosemary Goring  39 s Country Life  In this bleakest of years  we all need a light in the dark","story":"I remember being surprised to read the shepherd Heida Asgeirsdottirrsquos account of her le in the most remote corner of Iceland, where she tends a flock of .She was unfazed by eruptions from the volcano  miles away, which could cloak the area in an ash cloud so thick she could not see her hands before her eyes. Nor did she baulk at challenging an international energy companyrsquos plans for developing in this environmentally fragile landscape. What did discomfit her was the dark. At night, she would stand on her doorstep and take solace in the lights of the nearest farm, a long way off.Spike Milligan understood the problem. In his poem Bump, which I learned as a child, he summed up the dread that night-time can bring: ldquoThings that go lsquobumprsquo in the night Should not really give one a fright.  Itrsquos the hole in each ear That lets in the fear,  That, and the absence of light!Hoolet is lit by gentle street lighting which, when it snows, reminds me of Narnia. Now that it is getting dark before five orsquoclock, the place can feel asit has closed in upon itself even before the working day has ended. With far less traffic than before, the only signs of activity are the winking of a dogrsquos neon collar, or the head torches of runners, bobbing like fireflies along the fields and stream.So it was a lovely surprise the other night when I went to close the shutters to see a row of brilliant coloured lights brightening the path by a house further up the street. Scarlet, plum, green, white, yellow and blue, they lit the way like an invitation to a party.The following evening the house opposite theirs was parading coloured lights too, and the day after, another house had framed a window in rainbow lights. It felt asthey were in conversation.As a child I could never understand those households that didnrsquot put up their trees or decorations until Christmas Eve, when it was almost too late. On the way to school Irsquod note the first lights beginning to appear in mid-November, the tally mounting with each day. Yet to those imagining that a few Hooleteers are jumping the festive gun, this somewhat unseasonal display of lights has nothing to do with Christmas, as I learned.It is part of a winter-time initiative, inspired by an East Lothian grandmother, Alison Johnston, who came up with the notion of Shine Bright Scotland, to combat Covid gloom. Perturbed at the bleakness of the coming months, she suggested people put a light in their window from the start of November, to hearten children as the nights closed in and help banish the pall that threatens to engulf us all. Here in Hoolet, the plan is to keep them shining through January.After a quick masterclass in garden illumination by the neighbours who first led the way ndash who knew you could close a window on the thin end of the cable, without cutting off the electricity  ndash I headed out to the shops. The shelves of outdoor decorations are a whole other world, and it was dficult not to get sidetracked by the grazing family of sparkly deer that could be ours,only I could blindfold Alan for the next couple of months.By the end of the afternoon, as dusk descended, I had festooned the cotoneaster bush beneath our kitchen window with a string of  bulbs, and switched on the power. It took a few minutes to find the right setting. What we needed was a steady glow rather than the flashing, rippling, or surge and fade effects which might make friends across the green hallucinate.It brightens up the garden no end, and that night I took a walk around the village, to see how far the notion had spread. One or two houses had decorations in their windows or hanging from the roof, but not many. Since then, however, there has been a new addition almost every night.Already the village green looks much more welcoming, with indoor displays of silver and golden swags, chandeliers and coronas, and trees and hedges twinkling asTinkerbell had just dusted them with her wand.We may not be allowed to enter other peoplersquos houses at the moment but like lighthouse keepers of old we can signal from a distance.A casual inspection of other places in the area suggests that the ripple-effect from headquarters in East Lothian has been slow to spread. Even so, there were hopeful glimmers wherever we went. At the entrance to one village, a massive coner greeted us with crystal lights. The owners either have a cherry-picker, or are trained in the art of throwing a lasso. Along the way, a handful of houses shone out, like ships at sea, pinpricks of good cheer, pushing back the dark.In this most dismal and isolating of years, there has never been more need to offer reasons to be cheerful. Yet in Nordic countries, regardless of religious custom, lanterns, candles and electric lights have long been used to ward off winterrsquos clutches.Itrsquos a habit that might prove to be catching, even once coronavirus has fled.Nothing that any of us does, of course, can match the house in Hoolet which, come Christmas, is more brightly lit than an oil rig. On the edge of the village, its magnicent display is the best antidote to the seasonal blues anyone could prescribe.With eaves, windows and walls bedecked in luminous decorations, the house becomes a beacon, a village-wide festive greeting.The man who pins the lights in place is the roofer who does our repairs. With his extra-long ladders, he spends a day every December crawling over the slates and chimney breasts, just like a Santa Claus come early."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12084509.jpg?type=article-full","title":"royal-mail-aberdeen-trial-hydrogen-dual-fuel-van-drive-better-air-quality","story":"The trial period will help determine whether hydrogen is operationally suitable for the postal delivery services fleet.A specially converted Ford Transit will be used in Aberdeen over the next year as part of the cityrsquos drive for better air quality and more sustainable transport options.The vehicle is slightly larger than a typical Royal Mail van, potentially making it suitable to support the companyrsquos growth in parcel deliveries.Royal Mail said it will be the first time in  years that a hydrogen-powered vehicle has been introduced into its fleet, and will be used to deliver letters, cards and parcels.The van can travel up to  miles in dual fuel mode.James Baker, chief engineer and fleet director at Royal Mail, said: ldquoAs a company we are committed to making changes to our operations that reduce our environmental impact.ldquoHydrogen is viewed by many as a vital source of future sustainable energy so is a perfect addition to our programme of initiatives that enable us to assess ways of achieving this, while allowing us to continue to deliver letters and parcels safely, efficiently and responsibly.Philip Bell, Aberdeen City Councilrsquos hydrogen spokesman, said: ldquoWe are absolutely delighted to support green transport technology in our city by providing Royal Mail with a hydrogen-powered van to operate from its Altens Mail Centre in Aberdeen for an initial -month trial period.ldquoAberdeen is already a global leader in pioneering transport technologies and we at Aberdeen City Council have demonstrated our commitment to innovation by helping fund in partnership, the worldrsquos first hydrogen-powered double-decker buses.ldquoWe are determined to meet our environmental obligations by tackling air pollution while also establishing the city as lsquoCentre for Excellencersquo for hydrogen."},{"url":null,"title":"politics-watch-heat-mercury-drops","story":"ldquoVirus tiers could end in nine weeks said the headline on a story about Boris Johnson trying to head off a rebellion by his backbenchers over restrictions in England.ldquoAndrew Marrrsquos third law of journalism, declared the host, ldquois put no weight whatever on that word lsquocouldrsquo.He did not fill us in on his first and second laws, so therersquos a space to watch.With Nicola Sturgeon as the main guest, the Marr show carried on the Scottish theme by asking Sarah Smith, the BBCrsquos Scotland editor, to do the newspaper review from an eerily quiet Pacic Quay.

Not only do they have to get the words ldquonever been so certain and ldquohumility in the same sentence, they also have to balance the high wires of two dferent audiences. They know the speech will be read by lots of non-SNP members: donrsquot-knows and switherers . But the speech is ostensibly written for SNP members .:Mark Smith: Withdrawn, remote and unconnected... the future I fearIt is partly this tension that creates many of the problems the First Minister, and others in the independence movement, face whenever they open their mouths. Ms Sturgeon said the case for independence had to be made with cool heads, patient persuasion and humility, but in the same breath she said independence has never been so certain.You get a lot of this from independence supporters: Joanna Cherry said the other day that Scotland was on a highway to independence and will leave the UK at the next exit.They do this for a number of reasons. First, it is aimed at assuaging the hard core of the SNP ndash they are impatient and fidgety, and it helps to be told that independence is ndash no buts, no doubts ndash going to happen. Second, in constantly saying independence will happen, the SNP is hoping for an illusion-of-truth effect in which a statement is repeated to the point where people start to believe it. I think this may already be having an effect on some unionists, including some high up in the Conservative Party who say in private that independence is now certain to happen.Mark SmithBut there are real dangers for the SNP in all of this ndash in talking, and behaving, like something is certain to happen. Ms Sturgeon is probably aware of it ndash which may be why the word ldquohumility was bunged into the speech ndash but the politics of certainty rather than humility is still something the First Minister, and others, do with increasing frequency. There are a couple of good reasons why itrsquos the wrong thing to say.First, voters can see that certainty about Scottish independence is misplaced, partly because itrsquos based on a misinterpretation of the data. Ms Sturgeon said in her speech that support for independence has risen and become the publicrsquos sustained and majority view and she bases this presumably on the recent run of opinion polls. But, while therersquos undoubtedly been a rise in support, there is no evidence for the First Ministerrsquos statement that itrsquos the majority view. Polls showing -% support for independence are based on those who express a Yes or No view ndash the donrsquot-knows are not included and one of the things we know, surely, is that the donrsquot-knows hold the key to the result.Certainty about independence ndash in public at least ndash also risks running into another problem: the backlash, sometimes known as The Kinnock Effect. You probably remember it. Neil Kinnock thought Labour was certain to win the  election. He held a big rally and punched the air and yelled ldquoall right!. and then Labour lost the election. Kinnock himself later recognised there was probably a backlash. ldquoInstead of modest competence hellip we had everything but the Tredegar male voice choir singing. It may have cost him the election.:Independence: Federalism: The problem with Gordon Brownrsquos plan to save the UnionThe same sort of problem exists for the SNP, which is why,you listen carefully, you can hear the sound of strain and contradiction in Ms Sturgeonrsquos speech. Including the word ldquohumility is an attempt to address the contradiction itrsquos probably also why she called on her party to ldquoreach out ndash to all of Scotland ndash like never before. But itrsquos not an easy problem to resolve ndash the First Minister is caught in the certainty and humility trap.Perhaps the answer is for Ms Sturgeon to actually display some of the qualities she espoused in her address to the conference. She said in the speech that itrsquos people who live in Scotland who are best placed to harness the countryrsquos resources, but why doesnrsquot she have the humility to acknowledge Scotland needs to share its decision-making with other countries   Even after a Yes vote, Scotland would have constitutional independence, but not independence in any total sense: our ability to be autonomous would be limited just as it is for every other nation in the world, including the UK after Brexit, and, whatrsquos more, we would cede sovereignty for the good of the nation.The First Minister should also try to do something  that she mentioned in her speech, and engage much more in the politics of persuasion rather than the politics of certainties . ldquoAn independent future lies ahead, she said. She cannot know this: an independent future may lie ahead, it may not. It is not humble to say that you know the future.I appreciate, of course, that the First Minister says stuff like this because shersquos got that high-wire problem of addressing the two audiences ndash SNP members and voters in general. But thatrsquos her problem, not ours.To bring Scottish independence about, and avoid a backlash against her nationalist certainties, she actually has to do what she is calling on her party members to do. Persuade voters that independence is a good idea. Acknowledge the real situation that the country is ided on the subject.

Sorry Graham, didnrsquot realise my increased propensity to cry at First Dates was more disgusting than your bowel movements.If we donrsquot chat about periods, the shame surrounding them persists. For some people who menstruate, this feeling isnrsquot rooted in the biological process but in believing yourself to be a failure for struggling to cope with the symptoms.

The average sufferer takes eight years to be diagnosed because their physical symptoms are downplayed or dismissed by GPs.A doctor once told me, during a scan of my stomach, it ldquolooked like I ldquomay have endometriosis lesions, but she didnrsquot follow that up by organising a laparoscopy , which is the only way it can be definitively diagnosed.

Charitably corrected on his attempts to conflate dferent episodes around \"revelations\" relating to the activities of her predecessor as First Minister, Marr was also kindly advised to examine cumulative coronavirus morbidities and \"excess deaths\" across the United Kingdom rather than focus on selections of NRS and ONS data over a limited period to compare the \"Covid- performances\" in Scotland and England .As with comparisons of care home deaths, it has been known for some time, and been the subject of a number of independent reports, that coronavirus deaths in England have been persistently under-reportedwith coronavirus generally not mentioned on the death certicate unless there was \"proof\" it was a factor while in Scotland coronavirus is recordedpresumed or suspected to be a factor in a death. Either Andrew Marr was not aware that the presentation of figures he robustly highlighted was akin to comparing apples and oranges , or he, like some others at the BBC who somewhat disingenuously portray themselves as \"Scots\", are no longer embarrassed that they seem to have sold their souls for English gold.Stan Grodynski, Longniddry.I WATCHED Nicola Sturgeon being interviewed by Andrew Marr on Sunday morning. She indicated that in her view, doing well in the forthcoming Scottish elections would give her a mandate for another independence referendum. However, when questioned by Marr about her appalling record on education and many other areas, she said the people of Scotland would have their say at those same elections.And that is the problem. If you support independence you must vote for her, evenyou would have wished to call her out for her abysmal record in government. Because around half of the country wants independence, so will vote for her no matter what, shes getting away with sheer incompetence.Scott Macintosh, Killearn.IT would appear Andrew Marr has at last discovered the reason for Nicola Sturgeons popularity and apparent rise in support for the SNP. He stated on his show: \"It seems to me that there is a gap between presentation, very, very good presentation and the reality. When it comes to coronavirus data, when it comes to education, when it comes to the Alex Salmond issue, there is a gap between how you present yourself, very, very effectively, and whats really been going on in Scotland.\"It seems so many people are taken in with her daily bluster but fail to admit that, as a prominent Scottish businessman recently stated about the SNP, \"everything they touch is a mess\". Ms Sturgeon appeared visibly rattled and uncomfortable at the sort of grilling she should be subjected to more often ndash well done Mr Marr.By May, the people of Scotland will have been well reminded of this regimes substantial shortcomings and any talk of a isive referendum will have gone.Douglas Cowe, Newmachar.AT a time when we are still struggling with a serious worldwide pandemic, and people in Scotland are still dying from Covid in signicant numbers, it is utterly reprehensible that Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP are devoting time and energy to discussing and planning for a second independence referendum. Lives and livelihoods must come before the personal self-gratying objectives of these insensitive and crass politicians. They should hang their heads in shame.Ian Forbes, Glasgow G.IRRESPECTIVE of how John Swinney dresses up his pound million school meal initiative, it is nothing other than a cynical election bribe.While it is right and proper that the  per cent of Scottish children who live in poverty are protected, Mr Swinneyrsquos largesse means the remaining % of Scottish primary school children will also enjoy free breakfasts and lunches, meals which one assumes their parents are able to afford.The illogicality of Mr Swinneys thinking is illustrated by his own primary-school-aged children receiving free meals regardless of his annual pound, salary.If Mr Swinney confined his policy only to children in poverty he would save pound million, an amount enough to fund almost , extra teachers or build seven or eight brand new primary schools every year.Food for thought Alasdair Gibbons, Bearsden.MARK Smiths symbiotic relationship to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP goes on . I would politely point out some things: all political leaders talk up their prospects, few with humility or insight. Better with the polls going with you, than against, I would have thought.I would guess most people recognise modern independence is as part of a community, but Scotland has no ldquoshared-decision makingat present, and after the Internal Market Bill, we will have zero autonomy. One person from a minor political party in Scotland, appointed by a UK Government we did not elect, will have more authority in Scotland than Scotlandrsquos elected parliament. How is that fair or equitable, and how can it endure Independence would allow us to enjoy the same degree of democratic sovereignty which other self-governing countries enjoy and overthrow the increasing tyranny of rule by a despot.GR Weir, Ochiltree.THE one person in the Scottish Governmentrsquos most senior ranks who has had no accusatory finger pointed at him in connection with the Salmond judicial review fiasco is John Swinney. So, why is he now the object of parliamentary anger and charged with engaging in a cover-up It was not he but the First Minister who gave the pledge that the parliamentary inquiry would ldquobe able to request whatever material they want, and I undertake today that we will provide whatever material they request. When she made that statement did Nicola Sturgeon know that when she came to recuse herself from involvement in what material was to be supplied, she personally was off that self-created hook  A question she should be required to answer in parliament.But her words were not personal. They were from the head of a Government committing that body to meet all requests from the committee. So, step forward Mr Swinney, the poor sap now taking the heat for not complying with the formal Government commitment given by its head. Perhaps he thinks this is a far, far better thing than any he has ever done, to have his reputation ruined in order to protect his leader, who either did not know what she was doing when making the commitment, or was engaged in an act of pure cynicism.Jim Sillars, Edinburgh EH.Read more: Letters: The real separatists are those who are taking us out of Europe"},{"url":null,"title":"former-labour-mp-tom-harris-tells-party-write-off-holyrood-poll-says-leonard-a-busted-flush","story":"Tom Harris, who lost his Glasgow South seat in the  general election, said a change in leadership of the party would not make a dference to its chances in May .Speaking in an online  discussion about the constitution, he also said that the SNP would never accept a lsquonorsquo vote in any independence referendum, and would demand a thirda second poll failed.Read more:Labours Richard Leonard launches petition for Margaret Ferriers resignationAsked by The Herald about Scottish Labourrsquos chances next year, Mr Harris said: ldquoI dont think it makes an awful lot of dference now about who leads Scottish Labour, I think theyre going to have to write off May, , whoever leads them.He described the current leader Richard Leonard as ldquoa decent man who was never really a Corbynite but said he was ldquonow seen as a busted flush.Mr Harris explained: ldquoI think the public tends to make a judgment of political leaders, and once theyve made that judgment, they tend not to change their mind.ldquoWhether fairly or unfairly, I think people have made their minds up about Richard.ldquoSo the question is, would his replacement by anyone, say Anas Sarwar or Jenny Marra make a dference  At the margins, perhaps.\"But I thinkScottish Labour is to recover in the longer term, it is not going to emerge in May, its going to be well beyond that.Mr Harris added that the party did ldquoneed a new leader and its always better to replace a failing leader earlier than later but explained: ldquoI dont think its going to have an awful lot of effect before May.ldquoApart from anything , people are just talking about Covid so its dficult to get traction on health, transport, the economy, whatever when something like this is going on.Read more:Leonard lsquowinning battle of ideasrsquo as Scottish Labour civil war continuesThe former MP, who headed up the Scottish arm of the pro-Brexit Vote Leave campaign, also addressed the issue of Scottish independence and said it would be ldquoabsurd to claim that independence is definitely not going to happen and acknowledged that there had been a rise in support for it in the wake of the Brexit vote.He said: ldquoI can accept there has been an undeniable increase in support for independence since June , maybe by five or six pointshellip Devolution itself has been a far greater boost for the nationalists.ldquoIt would be absurd, blinkered, to claim independence is definitely not going to happen.

But sometimes we are maybe not as vocal as we should be in promoting this success.“That is why the Hall of Fame has been initiated — it is an opportunity for those who have dedicated their lives to receive the recognition and credit they deserve.”Describing how the process will work, Ms Johnson said the first step must come from the public in nominating a deserving inidual.This can be anyone — living or deceased — from any sport, and it is expected that those who are nominated will have contributed signicantly to their chosen sport.In terms of athletes, they must have represented Orkney or equivalent in a team or as an inidual, and they must have retired or completed their highest level of competition.In exceptional circumstances, where a performance of outstanding athletic achievement warrants special recognition, consideration will be given to those who are still competing at the highest level.With nominees from an earlier era, who perhaps had limited opportunity to compete at an elite level, the opinions of sporting peers, clubs and associations will be sought.To be eligible for selection as a volunteer, a signicant period of service, and the contribution of administrators, coaches, managers and those in supporting roles, including technical officials and referees, will be recognised.Those who have also played a role in sport’s legacy, such as authors and photographers, will also be considered.“The sporting world here in Orkney is rich and ied,” said Ms Johnson. “And the Hall of Fame is open to every single eligible candidate, regardless of the sport or sports they are, or were, invested in.“So, whether it is in the swimming pool, on the football pitch, playing rugby, or out on the golf course, we want to hear from the people of Orkney as to who should be the first inductees into the Orkney Hall of Fame.“Our athletes dedicate themselves to their sport, becoming inspirations and positive role models, and it is only right that we promote these athletes whose achievements set themselves apart from the rest.“But, as with any sustainable sporting environment, we must also pay tribute to the contributions of those who ensure sport takes place in the first place — whose dedication and commitment has been integral to the development of sport within the county.“I urge the Orkney people to help us shine a light on these people, and submit our short nomination forms.”Nominations will be open until Friday, December , .Successful Hall of Fame nominees will be announced at a virtual awards evening on Friday, January , .Nomination forms for Orkney’s Sporting Hall of Fame can be downloaded here by email: leisure.culture@orkney.gov.uk or by telephone:, extension .copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Those receiving two negative results will be encouraged to safelyhome as soon as is practical after the second result.If either of the lateral flow tests s a positive result, the student will be asked to self-isolate and undertake a confirmatory polymerase chain reactiontest through the usual NHS Test  Protect channels.Colleges and universities will have specic information for students on the care and support that will be available for those who are either not ing home, or who are having to self-isolate.Minister for further and higher education Richard Lochhead said: “Our priority is to ensure that students who wish to go home at the end of term can do so while keeping themselves, their families, friends and communities safe.“We are asking that students continue living at their term-time accommodation for now and minimise any opportunity to pick up the virus by limiting themselves to only essential reasons to mix with others.“Voluntary testing will also be available from next Monday. This is part of a huge UK-wide effort by colleges and universities to test asymptomatic students before they leave their term-time accommodation.“I want to thank all students for their tremendous resilience and patience this academic year and I know that they will continue to do all they can to stay safe and ensure a happy reunion with their loved ones.”Professor Gerry McCormac, convener of Universities Scotland, said: #Students who intend tohome this Christmas should take the test for people without symptoms as soon as possible.#The test is quick and free and the results are available fast. The tests are a helpful extra step to take to keep your family and friends and the wider community safe from COVID- this Christmas.#A double negative result will give you more confidence to travel home but it doesn’t change the need to practise personal safety measures wear a face covering, avoid crowds, keep two metres distance and wash your hands regularly to minimise your risk.#This has been a challenging term for students and I want to thank them for their continued vigilance against the virus. I also want to put on record my thanks and admiration for the staff involved in making these testing centres a reality as well as those who will be working in them.#To have these testing centres open so quickly is a testament to our dedicated staff as well as the partnership approach across colleges and universities to ensure that as many students  as possible get tested.#Updated guidance has now been published on the Scottish Government website for students on minimising social contact, testing and end of term travel — whether to other parts of Scotland, the UK or the world.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

But I know that for families struggling now, February is still a long way off.“So I am announcing a £ million package to bridge that gap, and help others struggling most with the impact of COVID over the winter months.“It will include money to help people pay their fuel bills and make sure children don’t go hungry.“It will offer additional help for the homeless, and fund an initiative to get older people online and connected.“And, most importantly of all, it will provide a cash grant of £ for every family with children in receipt of free school meals.“The money will be paid before Christmas and families can use it for whatever will help them through the winter. That could be food, new shoes or a winter coat for the kids.“Families will know best what they need. That’s not for government to decide.“Initiatives like this are not just about providing practical help to those who need it most — they are an expression of our values and of the kind of country we are seeking to build.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

NPower, which also owns E.On, did not sign upIt also includes some of the biggest so-called challenger energy companies, including Octopus, Ovo and Bulb.They only represent a quarter of energy supply companies, but have a market share of around %. Other suppliers are invited to join, Energy UK said.The acting chief executive of Citizens Advice Alistair Cromwell said: ldquoItrsquos great to see energy suppliers committing to improving services for people in vulnerable circumstances, especially at a time when many households will need support more than ever.ldquoEvery day we help people who canrsquot get through to their supplier, are having problems with their bills or problems topping up their pre-payment meter.ldquoThis commitment will play a signicant role in making these problems a thing of the past. Itrsquos right that we recognise this in our star rating and hope more suppliers will be encouraged to sign-up.Other commitments include appointing a champion on the board who is responsible for meeting the other targets, training frontline call centre staff to better identy vulnerable callers, getting feedback from customers onbilling communications are understandable, and performing regular customer research.Ed Dodman, the director of regulatory affairs at the Energy Ombudsman, said that the trade body ldquodeserves praise for the new work.He said: ldquoWe know from the complaints we handle that complicated and hard-to-understand bills are a real source of frustration for customers, including those in vulnerable circumstances, and can lead to a breakdown in trust between customer and supplier. Itrsquos therefore encouraging to see suppliers signing up to improvements in this area.copy -. This site is part of Newsquests audited local newspaper network. A Gannett Company.

Men were more likely to say they were bored .Women were also more likely to have felt worn out by the pandemic .Around one in six said theyrsquore being more careful , while a similar proportionsaid less careful.Over the course of the pandemic, almost three-quartershave felt disappointed by people not following recommended measures in public.Professor Bobby Duffy, director of KCLrsquos Policy Institute, said the public has been ldquoremarkably resilient, with the majority saying they are following restrictions carefully during the second lockdown.He continued: ldquoBut this isnrsquot everyonersquos experience: one in six say theyrsquore not being as careful in obeying the rules, and one in four have found it tougher to follow them this time.ldquoSocial isolation and a feeling of being worn out by the crisis are drivers of this, but so too is the official response to the pandemic.ldquoA third of those who have found the latest rules more of a struggle say itrsquos because they feel the restrictions have not been applied fairly, and the same proportion cite reduced trust in official advice as a reason.ldquoAs we come out of this national lockdown and enter a new tiered system, the Government must rebuild confidence in its approach and clearly communicate what it is doing and why.Separate polling suggests that almost halfof Britons think le will be back to normal within a year, following positive vaccine announcements.Just over halfsay it has made a positive dference to how optimistic they feel, the Ipsos MORI survey of , adults found.But it suggests signicant numbers are unsure whether they would take the vaccine.Some % said that they definitely or probably would take it, with older people more likely to say they would get vaccinated.Kelly Beaver, managing director of public affairs at Ipsos MORI, said: ldquoWith over a fth of Brits either not sure or leaning towards not taking a vaccine, there is a greater need than ever for clear communications from Government, targeted at convincing those waverers of the importance of this step in fighting Covid-.copy -.

While he waited, he took a job labouring with pick and shovel on Harris’s ‘Golden Road’.After graduation he worked in Ayrshire for five years, and then ed to Harris in his late s – as the only unmarried child – to look after his mother who had taken ill.When she recovered, he accepted a position with the Highlands and Islands Veterinary Scheme, run by the government for vets working in crofting areas.Not long after he arrived on Skye he met Morag, also from Harris, who was working as a domestic science teacher at Broadford school.They married in  and then seven years later they moved to a croft at Old Corry, allowing Donald John to get some of his own livestock.He was an active crofter himself, keeping cattle and as a member with the local sheep stock club — and his involvement would continue long after his official retirement in .Known for his wealth of stories and knowledge of a broad range of subjects, Donald John was a popular speaker for Burns suppers, and in  his family honoured him with a special th birthday celebrations.In  he received an MBE for services to the community.On the Skye and Lochalsh Memories Facebook page this week, hundreds of messages were left in tribute.“His love of animals was only matched surely by his kindness and consideration to his fellow humans.”Lochalsh councillor Biz Campbell added: “One of the finest Highland gentlemen I have ever met. You have left us all with wonderful memories. Your knowledge as a vet was unparalleled. We could telephone any time of the day or night and be assured we were getting the best advice possible. Deepest sympathy to the family.”Respects were paid along the roadside as the hearse made its way through Broadford on Monday afternoon.Donald John, whose we Morag died in , is survived by sons Neil and Norrie and by four grandchildren.

Another would involve a change to soft drink sales.She added: “We have a drinks chiller at the front but were looking at introducing a bar restaurant-style system where fizzy drinks come from mixer taps.“If we could get something like that, we would be saving not just on bottles but also the water used for these which is transported around the country and is another waste.“That is quite a big investment, though, so I wouldn’t be able to consider that without a grant.”Zero Waste Scotland has said it will administer a total of £, in grant funding provided by the Scottish Government and European Regional Development Fund to empower island shops to take the next steps in the war on waste by ditching single-use packaging and moving to reusable options.It says that the new scheme would see cash made available to existing small and medium-sized enterprises in the isles to make the transition to package free dispensers.“My shop is so small, it is not just about fitting in the new stuff but also about moving everything  around so I don’t lose the things that I sell which enables me to pay staff and support the local community,” she said.“We have tried to do what we can within our budget. We do glass milk bottles for people, we have dispensing units for refills for washing up liquid and laundry liquid.“There are things that I have looked at that we can do, and sothey had just given us that money I applied for then I would have been really happy!”The scheme opened on th October, but Nancy stressed that wasn’t a great deal of time for small business owners like her.“It sounds like a lot of time but when you are running a shop it isn’t very long. We had to get three dferent quotes for some of these things,” she said.“I’m in the shop five and a half days a week — and my afternoons off have been spent on the phone and the internet scoping out possible projects. I don’t really have the extra time it takes to do it.”She added: “If I can’t come out with a scheme then we don#t get anything is my understanding at the moment.“I know it is worth putting a bit of effort in, though, becauseit does work I can really make a dference to the shop and the environment.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/kate-forbes.jpg","title":"summit on future of gaelic as a community","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe summit on Tuesday st December, pm, will be co-chaired by Kate Forbes, constituency MSP for Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch.

There are still plenty of people in Skye and Raasay with Gaelic, and it can still be heard throughout the island.“Urgent work is required to save Gaelic, but as a living language it won’t be politicians, bureaucracy or tokenistic gestures that make the dference. Ultimately, it will be those people for whom it is the language of daily le that can reverse the decline.“I hope this summit will be a fruitful exercise in doing that.”Councillor Munro said: “It’s extremely important that Gaelic communities in Skye and Raasay have an opportunity to have their voices heard. The recent research by Soillse clearly sets out the challenges facing Gaelic in terms of usage and transmission.“Now is the time to consult with communities and to set the agenda for language policy and planning efforts.

That just cant happen at the moment for obvious reasons and that is somewhat worrying because new faces are literally the leblood which keeps bands going.At this time of year youd be seeing new youngsters coming in to learn how to play. “poundBands need practice in the winter period to get everyone up to scratch, especially the newcomers. Despite Covid, some local bands did manage to mount socially distanced parades around the th period and others played in open spaces such as King George Park in Harryville for the Derry Day At Home festival.The local bands can hold their heads high in that respect, says Rodney. They followed all the protocols and brought the traditional culture to their communities, lting spirits at an otherwise gloomy time.Rodney now hopes that covid restrictions will have a major impact on the R number so that players can get back to their practice nights. was a bleak year for our local bands so we are all hoping that next year will be back to normal and our bands will be wanting to show off their musicianship to best effect, he says.

They receive pound. million from government, leaving a shortfall of pound. million to be found every year.In recent weeks Chris and Mary Selwood from Ballymena who run the very successful Belfast Property Meet and Stephen and Marie Reynolds proprietors of the award winning Front Page Bar, Ballymena have teamed up to help. Over the years they have been huge supporters of N.I.C. Hospice and have raised thousands of pounds for the charity. Together they came up with the idea of organising an “online, virtual concert” entitled “Northern Ireland’s Big Night In ” to help raise much needed financial support for the Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice.The evening of music, comedy, song and dance takes place on Friday December  from pm and will be broadcast live on Facebook  YouTube. The event, similar in format to Children in Need but on a more local level, is hosted by Jackie Fullerton MBE and BBC presenter Claire McCollum. To date they have confirmed performances from Shane Lynch,with his new band Boyz On Block, singer songwriter Phil Coulter, The Irish Rovers from Canada, West End performer Peter Corry, local band Pure Blarney, world pipe band champions Field Marshall Montgomery, stage and television comedians William Caulfield and Tim Mc Garry, lead dancer with Riverdance Lauren Smyth, X Factor finalist Andrea Magee and a host of others. Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice, based at Horizon House, Newtownabbey is the only service of its kind in Northern Ireland and looks after over  families a year.  But what exactly does that mean  It means thatyou have a child that has a le limiting condition, then the N. Ireland Children’s Hospice can help you with specialist care, not only for the child, but also for the entire family.  Imagine receiving the news that your child has a rare or complex health condition, while that news in itself is a terrible emotional blow, a parent may also have to worry about managing their child’s care, sorting out medications, dealing with numerous hospital visits, living with sleepless nights and the continual worry about infection or signs that their condition is worsening—as well as often still being a parent to other children in the family.For many children and parents across our community, the N. Ireland Children’s Hospice is a leline -.somewhere they can turn for help when they need it, where there will always be someone to listen and care for those very ill children when things are tough. Care is provided not only in Horizon House but in many families homes across Northern Ireland as well. Producer for the event is Alan Kirk from Ark Media who has recently worked with Shane Lynchand the guys at Boyz on BlockChris said: “It’s going to be a very exciting night and all we need everyone to do is tune into “Northern Ireland’s Big Night In ” on Friday th December at pm and enjoy all the wonderful entertainment provided.

Everyone is in it to win it. Both sides of the border have had a very tough year. Everyone is looking to catch up, and make up some of their losses.Letterkenny Chamber of Commerce CEO Toni Forrester told the BBC#s Sunday Politics programme that they are not targeting Northern Ireland#s shoppers when it comes to advertising.We aren#t running campaigns in Northern Ireland to attract people in to shop, she said. We#re keeping our advertising very much local.President of Dundalk Chamber of Commerce Sean Farrell, who is also the manager of The Marshes shopping centre, said he expects to lose two thirds of the usual quota of Northern Irish shoppers when the shops reopen.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseDundalk Chamber of Commerce CEO Sean Farrell FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappDundalk Chamber of Commerce CEO Sean Farrell I#m sure our northern customers will respect the travel restrictions in place, he said.When retail was open in Northern Ireland and closed in the south there wasn#t a massive influx of southern based customers going to the north.He is worried about losing Northern Ireland shoppers.Between  and % of our customers are coming from across the border, he said. I expect that to fall to two or % this week.He added: I won#t be telling Northern Ireland shoppers to stay away. Northern Ireland was open for retail when we were closed. Now we#re reopening and Northern Ireland is closed. The approach is all wrong.It should be an island of Ireland approach and both governments should work together so as not to encourage people to cross the border and further the spread of Covid-.

There was a time earlier this year when many of us thought this could become a very dficult issue for the Government.“I have to say the minister and his entire department have done a fantastic job in listening, not just to this side of the House but the other and making sure that the points that we raised have been addressed.”Labour’s shadow culture secretary Jo Stevens said action to remove high-risk vendors from the UK’s telecoms networks must go hand in hand with measures to ersy the supply chain.She said: “Let’s be frank, until this year the Government had failed to face reality.“We will not oppose the second reading of this Bill, but we have many concerns which will need to be considered and addressed at committee stage because the Bill this House eventually passes must take steps to ensure that our telecoms supply chain is resilient in the future or we’ll be forced tohere again in a short time to deal with the next Huawei.“We must be mindful as with all legislation that we seek to anticipate the problems of the future rather than just deal with the issue we face today. We, of course, fully support steps to remove high-risk vendors from the network, but they absolutely must go hand in hand with credible measures to ersy the supply chain.”The Bill will force the removal of all Huawei equipment from G networks by  and create national security powers capable of imposing controls on when –at all – a telecoms firm could use material supplied by companies such as Huawei.The Government has published a G Supply Chain Diversication Strategy to ensure the UK is “never again dependent on a handful of telecoms vendors”.Under the legislation, security protocols around UK networks will also be strengthened with fines – of % of turnover or £, a day – for those who do not meet the new standards.Communications regulator Ofcom is to be tasked with the monitoring and assessing of security protocols among telecoms providers.PAMost ReadNorthern Ireland#s Hollywood Hills: Millionaire pumps entire fortune into row of dream homes near BangorCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Schools won#t close early for Christmas, vows Weir as  deaths and  new cases confirmedDublin dodge: Travellers flying into Republic swerving Northern Ireland#s strict Covid- quarantine rulesHe should know better, says Narrow Water survivor over Sinn Fein TD#s tweet hailing IRA ambushShock as we of Glentoran legend Scott Young dies suddenly,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The Derry News recently uncovered information which categorises the local reservoirs as ‘high risk’. A flood inundation map shows that in the event of reservoir failure, areas as far away as the Strand Road and Buncrana Road would be impacted. At present it is known that the flood risk associated with the reservoirs will affect developments at Fort George, a community centre and social housing in the Glen area, the A Buncrana Road and possible Magee expansion on the Duncreggan Road. googletag.cmd.push In addition, private development at the former Arntz Belting site falls within the flood inundation zone. Reservoirs are rated either low, medium or high which determines the level of management required and by extension long-term maintenance costs. Legislation requires a poundm programme of works to be carried out before planning permission is granted at several high-profile sites in the city. Council leases the site to Creggan Country Park. Under current guidelines the financial burden would fall on not-for-profit organisation Creggan Country Park Enterprises as the designated manager of the site. But Sinn Feacutein MLA Martina Anderson now says that a paper will be presented to councillors next month proposing that the council assumes the role of site manager. googletag.cmd.push In a statement yesterday a council spokesperson said that along with relevant government departments it is looking at ‘a range of options’in relation to the management and maintenance of Creggan Reservoir. JOINT FUNDING Sinn Feacutein MLA for Foyle, Martina Anderson, has spoken in light of further discussions between her party, Derry City  Strabane District Council and government departments. She expects ‘imminent progress’ to be made on the management of the reservoir and is urging the Department for Infrastructureand the local council to progress ‘vital safety works’ at the reservoir. MartinaAnderson said: To remove existing DfI planning objections for Fort George and the new Glenview Community Centre, there is a need for structural works to be carried out to the Creggan reservoir and for the council to adopt the management of the site.     “I expect a report to be presented to a council committee in the coming weeks whichpassed will see the council adopt the management of the reservoir. “The council are a strategic partner in the development of the new Glenview Community Centre and the A, Magee expansion and Fort George developments are all key elements of the councils Strategic Growth Plan for the city and district. “Therefore, it makes absolute sense that councillors would support the proposal. “Regarding the required structural works at the Reservoir, the ultimate responsibility for Reservoirs resides with the DfI and the Minister should not abdicate her responsibility by refusing to support any application submitted for funding. “I am calling on her department officials to continue to engage with the council to finalise a joint funding package for the works as soon as possible. “I will also not hesitate to lobby Sinn Feacutein ministers to assist the projectrequired. “I will not allow a situation to develop where so many key projects are jeopardised given the major economic, infrastructural and community benefits they will bring to the entire city. SDLP MLA Sinead McLaughlin said she is ‘very pleased’ that progress is being made regarding the flooding concerns relating to the Creggan Reservoirs. “I have been actively involved in the resolution of this since June and have instigated action by the council, including a paper going to a council committee. “The proposal to be considered by councillors for the council to take management responsibility for the repair and remediation of the reservoirs is sensible and consistent with the demands I have put to the council, along with SDLP councillor colleagues. It is essential that we make urgent progress in terms of reservoir safety and assurance, not only so that Fort George and other signature projects obtain planning approval, but also to protect residents and property in Derry given the assessed flooding risk.   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Lynn and Philip Hasson had arranged to get married in Donegals Redcastle Hotel in May, but the coronavirus outbreak halted their plans. The big day was rescheduled for November. However, as the date grew closer they were advised to move the celebrations to October in case lockdown restrictions got tighter again. When the ban on unnecessary cross-border travel came into force in early autumn, the couple were told they couldnt get married in the Republic. Undeterred, they rebooked their wedding at Derrys Beech Hill Country House in Ardmore at the end last month. googletag.cmd.push But on Wednesday, October , they got a call to say they would have to get married three days later, Saturday, October , before fresh lockdown measures came into play. After confirming that her son, Matthew, and his partner could make the wedding, Lynn gave it the go ahead. It was a bit crazy, I was working until .pm on the Thursday so we didnt have much time to pull it together, said Lynn, who is a support worker with Praxis Care. A host of Derry businesses pulled out all the stops to make sure the wedding could go ahead early and Lynn and Philip finally made it down the aisle. googletag.cmd.push We both have big families and lots of friends and we didnt want to leave anyone out so our initial wedding was for  people and ended up being for just  - including the bride and groom. In the end we only had close family and a few friends and they couldnt even bring their partners, but that was just the way it had to happen. There were a few people that couldnt come because they were isolating which was a pity.  Thankfully, Lynns two sons and Philips four children were able to attend. In the end it was very intimate and I stood back and looked and it was all the people that are closest to us which was lovely, said Lynn.     I was starting to think I was jinxed and in the run up to the wedding I was very nervous, but that day around lunch time all of a sudden I felt so, so relaxed. It was a brilliant day. And Lynn isnt resentful that she missed out on her big day As long as no one is sick then anything  is fixable, she said. I wouldnt want to be one of those families waiting on a phone call from the hospital. Lynn and Philp thanked everyone who made their last minute nuptials such a success. Wed like to say a special thank you to Aisling and Michael at the Redcastle who were excellent and gave us a full refund. To Jenny and James at the Beech Hill Country House for making everything run so smoothly and to Lisdale Signature Cars, Funky Cakes, Sass and Halo for the flowers, Natalie Doherty for the photography, Erin Gilroy for the make-up and Charlene Ferguson for the hair. And to my friend Anne Marie Boyle who did the balloons and decorations- she was my rock,” added the new bride.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Essentially, the reason for this dichotomy boils down to nationalists wanting a United Ireland and unionists wanting to stay within the United Kingdom. Back in , Northern Ireland’s population split was roughly % Catholic and % Protestant. Nearly a century later official statistics show a very dferent demographic. Catholic pupils, from nursery school through to sixth form, for example, now amount to % of all pupils enrolled in Northern Ireland schools and colleges. This changing picture could be perceived to blow wind into the sails of those advocating Irish unity. googletag.cmd.push However, before anyone loses the run of themselves, a component woven into the  Good Friday Agreement described as an un-intended outcome cannot be dismissed. A new identity called ‘Northern Irish’ emerged from the Good Friday Agreement, which for the first time in the history of these islands permits people born in Northern Ireland to choosethey want to be British, Irish or both. Something  that can’t be dismissed is the changing attitudes amongst those born into emerging peace. The young appear to be rejecting rigid national and religious identities. It would, therefore, appear the old assumption that all Catholics support re-unication and all Protestants support the Union no longer holds water. googletag.cmd.push This evolving mind-set is borne out by a recent LUCID TALK poll, which found % of Sinn Fein voters and % of SDLP voters would vote for a united Ireland while % of DUP and % of Ulster Unionist voters would vote to remain in the UK. Analysis of these October  statistics entitle the pollsters to comment: ‘neither those advocating Irish Unity or those advocating the status quo had anything close to a majority.’ While accepting opinion polls are never an exact science and, on occasions, can be all over the place they still serve, to some degree, as a barometer for public mood.     Moreover, by observing prevailing demographic trends in tandem with the results of ious polls, it must to be reasonable to assert a united Ireland in the near future is anything but a done deal. But, despite having access to all the pollsters predictions and awareness of a very dferent population structure, one side looks asit’s in a hurry to alter the constitutional landscape of Northern Ireland while the other side seems content to bury its head in the sand. Nationalists want to talk about little  while unionists prefer not even to mention the elephant in the room. Neither position, to be fair, is either acceptable or desirable and could, in the end, serve to weaken the ability of a devolved administration in Northern Ireland to mature. More now than ever, both traditions should be working as partners to make Northern Ireland the kind of place that makes le on earth worth living the kind of place that enables people to grow in hope and build a better future, regardless of their creed or culture. The hard-won peace, in place since , represents a sweeter music that is superior to the discords of ision. That being so, nothing should be hastily brought forward that risks putting our widely celebrated peace process in jeopardy. Change is often a slow fuse. So why rush  The quick fix, the short-cut, the on-the-spot-solution could, in the long run, turn out to be detrimental. Choosing to take the time to appeal to the nature of our better angels would, according to Charles Dickens, point out how the shadow of our own desires can eclipse the brightness of our better angels and this could adversely affect future outcomes. Beyond all reasonable doubt, there is a need for both the Orange and the Green to go beyond what comes easily and to live in a way that’s more enlightened. Dr King, in his letter from Birmingham jail, reminds us how we don’t walk the journey of le alone. None of us is an island we are all part of something bigger, which means there should, at all times, be a unity of purpose and a willingness to work for the greater good of all without fear or favour. French philosopher Albert Camus got it so right when he said: ‘Don’t walk in front of me I may not follow. Don’t walk behind me I may not lead. Just walk beside me and be my friend.’ This ought to be the aspiration of every Member of the Legislative Assemblyat Stormont. Showing to themselves, the electorate and the world their determination to progressively build bridges of co-operation and friendship across frontiers of memory, grief and pain. At some point in the future, when it becomes clear that a mandatory coalition of erse political figures are selflessly committed to making government ‘work’ for everybody in the Six Counties, regardless of where they live, how they pray or who they love. Then, and only then, should consideration be given to cautiously stepping out onto a road less travelled to begin exploring potential models and possible permutations for north, south, east and west relationships.    --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Department officials are to brief county council officials and councillors in Letterkenny next week over the establishment of a direct provision centre in the town which is tohouse up to  people. The accommodation centre is to open on the Port Road in January and residents will move into the centre on a phased basis while their claims for international protection are being examined. The Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth has signed a contract with Bridgestock Care Ltd to provide accommodation for international protection applicants in  apartments at a site on the Port Road. googletag.cmd.push The department said the former student accommodation ies from two to three-bedroomed self-contained units with fully equipped kitchens, living rooms and bathrooms. In a letter to Donegal County Council, a department official said the accommodation facilitates independent living for the families, in line with national standards for accommodation centres adopted last year. The department is working “to ensure that the necessary supports are available to centre residents, with no disruption to services for the local community,” the letter said. But local councillor Michael McBride said the location is close to industrial and retail areas and has no green areas or play areas for children. googletag.cmd.push The independent councillor said there could be issues with sewerage due to the large number of people being accommodated at the former student accommodation. He also said he disagreed with sending such a large number of asylum seekers to one town and said there has been “no correspondence or liaison with the local community, local councillors and the local council”. “I think it is in the wrong place,” he said. “There is no public sewerage there. I dont knowthe sewerage there will be able to cope,” he said. He said he believes the asylum seekers should be “spread out around the countryside and be able to integrate into the community”.     “I’m not so sure that putting such a number into one town is the correct way to do it either.” He said the lack of communication from the department on the issue was “a very underhand way of doing business”. Cllr McBride said he is not against the relocation of asylum seekers. “Everyone needs a roof over their head and they are coming from a very, very dficult situation. I want to make that absolutely clear,” he said. He said he also has concerns about services such as healthcare and education. “You have to look at the long term health and welfare of the people moving in there,” he said. “For a place where there is going to be a lot of children, it is just completely unsuitable,” he said. Sinn Feacutein councillor Gerry McMonagle welcomed the news that the asylum seekers are coming to the town. “I welcome the fact that we can provide these  families with suitable and adequate accommodation. We have to remember where these families are coming from. They are coming from war-torn corners of the world. “What we need is answers from the Government on the schooling of these children - has it been arranged  Is the capacity there  Is there suitable and adequate health care for them  There needs to be a very solid support base put in place in time for these families arriving.” Two Donegal Oireachtas members have welcomed the announcement that the asylum seekers will be housed in Letterkenny. Independent TD for Donegal Thomas Pringle, and Independent senator Eileen Flynn, said they will be delighted to welcome the families in the international protection system who are coming to Letterkenny. Deputy Pringle said: “This is good news for Donegal. It’s important for the local community to rally around and help make our new neighbours feel welcome.” Senator Flynn said: “I hope people will extend the famous Irish welcome – a real ceacutead miacutele faacuteilte – to the families Letterkenny will welcome in the new year.    --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Former Glee star Damian McGinty is currently singing with globally successful group Celtic Thunder and lives in America with his we. And although he hasnt been back to Derry in a year due to the ongoing global pandemic, the city remains close to his heart and he is donating all the money from the sales of his popular calendar to St Vincent de Paul . The charity helps distressed people by visiting them in their homes and giving them money, clothing, food, fuel, furniture or electrical items. googletag.cmd.push Damian explained: Something that has been really on my mind recently, is families putting food on the table over Christmas. Covid has hurt millions, whether it be in terms of health, or financially. I think a really serious issue moving forward is going to be hunger, and it absolutely breaks my heart to think of parents lying awake at night worrying about feeding their kids the next day. It breaks my heart to think of kids going hungry, and Santa being something that is simply not on the cards. It’s not fair. As well as selling the calendar Damian asked his fans to donate what they could afford and has raised just under pound,. googletag.cmd.push This will go a long, long way, said Damian. We can make a families Christmas a little bit better, and that’s a light the world needs right now. I wanted to try and use my  to make a dference as it’s been a tough year for so many and my followers helped me do that and I want to say thanks, so, so much. Last week, Damian joined Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council, Cllr Brian Tierney, for hislatest of his Covid- video appeal. Ive been really concerned to see the number of Covid cases across Derry and Strabane in the last few months – its really worrying, and the threat hasnt gone away, he commented.     I havent been home since Christmas and for me thats been quite dficult because I have never gone that long without visiting home in my le, and I miss it a lot. I know the community back home is full of amazing people that care about each other so Im appealing to everyone to do what they can to get us back to where we were and where we will be again. Mayor Tierney said that Damian is one of many people making sacrices for the greater good. I was delighted thatDamianjoined me in this message and has shared his personal experience to show why its important that we all follow the guidelines in place. Hehasnt been able to come home and visit his family since last Christmas, which, naturally, is incredibly dficult. Its just one example of many people and businesses who are making sacrices to protect our community and keep everyone safe, so alongsideDamianI am asking that everyone makes those sacrices worthwhile by doing all they can to reduce our cases numbers and stop the spread of Covid-.

The pensioner fell in the Greenwalk area of Creggan on Friday evening. Local people and family members who came to her aid did not want to move her, so they tried to keep her warm and dry after calling for an ambulance. However, local independent councillor Gary Donnelly said it took two hours for ambulance to arrive. Cllr Donnelly described the scene as shocking. He added that residents in Greenwalk have been trying to get improved street lighting for years but without success. googletag.cmd.push The family of the local woman said she suffered a broken shoulder in the fall. After being contacted by the Derry News, a NIAS spokesperson apologised for how Fridays call-out had been handled. “We apologise for any distress or discomfort suffered as a result of her prolonged wait for an ambulance,” the spokesperson said. “NIAS seeks to provide the quickest possible response to meet the clinical needs of any patient who contacts us as a result of having suffered illness or injury. “However, regrettably some patients are currently waiting longer than we would wish due to the demand for our service and the impact of the Covid- pandemic on our staffing levels.” googletag.cmd.push The NIAS spokesperson said the call in relation to the Creggan incident was received at .pm on Friday. “Based on information passed to ambulance control, it was prioritised as a Category  call with a performance target of  minutes. “A crew did not arrive at this scene until : which was  minutes outside of the target response. “NIAS recognises the distress and discomfort a wait of over two hours for an ambulance is to an elderly patient who is lying in the cold and wet, or to those who are caring for her at that time. “The delay in this case was as a result of crews in the area responding to calls which were more pressing in terms of clinical need.     “NIAS regrets that the patient had to endure this delay and once again offers a sincere apology. “We would have liked to have provided a more immediate response, particular given the age of the patient and the conditions in which she had to wait.” The NIAS spokesperson said they receive more than  calls each day through the  system. “To enable us to target our resources to those whose clinical condition is most urgent, each call is triaged and categorised accordingly. “Against each of the categories is a performance target for response times which NIAS aims to deliver. “Category  calls are those calls which are immediately or potentially le-threatening and to which NIAS seeks to despatch an immediate response with an average performance target of  minutes.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Thats because I had no training. It was tough because it happened to us on a few occasions, against Shamrock Rovers and then Sligo. We were quarantining for basically a month.”There have been so many What   moments for Derry City this season, and despite the seventh place finish in the Premier Division, Akintunde strongly believes that European qualication should have been Derrys, only for key moments in games to go against them.“Its definitely been a tough year,” he agreed.“We have underachieved and we could have done so much better. The boys are great and the manager and the staff were great. It was just one of those seasons where it was the fine lines. There were games we could have won and we let them slip.“If you look at Bohs when they got two goals in the last minute and when we played Sligo away they beat us -, but just before their goal we had a chance to score. Its just the fine lines. Those two games there, thats six points, but there are other games as well.“This season has been painful, because its just those little details in those games and we could really have achieved so much more.” googletag.cmd.push Future talksAkintunde is now a free agent but he has not ruled out ato Derry City in . The striker will meet with City boss Declan Devine in the coming days, after which his future will be much clearer, but whatever happens, he believes in normal circumstances in a normal season, he would have had a much bigger impact at the club.“I came in mid-season and I got a few goals,” he reflected. “I feel I could have got a few more. My contract is up now at Derry but I still have to talk to the gaffer. Im not sure whats going on for now so Ill just wait and see. I did half a season so it would be nice to do a full season fully fit, but Ill have a chat with the gaffer and just take it from there.” googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The old windmill stump will also be preserved as part of the new project.According to those behind the proposal, the location is an ideal site for a new park, explaining that itrsquos their intention to provide a ldquofirst-class outdoor community asset for local people of all ages and backgrounds, with the focus on community heritage, where residents can exercise and relax in the outdoors.Development Association chairman, Martyn Todd, is delighted with the recent decision to grant access to site of the planned heritage park.ldquoThe decision by Newry, Mourne and Down Council to allow access to the field is one more hurdle overcome for our plan to provide a much-needed neutral space in the fresh air for the residents of Saintfield, he said.ldquoWe would like to thank our Rowallane councillors for their unwavering support on this issue, together with support from councillors across all parties.Barbara Graham, a member of the Development Association team managing the heritage park project, who has a great deal of experience in the architectural and planning professions, is also pleased with the council decision.ldquoNow we can proceed with the preparation and submission of our planning application for the park, she said.ldquoAs part of this process, we intend to carry out an in-depth consultation with all residents to ascertain their views, suggestions and any concerns that they might have regarding the park.The Development Association has confirmed that due to restrictions imposed on gatherings due to Covid-, the team propose to consult with the public by means of electronic media, newsletter, press advertisements and leaflets, with consultation exercise stretching over  weeks.It is also hoped to display a visual representation of the proposed park design in the window of a vacant shop on the townrsquos main street.Paul McGeown, another member of the heritage park team, explained that although the park was still some way from becoming a reality, it was hoped that it will provide a recreational facility for the residents of Saintfield for generations to come.ldquoThe hard work begins now, as we have to raise the funds to implement our vision, he added.Local businessman Kevin Young is head the fundraising team which will target donor agencies, businesses and residents in the drive to raise the necessary finance.At the Development Associationrsquos recent annual meeting, several residents expressed concern about the proposal, claiming that ldquono proper consultation had been held with them about the park proposal.Further information about the project and progress updates are available at the Saintfield grouprsquos website, www.discoversaintfield..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/25th November 2020 Aromatherapy.jpg","title":"Aromatherapy wellbeing help for students  ","story":"STUDENTS at St Colmanrsquos High and Sixth Form College in Ballynahinch are being offeredaromatherapy sessions to help support and improve their wellbeing.The sessions are part of the schoolrsquos development plan and are conducted by beauty therapy teacher Miss Claire OrsquoNeill.Students are provided with the opportunity to learn about some holistic therapies and enjoy the benefits that these therapies can bring in terms of relaxation and focusing the mind positively.During these practical sessions, pupils work on each other using essential oils such as lavender, lemon, chamomile and peppermint, recognising the benefits of such oils to each inidualrsquos needs.The sessions have proved popular with many students, allowing new avenues of mindfulness to be explored..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/25th November 2020 Camogs.jpg","title":"Camogs power past Meath to set up glory bid  ","story":"DOWNrsquoS camogs are one game away from All-Ireland glory.The Red and Blacks will face Antrim in the All-Ireland Intermediate final at Kingspan Breffni Park on December .Down set up the showdown with a superb victory over  champions Meath in Clones on Saturday.Down, beaten finalists two years ago and semi-finalists last year were determined that they would not be the nearly team once more.It was a cagey affair for the most part in truth, as both teams at times looked tentative.Certainly it was not a game where the attacks flowed freely, with both sides aware of the prize at stake, and the price of playing their game too openly and expansively.However, manager Derek Dunnersquos charges did enough to break free from the nervous shackles enough at key points in the contest to ensure they would emerge with a comfortable enough six-point winning margin.The Mourne county always looked like they had another gear they could slip into,needed, and indeed they confirmed that as Niamh Mallon fired a brace of points early on in the early stages of the second half.It was in this key period that Down accelerated away. The excellent Saoirse McCartan added another score to confirm their qualication late on, when Meath were trying to build up one last head of steam.McCartan and Mallon were a constant threat to the Meath defence throughout. They interchanged positions sharply, confusing their markers along the way.Down did have the chances in the first half to have come away from the opening period with more scores than they did.They always looked in strong hands under the guidance of Fionnuala Carr, who swept everything up that came towards her full-back line when Meath did come on the hunt.Down led by - to - at half-time. In truth though, they could have been forgiven for chastising themselves that the advantage was not a little more commanding.In the second half, the Mourne county hit some poorly-executed wides from promising positions, and failed to capitalise on a couple of inviting goal opportunities. Mallon adopted a deeper role than many have been accustomed to seeing her in, but she performed admirably in it, getting plenty of possession.Fionnuala Carr was extremely effective picking up breaking ball in front of her full-back line, ensuring the dangerous Jane Dolan in the Meath ranks was starved of possession. Paula OrsquoHagan gathered a clearance quickly and ed it from  metres over the bar for another key score, followed by a pointed free.Moments later, Mallon flashed a shot just over, when a goal seemed on.

I know a lot of people try that and fail, but it worked for me, said Deirdre. I suddenly realised that the only person who could do this was me and the person who can fail is myself.However, behind Deirdrersquos successful weight loss was years of pain and unhappiness.She said that her confidence was at its lowest time when she joined her family on a family holiday in Cornwall in .A day out at an adventure park ended in tears and humiliation for the young woman who had just experienced the major loss of two missed miscarriages.She married her husband Darren the year before and quickly got pregnant just months later.ldquoI went for a scan and I was told there was no heartbeat, said Deirdre.ldquoThen I got pregnant again and while there had been a heartbeat detected in a early scan, it wasnrsquot there on the second scan.Deirdre was feeling so low when she left the hospital after her second loss that she was persuaded to go on a family holiday to cheer her up.ldquoMy family are all very active and I felt I couldnrsquot keep up as I was really heavy then, she explained.ldquoWhen they suggested going to an adventure centre, my heart just sank. I sat on the sidelines and just watched but I decided to give ziplining a go.ldquoThe guy who was running it askedhe could weigh me. As soon as he did so, he said that I was just too heavy. I was fighting back the tears in front of everyone.ldquoI was in a mood for the rest of the holidays and I was cross with everyone, including myself.

Whether the weight loss was fast or slow, I was going to keep going, said Deirdre.ldquoIrsquom very anti slimming clubs. I must have went to a slimming club about - times in my le. Every time I lost three stone but I would put it on again plus more.ldquoI realised that demonising certain foods was wrong asI would lapse by having butter on my toast, I would binge as I was annoyed at being off-plan. So nowI want butter on my toast I have it and enjoy it.Deirdre followed a high protein, low carbohydrate diet initially at around , calories a day which made her feel satisfyingly full.She said: ldquoI realised that I didnrsquot feel like I was on a diet. Diets for me used to be all or nothing andI slipped up, I would binge. But for limiting my calories, ldquoI realised I could go out to dinner but as long as I was back being sensible the next day, I still would have weight off that week.Deirdre denies herself nothing nowadays, enjoying three meals and two snacks a day and often enjoys a ready meal of - calories a day. Her treat is to have a coffee and chocolate bar in the evening once her two children are in bed.ldquoI now work out with a personal trainer at least once a week and try to do another work out or two on my own, said Deirdre. ldquoBut you can lose weight without every working out by just staying active and on your feet.Deirdre said she lost her most weight when she was keeping to around , calories a day with  grammes of protein.ldquoI think of everything in money terms, said the financial analyst. ldquoI have my bill paying calories which will keep me full and all the nutrients I need. Then you have your disposable income calories, like a glass of wine or chocolate bar that you can have fun with mdash as long as it all balances out for your calorie intake and exercise for that day.ldquoOne of the things Irsquom most proud of is that I never ped my calorie intake to lower than , a day so I was never hungry.For inspiration and fantastic lean protein meal recipes, follow Deirdre on Instagram ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/25th November 2020 From.jpg","title":"Down manager full of praise for All Ireland finalists  ","story":"DOWN manager Derek Dunne was understandably happy after he watched his charges brush Meath aside at St Tiernachrsquos Park on Saturday.The Mournewomen will now go on to play Antrim in an all-Ulster decider on December , after their neighbours cruised to a - to - triumph over Laois in Inniskeen.Down always held the upper hand, showing real grit and an outstanding work rate against a side that had played at senior level for the past two seasons.ldquoIt was a tough, tough match, Dunne said afterwards. ldquoFrom one to  though, everyone in the field performed.

This is simply not acceptable, from an NHS that can build Nightingale hospitals in a matter of a few weeks. It is all about priorities.Mr McGrady said there was ldquoa much bigger picture to be considered before any permanent reshaping of emergency care across Northern Ireland can be considered.He said there was an urban-rural ide in terms of emergency department services and their distribution, with an undue concentration of a limited resource in the Belfast area inevitably having a detrimental impact on the rest of the population.He said that according to Google, the average car journey times between the hospitals on a non-blue light basis ies considerably with  minutes from the Downe to the Ulster and  minutes from Downpatrick to Lisburnrsquos Lagan Valley.ldquoFrom the Ulster, itrsquos  minutes to the Royal Victoria and  minutes to Lagan Valley, while from the Lagan Valley to the Royal and Craigavon area hospitals it is  and  minutes respectively, said Mr McGrady.ldquoSadly, we all know that in our area we have a poor quality roads infrastructure and that the situation is much, much worse, for those who do not own a car and have to rely on the scant and inadequate public transport links from our area, even from its larger towns.Mr McGrady said the case for a restoration of a -hour emergency department in Downpatrick was even stronger now than ever before.He continued: ldquoWe are fully aware that there was and is an emergency situation, a national emergency, over Covid.ldquoOur community has more than played its part through the temporary loss of services at the Downe a hospital which, as always, has stepped up to the mark to play a massive role, punching well above its weight in responding to the Covid emergency.Mr McGrady said the time had now come to rebuild, with much positive news on the coronavirus vaccine battle.He added: ldquoThe damage done to our local services must now be repaired as a matter of the utmost urgency.

From what Irsquove heard of todayrsquos methods nothing much has changed. Emotional dficulties and anxiety is not as a result of stammering, but the issues which manest it.ldquoThe EA must recognise this in isolation and not overlook it because a child isnrsquot experiencing other learning dficulties. You can be effectively mute, but intelligent.Cllr Lewis said he remembers as a child being laughed at in shops, unable to tell the assistant what he wanted while in school he dreaded group activities, describing get to know you ice breaker games as ldquopure torture.He said that when he got on the bus he wrote down where wanted to go right up until my early s, revealing that he always carried a pen and paper in case he needed to write down what he wanted to say.He continued: ldquoThere was worry, anxiety and gut-wrenching sickness as all the feelings built up nervousness as I prepared to open my mouth and attempt to speak.ldquoNobody can understand or begin to imagine the absolute complete fear of failure any young child experiences when put into the situation where you are forced to speak.ldquoItrsquos easier to stay in the background, be unseen, unheard and unremarkable. This frustrates your confidence as you know you have a valid point to make, an opinion to give or part to play but, unfortunately, you are tongue tied, unable to relay your thoughts into words so you stay silent.Cllr Lewis also revealed that public silence manested into private anger, explaining that as a child, he took out his frustrations on his parents, picking unnecessary arguments and that the displaced enjoyment of raising his voice within the home ldquodeveloped an unhealthy and sometimes abnormal relationship with close relatives.Cllr Lewis hopes he is speaking directly to young people reading this article and encouraged them not to be deterred or put off from achieving their goals.ldquoIt was always my ambition to be a politician. I had a keen interest in history and politics and in the last council election knocked well over , doors in the district, speaking to residents from Spa to Ballyward, topping the poll in Slieve Croob.ldquoI have given speeches in Newry, Downpatrick, Belfast, Washington, San Diego, Brussels and Ypres proving that nobody is below their dreams. I want to use my position to lobby for improvements, support young people by ensuring that those with a stammer facing dficulties are given the help they need, he declared.Cllr Lewis said that each time his grandmother saw a newspaper article on stammering she would cut it out and give it to him, offering to help anyone who finds themselves in a similar situation to him.He continued: ldquoI understand what they are experiencing and believe that working together we can seek to change the system to ensure young people are given the very best start in le. Those who need a shoulder to lean on must be helped.ldquoMy appeal to the Department of Education and EA is not to abdicate their responsibility. Itrsquos shocking to learn that schools must take money from their own budget to facilitate counselling for pupils.Calling for direct investment in schools for full-time mental health workers focusing on children with complex confidence and anxiety issues, Cllr Lewis said that simply teaching children to mask a stammer wasnrsquot helpful.He added: ldquoItrsquos like showing someone with a broken leg how to spend their le relying on crutches and walking aids.

People are going through very dficult times at the moment everywhere, they canrsquot see their family.ldquoEven myself and my husband, working in tourism, we have seen things become really bad this year in terms of the work that is available.ldquoIn terms of the provisions of the food bank, and putting it on social media or in local press notes, it was surprising when we got out there amongst the community, how few people still knew it was there.ldquoOnce people did know about it more through our latest efforts, we saw their generosity coming to the fore as they donated money to the cause.ldquoIt has been received so well that we are looking forward to revisiting it again in the future for another go mdash hopefully in February..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/25th November 2020 Support.jpg","title":"Support retailers by shopping local  ","story":"PEOPLE across the district are being urged to shop local this Christmas mdash and safely.While similar appeals have been made in the past to support local businesses, a senior politician believes that this has never been more important than this year, given the global pandemic.The past eight months have been devastating for the local economy, with many shops preparing to close for two weeks at the close of business tomorrow as part of the circuit breaker measure.Many shops in Downpatrick are remaining open until pm today and tomorrow, with local councillor Dermot Curran keen for people to shop locally.He said businesses across the district which many people approach for support for ious fundraising efforts during the year now need the publicrsquos support more than ever.Cllr Curran has also welcomed confirmation that Newry, Mourne and Down Council recognises the impact Covid- has had across the district and is planning to shortly launch its own lsquomake it local campaignrsquo to support businesses in the run-up to Christmas.He said people need to shop locally and to do so safely, adhering to public health advice by wearing a mask covering their mouth and nose and exercising social distancing.ldquoIt is vitally important to keep the local economy open and for people to support it, Cllr Curran declared.ldquoEveryone recognises that Christmas will be dferent this year and while supporting the economy is important, so too is ensuring that people stay safe.Cllr Curran described the new Covid- restriction measures as a ldquosevere blow to the local business community which has operated and followed all public health advice, but which will soon find itself in lockdown again ldquodriving many to the clf edge.He said the Federation of Small Businesses was urging people to shop local this Christmas and hoped shoppers will follow this advice.ldquoWhile doing so, it is necessary to wear a mask, keep your distance and wash your hands, the politician continued, welcoming the financial support which the Northern Ireland Executive outlined on Monday for the business community.Cllr Curran people may very well be thinking twice about trips to large retail centres, normally part of their traditional Christmas shopping routine.He said there was much to be said for shopping locally and supporting businesses which have been at the heart of the districtrsquos economy for generations.ldquoShopping locally retains consumer spend in the district, but also helps reduce fuel costs and car parking charges at a time of the year when increasing financial pressure is placed on the family budget. This has never been truer, he said.ldquoLocal businesses often offer as much value and choice as those in cities and in the run-up to what is not a normal Christmas, I urge people to support their local traders. Our family-owned and independent shops keep traditional, local products alive and local shops.ldquoIn addition, shopping locally helps secure jobs and businesses which are well known for putting something back into their respective towns and villages by sponsoring community events and those organised by local schools and charities need our support this time.He added: ldquoSpending our money locally is a critical component of effectively supporting our communities across the district. Our local shops are places for unrivalled personal service.ldquoOur businesses have a strong understanding of the communities where they are based and I hope that our support will see them through the traditionally dficult New Year months and that they could look forward to the remainder of next year with confidence. It is the very least that they deserve..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/25th November 2020 Top.jpg","title":"Top stars take part in in Drumaness Masters  ","story":"SOME of snookerrsquos leading names from the past three decades will be on their way to Drumaness next month.Former world championship semi-finalist Joe Swail, from Belfast, is just one of the big stars who will competing in the Ballynahinch Motor Factors Drumaness Masters.The event takes place in the Dan Rice Memorial Hall over December -, with the winner carrying off the Jimmy McGivern Memorial Cup.Among the other big top players taking part are Dungannonrsquos Patrick Wallace, a former world championship quarter-finalist, defending champion Alastair Wilson and Declan Lavery who has won the Northern Ireland Open title.Tournament director Darren Oldroyd says he is delighted such a strong field is set to come to the Drumaness Masters.He added: ldquoItrsquos great that we have been able to attract such names to the competition.

Picture by Mark Pearce PresseyeJust last year Jim published a book of stories gathered over his years in the ministry – a thoughtful, entertaining and poignant mix of real le tales entitled ‘Stories From The Streets’.His memory banks drained Jim pondered a new project, then came lockdown and suddenly more stories that had been buried deep in his mind’s recesses started to flow. It was time for another book.He said: “I didn’t really think I had a second book in me but I was put into lockdown and I was isolating until July  and I thought maybe I’ll start writing more stories.   \" fill\"#ea\"  to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...\"Jim Rea and his we Carol celebrated their th wedding anniversary during lockdown“Whatever kind of mind I have I just tend to be able to reflect back on something and see a story. I’ve never written these down anywhere. They’re stored in my head, sometimes something can just trigger a story and it comes back to me.”Jim Rea was elected president of the Methodist Church in Ireland in , prior to being awarded an MBE in  for services to the community.For  years he worked on the Newtownards Road.He is a regular on BBC Radio Ulster’s Thought For The Day and Downtown’s Just A Moment as well as writing a religious column in the News Letter.\"Reflections From The Road by Jim ReaIn  portrait featured in a ‘Quiet Peacemakers’ art exhibition by Susan Hughes.Jim said some of these new stories were very personal and required anonymity: “I was always fearful that some of the stories I’d put into this new book would require a changing of names because of anonymity. I did that.“I kept pressing on with it, I got encouragement to do it, I thought it’s something positive to do when you’re locked down in the house.“It’s a book for a light reader. Hopefully the stories are inspirational – they’re sad sometimes, humorous on other occasions.“Everything in that book is absolutely % true. There’s a story of a lady who was in the hospital and came to see me in  to tell me I’d prayed with her when she’d taken an overdose and was pregnant. It took her  years before she came to see me.“There is the story of Gordon Wilson that will strike a chord. There’s the story of the wee boy Paul Maxwell who was killed on the boat with Lord Mountbatten.“I’m  years of age, I’m thinking for the sake of antiquity to write these stories down.”Jim worked on the Newtownards Road for  years where he founded the East Belfast Mission in .He was later stationed in Portadown and was involved in mediation to dfuse the impasse at Drumcree.“I’ve been in all sorts of dficult situations,” said Jim, who worked almost exclusively in conflict areas during the Troubles and witnessed some of its most horric events.“I was ministering through the worst of the Troubles and experienced the death and destruction that was happening on all sides.”Jim writes about the late SDLP leader John Hume and an encounter with cricket umpire Dickie Bird, but he believes it is important that the stories of unsung heroes like Rev Sam Burch are committed to our social history: “Sam Burch was a very low key player in the whole peace business but was very important. I thought, nobody has ever written about Sam Burch to say how that guy did so much in such a quiet way. “I think that when I pass on people will read these stories and they’ll be part of history. Maybe not academic history, but social history.”Jim commented: “My central purpose in writing these two books is to share the truths of the Gospel through these true stories, and also to honour the memory of some remarkable people I have met, some of them well-known and some hardly known at all.“My aim will have been achievedthe stories help readers realise what it means to follow Jesus and experience the greatest hope of all – the wonder of le that never ends and continues in the new heaven and new earth, where there will be no sorrow, sadness or pandemics.”Well known through his articles in the News Letter and as a radio personality, Jim said when you become a public figure you have to learn to take the rough with the smooth: “I was doing a Thought for the Day on Radio Ulster. I said something along the lines of, ‘God loves you, no matter whether you live in Belfast or Ballymena, Portadown or Portaferry, Dungannon or Divis Flats. You could see the point I was making. “Anyway, I got a letter from a woman who said, ‘how dare you compare Dungannon where I live with Divis Flats ’”During lockdown Jim and his we Carol celebrated their th wedding anniversary: “Not bad going I suppose. I don’t know where I’d be without her.”Jim said his second book came together faster than his first despite ‘starting from scratch’.He said: “I started writing it in February and finished at the end of September. I’ve got people to read the stories and edit them because to be honest I make so many mistakes. I’m very aware of my own inabilities. I need someone to keep me right. The glaring mistake I saw after the book was published was the Latin ‘Quis Separabit’ was wrongly spelt.”He continued: “The first book came out of a lot of the stories I’d written for Billy Kennedy for the News Letter. There were all those News Letter ones to draw on. On this occasion I was having to write relatively new stories so I didn’t have as many to pull back on. I was starting from scratch. Yet I finished it much faster than the first book.”His first book allowed the Belfast man to make a sizeable donation to charity: “The profits from ‘Stories From The Street’ have allowed me to contribute a total of £, to the Welcome Organisation and East Belfast Mission’s Hosford House, both charities for the homeless.”A story from the book:One day the funeral director called me and asked me to conduct the funeral of a man called Alan Short. As always I would talk to the family to get to know something about the deceased.When I arrived at the home I was told I should refer to the deceased as Shortie even though he was six foot three. It was also important to mention his fanatical support for Rangers Football Club. They went on to tell me that he was a dedicated member of a South Belfast loyalist flute band, and I was assured most of the band would attend. I took copious notes, hoping that I could do my best at the funeral at Roselawn Crematorium. I got the impression that Shortie was a big character who had an influence for good on the band.When we got to the crematorium a young man with a strong Glaswegian accent approached me, introducing himself as Brian. He said he would like to say a word about Shortie on behalf of the band. “I will say nothing to offend you, Reverend, in fact, I will quote scripture.” So I agreed. When I invited Brian to speak, some of his reflections on Shortie brought laughter. And then, true to his word, it came: “Shortie always told me that Rangers were mentioned in the Bible. Psalm  verse . WE ARE THE PEOPLE the sheep of his pasture.I couldn’t help but smile. ‘We are the people’ is commonly used by Rangers fans to express their supremacy. Not so terribly in recent years!Then I had to speak. “Thanks Brian, what a great play on words.” I then told the large number gathered that I wanted to speak on the words “no surrender.” Suddenly I had a captive audience eating out of my hand.I paused and then went on, “I spell it dferently. I spell it as K-N-O-W surrender.” And I explained that the most important thing they could do was to surrender their lives to Jesus Christ. I explained how they might take that step. One wee man going out shook my hand warmly and said it was the best funeral he had ever been at, a bit over the top I thought. However I don’t know of the long term impact, but I still pray that God may use those words, rather impromptu, or as they say in these parts, “on the hoof”."},{"url":null,"title":"pictures christmas through years around ni see who you recognise ","story":"NI couple admit causing suffering to Boxer dog which was excessively thin, had an ingrown claw and was living in filthy conditions   Controversial new monthly bin collections to be trialled by NI council - DUP warn it will lead to an increase in fly-tippingNewsLatestTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats OnThings To DoArts and EntertainmentNightleRetroLestyleEating OutChristmasCarsHomes and GardensCoronavirusFarmingPuzzlesChristmasPublic NoticesNewsPeople\"Santa Claus who made a surprise visit to Tobermore Christmas lights switch on last Saturday night PICTURES: Christmas through the years around NI - see who you recogniseTake a walk down memory lane with these nostalgic photographs from  and before in dferent parts of Northern Ireland.By Gemma MurraySunday, th November , : pm  \"       \"  The pictures were taken from our digital library..

Doctors surgeries and dentists are struggling to cope, St Cyres School and Stanwell School are full up with places. The foundations are not there for this development to go ahead.Last week Alex Wilson, Liberal Democrat candidate for Cardf South and Penarth, submitted a report to the Vale of Glamorgan Council calling for the plans to be reconsidered.The old farmhouse at Upper Cosmeston FarmThe survey, filled out by  residents, revealed  per cent believe the new houses would cause a ldquodisruptive increase in traffic  per cent said the plans donrsquot sufficiently mitigate an increase in pollution from extra traffic and  per cent said the new -pupil school wouldnrsquot meet the increased need for places.One respondent said: ldquoOvercrowding, air pollution and an unsuitable plot make this area totally wrong for housing development mdash especially when worldwide we are endeavouring to be mindful of the damage the aforementioned poor practices produce.Another said: ldquoEnvironmentally, itrsquos a disaster. I run in this area and there is signicant wildle here. Also, every year there is always some flooding on Lavernock Road when a quick heavy downfall happens. If the green pastures canrsquot contain the rainfall, more concrete isnrsquot going to make it any better.Mr Wilson added: ldquoWe support new house building and recognise a need for social housing, but we wanted to make sure we were engaging with our community and finding a balance. This also has a direct impact on me because my house backs onto Lavernock Road.ldquoWe fully support the petition to fight the development and I am encouraging people to sign it. Our major concerns are that this has not been properly thought through.While the public consultation on the plans has now ended, the Vale of Glamorgan Councilrsquos planning committee will soon consider whether to grant permission, during a public meeting. A date for that meeting has not yet been set.A Vale of Glamorgan council spokesmansaid: ldquoThe council is currently considering a planning application from Welsh Government relating to this matter. The plans can be viewed through the online planning register on the councilrsquos website and comments are invited from any interested party.ldquoPlanning officers are available to discuss the proposals with members of the public throughout the normal working week by email, telephone or virtual meetingnecessary.ldquoViews can be submitted by emailing planning@valeofglamorgan.gov.uk and all will be considered as part of the normal planning process.

When a bubble is formed it is fixed, and must not be changed or extended further at any point.bull Each Christmas bubble can meet at home, at a place of worship or an outdoor public place, but existing, more restrictive rules on hospitality and meeting in other venues will be maintained throughout this period.It is important that everyone respects and abides by the rules of each nation wherever they choose to spend the festive period.Where there are any iations in our approach, these will be communicated by each administration accordingly.Further guidance will be provided in due course.The winter holiday period is a time often spent with family and friends, with schools and offices closing and people travelling over the bank holidays.Many have already begun making their plans, and we are today providing clarity to help people make the right choices for them, and enjoy time with those closest to them while staying within the rules to protect us all. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

For those in higher-cost areas like London, the losses will be even greater.The anticipated surge in benefit caps comes after a nine month \"grace period\" in which some claimants were protected from a cap at the start of the pandemic.For people who claimed in April, a further surge in benefits caps is expected at the end of January, when their \"grace period\" ends.Figures published last week showed that , British households - most with children - had their benefits capped in April, with more than  per cent of these households including children under five.Separate research suggested that the financial shock of this cap increased the risks of poor mental health among claimants.Cap undermines wellbeingThe study by the London School of Economics said: “[The cap] may actually push people further away from the labour market because it undermines their wellbeing.”Housing charity Shelter has urged government minsters to scrap the planned cap. The charitys chief executive Polly Neate commented: “It limits families’ basic incomes to the point where parents have to choose between paying their rent or feeding their children. And too many get to the point where they have no choice, and homelessness becomes unavoidable.\"Benefits caps - limiting the total amount of benefit people can receive - were first introduced in  as an \"incentive\" for jobless people to find work. It has since been made even less generous, in spite of evidence that those who had their benefits capped were actually less likely to find work.   \"       \"  Most Popular   Family’s disbelief as killer walks free from court after dangerous driving spree    Tributes to popular NI man who died suddenly in hospital    NI man scoops £k and a De Lorean car in online competition    Benefits to be capped for thousands of struggling families - heres why    Private funeral for NI farmer and lay preacher who died in fire Most Popular   Private funeral for NI farmer and lay preacher who died in fire    Supergran Heather lts  stone of litter since start of pandemic    Staff concern as those wanting COVID- tests still turn up at NI DVA centre without masks    DUP MP Carla Lockhart calls for sport to reopen for mental health    Man head-butted his girlfriend, court told                        This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\" ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-lhVmIH sc-bYSBpT cqvPrG\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy  News you can trust since News\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"     NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisCoronavirusSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"     SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"     Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"     LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessPublic NoticesFollow us          "},{"url":null,"title":"these are  most popular dog names  ","story":"Elderly farmer and former lay preacher dies in Co Armagh house fire   Family’s disbelief as killer walks free from court after dangerous driving spreeNewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisCoronavirusSportFootballOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleCarsHomes and GardensPublic NoticesNewsPeople\"Did your favourite make the top   These are the  most popular dog names of The UK is a nation of dog lovers, with thousands of families across the country welcoming a new furry friend into their home every yearBy Claire SchofieldMonday, th November , : pm  \"       \"  Much like a newborn, the fluffy new family member needs a name too and as with humans, trends for dog names also fall in and out of fashion as years go by.
