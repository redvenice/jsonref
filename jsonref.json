But what is Martin Lewis’s net worth?Who is Martin Lewis?Born Martin Steven Lewis on May 9, 1972 in Withington, Manchester, he is an English financial journalist and founder of the website MoneySavingExpert.com.He lost his mother in a car accident at a young age and later in life, went on to become a patron of the children’s bereavement charity Grief Encounter as well as an advocate for life insurance.Martin studied government and law at the London School of Economics and went on to complete a postgraduate course in broadcast journalism in Cardiff.His first job was at a financial communications consultancy, the Brunswick Group in London and later, became a producer for the BBC Business Unit working on BBC Radio Five Live business programmes.Martin was also an editor of BBC Radio 4’s Today programme and then moved to Sky’s Simply Money where he formed his Money Saving Expert persona.After the collapse of Simply Money, he wrote for the Deal of the Week column in the Sunday Express and was then granted slots on Channel 5’s Open House with Gloria Hunniford.Martin returned to BBC for a short while before presenting a daytime television series on ITV in 2005 called Make Me Rich as well as Channel Five show It Pays to Watch.He then presented money saving programmes on Good Morning Britain and Lorraine and now appears on This Morning, The Wright Stuff and began presenting The Martin Lewis Money Show.Martin Lewis is married to former 5 News weather presenter Lara Lewington in May 31, 2009 and the couple had a daughter in November 2012.          Money Saving Expert Martin Lewis pictured with his Order of the British Empire (OBE) medal alongside his wife Lara Lewington at an Investiture ceremony in February 2015 at Buckingham PalaceMartin Lewis on Question TimeMoney Saving Expert Martin Lewis was applauded by Question Time viewers after he slammed Labour Party MP Chi Onwurah over student finance claims.He accused politicians of dissuading young people from attending university by referring to the fee payments as student ‘debt’ and said that an entire generation had been ‘mis-educated’.He said: \u0027It is an abomination, you should all hold your heads in shame... It\u0027s an increased form of taxation when you leave but is not framed as a debt, it shouldn\u0027t be called a debt, it\u0027s a graduate contribution system so don\u0027t even go there.\u0027Martin explained that the price of attending university was irrelevant and the repayments are based on salary, which means that those who earn a lot after completing their studies, will naturally have to pay back more.Ms Onwurah, MP for Newcastle upon Tyne Central said: \u0027If somebody, and particularly somebody from a working class background, if somebody has 57,000 in debt,\u0027 but Martin interrupted her to say: ‘Don\u0027t tell them! Politicians do this all the time. You can\u0027t make political points.\u0027You put off young people from underprivileged backgrounds from going to university with a fear of debt by framing it as a debt when you know it doesn\u0027t work like that.\u0027Politicians need to take responsibility. Your political football that you and all the parties have used student finance to be has mis-educated a generation about how student finance works and it is an abomination, you should all hold your heads in shame because there are people from poor backgrounds on television - I saw a programme two weeks ago - saying I can\u0027t afford to go to university.\u0027Well, you know what, it is expensive, it\u0027s an increased form of taxation when you leave but is not framed as a debt, it shouldn\u0027t be called a debt, it\u0027s a graduate contribution system so don\u0027t even go there.\u0027Ms Onwurah responded: \u0027It is really, really important to recognise that tuition fees are an obstacle for students going into university. It\u0027s psychological but a lot of the world is psychological. How things are perceived is what informs people\u0027s choice.\u0027You can argue to re-educate, or you can argue, as we have done, to abolish tuition fees.\u0027Martin Lewis suing FacebookIn April 2018, Money Saving Expert founder Martin Lewis revealed that he is in the process of suing Facebook for publishing dozens of adverts using his image to promote scams.He said that the social media platform had used his name to ‘rip off vulnerable people’. He continued: \u0027I feel sick each time I hear of another victim being conned because of trust they wrongly thought they were placing in me.‘I believe politicians have totally missed the impact of social media companies on real people and their pockets. It is about time they took this seriously.’Martin went on to say that Facebook founder Mark Zuckerburg ‘pretends to be an honest and campaigning man but his company is a facilitator of criminal scammers … They have known about these scam adverts for years, and they are still happy to roll around in their dirty money.’Facebook has been accused of publishing more than 50 fake Martin Lewis adverts, with the majority promoting schemes trading in Bitcoin, which Martin claimed were actually binary trading firms.Binary trading is a risky form of gambling on the stock market that sees most investors lose money.The Financial Conduct Authority has said almost 100 firms are illegally offering such investments to UK consumers and warned of online firms that take money, place no bets for customers then break contact.Martin has asked Facebook to remove the adverts multiple times but they are left up for days or weeks before being taken down and then reappear days later.A Facebook spokesman said: ‘We do not allow adverts which are misleading or false on Facebook and have explained to Martin Lewis he should report any adverts that infringe his rights and they will be removed.’Martin Lewis net worthMartin Lewis’s net worth has accumulated to approximately £73 million, according to Wealtholino.In 2012, BBC News reported that Martin sold MoneySavingExpert.com for up to £87 million.Met Gala 2018: Date, theme, hosts and moreMarvel character searches on Pornhub surged before Avengers: Infinity War releaseJennifer Aniston joins Brad Pitt and others in objecting to The Weinstein Company saleGrey\u0027s Anatomy preview hints at Sarah Drew and Jessica Capshaw\u0027s leavingCinco de Mayo: How to celebrate in style Who is Matthew Lawrence?

The mast was broken, the sails in shreds and the boat itself flooded with water.The British towns where VEG has almost vanished... and why...We had to tell our children Daddy could die on Everest... we...Share this articleWhat followed was a story of good fortune, rare courage, and redemption. For more than 40 days, with her boat crippled, equipment smashed and heart broken, 23-year-old Tami somehow endured the elements threatening to annihilate her and then conquered them – and she did so thanks to the guiding spirit of her dead fiancé, whose insistent voice, day by day, had urged her on to a seemingly impossible survival.That voice, she says, brought her back from the brink, helping her navigate with just a sextant and the stars above her head.Now her ordeal and the extraordinary memoir that followed have been made into a big-budget Hollywood film, Adrift, set for release in June, and featuring British actor Sam Claflin as Richard and Shailene Woodley as Tami.Both are rising stars – Sam appeared in the film adaptation of Jojo Moyes’ novel Me Before You, while US actress Shailene played a teenage cancer patient in The Fault In Our Stars – and Adrift looks set to be this summer’s cinematic hit.Yet even the big-screen treatment could hardly be more dramatic than the true 1,500-mile solo epic that Tami describes in Red Sky In Mourning: A True Story of Love, Loss And Survival At Sea, which will be re-published next month as Adrift.It was September 1983 when the two young sailors embarked on what they imagined to be a routine delivery for the Hazana’s British owners, Peter and Christine Compton.At 34, Richard was more than a decade older than his young American lover, but with his his lapis lazuli eyes, golden hair and ‘exotic’ English accent, he meant everything to her. They had already spent a year and a half together on the Pacific, delivering and mending boats.True, the distance involved in this new mission was vast, yet the pair had few concerns, as Tami later recalled in a series of moving interviews: ‘I’d been sailing blue water for four years. Together we had 50,000 miles of ocean-sailing under our belts. We hugged, laughed, made love and relaxed into 20 days of paradise.’          The couple set off on the 4,000 mile trip on board the Hazana across the Pacific OceanA disastrous reality was less than two weeks away, in the shape of tropical storm Raymond, which ‘tore out of the blue’, hit hurricane force then held its peak intensity for two catastrophic days.It was Richard who spotted a monster wave approaching the Hazana and ordered Tami below deck while he secured himself with a safety harness and tried to keep the vessel afloat.Moments later she heard him scream ‘Oh my God!’ and her world was thrust into darkness.Tossed like a cork on the raging ocean, the yacht had flipped end over end. It was 27 hours before she regained consciousness to an eerie silence and utter devastation. The cabin was half-filled with water, everything inside it smashed or scattered on the floor.Scrambling out onto the deck she looked desperately for Richard but found only wreckage. The boat was all-but destroyed: masts were broken off and the waterlogged sails floated uselessly in the water.Richard’s safety line dangled ominously off the boat. Tami shouted his name over and over again, but found only empty ocean. Richard was nowhere to be seen.

Andy Perry is believed to be the first Brit to lose an entire leg from a spider bite, after he almost died when the creature sank its fangs into his ankleAfter numerous appointments with specialists Andy opted for an elective amputation above his right knee, which was carried out in March.He has now been left wheel-chair bound, unable to work or play with his children and needs daily treatment.Andy, of Huncote, Leicestershire, who lives with his police officer wife Christine, 39, said: \u0027I was doing a quote for a job in 2015 and I was coming home at lunchtime to look after the kids because my wife was on shift.\u0027But within a couple of hours I started feeling really poorly. I rang the missus to see if she could come home but she couldn\u0027t and the next I know I got a massive ache in the small of my back.\u0027That was pretty much me done then and Christine came back home when I called her again.          Mr Perry\u0027s leg is pictured three weeks before the amputation. He said the pain was so severe he considered sawing it off \u0027I went to bed when she got back, pretty much for the whole weekend and I was throwing up.\u0027Then on the Sunday morning it was a question of having to get over to the hospital as soon as I could.\u0027I was seen by a doctor in the Royal Leicester Infirmary Triage and he said there was no chance of me going home.\u0027Then he admitted me straight away, the ache in my back was the kidney\u0027s packing up from the infection and sepsis.

Mr Perry\u0027s leg is pictured following the amputation he was forced to undergo when the spider bit his ankle \u0027They came to a conclusion it was a false widow spider because it has a reputation of biting people.\u0027The puncture marks were just above the sock line because I used to wear socks and boots.\u0027The only thing we can think of is that I literally just brushed past it and its had a quick bite as I\u0027ve gone past.\u0027Apparently the bite of the false widow feels like a bee sting but I didn\u0027t feel a thing. The spiders are an awful lot more common than people think.\u0027After they sorted out the kidney function, things started improving and the sepsis was beaten by the anti-biotics.          Mr Perry (pictured before the bite with his son Tom) is believed to be the first Brit to have a leg amputated due to a false widow bite\u0027I\u0027ve had the district nurses coming around for the next three months changing the dressing on my leg every day.\u0027The lymphedema caused the leg to swell to the point where the skin split and fell off.\u0027That was all just a massive open weeping sores and blisters and just generally horribleness.\u0027And that was it, the leg was all but useless from that point, I spent a certain amount of time trying to get treatment.\u0027There just wasn\u0027t a surgeon nearby who wanted to touch it because of the lymphedema as it was a live infection.\u0027So without getting any treatment I just couldn\u0027t work - so I figured I would go down the route of elective amputation in a last desperate attempt to get back to work.          Andy had no idea he had been bitten by Britain\u0027s most venomous spider until he was rushed to hospital suffering from sepsis and kidney failure\u0027But again trying to find a doctor or surgeon to look at the amputation was hard.\u0027Eventually I had to threaten my GP with cutting my own leg off with a blade from a chainsaw because I was getting so desperate.\u0027Out of that I tried a guy in Coventry who climbed on board straight away as soon as he saw the leg.\u0027I spent 20 minutes talking to him, needed a second opinion and spoke to prosthetic people and as soon as that was done it was all agreed.\u0027The leg was cut of on March 13 of this year, it should\u0027ve been healed by now but I got a secondary infection so I was back in surgery on April 27.\u0027I\u0027ve now got a vacuum dressing on me which pulls all of the gulp out of the leg and takes it away.          The father-of-two has spoken of his horror after he fell seriously ill after being bitten by a false widow spider\u0027The plan is to rehabilitate the leg, get a prosthetic and get back to work for this year or next.\u0027I had been a landscaper for about five years prior to the bite and I had a good business going on but now its all gone.\u0027We\u0027ve been living off my wife\u0027s salary - I have got zero income because of this bite.\u0027Andy is now hoping to get help to fix up his garden so he can play with his children Thomas, 8, and George, 5.He added: \u0027They\u0027ve been brilliant, they\u0027ve taken it in their stride, we have explained every single thing about whats happened all the way along. I can\u0027t use the garden, I\u0027m just complete and utterly stuck\u0027I\u0027ve been looking for help with my new project which is sorting out his garden to make it more wheelchair friendly.          Mr Perry was rushed to hospital suffering from sepsis and kidney failure and had to have his leg amputated \u0027I\u0027ve now realised that our garden is horribly unsuitable for my wheelchair.. My chair is great but it doesn\u0027t like grass.\u0027It is a small garden and it\u0027s laid mostly to lawn and soft landscaping but there is a large raised deck that I installed to overcome the slopes in the garden.\u0027I can barely get outside let alone use the deck so I\u0027m restricted to an area of 1.5 square metre.\u0027I\u0027ve contacted lots of builders yards in the hopes of securing donations of materials. I can\u0027t afford to buy the items which I think will cost around £4,500.\u0027I know it is a long shot but I\u0027m hoping to raise donations of materials and then I\u0027m hoping to find friends and tradesmen willing to help out by doing the work, a kind of Ground Force, DIY SOS thing, on a local basis.\u0027I just need to get a prosthetic but we don\u0027t think that will be this year - I had promised the boys to take them trick or treating at Halloween but I don\u0027t think that\u0027s a possibility now.\u0027The UK has seen a rise in false widow spiders - dubbed Britain\u0027s most venomous spider - in the past four years, believed to be caused by an increase in climate.The influx of the eight-legged beasts has seen a number of unsuspecting Brits hospitalised.The false widow spider is not deadly, but can deliver a similar bite to its antipodean cousin, which can kill within hours.Instead of the venomous black widow spider, which dons devilish black and red markings across its body, the false widow spider in Britain is usually harmless.The Steatoda nobilis is native to Madeira and the Canary islands, and is believed to have arrived on British shores via a cargo transporter in the 19th Century. Andy\u0027s Justgiving page is here. Crowdfunding to Buy an electric wheelchair on

It was then used for storing meteorological records and artists and school groups visited until it was turned into a private residence in the 1980s.The current owners bought it in 2004 and transformed it from the basic accommodation it had been over just the bottom two floors, into the stunning five-storey property it is now.It has 1,216 sq ft of accommodation with two bedrooms and two bathrooms on the ground and first floor and the kitchendiner and lounge on the second and third floors to take advantage of the views.On the fourth floor is the observation deck, which the estate agents describe as \u0027one of the most incredible rooms anywhere in Cornwall\u0027.          On the ground floor of the building there is a useful wet room with modern appliances, shower, loo, sink and modern tiling          There is also a camera obscura in the observatory deck, effectively turning the room into a pinhole camera and projecting the beautiful panoramic views onto a table          The comfortable lounge one floor below the observatory deck affords the inhabitants ample living space and yet more sumptuous viewsIt has windows on all eight walls offering a genuine 360-degree view across Falmouth, the surrounding countryside and coastline, including Falmouth Bay, and across to the Roseland Peninsula, with St Mawes and Pendennis Castles easily seen and lit at night.The room has an oak panelled vaulted roof space leading up to the camera obscura at the apex, which was constructed in the 1950s.It converts the whole room into a pinhole camera when the black-out blinds are drawn and it rotates, allowing the panoramic views to be projected as an image on a table in the observation deck.The owners have recently run the property as a holiday rental and are prepared to sell it with ongoing bookings and its website if the buyer wanted to continue this.All the furniture, linen, cutlery and crockery, light fittings, blinds and artwork are available by separate negotiation.Ian Lillicrap from Lillicrap Chilcott said: \u0027I\u0027ve been an estate agent in Cornwall for 39 years and I can honestly say it\u0027s the most unusual property I have ever dealt with.          The house also features a light and bright compact kitchen with 360 degree windows offering light from every angle around          The house only features two bedrooms in total but they are modern and bright throughout - with the house having been recently renovated          The house\u0027s floorplan shows the unusual layout in more detail - as it is split over five floors but only offers around 113 square meters in living space\u0027And the views from the upper floors and the top are the most spectacular I have ever seen.\u0027It\u0027s like being in a helicopter above Falmouth when you reach the top. It just completely takes your breath away.\u0027It\u0027s glazed on all sides so you get a 360-degree view over Falmouth and for miles surrounding.\u0027It is the sort of vista you just never see.\u0027It\u0027s a well-worn phrase but it truly is a once in a lifetime opportunity.\u0027The craftmanship in this property is spectacular. The beautiful, quality, intricate workmanship and ingenuity, similar to kitting out a superyacht, has been brought into this building.\u0027The flooring, the winding staircases from floor to floor and the way the kitchen has been fitted, it\u0027s all marvellous. The owners have the most incredible eye for detail.\u0027It\u0027s not huge so I don\u0027t think it will sell as a main home but it would be an absolutely prized second home for someone or it could be someone who wants to use it for lettings.\u0027I don\u0027t believe there is anything else resembling it in Cornwall. There\u0027s nothing that comes close in terms of uniqueness and quality.\u0027 "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/06/18/4BEA807F00000578-0-image-m-40_1525628304038.jpg","title":"Quadruplets history celebrate fifth birthday","story":"    Christine Clark’s quadruplets (pictured together) made history when they were born in RotherhamThey have just celebrated their birthday and are already ‘little ladies’, according to their father Justin. ‘At one point, I could hold all four girls at once,’ he said. ‘Now I think: “Where have they gone?

Unable to see him for nearly a month due to his condition, I prayed for his recovery. I also tried to help ease his family’s burden by sending weekly food parcels. Over the weeks, I must have cooked gallons of chilli con carne (from my special recipe containing cardamom, coriander, cumin, smoked paprika and, of course, chilli).The aim was to give them more time and the ultimate comfort food after hours of visits to Andrew’s hospital bedside.Beggars could be banned from being within 30ft of cash...McDonald\u0027s, Costa, and KFC are charging up to 28 per cent...Share this article    Andrew Marr (left), Amanda Platell and Charles Kennedy (right), review the papers during the filming of the Andrew Marr ShowDoctors had discovered that he’d torn his carotid artery, causing a massive stroke and putting his life in danger. In his hospital bed, he soon realised that his voracious appetite for work meant that he’d pushed his body and mind too hard.‘I’m a gulper, a gobbler-down of life. I wolf experiences down,’ he later said. Thankfully, the stroke hit the left side of his brain — which meant his memory and speech were not impaired. But it took months of sheer willpower and tough physical rehab exercises – as well as walking, reading and painting – before he was able to go back and present his Sunday morning BBC1 show.

It’s partly because she fought for me she was my tireless advocate in the hospital to get the right treatment.’His friends often joked that he could have lost half his brain and he’d still be cleverer than almost anyone we knew.When Andrew told me last week of this latest health scare – a small tumour on his kidney which was caught early and will be frozen off – I was more sanguine. Yes, we all fear the words ‘tumour’, ‘cancer’ and ‘malignant’. Yet I know that Andrew has more courage and determination in his little finger, even the one hardest hit by the stroke, than most people do in their entire body.Moreover, this no-nonsense Scot would be appalled to be called ‘courageous’. He’s a man without an ounce of self-pity. He would never, ever, ask: ‘Why has this happened to me?’ What I’ve learnt from our friendship is that Andrew has guts. He’s damn stubborn, too.He’s approaching this cancer scare with the same determination he did his stroke.Get on with it and go back to work and normal life.I’m sure that will be the case – and that his family won’t have to endure any more takeaway pans of chilli con carne a la Platell."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/06/09/0234D4AB000007D0-0-image-a-11_1525594220709.jpg","title":"Duchess York left guest list Meghan Harrys second private wedding reception","story":"    The Duchess of York. She is said to be \u0027deeply unhappy\u0027 that she is not on the guest list for Harry and Meghan\u0027s second private evening wedding receptionThe Duchess of York is said to be ‘deeply unhappy’ after being left off the Royal Family’s ‘inner sanctum’ guest list for this month’s royal wedding.Prince Andrew’s ex-wife is among 600 guests invited to the ceremony in St George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle on May 19 and to the reception that is being held afterwards in St George’s Hall, it can be confirmed.But while Andrew and their children, Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie, have also been sent coveted invitations for a second, private evening reception for 250 being thrown by Prince Charles for the couple, Sarah is most definitely off the guest list for that.According to sources, the 58-year-old duchess has been complaining about the ‘snub’ to anyone who will listen – even though many in the royal households think she should count herself lucky to be going at all. Prince Harry personally intervened to make sure she had an invitation to his wedding to Meghan Markle and the first reception after years in the royal wilderness.It is understood that Sarah has already been introduced to Meghan by Harry, who is close to his cousins Beatrice and Eugenie, but it is thought that Charles, who is paying for the evening reception at Frogmore House, doesn’t approve.An insider said: ‘Numbers are limited to the evening party, she is not a member of the Royal Family any more and Prince Charles simply doesn’t have time for her. \u0027He just can’t see why she is still such a big part of his brother’s life.’Prince Harry\u0027s bid to be first royal to serve on the...Meghan Markle\u0027s Suits co-stars enlist the help of the show\u0027s...Share this articleThe duchess wasn’t invited to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s 2011 wedding at Westminster Abbey, which was a much larger occasion than Harry and Meghan’s ‘intimate’ family ceremony, and took herself off to a spa in Thailand to lick her wounds.While relations have thawed enough in recent years for Sarah to be invited to a small number of occasions, such as Royal Ascot and the family’s summer sojourn at Balmoral, even the Queen has to take care that she doesn’t appear when Prince Philip is around.He is said to hold a deep-seated grudge against the duchess for the embarrassments he feels she has heaped upon his family over the years, once memorably describing her as ‘having no point’.

Not infrequently, he shows up in a more casual setting such as playing hockey or skiing.At Sheremetyevo International Airport and souvenir stands throughout Moscow, Putin\u0027s sober, stern visage gazes out from T-shirts, mugs, matryoshka nesting dolls and refrigerator magnets. Sometimes, the images combine respect with a touch of humor, such as the popular portrayal of him riding a bear, his shirtless torso showing impressive muscles.

All these Asian things are sort of unpleasant to him. Putin\u0027s nature is quite reserved. So to him, as a professional spy, the grotesque displays of loyalty are suspicious rather than pleasant,\u0027 says Minchenko.

Andy Perry is believed to be the first Brit to lose an entire leg from a spider bite, after he almost died when the creature sank its fangs into his ankleAfter numerous appointments with specialists Andy opted for an elective amputation above his right knee, which was carried out in March.He has now been left wheel-chair bound, unable to work or play with his children and needs daily treatment.Andy, of Huncote, Leicestershire, who lives with his police officer wife Christine, 39, said: \u0027I was doing a quote for a job in 2015 and I was coming home at lunchtime to look after the kids because my wife was on shift.\u0027But within a couple of hours I started feeling really poorly.

The spiders are an awful lot more common than people think.\u0027After they sorted out the kidney function, things started improving and the sepsis was beaten by the anti-biotics.

Andy had no idea he had been bitten by Britain\u0027s most venomous spider until he was rushed to hospital suffering from sepsis and kidney failure\u0027But again trying to find a doctor or surgeon to look at the amputation was hard.\u0027Eventually I had to threaten my GP with cutting my own leg off with a blade from a chainsaw because I was getting so desperate.\u0027Out of that I tried a guy in Coventry who climbed on board straight away as soon as he saw the leg.\u0027I spent 20 minutes talking to him, needed a second opinion and spoke to prosthetic people and as soon as that was done it was all agreed.\u0027The leg was cut of on March 13 of this year, it should\u0027ve been healed by now but I got a secondary infection so I was back in surgery on April 27.\u0027I\u0027ve now got a vacuum dressing on me which pulls all of the gulp out of the leg and takes it away.          The father-of-two has spoken of his horror after he fell seriously ill after being bitten by a false widow spider\u0027The plan is to rehabilitate the leg, get a prosthetic and get back to work for this year or next.\u0027I had been a landscaper for about five years prior to the bite and I had a good business going on but now its all gone.\u0027We\u0027ve been living off my wife\u0027s salary - I have got zero income because of this bite.\u0027Andy is now hoping to get help to fix up his garden so he can play with his children Thomas, 8, and George, 5.He added: \u0027They\u0027ve been brilliant, they\u0027ve taken it in their stride, we have explained every single thing about whats happened all the way along.

My chair is great but it doesn\u0027t like grass.\u0027It is a small garden and it\u0027s laid mostly to lawn and soft landscaping but there is a large raised deck that I installed to overcome the slopes in the garden.\u0027I can barely get outside let alone use the deck so I\u0027m restricted to an area of 1.5 square metre.\u0027I\u0027ve contacted lots of builders yards in the hopes of securing donations of materials. I can\u0027t afford to buy the items which I think will cost around £4,500.\u0027I know it is a long shot but I\u0027m hoping to raise donations of materials and then I\u0027m hoping to find friends and tradesmen willing to help out by doing the work, a kind of Ground Force, DIY SOS thing, on a local basis.\u0027I just need to get a prosthetic but we don\u0027t think that will be this year - I had promised the boys to take them trick or treating at Halloween but I don\u0027t think that\u0027s a possibility now.\u0027The UK has seen a rise in false widow spiders - dubbed Britain\u0027s most venomous spider - in the past four years, believed to be caused by an increase in climate.The influx of the eight-legged beasts has seen a number of unsuspecting Brits hospitalised.The false widow spider is not deadly, but can deliver a similar bite to its antipodean cousin, which can kill within hours.Instead of the venomous black widow spider, which dons devilish black and red markings across its body, the false widow spider in Britain is usually harmless.The Steatoda nobilis is native to Madeira and the Canary islands, and is believed to have arrived on British shores via a cargo transporter in the 19th Century. Andy\u0027s Justgiving page is here. Crowdfunding to Buy an electric wheelchair on JustGiving"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/06/07/4BE7F1E700000578-0-image-a-1_1525589506266.jpg","title":"Quadruplets history celebrate fifth birthday","story":"    Christine Clark’s quadruplets (pictured together) made history when they were born in RotherhamThey have just celebrated their birthday and are already ‘little ladies’, according to their father Justin. ‘At one point, I could hold all four girls at once,’ he said. ‘Now I think: “Where have they gone?

The weather dubbed the \u0027Roast from Russia\u0027 followed the \u0027Beast from the East\u0027 The Russian Embassy retweeted a story from The Mirror, which referenced the warm blast moving in from the Continent.The headline which called the sunny spell the ‘Roast from Russia’ was seized upon by the Embassy in London, which frequently attacks the British media.The Embassy wrote: ‘When in doubt what to do, blame Russia.’However, the hotspell is literally being swept from the southern parts of Russia to the UK, leading meteorologists to dub the heatwave the \u0027Roast from Russia\u0027.It is not the first time the weather has been linked to Moscow. In February, temperatures plummeted to -5C and an extreme weather warning was issued. The chill coming from Siberia was subbed the Beast from the East. Winds from the east, caused the mercury to plummet - with even daytime temperatures struggling to rise above zero.                          Prankster hilariously \u0027translates\u0027 insults from group of irate menMoment married dad is caught while trying to meet 14-year-old for sexCarnival cruise ship crew scramble to stop ship from floodingShocking video shows corporal screaming at woman traineePrivate scheme \u0027My Little Bobby\u0027 is Britain first private policeAndrew Marr reveals he\u0027s to undergo a kidney operationSneaky dog loves to hide from owners behind flower potDrunk man stumbles and falls as he is hauled off plane in Majorca\u0027ISIS terrorist\u0027 is liquidated by FSB marksmen in RussiaA look back at Sir Alex\u0027s key moments as he recovers from surgeryOn Sunday, the mercury hit 22.3C in Edinburgh and 20.8C in Katesbridge in County Down - making for the hottest day of 2018 in Scotland and Northern Ireland.The weather is set to become mixed as the month progresses, and the May 19 wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle draws near.Royal bride Meghan may be hoping the rain will stay away for her big day at Windsor Castle.Looking at the long range forecast, which is not as accurate as the shorter range forecast, Mr Powell said: \u0027It looks like we should be prepared for some pretty changeable weather throughout the second half of May.\u0027We\u0027re still going to see some dry days, but there\u0027s still going to be some wet days mixed in as well.\u0027 Referring to the day of the eagerly anticipated wedding, Mr Powell added: \u0027We\u0027ve got this idea that there could be some warmer spells, most likely across the south and east of England, so at least that bodes well for wedding locations and things like that.\u0027   The Met Office warned that those would with hay fever could have a gloomy day because tree pollen levels would be moderate to high for many.

Not infrequently, he shows up in a more casual setting such as playing hockey or skiing.At Sheremetyevo International Airport and souvenir stands throughout Moscow, Putin\u0027s sober, stern visage gazes out from T-shirts, mugs, matryoshka nesting dolls and refrigerator magnets. Sometimes, the images combine respect with a touch of humor, such as the popular portrayal of him riding a bear, his shirtless torso showing impressive muscles.  Everywhere: Russian traditional wooden matryoshka dolls showing Russian President, Vladimir Putin, on sale in a street souvenir shop in Moscow, Russia  Fashion statement: Salesmen in sweatshirts with an image of Putin wait for customers at GUM (the State Department Store) in MoscowAnalysts say Putin\u0027s portrayal is subtly shifting.\u0027Putin has started to shift from the image of the fighter and a miracle-maker to the image of a considered man and the leader of a young team,\u0027 says Yevgeny Minchenko, a Moscow-based political consultant.\u0027He\u0027s now a wise ruler, who doesn\u0027t go solving the issues at hand, but he sets a strategic course and appoints talented young people who are able to implement this course.\u0027Although his face is widespread, the portrayal stops short of the omnipresence that characterizes personality cults such as those of Kim Jon-un in North Korea or Turkmenistan\u0027s Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov.\u0027He\u0027s a person of a European culture. All these Asian things are sort of unpleasant to him. Putin\u0027s nature is quite reserved. So to him, as a professional spy, the grotesque displays of loyalty are suspicious rather than pleasant,\u0027 says Minchenko.

He had chosen the role because he felt he was becoming a “Bond slave” and the film was about as far away as possible from the cartoon smoothness of 007. Cannes wasn’t much interested in that distinction, however. Goldfinger had come out the previous year Thunderball was on its way. When Connery cruised the Croisette in an open-topped sports car it was Bond, “Mr Kiss Kiss Bang Bang” as the New York Times called him, the crowds wanted to see.Connery, for all his reluctance to identify with his character, clearly didn’t disappoint. Has he ever looked more Bondlike than in this picture? Eyebrow raised, catching the eye of a beautiful face in the crowd, keeping his head and his tailoring on point, while all around him are losing theirs. This was his first time at Cannes, but he knew exactly what Cannes demanded: it was the place actors had always come to act most like film stars.This year’s festival, which opens next week, will conjure similar images: the same spring Riviera light, the same rococo facades, the same paparazzi scrum around an icon. Just as the photograph of Connery harked back to the welcome and confected spectacle that the film festival represented after the war, so this year’s images will reference the less inhibited atmosphere of the 60s. Glamour never goes out of style – or at least so Cannes insists."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/314ec7a5ae0bd3b76e28ff2c31d2662cf47e5dd8/982_410_5738_3443/master/5738.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e467e6b68c3d7ea2980dc6b08268a852","title":"blade runner sheffield scissor maker in pictures","story":"Arriving in Sheffield 25 years ago, Grace Horne’s plan of being taught to be a cutler by the renowned Stan Shaw did not go to plan"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cecb584be515350f50ee731f4b0185280a78bd18/80_18_2285_1371/master/2285.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=62265868a54064b892a94da2cceebf05","title":"michael morpurgo my family fought for peace not for brexit","story":"The War Horse author remembers the uncles who inspired his latest book, In the Mouth of the Wolf, and who taught him that peace must come before prosperityI have just walked around the ancient ramparts of Ypres, whose name became the byword for stubborn allied resistance against the German invasion of Belgium in 1914 at the beginning of the first world war. It was an invasion that forced 250,000 Belgian refugees to get in boats and seek safety in Britain. They came. They were welcomed. They were cared for. This should be remembered, perhaps, as a lesson in kindness for us today.In the evening, I stood in the bitter cold under the Menin Gate as the Ypres fire brigade bugles played the Last Post, as they have done every evening since 1928, except during the German occupation of Belgium in the second world war. As the echoes faded, I thought of my uncle Pieter Cammaerts, who died in the second world war – in the RAF, aged 21, in 1941. Uncle Pieter is buried in the church at Radlett, his name is on the war memorial in the Hertfordshire town, but almost no one alive today knew him. He died two years before I was born and I know him only from photographs, from family stories. But so much of the reason I was standing under the gate, so much of why I had written my most recent book, In the Mouth of the Wolf, and War Horse and Private Peaceful, was because of my uncle Pieter, and my uncle Francis.My uncles have fascinated and inspired me since I was a child. In my family, their lives are legendary. All my writing life I had wanted to tell their story. Writing it was my way of trying to remember them, of acknowledging my debt to them, and all the millions of “mouthless dead” of two wars. They had fought for peace. I had enjoyed that peace in a Europe that, for the most part, had decided enough was enough, that war was not the way. I lived in a European Union. We members argued often, but no longer fought. Togetherness seemed to be working. Peace had become too precious. My uncles were among those who had enabled that reconciliation to happen.The two brothers, though very different – Francis, tall, confident and charismatic, Pieter, smaller, tentative and fragile – were close. They came from a Christian socialist family, their father, Emile, was a Belgian poet and free thinker, later art critic, philosopher and professor of Belgian studies at London University. Their mother, Tita, was an actor, a devoted Christian, a formidable and highly principled woman. There were four equally formidable sisters, my mother among them. It was a house of music, theatre and books, of heated discussion and strong opinions. Holidays were often spent walking in the Ardennes, which the family loved.Francis, a socialist and pacifist, went to Cambridge and became a teacher. Pieter went to Rada in London and was starting out on a promising career as an actor when war broke out in September 1939. He joined up almost at once. Francis, following his convictions, became a conscientious objector, and was sent to work as a shepherd on a Lincolnshire farm. The Germans were soon invading Belgium, through the family’s beloved Ardennes, and marching into France, towards the Channel. Invasion was threatening.In 1941, Pieter, now a sergeant observer in the RAF, was killed when his plane crashed in St Eval in Cornwall. The family were devastated. Francis, still shepherding but now a husband and father, decided he could no longer stand by while others were fighting for his family’s survival, and for the beliefs and freedoms that were so precious to him.He confided his dilemma to Harry Rée, his great friend, fellow teacher and pacifist, who, unbeknown to Francis, had already joined the Special Operations Executive, SOE. Francis spoke fluent French. Harry said that could be useful, and that he would put him in touch with someone in London. Francis walked into an interview in an upstairs room in Baker Street a shepherd, and came out an officer in the SOE.After months of gruelling training, during which he could say nothing to his wife, Nan, or his friends and family, Francis found himself in German occupied France. In Paris, he realised at once that fellow agents there were compromised. Within days more than 60 were rounded up and shot. Francis by this time had made his way south, where he found himself organising and supplying resistance fighters, the Maquis, across a swath of southern France, an army that in the end numbered more than 10,000 men and women, comprising communists, socialists and Gaullists, from all walks of life, all determined to rid their country of the invader.So this pacifist uncle was now a secret agent, fighting the enemy, living in constant danger of capture and death. But he proved to be an agent who had all the right instincts. Trust, he knew, was everything. He had seen others’ mistakes. He picked his few friends with great care. He was courageous, and scrupulous about security, never sleeping more than two nights in one place. He inspired and gave great loyalty.The Germans put a huge price on his head, but he was never betrayed. He managed to outwit both the Gestapo and their counterparts in the dreaded French Milice, and survived these perilous years through his skill and bravery, but also through the love and courage of his comrades. He returned after the liberation of France to his family, and to his life as a headteacher, and a principal of teacher-training colleges in England and in Botswana.When Francis was an old man, I visited him in Le Pouget, the village in south-east France where he came to live in his latter years, to be closer to his family and his old friends from the resistance. Only if pressed would he speak of his war years. Two weeks before he died, the villagers gave him a 90th birthday party. The children sang, the mayor made a speech. He was a legend there, too, not only in his family.More and more I wanted to tell his story. It was important to the family and to me, especially now Britain had decided to leave the European Union. The Mouth of the Wolf begins with an old Englishman being given a 90th birthday party by the people of his French village. Tired, he goes to bed and remembers those people who could not be there with him that day. He talks to them, remembers with them the joys and the sorrows. But it was difficult, I found, to settle to my writing in the midst of the post-referendum furore. It came to me as I was trying to weave the story of my two uncles, that in all the bitter bickering about Europe, few if any were talking about why the EU was there, how it came to be. My uncles had done what they had done to defeat tyranny, to bring peace and reconciliation. They knew, we all know, that for hundreds of years, thousands even, European states had fought one another. Trade wars, religious wars, power grabs, land grabs, disputes between kings and emperors – our continent has been almost constantly at war over the centuries.In the last century, the inclination of the great European powers towards belligerence and self-destruction led us into the two most destructive wars the world has ever known. Then, out of the rubble, out of all the grieving and misery, France and Germany, the two great nations at the heart of these titanic struggles, decided that the only way to ensure peace was through trade that if they created close, mutually beneficial links, there would never be any need or wish to fight, that prosperity, security and peace would be interlocked.Soon, six nations gathered together to create this trading bloc. Europe’s peoples could see the sense of this. More wanted to join. So the new Europe, changing its name and much else besides, grew in numbers, grew closer, and did help to bring lasting peace. But it became bureaucratic, less democratic, put ever more stars on its flag, and created a new currency. The mutual benefits of prosperity and stability were evident, but were not shared equitably. We were a member of a club in which we felt we were losing control over our destiny, where the rules were being changed, which alarmed many. We argued, all the countries argued. But it was still jaw-jaw, not war-war.In this febrile atmosphere came the referendum. I was sure the people would vote to stay in because I thought British people valued peace above all else, and the prosperity most had enjoyed for so long. Yes, there was plenty we did not like about Europe, but we would stay and put that right. I was wrong. But I am sure, too, that the country was wrong, deluded by lies and statistics, by absurd promises. I feel we are now travelling down a path that takes us away from our friends and neighbours. We have told them we don’t like them, that we wish to orce them. They are hurt, upset, angry. Why wouldn’t they be?My uncles’ lives taught me that peace must come first, before prosperity. They helped make Europe a place of peace at last, of free peoples. That’s the Europe, with all its faults, I believe we belong to. That Channel of ours has saved us in the past, often. Now it threatens to separate us. Holding hands across the sea is the only way. It always was. My uncles knew that.• In the Mouth of the Wolf is published by Egmont.

That is the fundamental lesson of the past six years – from the open, compassionate and pluralist spirit of the 2012 London Olympics, via the Tories’ surprise victory in 2015 and the nativist vote for Brexit in 2016, to Jeremy Corbyn’s unexpected surge in last year’s general election.The oscillation is bewildering, the runes unreadable. Which is why smarter Tories do not buy for a second the notion that we have reached “peak Corbyn” – a silly attempt to graft branding jargon on to nuanced psephological reality.Yes, Labour failed to take Barnet, Wandsworth and Westminster in last week’s local contests, and should be concerned about its failure to make much progress outside London. But the party denied the Tories control of Trafford, took Plymouth, and – according to the BBC – would be the largest party in the House of Commons if the results were replicated in a general election.What has been scotched (or should have been) is the no less silly myth of impregnable destiny that has gripped some parts of the Labour left since the Tories lost their majority. There is no direction to history, no teleology in a complex democracy. To say that Labour has a lot more to do to win – as Alastair Campbell and others did on Saturday – is not to reassert Blairite values, defend neoliberalism, or declare the Iraq war a roaring success. Least of all is it a “smear”. This is all about the hard grind of gaining power, the door-to-door trials that face any opposition if it is to become a government.William Hague has observed that the Tory party has two default positions: complacency and panic. It is fair to say that Conservatives are panicking a little less than they were a week ago. They have been reminded that Corbyn is a man rather than a shaman, that his path to No 10 is not mystically ordained. But, in private at least, they are uncertain what to do with this information, how to turn it into useful political action.Let us say that Theresa May does not fight the next general election as Tory leader, but aspires to remain in office until at least 29 March 2019, when Britain leaves the European Union. The most important question facing the party after her departure – more important than the identity of her successor – is the trajectory it chooses to follow when she is gone.You would need a heart of stone not to laugh at the decline of the movement formerly known as Nigel\u0026nbspFarage’s fan club. It is glorious that Ukip should now be self-identifying as the Black Death: the words of its general secretary. But the Tory party must at all costs avoid becoming the willing host to its contagion. The defining characteristic of the Ukip voter – past or present – is implacability. No Brexit will be hard enough, no immigration reform tough enough, no recoil from progress fierce enough to please them.It follows that a strategy designed to appease this tranche of the electorate is not only (in my view) terrible for the country but also (as a matter of fact) entirely pointless. If the post-May party becomes hostage to the spirit of Farage – and some say it already is – then it will lose the next general election, and deserve to do so.Ours is a deeply erse society, economically dependent upon immigration and culturally enriched by it. The Tory party has been wrestling with this fairly straightforward reality for more than 20 years now. What was once called “modernisation” is now in fairly obvious retreat: ask those affected by or – a much more numerous group – appalled at the Windrush scandal and the government’s handling of it.To win a majority again, the party has to persuade (for a start) young, urban, socially liberal and ethnic minority voters that it does not hate them. This is, to put it mildly, no easy task.Last week’s elections were a minor tremor alerting the political class to the tectonic uncertainty that still lies beneath. The Tories have been awakened from their fatalistic stupor and reminded they have a choice. What matters more, of course, is that the rest of us do too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0b57093fe2a030984998ff01a270f51bebd90c7/11_233_5456_3274/master/5456.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bf2409405e351cb61abcd221cc08cc40","title":"bank holiday public","story":"A Manchester Day for Manchester, a Kent Day for Kent? How about an Equal Rights Day? Let’s make public holidays matterBritain has many quaint bank holiday rituals, such as sitting in motorway traffic jams or stubbornly lying on the beach when the wind-chill is close to freezing. One of the more understandable is pointing out how few days off we have compared with many other countries and calling to have more of them. I beg to differ. We shouldn’t have more bank holidays, we should abolish them altogether.Bank holidays are a British idiosyncrasy that some former members of our empire continue to honour. Other countries don’t have more of them, they have public holidays instead. This is not a matter of mere terminology. A public holiday is a shared civic commemoration of something important for the society that celebrates it. These include Bastille Day in France, Liberation Day in Italy and Waitangi Day in New Zealand, which commemorates the signing of the nation’s founding treaty by the British Crown and Māori chiefs.Even in America, where there is no legal right to any days off work, many employers observe Labor Day, Thanksgiving, Memorial Day, Independence Day and Martin Luther King Day. These all remind citizens of some of the important people and moments in their history, helping to forge a shared identity. In the UK, apart from Christmas and Easter, our bank holidays celebrate nothing at all. For example, last Tuesday most countries in the world celebrated International Workers’ Day. We just worked. Today’s early May bank holiday is supposed to be a surrogate but it has never been widely seen as a special day for working people.Chosen wisely, public holidays could do important civic work. For decades politicians have been wringing their hands about the failure to create a clear sense of Britishness and Englishness. They might have noticed that the only national day officially celebrated in the UK is St Andrew’s Day in Scotland. Why not give Northern Ireland, England and Wales their own national holidays as well as creating another for the whole of the United Kingdom? Allowing regions to have their own public holidays could help to foster local identities and boost civic pride. Some will be more enthusiastically embraced than others: I imagine Manchester Day would be a huge party. Kent Day would get people thinking more about what they love about the garden of England.The national conversation about which days to celebrate would itself provoke a valuable civic conversation. Many would champion International Women’s Day. A better option might be a day for equal rights which could honour all historically disadvantaged groups. As well as being a reminder of the work that still has to be done, it would hopefully over time become more of a celebration of what has been achieved.Adding non-Christian holidays to Christmas and Easter is tempting but impractical. The way to recognise all faiths and none is to give every citizen the right to take one or two days off a year for occasions of personal significance, no questions asked. A Jew could choose Passover, a Hindu Diwali, a Muslim Eid, a Sikh the birthday of Guru Nanak, and an atheist the anniversary of the release of Monty Python’s Life of Brian.Of course the creation of these holidays would run the risk of being politicised. But a non-partisan commission could be charged with making the decisions, ensuring our new national holidays are unifying, not isive.The right to paid leave should be part of the change from bank to public holidays. At the moment, workers have an annual entitlement of 5.6 weeks but no right to insist on taking it on bank holidays. Making time off mandatory for public holidays would reinforce their civic significance. If that means fewer shops open, depriving many of their preferred bank holiday entertainment, so be it. If they had something real to celebrate they might be less inclined to spend the day shopping anyway.The final change should be an end to the rule that makes all public holidays except Christmas and Good Friday fall on a Monday. This is part and parcel of the crudely utilitarian ethos of bank holidays, which are designed begrudgingly to ensure that if we must take time off it should interfere as little as possible with the usual routines of production and commerce.Other nations are more relaxed. In a lot of countries, when a holiday falls on a Tuesday or Thursday many take the day between it and the weekend off. In France, Italy, Portugal and Spain this is called “making the bridge”, in Sweden it’s a “squeeze day”, while in Chile they “take the sandwich”. If a day is truly important it should be celebrated whenever it falls. Taking time off seriously would challenge the Protestant work ethic assumption that we live to work, signalling that as a nation we believe that we work to live.• Julian Baggini is a British philosopher and the author of several books about philosophy, including A Short History of Truth (Quercus).

At first glance, it could be a pretty solid adult choice for boredom or sleep. Yet the Douyin video platform in China deems its influence to be a potentially harmful one, due to its growing popularity among the country’s shehuiren. That’s anti-establishment “gangster” internet users to some, or people who like memes and get tattoos of asinine cartoon characters because it’s a bit funny to others.Like people who spend a lot of time on Tumblr, Reddit, or 4chan, ironic Peppa Pig fans probably aren’t a danger to the continuation of humanity as we know it. They might need tattoo-removal services at some point, but a government ban on the cartoons they like, as well as their associated hashtags, is a bit much. For many here in the UK, the ban in China has been taken as bizarre and hilarious. Peppa as a figurehead for “unruly slackers”, a cult-like hero calling society’s disaffected to rebel? The cartoon? It’s always been a pedestrian watch, probably even for the generation of children it was designed for. To kids watching who come from single-parent families, have two mums, or are living in foster homes, Peppa Pig’s cosily conservative family set-up may be as otherworldly as talking pigs and rabbits.  But despite Peppa being so safe – almost antiquated, even – all the sniggering about its ban from China’s media platforms is what’s truly bizarre. Because it shouldn’t be surprising at all. A group of adults using the creation or censorship of children’s entertainment to further their own political and moral values isn’t unheard of it’s almost de rigueur, everywhere. There have been understandable examples of censure, such as the episode of the 90s cartoon Gargoyles on gun crime, which was subsequently cut to remove the blood. Even though blood usually happens after a gunshot. And gunshots tend to happen in television episodes that have been commissioned to focus on guns. An episode of TaleSpin was also taken off air, in this case because of its terrorism theme. Yes the adults who created it animated Baloo to fight against terrorism. In a children’s TV show. Going further back, there’s 1818-47’s The History of the Fairchild Family’s subsequent fall out of regular circulation … because it included a gibbet-side lesson where a child is shown the hanged corpse of a criminal. Adults of the time wanted children to know that criminals deserved to be hanged. If the adults in charge aren’t stealthily dripping their own politics into children’s entertainment, they’re banning it afterwards when it includes politics they don’t agree with. This is what media for children is, because it’s created, and censored, by adults for the adults they want to see in the future. It’s gentle (sometimes not so gentle) social conditioning, and always has been. Politics but, ya know, for kids.  The reporting of this ban with its undertone of “isn’t China weird and funny compared to us – how ridiculous” ignores all this how politics are used during the creation of entertainment for children, and afterwards by politicians themselves. This isn’t even Peppa’s first foray into the world of politics she was part of the promotion of the Labour government’s Sure Start programme back in 2010. One episode of the show was banned by the Australian Broadcasting Company for fear it would encourage children to interact with dangerous spiders. The columnist Piers Akerman even accused the programme of pushing “a weird feminist line”. So China’s ban is not unprecedented, nor ridiculous. Not even when it involves innocent little Peppa and her brother George. The innocuous fictional world of Peppa Pig might seem too far removed from our own to become a symbol of unrest, or moral decay in society, but like much media before it, we create it, we consume it, we use it, and we ban it. What is children’s entertainment but a means to prepare our children for the world? And what is the world but a messed-up mire of warring politics created by angry grown-ups? Children need to be ready for this wherever they live – welcome to adulthood, kids.

Far from being an innocent defence of Enlightenment values, the protest seemed more a Trojan horse for the ideas of the far right to insert themselves into the political mainstream. The demonstration was a response to former EDL leader Tommy Robinson’s permanent ban from Twitter, and featured figures such as Anne Marie Waters, Milo Yiannopoulos, and Gerard Batten of Ukip.I’m not sure that British mainstream politics has quite taken the growing presence of the far right across Europe and the US seriously enough, or indeed the fact that British far-right and socially conservative groups are overtly and deliberately adopting the tactics of their allies across the pond. Claiming freedom of speech as a value is something the American far right has been doing for years (aided and abetted by liberal dupes, naturally) Britain has also recently had an escalation in protests outside abortion clinics. “They are starting to resemble more and more the tactics that you’d see in the United States: graphic imagery, more aggressive approaches to people,” said John Hansen Brevetti, clinical operations manager at a clinic in Ealing, west London.It’s important to understand that these protests aren’t simply inidual opportunistic acts, but part of a growing narrative embraced by social conservatives and the far right that the nation has been corrupted by elites, who are simultaneously destroying the economy and damaging society with their decadent liberal values. These elites, argue these protesters, are censoring ordinary people from expressing reasonable opinions, and forcing women to abort their children when other options might be available. Or as Tommy Robinson put it when he addressed the rally: “The people of this country have been silenced for 20-30 years with the tag of racists. They have managed to silence people so that they are too scared to speak up when they see things that are wrong.”Robinson is tapping into that hoary old Nixonian trope, “the silent majority”. Central to these culture wars, then, is who “the majority” is and which groups can claim to speak for it. No one can claim to have found the perfect oppositional response to the culture wars, but in light of Robinson’s argument, it’s probably a bad idea for the opposition to set itself up as a group that represents only minorities. Instead, perhaps the aim should be to redefine who the majority are, through collective struggle, solidarity and a movement that makes itself welcoming to, and represented by, all demographics in society.Whatever the response to the weekend’s rally is, it can’t come soon enough. Nigel Farage’s triumphalist meetings with Marine Le Pen, the far-right AfD in Germany, and Donald Trump should tell us all that this is a concerted international nationalist project that correctly sees itself as insurgent. And preceding every far-right victory is a political mainstream that didn’t take it seriously enough. Let’s not allow that to happen again."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/46599382d6ecfc11b2a6cea8e2302be504f1af86/500_422_2974_1784/master/2974.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef940c6fdb76e00ec324ec8b1e37fc6f","title":"peak unicorn bank holiday","story":"First the cats came for the internet, and I did not speak out.

Unicorns have infiltrated society more successfully than if the Russian election web fiends and Cambridge Analytica had got together and hatched a plan over a glass or three of gin (unicorn-themed, of course).Unicorns are ubiquitous. There’s a pastel-coloured epidemic of glittery, rainbow, twee awfulness. Fancy an adult-sized unicorn onesie, a shower cap to “keep your hair as perfect as a unicorn’s mane”, light-up unicorn slippers, your own personalised unicorn meme, a unicorn trophy, or even a unicorn outfit for your dog or cat?As for those men and women sporting sparkly T-shirts with that lame trope: “Always be yourself, unless you can be a unicorn, then be a unicorn.” NO! Listen to yourself. Unicorns don’t exist – so you’re basically saying you’re no better than a puff of air (at the same time as sporting an atrocious fashion choice). Just because they are legendary creatures it doesn’t make them legends.What are these mythical monsters anyway? One story says that they existed, but were simply too late to get aboard Noah’s ark when the great flood came. I’d call that lazy. Japan has its own unicorn, called kirin, which is a kind of wild vigilante – rampaging around seeking out baddies and then brutally piercing them through their hearts with their sharp horns. That’s neither sweet nor cuddly. “Always be yourself, unless you can be a unicorn, then be a murderous vigilante” doesn’t have quite the same ring to it.The most likely explanation for this fake folklore-y freak is that someone somewhere with a touch of myopia saw a one-horned, ordinary animal, such as the deer discovered in Italy in 2008, and blew the whole thing out of proportion.So this bank holiday, make a pledge to stand firm in the face of the equine invasion. Desist from further rainbow frippery, rise up, grab this issue by the horn – and step away from the unicorn."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ed6596e6c1d144d90bc7fc9dfa5fa0d425e676c/607_182_3260_1957/master/3260.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a09f093226f13b2c90eaae2df6c76109","title":"stephen hawking god multiverse cosmology","story":"Scientists have discovered a surprising fact about our universe in the past 40 years: against incredible odds, the numbers in basic physics are exactly as they need to be to accommodate the possibility of life. If gravity had been slightly weaker, stars would not have exploded into supernovae, a crucial source of many of the heavier elements involved in life. Conversely, if gravity had been slightly stronger, stars would have lived for thousands rather than billions of years, not leaving enough time for biological evolution to take place. This is just one example – there are many others – of the “fine-tuning” of the laws of physics for life.Some philosophers think the fine-tuning is powerful evidence for the existence of God. However, in his 2010 book The Grand Design (co-authored with Leonard Mlodinow), Stephen Hawking defended a naturalistic explanation of fine-tuning in terms of the multiverse hypothesis. According to the multiverse hypothesis, the universe we live in is just one of an enormous, perhaps infinite, number of universes. If there are enough universes then it becomes not so improbable that at least one will chance upon the right laws for life.The problem is that the less variety there is among the universes, the less capable the multiverse hypothesis is of explaining fine-tuning. If there is a huge amount of variation in the laws across the multiverse, it is not so surprising that one of the universes would happen to have fine-tuned laws. But if all of the universes have exactly the same laws – as in Hawking and Hertog’s proposal – the problem returns, as we now need an explanation of why the single set of laws that govern the entire multiverse is fine-tuned.Hertog seems not to agree, arguing that the paper does make progress on fine-tuning: “This paper takes one step towards explaining that mysterious fine-tuning ... It reduces the multiverse down to a more manageable set of universes which all look alike.” However, this merely puts off the explanation of fine-tuning, for the result is that the laws underlying the generation of the multiverse are fine-tuned. We now need to explain not only why our universe is fine-tuned but why every universe is fine-tuned! In terms of explaining the fine-tuning, this is not a step forward but a step back.All is not lost. Hawking was exploring models of the multiverse based on inflationary cosmology, and his paper casts doubt on the potential of this kind of multiverse to explain fine-tuning. But there is another source of scientific support for a multiverse theory: the “many worlds” interpretation of quantum mechanics. While physicists have been exploring inflationary explanations of fine-tuning, philosophers of physics have been exploring quantum mechanical explanations of fine-tuning. If, in the earliest period of our universe, our laws were shaped by the right kind of probabilistic process, the many worlds theory could furnish us with enough variety of laws across the many worlds so as to make it likely that one would be fine-tuned. We don’t yet have evidence that our laws were shaped by such a process. But if the alternative is the postulation of a supernatural creator, then this seems like the more plausible proposal.There is still hope for a scientific account of fine-tuning. However, by ruling out one of the two scientifically credible options for doing this, Hawking and Hertog have slightly strengthened the alternative explanation in terms of God. It is ironic that the atheist Hawking should, in his final contribution to the science, make God’s existence less improbable.• Philip Goff is the author of Consciousness and Fundamental Reality"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a1504c3ab093f4a17da9162c219ebb00832ea5d6/0_196_5100_3059/master/5100.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=960a18239c41b2575229e549b2790dee","title":"get the lowdown on ottawa a local reveals all","story":"Queen Victoria may have picked Ottawa out of obscurity to name it the capital of Canada but the city has grown into a modern metropolis packed with award-winning restaurants, stunning architecture and a local population that loves to embrace the outdoorsWhen Queen Victoria picked Ottawa to be the capital of Canada it was an unimposing frontier town: the city has since grown into a modern metropolis packed with award-winning restaurants, stunning architecture and a local population that’s all about the outdoors.Whatever the weather, Ottawites embrace all four seasons. On lazy, hazy summer Sundays, stretches of the Sir John A Macdonald Parkway are closed to traffic and become a pedestrian haven. Why not join the dog walkers and bicyclists, in-line skaters and joggers alongside the beaches and rapids of the Ottawa river? You can paddle the rivers that frame the city – the Ottawa, Gatineau or Rideau – or enjoy the wildlife in urban parks or the much-loved Greenbelt, around 20,000 hectares (around 49,500 acres) of farms, forests and wetlands that surrounds the capital. In May, admire the rich colours of the Canadian Tulip Festival it’s the world’s largest, with over a million orange, red and yellow flowers.In winter, locals descend en masse to skate on Ottawa’s central Rideau canal. The world’s largest naturally frozen ice-skating route is home to a hardy crowd who chow down on Beavertails (that’s a pastry, not an animal’s tail), pull on cosy clothes and toques (wool hats), and glide along for nearly 5 miles (around 7.8 km). For three weekends in February, the Winterlude festival brings ice sculptures, foodie events and a children’s Snowflake Kingdom.Thanks to it’s historical significance, Ottawa is not short of imposing buildings. Admire the vaulting neo-gothic spires of Parliament Hill, the crystal tower of the National Gallery of Canada and, just across the river in the twin city of Gatineau, the Canadian Museum of History, the design of which is inspired by Canada’s topography.The Hill is also the centre point for Canada Day, Canada’s birthday celebrations every 1 July. Expect to find a stage showcasing Canadian musicians, followed by fireworks at night. Watch from the Hill or behind the Fairmont Château Laurier, the historic “castle”, opened as a grand hotel in 1912. Parliament’s central Peace Tower is perfect for a bird’s-eye panorama of the city visit on Wednesdays at noon in summer for free yoga sessions in front of parliament on the lawn. Keep your eyes peeled: you might just see prime minister Justin Trudeau and his wife Sophie Grégoire Trudeau joining in.There’s a vibrant restaurant scene in Ottowa. Explore the eclectic cuisine of Canadian Culinary Champion Marc Lepine, the only chef to win the Gold Medal Plates competition twice, at his restaurant Atelier or the innovative Middle Eastern fare of Walid El-Tawel at Fairouz.City neighbourhoods are equally exciting and eminently walkable. ByWard Market is arguably the most vibrant, with more than 120 places to eat and drink in a four-block-by-four-block patch that’s also home to a great selection of shops. Also try Westboro and the Glebe, where you’ll find Lansdowne, a complex with a year-round farmers’ market and a new stadium where you can catch sports events downtown. Ottawa’s museum and gallery scene reflects Canadians’ past and future hopes. Gatineau’s Canadian Museum of History’s Grand Hall with its towering totem poles captures the lasting presence of indigenous cultures, while the museum’s new Canadian History Hall presents the largest and most comprehensive exhibition about Canadian history ever created. In contrast, quirky Bytown Museum reveals the history of Ottawa . Here you can discover the military raison d’être of the Rideau canal – a Unesco world heritage site – as you learn about its construction after the British colony’s war of 1812 with the US.

The environmental fashion campaigner, who grew up in Italy, remembers hand washing her sweaters each summer, carefully storing them away, then unpacking them the following winter. She would wear them year after year so she had to look after them. This was before fast, disposable fashion she says, “We did it a different way.”These days, as the founder of Eco-Age, a brand consultancy firm that works with luxury fashion labels on improving their sustainability credentials, and as someone who makes frequent appearances on the red carpet alongside her Oscar-winning husband actor Colin Firth, she has an expanded wardrobe – yet it’s probably not as big as you may imagine. In 2010 Firth came up with the Green Carpet Challenge, using her visibility in front of the world’s media to wear only ethical, sustainable and repurposed fashion, and she’s often photographed repeatedly wearing the same gowns as part of her #30wears pledge.She was a long way from Hollywood’s red carpets last year when she travelled to Tasmania to meet some of Australia’s top merino wool growers and learn about the production of wool. Each year she travels to a different country to learn more about the global supply chain. “You can never replace the real experience of meeting people and seeing things with your own eyes.” Recently she’s visited Bangladesh to meet the garment factory workers and Brazil to meet the leather farmers threatening the Amazon leather.The trip to Tasmania was “facilitated” by Woolmark, the Australian company that promotes the use of merino wool around the world, and her experiences were captured in a short documentary Fashionscapes: Forever Tasmania She says she didn’t know what to expect. “You have images of huge herds of sheep overgrazing and intensively reared and then we ended up in this landscape.” Tasmanian farmers like Matt and Vanessa Dunbabin of Bangor farm, who farm merino sheep, prime beef and prime lamb, and Roderic O’Connor, who runs the wool farm Connorville met with her, and she says she found their careful approach to land conservation and sustainable wool production inspiringThe controversial practice of mulesing is a significant issue for the industry, with international wool buyers pushing farmers to phase it out, not least because of customer concerns. Firth asked the farmers about it, and on camera O’Connor says the industry is looking for solutions, through breeding and by using pain relief. For Firth it remains an ethical dilemma. “It’s not a nice practice but if it is done properly it saves the sheep’s life and a death from hell.”The industry is also seen as having a significant environmental impact thanks to pesticide use, greenhouse gas emissions and, in some cases, overgrazing. The washing, dyeing and treatment of wool can also have an impact. Yet the wool industry is pushing back, saying the life cycle assessment tools often used by the fashion industry don’t measure the full supply chain. Woolmark points out that wool is natural, renewable and biodegradable. Firth was convinced, saying that wool comes out on top when compared to the evils of synthetic fibres, which shed microplastics each time they are washed and are not biodegradable. “If you throw away a wool sweater, it composes in the ground very quickly, and it doesn’t waste microfibres when you wash it.”The day before our interview was the fifth anniversary of the Rana Plaza tragedy, when the collapse of the garment factories killed 1134 workers. Firth recently visited Bangladesh and she was disheartened to see how little has changed for the fast fashion industry. “There are new Bangladeshs every day,” she says. “Today all the big guys have just moved to Ethiopia to produce in a country where there is not even minimum wage so the story repeats itself in terms of the businesses and how they produce.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/30fa24ebea2b21ee16fe403caa084534da14a0bd/0_521_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=471021b6e6aac7a897c52b8e714b95f0","title":"good day sunshine what to wear in may in pictures","story":"As the old adage goes, ‘Ne’er cast a clout till May be out’ – here’s how you can transition your look from spring to summer without being caught out by a cold snap"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75d1ebc99fa0eebca93e813c70e372bbed6766ed/0_0_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a1151eff6e6dc8953792193dfa402650","title":"lean on pete review andrew haigh modern american odyssey charlie plummer","story":"British director Andrew Haigh’s modern American odyssey sees Charlie Plummer excel as a teen fleeing grim realitiesA performance of remarkable depth, candour and vulnerability by rising star Charlie Plummer lies at the heart of this terrifically moving fourth feature film from British writer-director Andrew Haigh. Adapted from the 2010 novel by Willy Vlautin, Lean on Pete blends timeless American myths with pin-point portrayals of modern urban hardship, as its lonely teenage lead heads east from Oregon with a horse on its last hurrah. The travails are tough but there’s an unsentimental tenderness at the centre of Haigh’s movie – a melancholic counterpoint to the grim realities of life from which our young hero flees.Plummer plays Charley Thompson, a lanky 15-year-old (he lies about his age) who has moved home umpteen times with his single father, Ray (Travis Fimmel). With dreams of playing for the high-school football team blighted by a nomadic lifestyle, Charley has become a loner who has learned to fend for himself. Running past the Portland Meadows racetrack, he meets Steve Buscemi’s trainer, Del Montgomery, who offers him a few bucks to change a tyre and help with his horses. “Never let go of the rope,” Del tells Charley an instruction that seems to double as a diehard life lesson.A diffident yet attentive presence, Charley has a trusting nature and finds a kindred spirit in the eponymous quarter horse, a former short-sprint winner (“Don’t blink or you’ll miss it”). The endearingly named Lean on Pete is showing signs of age, and Del is getting ready to send him, euphemistically, “to Mexico”. “You can’t get attached to a horse,” says Bonnie (Chloë Sevigny), a jockey who has suffered her fair share of injuries, and who observes tellingly that “there’s only so many times you can fall down, right?” But when all hope seems lost, Charlie hits the trail with his one true friend, heading for Wyoming and searching for somewhere to call home.Vlautin’s novel has been described by critics as a distant descendant of Walter Farley’s The Black Stallion, with shades of Salinger and Steinbeck. There is a quote from the latter at the start of the novel that Haigh has clearly taken to heart. “It is true that we are weak and sick and ugly and quarrelsome,” Steinbeck wrote, “but if that is all we ever were, we would millenniums ago have disappeared from the face of the Earth.” Haigh paints sympathetic portraits of all the characters the good, the bad and the ugly. Ray may not be an ideal father, but there’s a tangible tenderness in the scenes with his son, and a sense of closeness that persists even during his frequent absences. Del is a world-weary chancer who dopes, exploits and then dumps his horses, yet there’s a gruff paternal affection in his advice to Charley to “do something else before there’s nothing else you can do”. Even Steve Zahn’s drunken drifter Silver has a child-like quality that is counterposed with a violent tinderbox temper.After the tight focus of Weekend and 45 Years (which the director described as “companion piece” pictures), Haigh widens his canvas as Charley heads into the desert, embarking upon an American odyssey to which Danish cinematographer Magnus Nordenhof Jønck responds with lyrical grandeur. While the narrative may be read as a coming-of-age story, there’s something more elemental in Charley’s search for a beloved aunt, who comes to represent his idealised yearning for a lost family life. Crucially, Charley remains at the centre of the picture, with the oblong 1.85 frame lending a human dimension to these expansive vistas, ensuring that we don’t get distracted by the scenery, or lose sight of the true focus of the story.Unsurprisingly, Lean on Pete is a film in which gestures are more important than words. Having declared in passing that “You won’t see me again in California”, Del shoots Charley a glance that speaks volumes about his shady past. As for Charley, he may have been schooled in Sam Shepard-style manly “truths” (“The best women have all been waitresses at some point,” Ray tells him between beers), but his voice has a lilting softness, which matches the expressiveness of his face. At times, there’s a touch of James Dean in Plummer’s plaintive delivery, along with echoes of Jon Voight’s marooned hustler in Midnight Cowboy. Having made a splash in Felix Thompson’s 2015 indie-pic King Jack, Plummer has proved a mercurial presence in films as erse as Oren Moverman’s The Dinner andmore recently Ridley Scott’s All the Money in the World. In Lean on Pete, this rising star proves his mettle in a role for which he is simply perfect."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/76461176c10d3d5d9f00bec8a378a594730acefe/0_60_1764_1058/master/1764.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9ef02736306f7d801ceec03899baa617","title":"south east london nil by mouth bromley boys thor 2 six","story":"South-east London isn’t always the perfect match for the glamour of the big screen. With The Bromley Boys on the horizon, here are six brave productions that buck the trendWhen a film is set in London, it can often feel like the whole thing was directed by the tourist board. There’ll be an aerial shot of the London Eye. The Shard will glint in the background. There’ll be taxis by the bucketload. If you’re shooting Basic Instinct 2: Risk Addiction, characters will attend aggressively sexualised therapy sessions right at the top of the Gherkin. It’s all very narrow and heavy on the landmarks.Sometimes the suburbs get a look-in, but not all of them. North and west London may have featured in everything from Shaun of the Dead to Bend It Like Beckham, and east London might have been used as a shorthand for grit in films like The Long Good Friday and Ill Manors. But south-east London rarely gets a mention.True, plenty of films are shot in south-east London – The Da Vinci Code had scenes shot at Biggin Hill airport Johnny Depp’s Dark Shadows was partly filmed in Beckenham Place Park – but very few films are actually about south-east London.This is why something like The Bromley Boys feels so refreshing. It hasn’t even been released yet but, simply by being about Bromley FC, it promises a glimpse at a London that passes the rest of the world by. Maybe a character will go running through the Glades shopping centre. Maybe they’ll get to register a death at the Civic Centre or ride around on the 138 to Chestnut Avenue. Maybe the action will venture out as far as Chislehurst Caves, although technically they aren’t in Bromley proper and so any inclusion in The Bromley Boys will be an almighty slap in the face to all true Bromleians.But with so few movies dedicated to life in London’s forgotten corner, what can we learn about the area from the productions that actually went there? Let’s find out.Kidbrooke’s Ferrier Estate provided the backdrop for Gary Oldman’s punishing 1997 ode to relentless miserable violence, famed for containing the word “cunt” more than any other film in history. It’s less a tourism advert and more a dire warning for the rest of the world to permanently partition London off. However, film fans had better brace themselves for disappointment, because Ferrier Estate no longer exists. It’s since been replaced by the Kidbrooke Village development, where a one-bed flat now costs close to half a million pounds. If anyone ever makes a sequel to Nil By Mouth, there’s a good chance it’ll feature Ray Winstone petitioning the council to build a nice Waitrose or a pop-up small-batch candlestick retail installation.Although poor Croydon is used in a lot of films – Delta Point became Gotham general hospital in The Dark Knight Rises, for example – not many films actually want to be about Croydon. But the Neil Gaiman adaptation How to Talk to Girls at Parties is both set and filmed there, and it features real-life locations such as the College Green, the multi-storey carpark near College Green and St George’s Walk shopping parade. Of course, it should be pointed out that Croydon is very obviously just a placeholder for miserable suburban nothingness, but Croydonites are probably already quite used to that.There’s an enormous chance that you haven’t seen Jamie Thraves’ Treacle Jr, which came and went in the blink of an eye eight years ago. But it’s nevertheless worth seeking out, because you’d be hard pushed to find a prettier depiction of London’s hidden gems. There are scenes set in Peckham Rye Common and scenes set in West Dulwich, there’s Goose Green and Herne Hill and Walworth. Locals will be thrilled to see the distinctive Sainsbury’s car park on Dog Kennel Hill. Best of all, there’s a lovely sequence set in the Horniman Museum. All films should contain lovely sequences set in the Horniman Museum.Written by Quadrophenia’s Martin Stellman, Babylon, directed by Franco Rosso, is nothing less than south-east London’s Saturday Night Fever. Aswad’s Brindsley Forde plays a garage hand who lives for the Deptford sound system culture at night, encountering racism, violence and police brutality along the way. Again, it’s worth pointing out that Babylon was released 38 years ago, and its depiction of south-east London has now become completely unrecognisable. For example, a Time Out list from 2016 entitled 15 Reasons to Visit Deptford High Street had in first place an Instagram of some nice cocktails sold by a Jamaican-themed bar. I’m sure the guy from Aswad would be thrilled.Imagine if Michael Caine had survived the end of Get Carter, then slowly went a bit cantankerous on a Walworth housing estate. Got it? Great, because that means you never have to watch Harry Brown, in which Michael Caine vigilante-murders a load of men in hoodies as brutally as he can. Again – and I realise that this is becoming something of a theme here – Harry Brown was filmed on an estate that no longer exists. It has since been redeveloped into something called Elephant Park where, like Kidbrooke Village, a one-bedroom apartment will cost you half a million quid.The lousiest Marvel movie featured several key scenes set in south-east London. Coincidence? We may never know. However, if you enjoy seeing famous landmarks getting blown to smithereens, this is the film for you. The Greenwich Old Royal Naval College gets the absolute hell beaten out of it at the climax of this film. In fact, the destruction was so comprehensive that developers have now transformed the site into a luxury housing scheme called Navy Halls, where a dot-sized one-bedroom apartment will now cost you three times more than you will ever earn in your entire life. It’s the south-east London way, after all."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bee958146b5e8bc6e58f5bcd69015b5ecfffe0f4/0_195_5535_3320/master/5535.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=36a58d7cc141eedb3e6fdef2119886d5","title":"patrick oconnell barcelona real betis campaign film recognition","story":"Like absolutely no other middle-aged IT systems analysts from Dublin, Fergus Dowd went to a Blyth Spartans match and wound up spearheading an international campaign to resurrect the memory of a former Manchester United captain who saved Barcelona from extinction. Sometimes, apparently, it takes an extraordinary Irishman to tell the story of an extraordinary Irishman.Patrick O’Connell, a footballer with what might be classed as scoundrel tendencies as well as qualities that enabled him to become a heroic manager, had lain in an unmarked London grave for 57 years until Dowd heard about his singular life and decided to rally, with almost Geldofian zeal, the football world into action. The story of how he and a trio of other not-so-average football fans did that, and of O’Connell’s exploits during some of the bloodiest episodes of 20th century Europe, are the subject of Don Patricio, a documentary by the Danish director Michael Andersen that will be shown for the first time next Monday in Dublin before being screened around Britain and Spain (also available here). covered O’Connell four years ago as part of our Forgotten Stories series and mentioned that Dowd was raising funds for a headstone for the former manager’s grave in St Mary’s Catholic cemetery in north-west London. That was news to Andersen, whose previous films have dealt with conflicts in the former Soviet Union. “I’m a lifelong football fan and very interested in history and when I read about O’Connell I thought ‘this can’t be true, I’ve never heard of this guy’,” Andersen says. “So I got in touch with Fergus to check it out. I had no idea he would talk me into investing years of my life and all my children’s inheritance in making a film about O’Connell and the campaign to get him remembered.”Some people just make things happen. Dowd was first moved to raise awareness of O’Connell when trying to raise funds for Scott Bell, a Blyth Spartans striker who developed motor neurone disease (which eventually took his life in 2013). “I used to enjoy going to England to watch matches and when the Premier League got too expensive I started going to lower league games,” Dowd says.“From watching Spartans I got to know Scott – you can chat with players at the bar after these games – and when I heard about his illness, I wanted to help fund his treatment. I remembered my dad telling me about a Dubliner who had captained Manchester United, managed Barcelona and made Real Betis champions. So I tracked down his grandson, Mike O’Connell, and asked him to give a talk at Blyth. Nine hundred people came to the Spartans clubhouse and you could have heard a pin drop. The more details I heard, the more I realised how remarkable Patrick was. Given his achievements I thought it was shameful he lay in an unmarked grave and his story practically buried with him.”Dowd and three friends – Alan McLean from Dumbarton, Simon Needham from Leeds and Maureen O’Sullivan from Dublin – resolved to get a headstone for O’Connell. They contacted illustrious footballers to ask for signed jerseys to auction. Johan Cruyff, Paolo Maldini and many more donated. “I’d explain that Patrick was a legend who deserved similar status to them and when they heard about him they agreed,” says Dowd.Martin O’Neill was especially captivated. “I thought I might only get a couple of minutes to say my piece but he was fascinated and asked to photocopy my notes,” Dowd says.O’Connell’s tale has driven Dowd and his comrades around the world, including to Mexico, where O’Connell took Barcelona in 1937 to raise the money that prevented the club from going out of existence. “It’s been surreal,” Dowd says. “One day I was heading to work in Dublin and got a text saying: ‘Keep going, you’re doing a great job’. It was from Luís Figo. I don’t think he was talking about my IT skills.” And then there was the bust parade in Seville. With money left over after buying the headstone Dowd commissioned the sculptor Joe Moran to make a bust of O’Connell and present it to Real Betis, whom O’Connell led to their only Spanish title in 1935.The club arranged for the bust to be delivered in front of 30,000 people before a match – and suggested carrying it around the streets of Seville first. “So there we were walking around with this big bronze bust and people rushing over to kiss it,” Dowd says. He has since presented Barcelona’s president with a portrait of O’Connell by Tony Denton, a Mancunian who had taken up painting only six months previously after being advised it might help curb depression.

Alongside Alexandre Lacazette the duo showed how exciting Arsenal can still be even if Burnley looked like a team packed for their summer holidays as they made up the numbers, offering less energy than the post-match speeches, in what was effectively a testimonial at the Emirates. Wenger might rue the fact he missed bringing the Gabonese international Aubameyang to England earlier – a striker not deemed good enough by Milan in his youth would have made the perfect project for the outgoing manager – but he is still leaving behind something tangible for someone to work with for years to come. Will Unwin• Wenger says goodbye but ‘will cherish every moment I was here’The bounce effect from Carlos Carvalhal’s appointment in December is a distant memory for Swansea supporters after the events of the last few weeks but if anyone is capable of reviving his players before their crucial week then it is the enigmatic Portuguese. Tuesday’s meeting with Southampton will provide the former Sheffield Wednesday manager with an opportunity to take a giant stride towards safety before their last game of the season against Stoke. He will need to come up with his very best motivational tactics to rouse a group of players who appear bereft of confidence after seven matches without a win. Finding a regular source of goals has been the root cause of Swansea’s travails – they are the joint-lowest scorers in the ision – and Carvalhal must come up with a solution. Quickly. Ed AaronsThe majority inside the Amex Stadium ended Friday night euphoric, players conducting a lap of appreciation and a broad smile on the owner Tony Bloom’s face. Yet in among the giddy optimism came some sage words from the man who has masterminded the club’s first campaign back at this level. “The potential is there but it’s always best working under pressure,” Chris Hughton said. “The moment we think we have cracked this ision then it will be a huge awakening. If we are prepared to apply ourselves exactly the way we did this season, then we can develop as a club. I certainly won’t get carried away thinking this ision is easier than it is.” It is testament to the efforts of Bloom and Hughton that, after August, they never languished in the bottom three. Yet their manager’s realism will remain key to continued progress. Dominic FifieldAntonio Conte said before the game that squeezing the space afforded Liverpool’s attackers would be key to securing victory. His three-man defence did this expertly by sitting deep and allowing Liverpool to play in front of them. It meant Chelsea had very little possession in the first 30 minutes but Liverpool’s dangerous attacking trio rarely got behind Gary Cahill, Antonio Rüdiger and César Azpilicueta. The few chances Liverpool created were all from distance or taken under pressure. When teams defend deep Liverpool can struggle and while this might not be a problem in the Champions League final against Real Madrid, who can be expected to attack, it could certainly lead to a nervy final game against Brighton when a draw may not be enough to secure a top-four finish if Chelsea stay in form and win their last two games. Gregg BakowskiSouthampton had every right to be disappointed when Tom Davies’s last‑gasp equaliser deprived them of a valuable win – even Sam Allardyce admitted Everton had nicked a point they did not deserve. The scene after the final match of the season at Goodison, with Allardyce diplomatically absenting himself from a players’ lap of appreciation that took place in front of almost empty stands, did not augur well for next season, for the manager’s future, or for Everton’s eventual move to a new home. Allardyce knows what is missing, and it is not just a statement of support from the board. “Moving to a new stadium is the right thing to do but you need a winning team to make it work,” he said. “If West Ham were winning games and competing for the top six no one would be talking about their stadium, it wouldn’t matter. I’d rather look at the overall picture than today. Next season we will strive to get better.” Paul WilsonDavid Moyes took over a team flailing in 18th place when he replaced Slaven Bilic as West Ham’s manager in November. The players were unfit, the squad was full of holes and Moyes was seen as a busted flush. But he has found a way to survive, keeping his nerve despite the noxious atmosphere hanging over the club and it is surprising David Sullivan and David Gold, West Ham’s owners, are wondering whether to extend his contract, which runs out at the end of the season. More than anything, West Ham need stability. “Consistency is getting yourself a level of play and building it,” Moyes said after the 2-0 win against Leicester secured safety with two games to go. He did that for 11 years at Everton, finishing in the top eight nine times. What could possibly make a club as chaotic as West Ham think they are above him? Jacob SteinbergIn the first half David Wagner’s Huddersfield did something to Manchester City that has been rarely witnessed this season: when Ederson began to initiate a move as he so often does for Pep Guardiola’s side the visitors squeezed in as close as they could. This involved players around the edge of the City area and cramming their half. The result was the Brazilian hit the ball straight to Aaron Mooy, Huddersfield launched an instant attack and suddenly City were under pressure. The tactic was not sighted again given the flow of the match but perhaps here was something City’s opposition might adopt, at times, in future matches. City are so technically astute they can and will beat this trap on occasion. But it is surely worth exploring as an option next season given how much import Guardiola puts on his No 1 being a first point of play. Jamie Jackson• Guardiola still has his sights on points century for Manchester CityJack Butland was in tears after Stoke’s relegation was confirmed by Saturday’s 2-1 defeat to Crystal Palace. Tears of sadness but going by his comments after the match, tears of frustration too. “He inherited a squad where, unfortunately, there was ill‑discipline and players you cannot rely on,” he said, when asked about the manager, Paul Lambert. “I think the whole recruitment process needs looking at. There’s been transfers who aren’t even part of the squad for all kinds of reasons, whether it be discipline, lack of performance. Too many recent investments have been completely unused and that’s unacceptable. It’s been farcical really.” Butland said it was too early to discuss his future but there will be interest in one of the few Stoke players to look like they belong in the top flight. As for Stoke, the long road back starts now. Nick MillerAside from a memorable victory against Chelsea, Watford have not done much under Javi Gracia. A season of promise has fizzled out and the Spaniard has won only four of his 14 games since replacing Marco Silva. This 2-1 win against Newcastle on Saturday was Watford’s first since 3 March, preserving their Premier League status, but it remains to be seen if Gracia has done enough to earn a longer stay. “We’ll see after the last game if the club respects my contract,” he said. A diplomatic way of putting it but, no matter what happens to Gracia, Watford’s players look like they would benefit from being led down a clearer path. Whoever takes charge next season will inherit a talented squad but one prone to switching off. A capable team require a sense of purpose if they are to realise their potential. Jacob SteinbergWest Bromwich Albion’s dramatic victory against Tottenham at the Hawthorns on Saturday extended their remarkable five‑match run under Darren Moore and enables them to go into the final week of the Premier League season with a slim chance of escaping relegation – a feat which seemed impossible a month ago. “It’s very frustrating,” said the West Brom defender Allan Nyom, who praised the work done by Moore but could not help wishing the transformation at the club had taken place a little sooner. West Brom are capable of winning at Crystal Palace on the last day but need several other results to go in their favour if they are to complete a preposterous escape. Whatever happens, Moore has shown he is a serious candidate for the position of full‑time manager.

I compliment the author of I’m With the Band – one of the all-time classic rock’n’roll memoirs – on her ornate necklace, and she says it used to belong to Psycho actor Janet Leigh. When I ask if she still has the jewellery gifted to her by Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page, she replies, bereft: “No, it was stolen, by a kleptomaniac married to one of the Beach Boys.”Then, as we scan the menu in the rapidly busying Friday night dining room of an in-crowd Hollywood hotel, I idly enquire as to her dietary habits. “I haven’t eaten red meat for 45 years. I went with Don Johnson, one of my dudes,” she says of the then-future star of Miami Vice, “to the first vegetarian restaurant in LA. And I saw on the back of the menu how we get the red meat. And I was so appalled that I stopped that day.”I’m With the Band, the classic confessional of Des Barres’s sexual and romantic escapades with a cacophony of rock stars, is republished in a 30th anniversary edition this month. In bracing detail, the woman born Pamela Miller in Reseda, California, details her high jinks on the Sunset Strip of late-60s and early-70s Los Angeles.Led Zep, the Rolling Stones, Jimi Hendrix, Buffalo Springfield, the Byrds, Captain Beefheart, Frank Zappa, the Kinks, the Who… These were many of the greatest acts of the cultural revolution, and Pamela – who turned 20 in 1968 – knew them all. She alchemised adolescent Beatles fandom into a new type of ardour: that of the groupie.“A groupie is someone who loves the music so much she wants to be around the people who make it,” she explains. “A fan is content with an autograph or a look from the stage, or a selfie. A groupie takes the next step. And that takes a lot of courage. But they do so totally willingly, sometimes hoping for a romance, or a one-night stand – or sometimes hoping to marry them,” Des Barres hoots.If groupie behaviour was judged then – the loose morals of silly girls, exploited by lascivious rock stars – it can appear even less savoury today. But before we get into that – and the still-no-holds-barred Des Barres, now 69, will happily get into that – let’s view a highlights reel.As depicted in the book, the gateway crush for the teenager who Robert Plant and Mick Jagger would come to call “Miss Pamela” was the singer with San Diego band Iron Butterfly. But her relationship with Who drummer Keith Moon was considerably more important, even though she was simultaneously seeing renegade country singer Waylon Jennings. “I was Keith’s LA girl, and there was no doubt about it. I knew that whenever he came to town he’d call no one but me,” Des Barres recalls, wistful even now for the tragic Moon the Loon, who died in 1978 aged 32.“I was the muse,” she adds, “and I don’t care what people say about that. Groupies enhanced these people’s lives in a huge way. And if it weren’t for us, they would not be who they are.” Page was more meaningful still. “I was in love with Jimmy and I was gonna be true to him. At this point I had only slept with four people people think I was this wild insane maniac!” But then along came Jagger, whom she’d lusted after since her school days. “Mick was number five. He convinced me that Jimmy wasn’t being true to me on the road. So I decided, ‘OK, I’ve wanted this guy forever, I might as well do it.’ And we had this long-term fling that was really awesome.”Her love of English rock stars eventually propelled Des Barres to Chelsea, in the heart of Swinging London. When two American tourists mistook her for Jagger’s girlfriend she thought she’d attained some kind of nirvana. “Fucking Mick on his pillows in the middle of his living room, listening to Dylan,” Des Barres sighs now, wistful once more. “There was nothing better on earth.”What was Jagger’s reaction when I’m With The Band was originally published? “He was asked once in Rolling Stone what he thought of the book. He said: ‘I was there.’ It made me feel good. He had no problem with it, in other words. No one has.” So no one tried to sue her? “Absolutely not. Because I was telling the truth, in a sweet way. I was telling my truth.”Of course, there’s truth then, and there’s perception now. We discuss her friend and fellow groupie Lori Maddox. She’s been dragged into social media “debates” in the #MeToo era from those who decry her losing her virginity to David Bowie at the age of 15. “I’m very proud of Lori for the way she’s handled this whole thing. She’s very proud of her history. She has no regrets at all. A lot of people have come after her and she just doesn’t rise to it.”Do they come after her because, as she was 15 she was, by definition, abused? “She was not abused,” is Des Barres’s firm conviction. “Because that’s what she wanted. Yeah, she was young. And nowadays 15 is not what it used to be. And prior to that era, 15 was not what it became. It was just a period in time when things like that happened and it was OK! It was a short period in time. But it was our reality, and everyone was OK with it.”In 1977, Pamela married English rock star Michael Des Barres. He was a raging cocaine addict so she vowed, on the spot, to give up drugs. They had a son together, but orced in 1991. She’s had a few relationships since then, but is currently single. Today she finds strength in her faith, something that has deepened over the years. As to how she squares her sexual escapades with Christian morality, she acknowledges that, “I fought with it. Until I finally realised that the orgasm – la petite mort – is godly. The orgasm is when you actually forget everything else but that. So you are actually one with all that is. And when the orgasms continued, I came to realise that sex is so good, so important, so connecting with the ine.”Putting her CV where her soul is, she’s also an ordained minister. Pamela Des Barres can officiate your wedding and throw in, too, eye-popping anecdotes about Jim Morrison getting her off gorilla anaesthetic Trimar, and why she only went to third base with the Kinks’ Ray Davies.These days, Des Barres still lives for the music. She throws gigs in her backyard, and hosts rock’n’roll tours of “her” LA for tourists. “I’ve become this historical person,” she smiles, “which is so weird.”But don’t go mistaking that for sadness, an elegy for an era whose time’s up, for a youth wasted. Pamela Des Barres was her own woman then and she’s her own woman now.“I miss a lot of people who didn’t make it,” she says quietly, “but there are plenty people who did. So, no, I have no sadness about it at all.” I’m With The Band: Confessions of a Groupie by Pamela Des Barres is published by Omnibus Press at £14.99.

But the tone of the footage – which shows men urging women to follow their dreams and culminates with the tag line: “Next to every great woman, a man believing in her” – has been criticised as patronising and discriminatory.Dr Madawi al-Rasheed, a visiting professor at the London School of Economics’ Middle East Centre, questioned the commercial value of the film and branded it a “dreadful piece of propaganda” that showed only women dependent on men.“My first reaction was this is a terrible campaign for Toyoto jeeps – it would not appeal to Saudi women who want to drive through the street of Riadh to get to work,” said al-Rasheed. “It focuses on women protected by a man. “But there are a high percentage – millions – of women in Saudi Arabia who are unmarried, widows and those who choose not to marry.”Both men and women in Saudi Arabia are patronised and deprived of basic human rights, said al-Rasheed, “but women suffer double the discrimination. They are not legal citizens.”The campaign seemed to be promoting the idea of equality in Saudi Arabia to the outside world, she said.A UN rights watchdog that has welcomed recent decisions on driving and allowing women to launch their own businesses said last month that, if discrimination against women is to end, Saudi Arabia must abolish its pervasive system of male ship and give women access to justice. The UN committee on the elimination of discrimination against women said the state should enforce a recent order that would entitle all women to obtain a passport, travel or study abroad, choose their residency, and access healthcare “without having to seek their ’s consent”.Suad Abu-Dayyeh, the Middle East and North African consultant for Equality Now, said: “This film is not accurate, it is not fair and it is not just. Of course, we should recognise the role of men in supporting women’s rights. But it should not be the core of the film.“We know in Saudi Arabia, women are very restricted according to their families, their culture, religious beliefs and according to the system. Their basic rights are denied. They can’t take a courageous stance towards the liberation of women. They can’t transcend that reality.”Alwaleed Philanthropies said the film, which is headed by the Saudi princess Lamia bint Majed al Saud, was inspired by UN Women’s #HeForShe campaign. Its launch coincided with a wider debate in Saudi Arabia about whether the end of the driving ban signalled the start of more wholesale reforms.The princess told the  she hoped the campaign, dedicated to men and women, would challenge stereotypes. “We want to celebrate the generations of Saudi women who have pioneered change, as well as the Saudi men who have supported them in their pursuit of empowerment – this campaign is first and foremost dedicated to those local heroes,” she said. “But we also want to reach an international audience in order to challenge some stereotypes of Saudi women as being oppressed and Saudi men as oppressors. We want to highlight the role that many Saudi men have played as supportive allies in this journey, and encourage more to do the same.Asked whether she believed the lifting of the driving ban was the prelude to greater equality, she said it was “a step in the right direction”.“Lasting change cannot be delivered overnight, but women are securing more and more opportunities to be independent and to be empowered within the kingdom. For many people within Saudi Arabia and across the world, the driving ban was symbolic of Saudi women’s lack of freedom. Lifting the ban will have huge practical implications for how Saudi women live and work, but it is also a clear sign from our leadership that as a society we are ready to move forward and modernise.”She said the inclusion of sky ing was to challenge stereotypes of a woman dressed in her Abaya and also to “emphasise the message that the sky is the limit for Saudi women, especially when everyone in society works together”.Abu-Dayyeh, who works with civil society groups all over the Middle East to promote women’s rights, said that while she welcomed progress made by the Saudi government, it was “very far away” from gender equality.Abu-Dayyeh said: “We have well-established civil society groups in Jordan and Lebanon. But there are no civil society organisations in Saudi Arabia. We have courageous female activists who are working separately, often to great cost. If we are talking about the battle for women’s rights in the region, we need to double that fight in Saudi Arabia.”Civil society does not exist in the kingdom. Sama Awaida, director of the women’s study centre in Palestine, said the film was sending out the wrong message. “I don’t understand how it can be about women’s empowerment,” said Awaida. “Women’s empowerment is a long struggle, but it is about empowering women to be independent of men, not dependent on men.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b2a0a983592b48774e398b1be3833c7567f6e2c8/0_0_8533_5120/master/8533.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=125f91daa6e671435d269968771e77e2","title":"ex girlfriend wont let me go feel responsible","story":"I broke up with her six months ago, and while I want to move on, she sees it as a life-shattering event and says she cries about me most daysI broke up with my ex-girlfriend six months ago and while I’m still sad about it and sometimes miss her, it’s been a life-shattering event for her.

Avocado has had its moment and, while I will always love it, the time has come for something else. This winter in LA (the same temperature as midsummer in the UK), I went to Kismet, a small restaurant on the city’s east side famed for its Californication of Middle Eastern food. The dish du jour? Broccoli toast. I was sceptical. Broccoli, I thought, lacks the requisite creaminess to be a good toast topping. I was wrong. Teamed with a tahini layer and some spice, it was all I could have asked for. Here is my version, plus five more toast toppings. Step aside, avocado.Good toast and leafy stemmed broccoli are key here, although standard (calabrese) broccoli will stand in if you slice it thinly enough. If you are using a grill rather than a griddle pan, be sure to turn the broccoli regularly: the result will be charred, crisped leaves that soften when they cool.400g stem broccoli, purple sprouting or Tenderstem4 tbsp thick Greek yoghurt4 tbsp tahini1 unwaxed lemonSalt and black pepperExtra-virgin olive oil4 slices sourdough100g sunflower seeds, toasted1 tbsp za’atarBoil a large pan of generously salted water, and blanch the broccoli for three to four minutes, until it has lost its rawness but still holds its shape. Drain and set aside.Mix the yoghurt with the tahini, a good squeeze of lemon, some salt and pepper, and a drizzle of olive oil. Taste, and balance with more lemon, salt and pepper as necessary.Heat a griddle pan or grill to maximum and, once hot, char the broccoli on all sides, until the edges crisp. Once you are happy with the broccoli, take it off the heat, then char the toast on both sides using the same griddle or grill.Spread the hot toast with a little olive oil and the tahini yoghurt, then top with the warm, charred broccoli, the toasted seeds and a good pinch of za’atar.Here are a further five toast toppings that just might supersede standard avo toast. None takes more than 10 minutes to make.Radish, butter and mint Mix a little butter with flaky salt and spread on toast as thickly as you dare. Top with sliced radishes, their leaves and some torn mint leaves.Peas and preserved lemonMash or blitz cooked peas with olive oil, Turkish chilli pepper flakes (or dried red chilli) and the chopped rind of a preserved lemon. Top the toast with feta and then the pea mixture.Avocado on toast, reinventedMash an avocado with a squeeze of lemon juice, a teaspoon of red-wine vinegar, a teaspoon of grainy mustard and half a teaspoon of honey or maple syrup, then stir in some chopped dill, season and pile on to toast.Soft egg and Persian cucumberBoil an egg for six and a half minutes, then cool under cold running water, peel and slice.

Figures for the value of the global meat industry vary wildly from $90bn to as much as $741bn. What about its cultural and social importance?Cooked meat may have been partially responsible for the large brains that characterise Homo sapiens and have put humans where we are now. Cooking made calories from meat (and from vegetables) easier to consume and absorb than in a raw form. And the domestication of certain animals – along with the domestication of wild grains and vegetables – marked the beginning of human agricultural history in the “fertile crescent”. Throughout human history the hunting and farming of meat has been part of our stories and mythologies and some of our legal and religious systems the fatted calf for the prodigal son the medieval forest laws that created areas where no one but English royalty could hunt the sacrifical sheep to mark the beginning of Eid Al-Adha even the roasted wild boars consumed at the end of every adventure by Asterix and Obelix. But is meat still crucial to human life? Some argue that, just because we’ve always eaten meat, that doesn’t mean we always have to. If we can get all the dietary nutrients and protein that we need elsewhere, should we? The old-fashioned vision of a mixed farm with wheat and chickens and pigs still exists. More than half of the farms in the US, for example, were small enough in 2012 to have sales of less than $10,000 dollars. But the 20th century saw the application of the principles of the industrial revolution to agriculture - how could inputs be minimised and profits be maximised?  The result was the factory farm, first for chickens, then pigs, and more recently cattle. Producers discovered that animals could be kept inside, and fed grain, and could be bred to grow more quickly and get fatter in the right places. Since 1925, the average days to market for a US chicken has been reduced from 112 to 48, while its weight has ballooned from a market weight of 2.5 pounds to 6.2. Pig and cattle farming has followed suit. Sows are held in gestation crates for up to four weeks once they are pregnant, and then put into farrowing crates once they’ve had their piglets to prevent them accidentally crushing their young. Industrially reared pigs spend their lives in indoor pens. Cattle farming is now being similarly streamlined, with cows in the last few months of their lives being fattened in feedlots with no access to grass and sometimes no shelter.What is the environmental impact of our current farming model? It is extremely difficult to separate out the different impacts of different farming models and types. Many measurements look at agricultural impact without making a distinction between arable v livestock, or industrial v small farms. However, the following information begins to indicate the scale of the problem. An influential study in 2010 of the water footprints for meat estimated that while vegetables had a footprint of about 322 litres per kg, and fruits drank up 962, meat was far more thirsty: chicken came in at 4,325lkg, pork at 5,988lkg, sheepgoat meat at 8,763lkg, and beef at a stupendous 15,415lkg. Some non-meat products were also pretty eye-watering: nuts came in at 9,063lkg.  Farms contribute to water pollution in a range of ways: some of those are associated more closely with arable farming, and some with livestock, but it’s worth remembering that one-third of the world’s grain is now fed to animals. The FAO believes that the livestock sector, which is growing and intensifying faster than crop production, has “serious implications” for water quality.  The types of water pollution include: nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus from fertilisers and animal excreta) pesticides sediment organic matter (oxygen demanding substances such as plant matter and livestock excreta) pathogens (E coli etc) metals (selenium etc) and emerging pollutants (drug residues, hormones and feed additives).  The impacts are wide-reaching. Eutrophication is caused by excesses of nutrients and organic matter (animal faeces, leftover feed and crop residues) – which cause algae and plants to grow excessively and use up all the oxygen in the body of wate at the expense of other species. A review in 2015 identified 415 coastal bodies already suffering these problems. Pesticide pollution can kill weeds and insects away from the agricultural area, with impacts that may be felt all the way up the food chain. And although scientists do not yet have full data on the connection between antibiotic use in animals and rising levels of antibiotic resistance in the human population, water pollution by antibiotics (which continue to have an active life even after going through the animal and into the water) is definitely in the frame. It’s hard to work out exactly what quantity of greenhouse gases (GHG) is emitted by the meat industry from farm to fork carbon emissions are not officially counted along entire chains in that way, and so a number of complicated studies and calculations have attempted to fill the gap.What about the giant companies that dominate the sector? A 2017 landmark studyfound that the top three meat firms – JBS, Cargill and Tyson – emitted more greenhouse gases in 2016 than all of France.  Some argue that veganism is the only sane way forward. A study last year showed, for example, that if all Americans substituted beans for beef, the country would be close to meeting the greenhouse gas goals agreed by Barack Obama. The UN Food and Agricultural Organisation has a huge collection of data, and has also published some crucial reports on this issue, including the groundbreaking Livestock’s long shadow.Some institutions doing interesting research include Sustain The Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy Brighter Green Sustainable Food Trust IPES-food.

Imagine you are in a grid 100 squares long and 100 squares wide. (The grid is fixed to the compass directions: updown is NS, and leftright is WE.) On each square of the grid, there’s an arrow. Each arrow is pointing either N, S, W or E.Choose any square. That’s your starting position. Now the game begins.The rules are that you must always follow the arrow. So, if the arrow in your starting square points N, you move to the square due north. If the arrow points E, you move to the square due east.But there is an extra thing you need to do. Once you arrive in a new square, you must rotate the arrow in the square you came from by 90 degrees clockwise. So if the square you came from pointed N, then once you leave that square you must rotate that arrow to E. If the square you came from pointed E, once you leave that square you must rotate that arrow to S.Safely in your new square, you repeat the process: follow the arrow to a new square, and then rotate the arrow in the square you came from by 90 degrees.If you are in a square on the top edge and the arrow points north, then the following move you are going to get out the grid. Hurrah! You win! Likewise if you are on any of the other edge squares of the grid, and the arrow in the square points out, you get out.But if you are not on an edge, you will probably start roaming around the grid. Here’s a statement:“No matter which directions the arrows are pointing at the start, and no matter which square you choose to begin, you will always eventually get OUT OF THE GRID”True or false?

The daughter of an Irish mother and Ghanian father, she spent the first couple of years of her life with her extended family in Ghana before growing up in south-east London and holidaying in Ireland to visit her maternal grandmother. Food – heaps of food from cooks who wouldn’t tolerate anyone leaving the dinner table hungry – features strongly in childhood memories of long summer days in Bantry Bay, County Cork. “Some of my earliest memories are very specifically about the smell of food cooking in Ireland – cabbage, black pudding frying. My aunt had a butcher’s shop so I was used to seeing a pig’s head on the counter and cows’ tongues hanging on hooks. We ate lots of offal, but we also used to go to the beach to hunt for crabs, to the river for salmon, and to the mountain to dig out peat for the fire – that smell always unlocks memories of my mum and her family. Peat, the smell of the sea, the morning dew – that landscape had its own special smell, a smell of freshness.”Food from a very different landscape was how, as a keen home cook, Adjonyoh later discovered and explored her Ghanian identity. The mysterious ingredients her father brought home to cook with were the same ones she would use to create dishes for her pop-up supper club in Brixton and her debut cookbook, Zoe’s Ghana Kitchen, published to great acclaim last year. These staples of Ghanian cookery were, she says, her sensory “access points” to finding out about her African heritage.“My father would be cooking with things I’d never heard of I didn’t know what they were,” she recalls. “Before I could taste them, I’d be aware of their unfamiliar smell and that’s a really strong memory of him in the kitchen – I’d want to eat something just from the aroma while it cooked.” After travelling to Ghana as an adult, and experimenting with traditional dishes back at home in her Hackney Wick kitchen, she started cooking updated versions of the recipes for friends. She sourced produce from Dalston’s Ridley Road market, getting to know the Ghanian women who sold from kiosks. “Shopping there, for me, was like being transported to another world,” she recalls. “They would help me identify ingredients and tell me how to cook them. The smells, flavours and colours were just amazing.”Some of the smells when she visited Ghana were a little too amazing. At a market with her aunt, Adjonyoh asked what a particularly pungent smell was. “What smell?” said her aunt, and carried on shopping. It turned out to be some cowhide drying in the sun, ready for eating later. Laughing, she recalls her aunt’s brief explanation: “‘Oh that’s wele,’ and I said: ‘What the hell is wele?’” The flavour wasn’t as strong as the smell, once she plucked up the courage to try it. “I was a bit wary of it, to be honest.”While her father’s cooking was hearty and traditional, it was a case of “there you are, get stuck in, don’t bother with cutlery”, she explains.Adjonyoh adapted recipes to make them visually appealing (gloopy okra was transformed into okra fries) because of the adage about people eating with their eyes. But it was the smell of her peanut butter stew – based on her father’s legendary groundnut soup – that drew people to come and buy food from an impromptu stall at her flat. “The dish has an amazing smell profile from the blend of spices,” she says. “People were asking what the smell was, how the dish was made. It was very much the smell that brought people to my door.”A career in food wasn’t the plan, but the clamour for her African cooking paid her way through an MA in creative writing: “It was just the demand. I loved the cooking and so did all the people who tried it.” The supper club, with just six tables and housed in a shipping container, was born, and for three years celebrated the variety, richness and abundance of Ghanian food. Now it’s time for a new adventure, with Adjonyoh travelling across Kenya and Uganda for a month to meet female chefs, cooks and food bloggers: “I want to understand each country’s relationship with food, the history of that, their distinctive produce and why it is that their food industry is largely dominated by women.” The journey will once again unite her passions for cooking, writing and travel. “I can’t wait to soak up the sights and sounds of two new food cultures,” she says. “When you’re travelling, all your senses are heightened. The first thing that always draws me in is food smells. No doubt I’ll be led by my nose again.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc89218ce3843f49f7e386483e5919f78b739dcc/0_49_2990_1795/master/2990.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8026b29a04c019d7647262331cb03984","title":"glasgow queen street london kings cross railway station survey","story":"London King’s Cross has highest satisfaction rating in Transport Focus study of 56 stationsGlasgow Queen Street is Britain’s most unpopular railway station, new figures show.The independent transport watchdog surveyed more than 28,000 passengers and the list comprises 56 stations where at least 100 people responded. The survey was conducted between September and November last year, shortly after a £100m modernisation project began at Glasgow Queen Street. Nine months into the work, some passengers are still unhappy with the station’s condition.Cameron MacIntosh from Stirling said: “The station is an absolute bomb site at the moment. It really looks like a place from the third world. I try and avoid it.”John McInnes from Cumbernauld said: “I hope they are going to finish it because it looks a disaster just now. It’s embarrassing bringing friends or relations here. They can’t believe the mess of the place.”Margaret McGinley from Larbert said: “It will look bad for a while, but I think it’ll be amazing when they’ve completed the renovation work.”The Abellio ScotRail-operated station was used by 15 million passengers in 2016-17, making it Scotland’s third-busiest station.One Gatwick airport passenger who responded to the survey said the West Sussex station was small and cramped with long queues for tickets and overcrowding on platforms. Another described it as an “appalling welcome to the UK”.Other critical respondents include one who claimed London Victoria was “grubby for what should be a flagship station”, and another who said the platforms at Cardiff Central were very run down.Anthony Smith, the Transport Focus chief executive, said: “While Glasgow Queen Street is being redeveloped it’s vital that the ScotRail Alliance continues to talk to passengers about the improvements and makes sure staff are on hand to help. Investment in stations can improve passengers’ satisfaction when targeted at features which make a difference to their experience.“Passengers’ top priorities for stations include arrival time information, waiting rooms and the overall look and feel of the station.”A spokesman for the Rail Delivery Group, which represents the rail industry, said: “As part of the partnership railway’s long-term plan, and to deliver on our commitment to boost local communities, we’re investing to improve 178 small and medium-sized stations right across the country.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5325058944c25af852069a5acc8c75f527c375c9/0_43_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0895e1345e570bb0fc1cc556db4c851a","title":"qatar blockade unexpected new vision isolation","story":"Enforced isolation has given the emirate confidence to pursue a political and cultural rebootFor most of the past year the city-state of Qatar, the wealthiest peninsula on the planet, has been exploring the law of unintended consequences. The trigger for that came last June, when Qatar’s closest neighbours, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bahrain and the UAE, escalated a simmering disquiet about the Gulf state’s role in the region to implement a full land and air blockade.Overnight, planes and cargo ships heading for Qatar were erted, all diplomatic links were cut and Qatar’s sole land border, with Saudi Arabia, was closed. Even camels were not spared the politics – 12,000 Qatari animals were forcibly repatriated.The stated aim for the blockade – which came with a 10-day ultimatum of 13 unlikely demands – was a protest against what was seen as Qatar’s singular role in “funding terrorism” (the Saudi line that Donald Trump swallowed and retweeted whole). Politically, it seemed rather an attempt to humiliate the sheikhdom and call it to heel. In the event, something like the opposite of that expectation has unfolded.Far from destabilising Qatar’s ruling al-Thani family, resistance to the ultimatum has lent it an “us against the world” authority. Among the 313,000 native Qataris (in a population of 2.6 million) a cult of personality has grown around the youthful emir, Sheikh Tamim, whose idealised portrait now gazes across the Gulf from the steel and glass skyscrapers of Doha, and is almost ubiquitous in the back window of the 4x4s that cruise the capital’s six-lane corniche.Isolation has also, it seems, acted as a catalyst to Qatar’s long-term vision for itself. One of the inbuilt ironies of the richest per capita state on earth was that, ever since it discovered and exploited its vast natural gas reserves, there has been little native necessity to drive invention. The al-Thanis’ stated goal has been to create a erse knowledge economy that lasts beyond the gas reserves. As Sheikha Hind, younger sister of the emir, explained to me in Doha last week in a rare interview, money – and the incentive of capital projects such as the 2022 World Cup – solves only some of those skills shortages.“It is not a secret that we are a wealthy society and that maybe nobody even needs to work,” she said. “But knowing that you can contribute in developing your country, and allow it to become even more prominent, is something everyone feels pride in. If anything, the blockade helped that. We see a big opportunity to be self-sustainable.”Qatar’s modern nation-building aspirations were first expressed by Sheikha Hind’s parents. While her father developed the partnership with Iran that could exploit the natural gas fields, her mother, Sheikha Moza, established the multibillion-dollar Qatar Foundation in order to transform education, particularly for women. Sheikha Hind, 34, a mother of five herself, was one of the first beneficiaries of “Education City” and has for the past three years been chief executive of the Qatar Foundation.From the balcony of its offices you can see the glass and marble evidence of that ambition in the futuristic campuses of a dozen “partner universities” that radiate outward. Each was persuaded here for its particular expertise in building capacity that Qataris need: Georgetown for its programme in government, Texas A\u0026ampM for engineering, and so on.The newest addition to Education City is the stunning Qatari National Library, designed by the Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas: a huge, welcoming building in which book stacks rise all around a central area that includes an open theatre and cafe, like terraces on backlit hillsides. There has been no library tradition in the Gulf, so Koolhaas’s idea was to create a space that is immediately understandable. Fifty-one thousand Qataris have already taken membership and the children’s library has proved particularly successful. In the few months since opening, every one of the 150,000 books on its shelves has been borrowed at least once.Along with those silver terraces of books, at subterranean level, in what look like excavated catacombs made of Iranian marble, the library houses an expensively acquired collection of rare manuscripts and calligraphy relating to the Arab world. This collection has been assembled in the same acquisitive spirit in which the al-Thani billions have filled its IM Pei-designed Museum of Islamic Art: to establish Doha as the modern intellectual capital of the Arab world. Later this year a new National Museum, shaped as a series of giant intersecting discs, designed by Jean Nouvel, will add another dimension to that claim.There is a blatant “look at us” attitude in some of this, but also the message that the territory that Qatar aims to colonise is as much cultural as economic. The al-Thanis have made headlines buying blingy stakes in such global landmarks as the Empire State Building, Harrods and the Shard – and splashing out ostentatiously on the world’s most expensive paintings ($250m for Cezanne’s The Card Players) and footballers ($262m to bring superstar Neymar to Qatari-owned Paris St Germain). But they have also long realised that it is whoever controls the story who generally wields power.That principle was first tested 22 years ago when the then emir established and funded the Arab broadcaster al-Jazeera. The harsh journalistic light the television station has shone on the internal politics of other Arab nations (and the relatively soft focus it gives to Qatar) is at the heart of the current enmity and blockade. One of the 13 ultimatum demands of the blockaders was that the broadcaster be shut down.The Saudi-led outrage at al-Jazeera’s reporting and editorial stance deepened during the Arab spring, when the station (and Doha’s ruling family) threw its support behind the popular uprising, rather than the established ruling powers. This stance was seen as part of a wider pattern in which Qatar seeks to build power at home while fomenting dissent abroad, aiming to be all things to all people: keeping trade and diplomatic channels open to Israel while openly funding Hamas hosting the major American air base, al-Udeid, while giving support to the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood offering to broker peace talks on Syria while giving refuge to known al-Qaida affiliates.The dean, Everette E Dennis, a distinguished observer of the fourth estate’s role in extending civil society in the former eastern bloc as well as in the US, had expected a fight over censorship when he came to Doha. He has found, he says, that “there has never been a single intrusion into what we teach and how we teach it – the full range of social issues that would be part of the conversation on an American campus are freely discussed here”.Initially, he found some unwillingness to challenge authority among the students,who come from across the region and beyond, but that quickly dissipated. He suggests that the gains of regular press freedoms have begun to be appreciated in Qatar (despite the fact that, since 2016, the authorities have blocked Doha News, an online outlet that offered more critical reporting of their actions).There has been learning on both sides, he suggests. The university has established the first system of press accreditation, for example, and lobbying from graduates of the programme has coincided with the establishment of a properly functioning government information office. That spirit of critical enquiry, he suggests, has also prompted the ruling family and its government to address international concerns, in particular over the shameful treatment of migrant labour in Qatar on capital projects for the World Cup. They have responded to concerns with a minimum wage and new policy over housing programmes and healthcare that have been given a qualified welcome by the International Labour Organisation of the UN.In the dean’s view the blockade has again accelerated this transparency. At the same time as it has become illegal in Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the UAE for citizens to question or criticise even the idea of the blockade, Qatar is lifting visa restrictions and attempting to brand itself as a home of greater free speech. While Saudi Arabia congratulates itself on finally allowing women to drive, Sheikha Hind can point to a majority of female undergraduates across all departments, including engineering, at Education City.In that sense, I wonder if the Qatari ruling family is secretly grateful for the blockade in sharpening a perceived cultural ide between itself and its Wahhabi neighbours. Has it proved more an opportunity than a crisis?“I won’t lie to you and tell you we are OK with the blockade,” Sheikha Hind says, “absolutely not. We have had students here who are terribly affected by it – whole families have been torn apart. It is a sad situation we are in.” She hopes, along with every other Qatari I speak to, that there is a resolution to the conflict soon. Still, she says, “if anything, the push we always had here for self-sustainability is just exploding now.” The goal has not changed, she suggests, “but now we are running rather than walking”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff96791027f4f6d44b8f414360127a11143eabab/0_115_1728_1037/master/1728.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=70d852b2231556cb1c66883b3cae9b03","title":"belgian monks search for lost beer recipe holds up brewery plan","story":"Researchers have spent a year combing through abbey’s library and have yet to find formulaThe Belgian monks of Grimbergen, whose beer is mass-produced by Carlsberg, are seeking to reclaim their roots and start brewing in their abbey again – but they have come up against a problem.Four volunteer researchers have spent a year searching through the 35,000 books and files held in the library and archives of the Flemish abbey, first founded in 1128 by Saint Norbert of Xanten, and they cannot find the original recipe.The monks last produced their dark brew in 1797, at which point the French Revolution shattered the monks’ communal life and their abbey’s walls.They reinstated their home on the same site, in the province of Flemish Brabant, six miles (10km) north of Brussels, shortly afterwards, but the monks did not brew again.In 1958, they came to a deal for the Belgian Maes brewery to use their brand, and today the beer is produced by the Alken-Maes brewery for Belgian drinkers and by a Carlsberg-owned brewery in Strasbourg for foreign markets.The abbey’s subprior, Karel Stautemas, said: “It is an old dream to start again. Four men have been looking for that document for a year …“Every day we get visitors who ask where the brewery is. And if you come from abroad, they do not understand that we do not brew beer. This is how the idea of re-establishing that tradition came to fruition.”Stautemas said the abbey had received the support of Alken-Maes and Carlsberg for a micro-brewery “in the same place as where the brewery stood here until 1797”.“Because we know the location, we have already found it in our archives,” he said. “We also have documents showing that the fathers then bought barley from local farmers. We even know all the ingredients. The only thing we do not know is how much we have to take from each. The composition is unavailable for now.”“It is not such an easy job either, because those texts are in Old Dutch. But there is good hope that the recipe will turn up. And then there is the question: do we still like that medieval beer today?”He added: “If everything goes as we hope and if we find the recipe quickly, we will drink our new Grimbergen at the New Year’s reception in 2020.“The other types will also continue to exist. We can’t handle mass production. It will be a nice addition to the existing offer. And from then on, we will be able to show and offer the visitors something from the house.”The Norbertine monks of Grimbergen use the phoenix as their symbol, in reflection of the abbey’s perpetual rebirth, and the motto “Ardet nec consumitur” (burned but not destroyed)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ffdb920409b74ef0f35ec521718e139fbdb1062/0_130_3872_2323/master/3872.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7d9550af83fbef12416b58d25355dd64","title":"different goals what street kids want from the other world cup","story":"The Street Child World Cup starts this week, and will help homeless and socially excluded teenagers turn their lives aroundOn a sunny afternoon in south London, a group of girls are training for a world cup in Russia. The ultimate goal for these players isn’t a trophy, however, but getting off the streets.The girls who will play in Moscow are doing this as a step towards changing their lives, which have been marked so far by school exclusion, deprivation and in some cases homelessness. The tournament, which starts on Friday (eds: May 11) will involve more than 230 homeless and street-connected youth from 20 countries.“Which team do I most want to meet? For me, it’s the Russians, because it’s their country and I want to see what it’s like,” says Kate, 16, who will play in midfield for the team, organised by homelessness charity Centrepoint.Like most of her teammates, Kate is a few weeks into Centrepoint Street Football England, a six-month programme to help socially excluded young people. She has not experienced homelessness herself, but was drifting without direction after being excluded five times from school. “It has really helped me, to focus on the football,” she says.“We want them to meet young people from around the world and get some knowledge of others’ situations, but we also want them to think about themselves: how did I get here, what have I overcome to be here? And to come home with some skills and inspiration from taking part in an international event,” says Jack Badu, sports operations and engagement officer at Centrepoint, who will take the girls to the tournament, called the Street Child World Cup. “It’s about aspiration.”Centrepoint partners with professional football clubs to support marginalised young people in its England squad and give them the chance to compete in international tournaments across the globe. The Street Child World Cup, held ahead of the FIFA World Cup, is one of four such tournaments another is this year’s Homeless World Cup in Mexico.The girls will be competing against teams from countries including Brazil, India, Mauritius, Mexico, the Philippines, Russia and Zimbabwe. None of the squad of 42 have been been chosen solely due to their skills on the pitch, but because all of them have been participating in social inclusion programmes and proved their willingness to change their lives. Like Kate, Verona, 17, had been excluded from school several times before joining a college run by Arsenal FC that partners with Centrepoint.“I didn’t get along with my teachers and was always having arguments,” she says. “It’s only when I started going to Arsenal college that everything started to go uphill. This is an opportunity I couldn’t have imagined taking two or three years ago. At school all the teachers see you as just another person to tell off. Here, you’re an inidual.“I have always played football, ever since I was nine or 10. I prefer to go to the Arsenal college and come here to train than just sit at home doing homework.” She hopes to be a physiotherapist when she is older. Over the six-month training period, the girls willtrain regularly at St George’s Park, home of the Football Association. At their most recent session, they were given the shirts they will wear in Russia. It was a proud moment, says Kate, who follows the England national women’s team and wants to work in the sport. They have also trained with Afghan footballer Khalida Popal, who fled the Taliban “because they told her it was a man’s sport and she couldn’t play, but she played for her country,” says Kate.In addition to helping develop their resilience, the girls’ Russian adventure has another dimension, says Badu: “We hope they will think about the issues that other young people face … that they’ll tell young people in Africa and elsewhere there are young people in the UK who care about them. From feeling that ‘no one supports me’, they’ll go to feeling they are part of a large community of young people from all over the world supporting each other.”The girls will return to London with £10,000 from the Vitol Foundation to effect social change in their communities. The team think they may spend it on a project to tackle knife violence or spaces for excluded young people to play sport amid cuts to youth services and rising youth homelessness.After the six-month development programme ends, Centrepoint will work to find them further opportunities such as coaching and mentoring. All the girls can take part in a player progression programme that involves mentoring next year’s England squad.Given British-Russian tensions in recent weeks, aren’t they a bit nervous? “We’ll take it all in our stride,” says Badu. “There is a lot of scaremongering but I think it’s great that the Russians want to support this tournament for street children.”“I am excited and nervous,” says Verona, “but nervous in a good way.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba70d1436ecdab3df0735fa78b47929f072fae7c/0_109_4764_2859/master/4764.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0823b8780e6e724342ab1fb874a31880","title":"viktor orban hungary preserve christian culture","story":"Ahead of re-election as prime minister, rightwinger talks of building a ‘Christian democracy’Viktor Orbán has said the main task of his new government will be to preserve Hungary’s security and Christian culture. The hardline rightwinger was re-elected for a third successive term as prime minister in April after a strong anti-immigration message secured a landslide victory. He was asked to form a government by the president, János Áder, on Monday.Orbán, one of the most vociferous opponents of immigration into Europe by mainly Muslim people fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East and Africa, saw his campaign, helped by his Fidesz party’s media dominance, resonate with swaths of the electorate, particularly in rural areas. Fidesz holds 133 of 199 seats in the parliament, which will enable the party to pass any laws, even those that require two-thirds support. Parliament will hold its first session on Tuesday, where Orbán will be officially re-elected prime minister. In a radio interview on Friday, Orbán said his government was building a “Christian democracy”.“We are working on building an old-school Christian democracy, rooted in European traditions ... We believe in the importance of the nation and in Hungary we do not want to yield ground to any supranational business or political empire,” he said.

On the campaign trail, Amlo, who is a friend of Jeremy Corbyn and his Mexican wife, Laura Álvarez, has pledged to wrest back control of the oil industry, explore an amnesty for those involved in Mexico’s devastating drug war, and challenge the country’s powerful and thieving “mafias”.That last message has found widespread support in a nation outraged and demoralised by jaw-dropping corruption scandals involving its ruling elite.“López Obrador is the only option,” Margarita García Rodriguez, a homemaker and mother of three, said during a recent Amlo rally in the industrial sprawl that encircles Mexico’s capital.“If he can’t help us out, then there’s nobody else that can. The whole system will collapse.”The prospect of a six-year Amlo presidency horrifies his many detractors and foes who paint him as an Hugo Chávez-style authoritarian and “tropical messiah” whose antiquated policies would ruin the Mexican economy.“He believes in old-fashioned nationalism. Old-fashioned statism. Old-fashioned protectionism. Old-fashioned subsidies across the board,” said Jorge Castañeda, one of Anaya’s two campaign chiefs and Mexico’s former foreign minister.“Is he a guy who is sufficiently pragmatic and intelligent to understand that you can’t do a lot of these things? Yeah. But what would he do if he could?”Amlo has sought to assuage such fears by naming a team of highly educated experts as his cabinet and promising business leaders there will be “no expropriations, no nationalisations” if he wins.He denies claims he is seeking to drag Latin America’s second largest economy back into the past. “If this horror we’re living now is what they want to give us in the future, the past is preferable,” Amlo told one recent rally. But as the clock ticks down to July’s election, Mexico’s answer to Project Fear is intensifying its operations in a last-ditch bid to thwart Amlo’s push for power. “This is a guy who is the wrong alternative for Mexico. He is tired, he is old, he is obsolete. He is surrounded by wackos and he has old ideas,” said Castañeda, a key figure in the often apocalyptic-sounding endeavour to derail Amlo’s campaign. “People don’t go to his rallies or listen or believe in him because he speaks intelligently or eloquently or charismatically. They go because of what he represents – the end of the system.”Amlo’s story begins in the Tabasco river town of Tepetitán, where he was born in November 1953, the first of seven children. Today, a bust of the town’s most famous son stands outside one of his childhood homes beside a plaque that declares him “El Rostro de la Esperanza” – “The Face of Hope”. Nicknamed “El Peje” after the pejelagarto, a feisty local fish, Amlo spent his early years playing baseball and tending to his father’s clothing store with his brother José Ramón, who later died after accidentally shooting himself with a revolver.He became politically active in the late 1970s, moving to Nacajuca, an area north of Tabasco’s capital, Villahermosa, that is home to the indigenous Chontal Maya people, to work as a local representative of the National Indigenous Institute.“López Obrador took on that role as if it was his destiny, with a missionary’s spirit,” writes José Agustín Ortiz Pinchetti in a flattering new biography of his friend called Amlo: With his Feet on the Ground. “He went to live in a shack just like the ones the indigenous families lived in.”Pinchetti recalls how during Amlo’s six years in the impoverished region, he and his family slept in hammocks and endured “African temperatures of over 40C” with nothing but a single fan to keep them cool. It was an experience that lit an “inner fire” within the young tabasqueño and made him determined see Mexico ruled for the many not the few. It also earned Amlo a considerable grassroots following. “Whatever he says, we believe. Whatever he says, he fulfils. He’s a man of his word,” said Glenda Jasso Aquino, a Chontal Maya woman who knew the presidential frontrunner at the time. “He’s more than a man … He’s going to be president to help his people, the earth, the countryside.”Jasso remembered Amlo taking on Mexico’s state-run oil company, Pemex, setting up protest camps outside its offices to force it to pay compensation to indigenous communities and campesinos whose lands it had polluted. “Amlo was the only person who raised his voice,” she said.From Tabasco, Amlo’s political quest eventually took him to the nation’s capital. In 2000 he was elected Mexico City’s mayor vowing to “put the poor first, for the wellbeing of all”. His administration proved popular: the left has crushed opponents in subsequent Mexico City elections. He subsidized subway fares, provided stipends for senior citizens and single mothers and built elevated expressways. Critics condemned such projects as populism, but promptly copied them in other parts of the country. “If you look at how he ran Mexico City, he was far from a radical,” said Carlos Bravo Regidor, professor at the Centre for Teaching and Research in Economics. As Amlo set about transforming Mexico’s capital, he also began eyeing the ultimate political prize, the presidency. He narrowly lost on his first attempt, in 2006, subsequently and controversially alleging that he had been the victim of electoral fraud and leading a months-long occupation of Mexico City’s political heart. In 2012 he was defeated again.Revolutionary or not, as election day approaches many analysts are convinced Amlo is in an unassailable position, even if one recent poll showed his main rival gaining ground. Castañeda said he was working 16-hour days to turn the race around and claimed his candidate, Anaya, had “a reasonable shot” at ensuring it was not third-time lucky for Amlo. Were a grand anti-Amlo coalition to coalesce in the coming weeks that could indeed be possible. However, Castañeda admitted there was now a “relatively big” gap between the candidates. Many Mexican voters were now so fed up with the system that they thought: “We just want to get rid of these guys and well, you know, let’s give him a try.”Amlo and his supporters are hoping that on 1 July they finally do."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3481526.1525634953!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"house rules how to get your first mortgage","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThings which help demonstrate a borrower’s desirability to a bank include savings and paying rent.

This represented a 70 per cent increase over the pervious 10-year period.This would provide for prefab replacement, a “deep energy retrofit” of schools built prior to 2008, modernisation of science and PE facilities, and investment in digital technology over the coming years.This will also include the provision of 50 large scale school-building projects and 20,000 school places in new buildings to ensure every child has a school place.“In total, the department’s capital budget will increase from €745 million today to over €1.1 billion in 2021. This shows the huge priority that Government puts on education,” the spokesman added.Fianna Fáil’s education spokesman Thomas Byrne said was “astonishing” that up to 575 school building projects seemed to be “on hold indefinitely due to a lack of available funds”.“Pupils are being taught in substandard accommodation with a 25 per cent increase in the use of prefab classrooms,” he said.He added that Minister for Education Richard Bruton clearly needed additional funding."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3486216.1525632145!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"tui may face hefty financial settlement over poaching claims","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tASTI members  picketing Rosmini Community College during a recent industrial dispute.  The union  lost about 2,000 members during a recent dispute. Photograph: Cyril Byrne The Teachers’ Union of Ireland (TUI) may end up paying hundreds of thousands of euro to a rival union following allegations it “poached” more than 1,000 members.This follows an investigation into allegations by the Association of Secondary Teachers Ireland (ASTI) that many of its members were recruited by the TUI during an industrial dispute last year.Under industrial relations rules, unions are not permitted to take on members from each other during a dispute.A disputes committee established by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions – the umbrella body for the trade union movement – recently directed the TUI to write to 1,059 members and advise them they were recruited in breach of trade union rules. These members will be free to rejoin the ASTI.After a six-week period, the congress will meet both unions to determine how many have rejoined their former union.Arising from this, the TUI will be “required to make a financial settlement with the ASTI, which reflects the loss of membership subscriptions involved, if any”, according to internal records of the disputes’ committee’s findings.It says the general secretary of congress will be available to assist in determining the structure and size of the settlement.The development comes at a time when teachers’ unions are presenting a united front in tackling the two-tier pay gap.The ASTI lost more than €250,000 last year in revenue from the loss of about 2,000 members between 2016 and 2017. This saw the union’s overall membership fall to its lowest level in more than 15 years.The TUI’s membership, by contrast, increased by at least 1,200 last year, according to Department of Education figures based on the number of subscriptions taken at source from teachers’ salaries.Well-placed sources said while they expected some members may return to their former union, they anticipated many would opt to remain with the TUI.The TUI, which is entitled to appeal the findings, has previously declined to comment on the investigation.During a dispute last year, there was a financial incentive for TUI members to join the ASTI.This was because the ASTI was considered to have “repudiated” the Lansdowne Road pay deal in place at the time, which triggered losses for members worth thousands of euro in frozen pay and forfeited payments.The TUI, however, remained inside the pay deal and its members were unaffected by these penalties."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Former t\u0026aacutenaiste Dick Spring to open annual PHOBUS gatheringState agency received \u0026euro13.5 million in fees from Government department in 2016 to disburse fundsMan in 30s dies in hospital after motorcycle collides with poleNUI Galway and Maynooth University show \u0026lsquosolid foundation\u0026rsquo in tackling gender biasConcerns over Kevin Street Maldron hotel were \u0026lsquoignored and ridiculed\u0026rsquo, say localsFigure is double the number in 2016 and 11 of notices were on residential propertiesEmily O\u0026rsquoReilly says \u0026lsquo\u0026rsquo interview \u0026lsquochanged the narrative\u0026rsquo on teenager\u0026rsquos deathEoghan Murray confirms that Rory Mulcahy\u0026rsquos report has been on his desk since June 2017Basic building costs have increased by almost 40 per cent since 2014Surveillance of prisoners with mobile phones in prisons could be \u0026lsquoovert or covert\u0026rsquoEdmondstown Road in Rathfarnham closed since last year following alleged illegal workKey allies back delaying talks on EU-UK deal until withdrawal treaty fully agreedMan in his mid-30s fatally injured when his vehicle hit a pole in FinglasSenior housing officials say Public Private Partnerships too slow and expensiveFianna F\u0026aacuteil\u0026rsquos Robert Troy says \u0026lsquodrastic\u0026rsquo decrease in State funding \u0026lsquomakes no sense\u0026rsquoTeachers\u0026rsquo Union of Ireland told it should pay ASTI to make up for loss of membersTV presenter Robert Peston makes the claim during interview with Jacob Rees-MoggReports of desertions and attempted mutinies emerge from German intelligence reports"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3486259.1525635180!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ireland a key pressure point at brexit summit barnier","story":"Speaking in Dundalk during a two-day visit to Ireland and Northern Ireland, EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier has urged rapid agreement by June on the scope of any British alignment with the single market.

Photograph: Clodagh KilcoyneReutersIreland will be used as a key pressure point at a crucial summit next month to force the UK to clarify its future relationship with the EU, Michel Barnier has said.In a private briefing in Brussels last week, the European Union’s chief negotiator also insisted Brexit does not threaten the constitutional status of Northern Ireland and asked for “drama” to be taken out of the Border proposals.In a briefing to representatives of the EU27, the bloc’s remaining member states, he said the risk of a breakdown in the talks later in the year will be heightened if there is no “early progress on Irish issues”. He was reporting on his recent trip to Northern Ireland and Ireland. An account of his briefing was sent to Dublin by Irish officials.The briefing, elements of which have been seen by The , says Germany and France support the position that talks must not progress to a future EU-UK deal unless all elements of the United Kingdom’s withdrawal treaty are agreed. This includes the so-called backstop, which would ensure no ergence in customs and trade rules between the Republic and Northern Ireland without agreed solutions on how to avoid a hard border.The EU has proposed this would mean Northern Ireland remaining in the customs union after Brexit. That has been rejected by the British prime minister, Theresa May, and the DUP, which supports her Conservative government in a confidence-and-supply deal at Westminster.“France also shared Barnier’s view on the need to reach agreement on outstanding withdrawal-agreement issues, including Ireland, by June,” the notes say. “Germany said it was essential that the Irish issue was not left ‘open to the end and then isolated’.”Mr Barnier said the EU “had specific leverage points” at European Council summits last December and March. “In June, the primary leverage point will be to make clear to the UK that finalising the outstanding aspects of the Withdrawal Agreement, ‘including on Ireland’, is a precondition to a constructive discussion on the future,” the account of his briefing said. Mr Barnier said the backstop does not affect the constitutional status of Northern Ireland but only sets out what checks are necessary after Brexit. He argued there are already checks between Britain and Northern Ireland for agricultural produce. “What he has learnt from his visit to IrelandNorthern Ireland is that all sides need to take the drama out of what is being proposed. Barnier repeatedly said he was moved by all communities in Ireland.”Speaking yesterday, the DUP leader, Arlene Foster, said Northern Ireland must “move in lockstep” with the rest of the United Kingdom. “We don’t believe we have to stay in the customs union to have free flow between ourselves and the Republic of Ireland.”A decision on the British government’s preferred customs option has been postponed after Ms May failed to secure the support of her ministers for a proposed hybrid “customs partnership” between the EU and UK. The arrangement would see British officials collect tariffs on behalf of the European Union for any goods coming to the UK that were subsequently destined for an EU member state.

Photograph: ITVTV presenter Robert Peston has suggested that Ireland has “undermined” British governments for at least the last century. In an interview with prominent Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg, Mr Peston described the Tory as a keen student of British history, before saying: “Ireland has undermined, the issue of Ireland in so many different ways has undermined, British governments, you know, going back well over 100 years now.” Mr Rees-Mogg responded by suggesting that the issue of Ireland had undermined British politics for “much more than 100 years. It’s a very long and complex history.”The interview took place on Mr Peston’s eponymous Peston on Sunday programme on ITV. Mr Peston suggested to Mr Rees-Mogg that in the absence of a post-Brexit customs arrangement, any Border checks could “undermine the peace that . . . has been so beneficial over the past few years”. Mr Rees-Mogg responded by stating that it was “deeply disgraceful that people who wish to keep us in the European Union are threatening the spectre of a return to terror to try and make people accept their views”. He said that those who raised the prospect of a return to violence “are all committed Europeans, some of them in receipt of pensions from the EU. “I think it’s deeply disgraceful to raise the spectre of lawlessness and of murder in pursuit of a political objective.” Mr Rees-Mogg pointed to the pro-Brexit stance of one of the key architects of the Belfast Agreement, former UUP leader David Trimble. Mr Trimble has said he does not share the contention of some Remainers that a return to a hard Border could undermine the peace process. Mr Rees-Mogg is one of the foremost Tories advocating that the UK leave both the customs union and the single market. He suggested during the interview that leaving both entities while keeping a soft Border between the Republic and Northern Ireland would be “very straightforward”, as neither the British nor the Irish government wanted to impose a hard Border. He cited claims by the head of HM Revenue and Customs, Jon Thompson, that a Border already exists between the Republic and the North. “It’s important to remember that there already is a Border: there is a Border for currency there is a Border for immigration there is a Border for excise, and there is a Border for VAT. But this does not need a physical infrastructure at the Border, and that’s what a hard Border is,” Mr Rees-Mogg said. “There may indeed need to be non-Border checks that take place – that would be perfectly reasonable in the new situation. But if we remain in the customs union and the single market, we’d lose the advantages of leaving.” Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":null,"title":"peston ireland has undermined britain for over 100 years","story":"  May 6, 2018TV presenter Robert Peston makes the claim during interview with Jacob Rees-Mogg "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3486674.1525695322!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"charitable status of not for profit pobal being reviewed","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIndependents4Change TD Mick Wallace has raised the issue of Pobal’s charitable status a number of times in the Dáil. Photograph: Bryan O’BrienThe company that manages Government and EU social inclusion programmes is to review its status as a registered charity, following questions about its entitlement to fees received from the Department of Children.Pobal, a not-for-profit statutory agency, began the review following confirmation by the Charities Regulator that it is examining the status of all statutory agencies listed on the register of charities.These examinations follow repeated questions in the Dáil about why Pobal, a not-for-profit State agency, is considered a charity when it received €13.5 million in fees in 2016 for the disbursement of €204 million in funds on behalf of the Department of Children. Minister for Rural and Community Affairs Michael Ring said: “Pobal has informed my department that it has commenced a review of its charitable status. The Charities Regulator has been informed of the process. It is expected that the review will take three to four months. “The board of Pobal will communicate the outcome of the review to my department through our existing corporate governance and oversight arrangements,” Mr Ring said in a written parliamentary reply to Independents4Change TD Mick Wallace. The regulator also informed the Wexford TD that “as part of our activity in 2018, the authority intends to initiate a review of those charities, which are on the register, that are also statutory bodies”.In a letter to Mr Wallace in February, chief executive of the regulatory authority John Farrelly said his office had worked closely with the Revenue Commissioners over the past two years “on the issue of entities that were deemed registered pursuant to section 40 of the Charities Act 2009 and a significant number have been removed from the register”.Mr Farrelly said that in 2014, Pobal and over 8,000 other organisations “including a number of State bodies” satisfied the criteria of Section 40 of the 2009 Charities Act, exempting them from tax.But the regulator stressed that “all entities on the (charities) register by virtue of section 40 are only deemed registered for so long as there continues to be an entitlement to such an exemption from the Revenue Commissioners”. Mr Wallace has raised the issue a number of times in the Dáil and also highlighted an internal departmental audit in 2014 which expressed concerns about payments made to Pobal to monitor compliance among childcare providers. “The auditors could not understand the annual fee of €2.5 million it received,” he said, although he acknowledged that the audit was before the appointment of Minister for Children Katherine Zappone. The auditors understood the department employed Pobal without a tender process and this approach had not been formally justified and the auditors did not know whether the contract with Pobal would be line with EU directives if legally challenged.“This is supposedly a not-for-profit charity,” Mr Wallace said. “The EU directive states that contracts greater €135,000 must be advertised and a competitive tendering process carried out.”Ms Zappone told the TD in the Dáil that legal advice “has indicated there is no obligation on Government departments to tender the contracts or arrangements made with Pobal for the management of funds”.She added that this reflected the Teckal exemption in EU procurement law “which states that open advertising and tendering rules for public contacts do not apply where a public body obtains services from in-house sources”.-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3468658.1524242996!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"le big mac emmanuel macron s rise and rise","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tWinning ways: Emmanuel Macron at his victory rally in Paris after being elected president, in May 2017. Photograph: Patrick KovarikAFPGettyPresident Emmanuel Macron likes to convince people. In manner and method, he is unlike his predecessors. Nicolas Sarkozy cajoled and bullied. François Hollande just gave up. Macron fixes interlocutors with his intense blue stare and builds a Cartesian argument. If that doesn’t work, he starts over, patiently, but with determination.The past week has tested the young president’s powers of persuasion. Early in the hours of April 14th, Macron used his constitutional power as commander in chief for the first time, joining the US and Britain in launching cruise missiles against three chemical weapons installations in Syria. The goal, Macron said later, was to convince Bashar al Assad and Vladimir Putin that the international community was more than a “nice” and “weak” body they could push around.In a further exercise in persuasion, Macron volunteered for a combative, 2½ hour live television interview on Sunday night, during which he made the surprising claim that, “Ten days ago, President Trump said the US would pull out of Syria. We convinced him it was necessary to stay for the duration.”The White House later issued a statement saying Trump’s view had not changed, and the French president made an embarrassing climbdown on Monday, claiming he “never said” the US or France would remain militarily engaged in Syria for the long term.Perhaps Macron, whose nickname is “Jupiter”, is threatened by hubris, the sin of pride that afflicted Greek gods.The rest of the week was one long attempt to convince Europeans and the French of the rightness of his positions. Macron – who has become the de facto leader of Europe – received the heads of the three Baltic states who have teamed up with five other northern EU countries, including the Netherlands and Ireland, to thwart his efforts to further integrate the euro zone.Then, before a more sympathetic audience at the EU parliament in Strasbourg, Macron pleaded with proponents of liberal democracy to wake up and oppose the populist authoritarians who deny European values. Macron then travelled to Berlin in yet another effort to enlist German chancellor Angela Merkel’s support for his European reform agenda.On Monday, Macron will go to Washington for a three-day state visit, the first of Trump’s presidential term. Although the two men have clashed on climate change, the Iran nuclear accord, trade protectionism and the rise of Eurosceptical populism, Trump appears to have been charmed by the young president, who says Franco-American co-operation is crucial in the fight against terrorism.As the first anniversary of Macron’s election approaches on May 7th, and a half century after the May 1968 revolution, a different kind of spring is flowering in France. For the first time in decades, the country is reversing its post second World War decline, and the persuasive Macron is turning France into the world’s greatest soft power.There is, of course, discontent. It wouldn’t be France if there wasn’t. This week Macron also confronted striking railway workers in the Vosges, telling them to “stop taking people hostage.” The country is struggling through a rolling strike over the reform of the SNCF railway company.And despite Macron’s best efforts to reassure them, many in France suspect their young president is out to destroy the familiar but dysfunctional “French social model”. In their eyes, Macron is pushing France into the chasm of savage, race-to-the bottom capitalism.So what do they make of him in his home town? The  travelled there to find out.Macron was born in Amiens, the capital of Picardy, 40 years ago and lived here until just before his 17th birthday. From age 11 to 16, he studied at the Jesuit school La Providence.Built in the graceless concrete style of the 1950s, “La Pro” is an elementary, secondary and technical school for 2,000 pupils, spread over several acres. Aside from occasional crucifixes, calendars of Pope Francis and portraits of St Ignatius of Loyola, the religious footprint is light. The teachers are lay people. The priest visits only once a week now.Not a single plaque or photograph records that the president and first lady of France passed through these corridors. Yet this is where Macron asked to be baptised at the age of 12, and where, at 15, he fell in love with his future wife, a French and drama teacher called Brigitte Trogneux Auzière.Macron has always been drawn to older people. His maternal grandmother, Germaine “Manette” Nogues, died in his arms five years ago, at the age of 97. The Protestant humanist philosopher Paul Ricoeur was a spiritual father to him the progressive socialist millionaire Henry Hermand his political mentor. “He’s attracted by knowledge, by people who have experience,” his neurologist father, Jean-Michel (67), says over lunch in Amiens.At La Pro and subsequently at Henri IV, France’s leading lycée and prep school in Paris, Macron often stayed after class to talk to teachers.Marc Defernand (78) taught Macron history and geography here, and was principal of Macron’s section. “He was more mature than other students,” says Defernand. “He always asked a lot of questions. Sometimes he would pick up a conversation we’d started eight days earlier, exactly where we’d left off.”In the autumn of 2016, Defernand queued in a local bookshop to ask Macron to sign his autobiographical manifesto, Révolution. The retired educator is moved, recalling what happened. “He grabbed me by the hand and said, ‘Monsieur Defernand! It’s so good to see you!’” Macron inscribed the book: “To Marc, this ‘Revolution’, which owes more to him than he knows. In friendship, Emmanuel.”We visit the 700-seat theatre where Emmanuel Macron and Brigitte Trogneux Auzière adapted a play by Eduardo De Filippo together.“He was dynamite,” Defernand says. “I told him that if he continued, he would be the Gérard Philippe of the 21st century. It was difficult for others to act in the same play with him. In the same way, it’s difficult for his cabinet ministers now.”Defernand wasn’t aware of the relationship at the time, though he knew Macron went often to Auzière’s house. “I assumed there was a flirt between him and her daughter Laurence,” he says.The scandal of a married teacher with three children having an affair with a student nearly 25 years her junior has been transformed into romantic legend. Everyone would rather forget the trauma.“Jesuits never pried into people’s private lives. There was no morality investigation,” Defernand says. “There were unmarried teachers living together at the time. I was more worried about students taking drugs.”The fact that Brigitte continued to teach at La Pro for years after her lover’s departure, and then transferred to Lycée St Louis de Gonzague when they began to live together later in Paris, is further evidence of tolerance, Defernand says.A tragic love story, known to most French people, occurred a quarter-century earlier and helped pave the way for Macron and Auzière.Schoolteacher Gabrielle Russier (32) had an affair with a lycée student half her age, Christian Rossi, in Marseille. The youth’s parents filed a complaint against the teacher and had their son placed in a mental hospital. Russier was given a suspended prison sentence and took her own life. The story became the subject of books, films and songs. Asked about it at a press conference, former president Georges Pompidou famously quoted a poem by Paul Eluard that was sympathetic to women accused of having slept with German soldiers during the war.The historian Jean-François Sirinelli\u0026nbspcompares the Russier and Macron stories in his book Les Révolutions françaises, to show how much France evolved in a single generation. “Gabrielle Russier takes her own life in 1969. Emmanuel Macron and his teacher start an affair in the 1990s, and in May 2017, Brigitte Macron becomes first lady of France.”Macron’s parents learned of the affair by chance. “My wife was much more upset than I was,” Prof Macron says. “It may sound macho, but I thought he’d get over it. He didn’t . . . I thought it was a little early. It wasn’t the way I envisioned life, but it wasn’t my life. I raised my children to be free and independent.”The Macrons didn’t consider filing charges against Brigitte Auzière, but they asked to meet her. “I was requisitioned to impose authority,” Prof Macron laughs. “I told her, ‘He’s a minor. I want him to complete his studies. After that, he’s free to do what he wants.’”The president’s parents have been hurt by press reports that they sent their son to Paris to get him away from Auzière. “He was going to go to Henri IV anyway. It was planned,” Prof Macron says, nonetheless admitting that perhaps Emmanuel “went a little early”.At La Pro, I ask a class of 14-15 year-olds, Macron’s age when he met Brigitte, if they could fall in love with a teacher. The teenagers laugh and say yes. “If it happened to someone our age, it would shock me,” says a student called Grégoire. “But now that he’s an adult, it doesn’t bother me.”The students say it’s “cool” that Macron is president. “He was elected because there was Marine Le Pen,” pipes in Ayoub, of north African origin. Perhaps parroting their parents’ opinions, the youths object to rising taxes and praise the appointment of cabinet ministers who are not professional politicians. For the future, they predict flying cars and tell me France will never know full employment.On a scale of one to 10, they give the young president an approval rating of seven. “He has to prove himself,” one explains. Like France, Macron’s successors at La Pro are waiting to see.The Amienois may seem blasé about their president, but his father attributes this attitude to the “taciturn, reserved” character of Picard people. The region particularly suffered in both world wars, has a miserable climate and has been decimated by de-industralisation.His son is an atypical Picard, “an extrovert” infused with the sun of the southwest on the side of his mother, Françoise Nogues-Macron.History and bloodlines led me to Macron père, to find out more about the family’s English ancestry. In February, Macron spent an evening with the Presidential Press Association. As the representative for foreign journalists, I was part of the welcoming party. I gave him a sepia postcard of English soldiers in Amiens in 1918. \u0026nbspMacron studied the photograph closely. “You know, they found me an English great grandfather,” he said with a laugh, staring at the postcard. “He was called George Robertson.” The president scrutinised the English faces for a long moment. He was looking for a face that resembled his own.Towards the end of last year’s presidential campaign, Brigitte Macron mentioned to British journalists that her husband had a great grandfather called “Mr Robertson from Bristol”. The London Times, Mirror and Daily Mail researched the story and told the Macrons more than they had ever known about “Mr Robertson”.George William Robertson was born in Bristol in December 1887, and is believed to have fought in the Battle of the Somme. Distant relatives in England have preserved his war medals.Robertson married Macron’s great grandmother, Suzanne Leblond, in the town of Abbeville, 40km from Amiens, in 1919. They had three daughters. The middle daughter, Jacqueline, born in 1922, was Emmanuel Macron’s paternal grandmother.“He disappeared from one day to the next,” Prof Macron told me. “No one in the family ever heard from him. Suzanne raised three daughters alone. She kept a very modest grocery shop in Abbeville. My parents sent me to live with her and my aunts for two years as a child.”The failed marriage to an Englishman “was never, never talked about. The family kept no trace of him. I never saw a picture,” Prof Macron continues. George Robertson married again, settled in east London and kept a grocery shop, like his ex-wife, Suzanne. A step-daughter told the Mirror that he liked to sing Roses of Picardy, which he had learned in the trenches.Had a butcher from Bristol not fought in the Somme, married a Frenchwoman and fathered her children, Emmanuel Macron would not exist, would not be president of France today.Macron’s intellectual precociousness and his relationship with Brigitte meant he “skipped his adolescence”, his father says. In the autumn of 1993, three months short of his 17th birthday, the future president moved to a garret near the Lycée Henri IV in Paris. \u0026nbspHe continued his relationship with Brigitte. “When I went to see him in his chambre de bonne, sometimes he called through the door for me to come back later,” Prof Macron laughs. “I knew she was there with him.”Christian Monjou taught Macron American and British civilisation for three years at Henri IV. Though he did not know about the romance, Monjou noticed that Macron raced off to Amiens the moment classes ended on Saturday. “It was a case of\u0026nbsp ‘the ided self’,” Monjou says in an interview in his book-lined study.Macron obtained his baccalauréat with honours, but twice failed the entrance exam for the École Normale Supérieure, which trains French academics. It was the only failure of his life. Had it not been for the distraction of romance with Brigitte, Monjou says, Macron would have succeeded in the exam and become an academic.Against all odds, Brigitte Macron eventually orced and moved to Paris to live with Emmanuel. They married in 2007. “Without her, I would not be me,” Macron said during the campaign.Macron went on to earn a doctorate in philosophy, then reoriented his life towards politics with degrees from Sciences Po and the École Nationale d’Administration (ENA). “He used failure as a launching pad,” says Monjou. “That is typical of a leader.”“Have you brought your helmet and bulletproof vest?” the taxi driver who takes me to the Whirlpool clothes dryer factory in north Amiens asks. It’s a joke, of course, but the “Whirlpools” are notoriously hostile. A year ago, Marine Le Pen promised their factory would not close if she became president. Macron ignored advice and plunged into the crowd of angry strikers, saying, “If you listen to the security guys, you’re dead.”The factory will move to Poland at the end of May. Most of the 290 workers have been promised retraining or jobs building “intelligent” refrigerators by the factory’s new owner. But they’re still angry. On the day I visit, management proposed a clothes dryer in lieu of a severance bonus.“Macron, Macron. He’s not a god. We’re losing jobs. We don’t give a damn about Macron,” François Gorlia, the in-house union leader, tells me on the phone when he refuses to come to the gate to talk to me.“He’s a right-wing guy. Everything for the rich. Nothing for the poor,” Sibylle (39), an assembly line worker says as she arrives for the 1pm shift. She’ll benefit from Macron’s investment in training for the jobless, but she isn’t convinced. “Training is fine and dandy, but there are no jobs.”After lunch in a simple bistro, Macron’s father Jean-Michel guides me through a maze of streets under construction, to the music conservatory where his son studied piano for nine years. When he failed the conservatory exam after his first year, Macron’s mother told his biographer Anne Fulda, the boy insisted on having the same examiner the second year, an early sign of his determination to convince. He played well, Prof Macron recalls, mastering Bach’s devilishly difficult Goldberg Variations.Prof Macron gives me the address of the modest, two-storey brick bungalow where Emmanuel and his two siblings grew up, and where the neurologist still lives with his second wife. “It’s not Neuilly,” Macron père says laughing, referring to the Beverly Hills-like Paris suburb where Nicolas Sarkozy came from. Though they are both doctors, Macron’s parents earned low, public sector salaries. “They weren’t neurosurgeons with private jets,” comments a presidential adviser.The Trogneux chocolate shop, near the cathedral in central Amiens, is where Brigitte Macron’s family have made chocolates and macaroons for five generations. They also own the local Renault dealership.Black-and-white photographs of successive generations of the Trogneux chocolate dynasty hang inside the shop. There is no photograph or mention of Brigitte Trogneux Auzière Macron. Jean-Alexandre Trogneux (57), the first lady’s nephew and godson, agrees to be photographed, but refuses to talk about the presidential couple. “We’ve made it a golden rule,” he says. “We don’t talk about them and they don’t talk about us.”Fabien Dorémus (32) heads the political book section of a shop in central Amiens. Macron’s Révolution sold more than 400 copies there, an “enormous” number, Dorémus says. He had no desire to read it, and dismisses the book – and Macron – as “all slogans and clichés”. A former journalist whose local online newspaper failed for lack of funding, Dorémus is close to the far left party France Unbowed.\u0026nbspSince Macron’s election, Dorémus says, “I’m not optimistic for workers, pensioners and people who need public services. I am very optimistic for the rich.”The bookseller mentions various left-wing grievances against Macron, arising from a handful of disparaging remarks since 2014: Macron referred to slaughterhouse workers who were losing their jobs as “illiterate” Macron told a heckler wearing an anti-Macron T-shirt, “The best way to buy a suit is to get a job” Macron called protesters against his labour reforms “slackers” and accused strikers of wanting to foutre le bordel, or wreak havoc.It’s hardly “let them eat cake”. But the president has been hanged and burned in effigy by protesters. “You have to put yourself in the place of the people who get told they are slackers and freeloaders,” Dorémus says. “He’s contemptuous of the lower classes. People started hating him because they feel disrespected.”Another criticism, made by Macron’s former teachers, is that his speeches are often so long and intellectual that they can be difficult to follow.And attempts to control the president’s image can be counterproductive. The novelist Emmanuel Carrère was given exclusive access to the president and first lady. In two interviews with Macron, there was “one really strong, beautiful sentence”, Carrère wrote in the . “And this really strong, really beautiful sentence was off the record. In its place I was given permission to use a perfectly dull, perfectly formatted variant.”In the course of a day in President Macron’s home town, there is not a single photograph of him to be seen.Brigitte Fouré, the city’s mayor, tells me the poverty rate is two percentage points higher than the national average, and 80 per cent of inhabitants qualify for social housing. Amiens is ided between disadvantaged north and middle-class south. It was ruled by a communist mayor for 18 years in the 1970s and 1980s.Macron spent less than 17 years in Amiens, Fouré notes. He “went up” to Paris nearly a quarter of a century ago. “People here don’t know him. A lot of people are proud that the president is from Amiens, but that’s it. There has never been a real relationship between him and the city. There is no emotional tie.”On a beautiful spring day, the Élysée Palace feels light years away from dreary Picardy. The top-floor office of a close presidential adviser has a view over the gardens and the Eiffel Tower in the distance.Macron’s entourage is comprised mostly of fervently devoted young men with backgrounds similar to his own. No one at the Élysée, other than the president, can be quoted by name. “Our rule is that no one gets inidual credit for anything,” the adviser explains.The adviser reportedly thought up the slogan used by Macron when Trump pulled out of the Paris accord on climate change, “Make our planet great again!” But he refuses to confirm this. “We work collectively. Everything we do belongs to the president.”The adviser counts a resurgence of French pride as Macron’s greatest achievement so far. “It’s been a long time since the French have been proud to be French, in the eyes of the world,” he says. Though it contradicts my experience in Amiens, the statement rings true. Most people in the professional milieus of Paris adore Macron and are proud of his presidency.A few doors from the president’s office, the adviser lists Macron’s “important victories”: the revision of the labour code and the taxation of capital investments the overhaul of the country’s education system changes to the EU’s posted workers directive ending the giant squat at Notre-Dames-des-Landes and dismantling the nuclear reactor at Fessenheim. The last two issues had festered for decades. “They seemed impossible for any preceding majority,” the adviser says.Macron is doing as much for the disadvantaged as for the rich, the adviser insists. “We have increased basic payments to the poor, the disabled and the elderly. We’re decreasing social charges on lower salaries. The pendulum has swung much more towards the least advantaged than the most privileged.”So why isn’t that message getting through? Why do polls indicate that a majority consider Macron the “president of the rich”?For one reason, the adviser says. “He was an investment banker. What’s more, at Rothschild the most symbolic bank in the world. For many people, that proves his competence. The thing that makes him hated by some is the reason why he is respected by others.”Because Macron worked for four years as an investment banker, “everything he does that is perceived as right-wing or for the rich is blown out of proportion”, the adviser says.“And everything he does for the underprivileged, that would be seen as left-wing, is discounted. It’s a problem of perception.”Opinion polls can be read two ways. An Ifop-Fiducial poll published on April 10th gave Macron a 55 per cent approval rating, high for France, 11 months into a presidency. But a BFM poll published four days later showed that 44 per cent of voters are “disappointed”.Nine years of piano and the rigour of France’s best schools have honed Macron’s powers of concentration. On April 17th, he took questions from MEPs in Strasbourg for three hours, without notes, without so much as jotting down a question – a regular performance for Macron.“He is someone with a great capacity of attention and concentration,” says Monjou. “People who’ve met him often tell me they were struck by the intensity with which he looks at them, as if, for the time they are with him, they are all that matters.”“When you talk to him, it is as if he is downloading your brain,” says a former cabinet minister who sometimes advises Macron.Geraldine Byrne-Nason, now Ireland’s Ambassador to the United Nations, is doubtless the Irish official who knows Macron best. She became friends with the future president when both were “sherpas”, responsible for briefing and accompanying Irish and French leaders to EU summits, between 2012 until 2014. Byrne-Nason represented the taoiseach’s office, Macron the Élysée Palace.“We spent hours and hours in corridors through the night while the heads of state and government were locked in meetings,” Byrne-Nason recalls. “Emmanuel would be one of my first points of repair. If you’re going to be there for seven hours, you want someone interesting to talk to.”Byrne-Nason calls Macron “an insider-outsider” who has mastered the system but is able to regard it with detachment. “He has a healthy disrespect for bureaucracy, and Brussels is the home of process and procedure,” she says. “In that regard, we were kindred spirits. There was a slight impatience with the weight of slow-turning wheels.”Macron was particularly understanding of Irish difficulties during the bailout, Byrne-Nason says. She believes he was responsible for support offered by then president François Hollande.Byrne-Nason sent glowing reports about Macron’s potential to Dublin, long before he became a presidential candidate. Last September, she listened to what she calls his “extraordinary speech in favour of international co-operation and law” at the UN General Assembly. “It was poetic. It was powerful. It lit up the place.” Ireland could have signed off on every word, Byrne-Nason says, calling Macron “a superstar president who generates both respect and influence here amongst the 193 countries of the UN”.If Macron were Irish, he might be a hybrid of President Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar: part poetic intellectual, rooted in left-wing Christianity and fascinated by ideas part dynamic young liberal, determined to make the economy flourish.When Christian Monjou was Macron’s teacher at Henri IV, he says Macron talked a lot about the Fabians, the centre-left British intellectuals who founded the London School of Economics. The Fabians believed in “the inevitability of gradualness, the idea that everything that is gradual you won’t be able to go back on,” Monjou says. “It is totally anti-French, with our tradition of revolution, not evolution.“French political life is saturated in ideology,” Monjou continues. “With Macron, there is something you might call empirical or pragmatic. It’s familiar to an Anglo-Saxon, but it stands out in France. I suspect this slightly Anglo-Saxon approach may come from listening to me for three years.”Macron’s adviser stresses he is more than a mere pragmatist who would be content to solve one problem after another. “The two legs of Emmanuel Macron are action and reflection,” he says. “He always does both.”Macron’s en même temps mantra seeks to reconcile irreconcilabables, such as liberalism and social protection. The challenge is most obvious in his self-described “humane but realistic” immigration policy. Measures such as the Collomb circular, which authorises police to search emergency shelters for illegal migrants, have alienated some of Macron’s closest allies.In 1997, Macron’s spiritual father Paul Ricoeur delivered a lecture titled Foreigner Myself. Ricoeur cited Leviticus, about “the stranger that dwelleth with you”, and the Gospel of Matthew, which says: “I was a stranger and you took me in.” Opponents of Macron’s tough immigration policy say he has betrayed Ricoeur’s ideals. The criticism must sting, but Macron believes that unless he calms fears of unlimited migration, extreme right-wing populists will continue to gain ground, in France and across Europe.The necessity of ending the “society of status” in which family background, education and profession determine all aspects of one’s life, “gives coherence to everything we are doing”, says the presidential adviser.Philippe Aghion, who teaches economics at Harvard, the London School of Economics and the Collège de France, has greatly influenced the president’s economic thinking.Contrary to Thomas Piketty, the French author of the best-selling Capital in the 21st Century, Aghion and Macron believe that increasing social mobility, not high taxation, is the most effective way of reducing income inequality.Aghion wants to wean France off its post-second World War reliance on the Keynesian welfare state, in which government spending stimulates demand. He is inspired by John Maynard Keynes’s exact contemporary, the Austrian-born economist and Harvard professor Joseph Schumpeter, who believed that innovation and technical progress are the basis of a prosperous economy.Aghion’s theories underlie Macron’s reform of the French labour code last year, and the ongoing reform of professional training. It is, Aghion admitted in an interview, a liberal economic policy. But, he insists, it is also a social policy.Schumpeter believed in creative destruction, “which means you constantly have new jobs replacing old jobs, new firms replacing old firms”, Aghion says. It’s a hard sell to a French public that craves security and is adverse to change.Aghion advocates Danish-style “flexicurity” that combines labour market flexibility with unemployment benefits and retraining for laid-off workers. “In a nutshell: innovation, social protection and social mobility. That’s the triangle you want to achieve,” he says. Listening to him is like hearing Macron speak.Macron’s parents were left-leaning agnostics who did not baptise their children. At the age of 12, probably under the influence of his surroundings at La Pro, Macron asked to make his First Communion. A black-and-white photograph provided by one of his teachers, Gérard Banc, shows the future president making his profession of faith.Macron’s intellectual affiliation has been with the Christian left, with Ricoeur and Esprit magazine, for which he wrote a half-dozen articles, and whose board he sat on. French media interpreted gestures at Macron’s campaign rallies as signs of mysticism, for example when he asked his followers to “show benevolence”, or ended rallies Christ-like, with outstretched arms. On the night of his election, he concluded his speech in front of IM Pei’s glass pyramid at the Louvre with the words, “I will serve you with love”.During his evening with the Presidential Press Association, I asked Macron if, 28 years after his baptism, he still has faith. Personal belief is a taboo subject in secular France. Embarrassed laughter rippled across the room, but he addressed my question.“I believe in something we don’t see, yes,” Macron said. “I have faith in the generic sense of the term. If one doesn’t believe in one’s lucky star, in good fortune, in one’s country, one doesn’t do what I’m doing. I believe in a form of transcendency.”Following Macron’s April 9th speech to French bishops, leftists and Freemasons accused him of attacking la laicité, which has been France’s official policy of state-enforced secularism since 1905.“We share the confused feeling that the link between church and state has been damaged, and that it is as important to you as it is to me to repair it,” Macron said.\u0026nbsp The purpose of laicité was “certainly not to deny spirituality” he argued. \u0026nbsp“For biographical, personal and intellectual reasons, I have the highest opinion of Catholics.”There is something Jesuitical, indeed monklike, about Macron. Unlike his predecessors, he shows no need to eat, sleep or chase women. Asked what has been the “greatest trial” of being in office, the French president said he has “measured the weight and the solitude and the end of innocence” that come with power.“I do not think it is a trial,” Macron continued. “The French have authorised me to do what I committed to do. One thing is certain. There is no respite, which may explain why I sometimes look pale. I do not feel authorised to enjoy any form of leisure. I take time to reflect. I read and write. But in the times we live in, there is no room for respite. That may be the trial of power, though I don’t live it as such. There is undeniably a form of asceticism.”Macron sees his rise to power as the result of a troubled epoch. “I don’t forget where I come from and why I am here today,” he said. “I am the fruit of a form of brutality in history, of a break-in, because France was unhappy and uneasy. If I forget that for one moment, it will be the beginning of the trial.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3486656.1525684590!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"russia s putin sworn in for another six years in office","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tRussian President Vladimir Putin has been sworn in for another six years .

On June 17, 2017 De Melo Moreira was photographing the gay pride parade for AFP, with temperatures reaching 42C in the capital.A villager of Sanguinheira stands in front of the gate of her house as a wildfire approaches the village in Macao, central Portugal, on July 25During the parade I had mentioned to my colleagues about the possibility of that weather conditions could trigger wildfires. So at the end of the parade we said we will keep in touch if we knew of anything.Later that night a colleague from another agency called me saying there was a wildfire blazing at Pedrógão Grande. The number of victims at that point was already 29, a number that would later increase. De Melo Moreira set off with a colleague late in the evening. The crew did not stop until the early hours of  June 19.The news of the spreading wildfires and the growing death tolls quickly caught the attention of international media. The demand for information was huge, the Lisbon-based photographer says.A firefighter stands in the middle of a road near flames blazing near the village of Sanguinheira, in Macao, central Portugal, on July 25The team carried on for four days through the exhaustion of working under high temperatures, intense smoke and long hours. Emotionally we were facing the tragedy and despair of people who lost their family and friends but also their houses and belongings, we had to continue working, De Melo Moreira said.An estimated 64 people died during those four days, almost all of them were killed in their cars as they tried to flee the flames.The coverage of a wildfire is very intense, especially when we have a huge demand to send over the story as fast as we can and we are working in extreme conditions, De Melo Moreira told The .When it comes to the dangers associated with this type of story, the photographer told The  that she takes precautions, such as never going alone to a fire and always letting the firefighters know where she is. I get close enough but not so close that I put myself in danger. I really respect the power of nature and I already know how unpredictable a wildfire can be.Isabel Godinho, 63, cries inside her burnt garage at Vilas de Pedro, Figueiro dos Vinhos, on June 19Photographing the aftermath, however, can be the hardest part of the job. Capturing all the damage and destruction in people’s lives can be the most difficult, I had to turn away to hold back my tears many times. Some stories aren’t photographable, I just hear them and picture them in my head, and incredible as it may be those images will form in my head in the end of the day when I’m alone in the hotel room and I can’t fall asleep.Between June and October, the driest summer in nearly 90 years, hundreds of fires raged across northern and central Portugal.Firefighters tackle a wildfire close to the village of Pucarica in Abrantes on August 10I covered most of the major wildfires in the centre of the country, it was extremely difficult to cover so many blazing at the same time, the photographer told The .The 2017 bushfires burnt a record 520,000 hectares of forest, an area 52 times the size of Lisbon and representing nearly 60 per cent of the total area burnt in the entire EU that year. That compares with an annual average of just over 83,000 hectares between 2008 and 2016.The last summer in Portugal was completely different from any other summer in the past years, it was a dark summer, De Melo Moreira said.  Forest rangers watch smoke rising from a wildfire in Gois, Coimbra district, on June 20The number of victims, injured, houses destroyed and territory burnt are incomparable. In my opinion it has to do with climate change. We are experiencing an increase in heatwaves in recent summers, very dry weather and strong winds and that leads to more deadly and devastating wildfires. Constança Urbano de Sousa, whose interior ministry was in charge of firefighting, resigned in October after facing public criticism over her handling of the fires. The government also came close to falling.Asked whether she feels that Portugal will be better prepared this year, De Melo Moreira is not optimistic.A wildfire at Vale de Abelha village in Macao, on August 16I hope my country is better prepared but I think the prevention will take more than a year to get set up.The magnitude of the disaster is believed to have been the result of a perfect storm of extreme weather conditions, bad forest management, a deficient communication system and arson.The forest management will take years to be amended, instead of growing high flammable but profitable trees like eucalyptus and pine trees we need to find other species that can contain the fires when they start.More than 90 percent of Portugal\u0027s 30,000 firefighters are volunteers and their equipment is bought with public donations.Portuguese firefighters have all the heart and bravery needed but clearly when Portugal is facing this problem every summer we need to have a specialised professional force.Behind the ShutterPlease review our commenting policyUK weather: May Bank Holiday heat record broken as temperatures could rise to 28CArmed patrols stepped up across London after Bank Holiday weekend of violenceArchbishop of Canterbury preparing for Royal wedding by listening to StormzyWhat do Kim Jong-un\u0026#39s shoes reveal about the reclusive North Korean leader?Russia\u0026#39s Putin sworn in for another six years in office Korean Air matriarch under investigation as employees demand ousting of \u0026#39nut rage\u0026#39 familyTory MP Johnny Mercer: My battles with mental illness - and how Army veterans are being exploited and failedMillennials \u0026#39have no qualms about GM crops\u0026#39 unlike older generationOn this day in 1945: The Germans surrender in World War TwoComment: A disgrace to the job... but \u0026#39Bully\u0026#39 Bercow still has his uses in ParliamentNearly 200 horses found dead on Navajo land in drought-hit Arizona Boris Johnson warns Trump that abandoning Iran nuclear deal could spark \u0026#39dash for a bomb\u0026#39Hizbollah on course to tighten grip on Lebanon, according to early resultsResearchers say there is no secret chamber in Tutankhamun\u0026#39s tomb after allDonald Trump\u0026#39s pick to run the CIA, Gina Haspel, offered to withdraw over \u0026#39torture\u0026#39 roleBoys aged 13 and 15 shot on high street in north-west LondonCampaigners warn against sale of fields and green spaces which \u0026#39save NHS more than £100 million a year\u0026#39Toxic gas follows molten lava as erupting Hawaii volcano destroys homes\u0026#39Mob fixer\u0026#39 who stopped gangster terrorising Steven Gerrard shot dead by gunman on a bikeWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/05/07/TELEMMGLPICT000162328279_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqMNXAjrQuC5hshkZY4lLDITLc2RSN87h2tEpyeVqDDtY.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"do kim jong uns shoes reveal reclusive north korean leader","story":"Kim Jong-un (left) may be one or two inches shorter than South Korean President Moon Jae-in (right), reports suggestIn the aftermath of a landmark summit on denuclearisation and the possible end of the Korean War, South Korea’s media have found time to analyse other great matters of state – the meaning of Kim Jong-un’s oddly shaped shoes. The conservative Chosun Ilbo newspaper dedicated a full-page spread to experts scrutinising Kim’s summit footwear, concluding that he may actually be shorter than previously reported. According to a translation by the Washington Post, Kim’s shoes displayed a suspicious slope that appeared to suggest he was wearing insoles to push his feet upward. Using videos and photographs, the experts argued that Kim may be nearly two inches shorter than South Korean President Moon...To continue reading this articleStart your free trial of PremiumAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekAccess one Premium article per weekRegister for freeTo continue reading this article log in to your  account.

Police detained Mr Navalny and some 1,600 other protesters, according to independent monitor OVD Info. Opposition leader Alexei Navalny is detained at protests two days before Mr Putin\u0026#39s inaugurationIn a state of the nation speech before the election, Mr Putin called for economic growth and increased government spending but also announced hypersonic nuclear weapons to overcome US missile defence, continuing the belligerent rhetoric of recent years.Although Russia\u0027s economy has emerged from a recession and is expected to grow 1.7 per cent this year, it has suffered volatile oil prices and Western sanctions, and 20 million are now living below the poverty line.According to the constitution, Mr Putin cannot run for president again, causing uncertainty about Russia\u0027s long-term future.  Among the guests of honour at the Kremlin on Monday was American actor Steven Seagal, who received a Russian passport from Mr Putin in 2016, as well as Alexander “Surgeon” Zaldostanov, the leather-clad head of the patriotic Night Wolves biker gang.Former German chancellor Gerhard Schroder, who was appointed chairman of Russia\u0027s state oil giant Rosneft last year, stood next to prime minister Dmitry Medvedev and Russian Orthodox patriarch Kirill. Current German leader Angela Merkel will meet with Mr Putin in Sochi later this month, a Kremlin aide said on Monday. This week, Mr Putin will receive Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu, who is expected to push back against Russia\u0027s announcement it would deliver S-300 surface-to-air missiles to Syria following American, French and British airstrikes there.Social media users poked fun at the pompous ceremony, especially when the head of the constitutional court appeared to mix up similar-sounding Russian words and declare Mr Putin\u0027s new term a “crime” rather than an “appointment”.UK weather: May Bank Holiday heat record broken as temperatures could rise to 28CArmed patrols stepped up across London after Bank Holiday weekend of violenceArchbishop of Canterbury preparing for Royal wedding by listening to StormzyWhat do Kim Jong-un\u0026#39s shoes reveal about the reclusive North Korean leader?Korean Air matriarch under investigation as employees demand ousting of \u0026#39nut rage\u0026#39 familyBehind the shutter: Patrícia de Melo Moreira on photographing Portugal\u0026#39s infernoTory MP Johnny Mercer: My battles with mental illness - and how Army veterans are being exploited and failedMillennials \u0026#39have no qualms about GM crops\u0026#39 unlike older generationOn this day in 1945: The Germans surrender in World War TwoComment: A disgrace to the job... but \u0026#39Bully\u0026#39 Bercow still has his uses in ParliamentNearly 200 horses found dead on Navajo land in drought-hit Arizona Boris Johnson warns Trump that abandoning Iran nuclear deal could spark \u0026#39dash for a bomb\u0026#39Hizbollah on course to tighten grip on Lebanon, according to early resultsResearchers say there is no secret chamber in Tutankhamun\u0026#39s tomb after allDonald Trump\u0026#39s pick to run the CIA, Gina Haspel, offered to withdraw over \u0026#39torture\u0026#39 roleBoys aged 13 and 15 shot on high street in north-west LondonCampaigners warn against sale of fields and green spaces which \u0026#39save NHS more than £100 million a year\u0026#39Toxic gas follows molten lava as erupting Hawaii volcano destroys homes\u0026#39Mob fixer\u0026#39 who stopped gangster terrorising Steven Gerrard shot dead by gunman on a bikeWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"asda sainsburys merger deal latest job losses new economics foundation","story":"Supermarket boss has promised 10 per cent price cuts for customersUp to 2,500 jobs in supply chains could be at risk from the proposed merger of Asda and Sainsbury’s, the New Economics Foundation has warned. According to analysis by the think tank, the promised price cuts – Sainsbury’s CEO Mike Coupe has pledged a 10 per cent reduction for consumers – will be passed onto suppliers. The NEF found that a 5 per cent cut in output for these suppliers could lead to a loss of more than 1,200 jobs, while a 10 per cent cut could lead to a loss of up to 2,500 jobs.Former Asda exec slams Sainsbury’s deal and says it should be blockedSainsbury’s boss caught singing ‘We’re in the money’ before interviewSainsbury’s fights back amid tough retail market with Asda merger planIn addition, the NEF warned, total job losses connected to the merger could end up higher still “as these estimates do not cover the total supply chain, or the further impact of lost demand in local economies from reduced spending by companies, employees and their families, which could lead to further business closures and job losses outside of supermarket supply chains”.“If the proposed merger between Sainsbury’s and Asda is allowed to proceed, we are likely to see a classic case of monopoly-like power in a mark,” said Alfie Stirling, head of economics at the New Economics Foundation.“This is part of a broader picture, where time and again UK capitalism shows itself to be geared against small business in a way rarely seen in the rest of Western Europe. Small and medium-sized firms make up more than 99 per cent of all UK companies, 60 per cent of employment and nearly half of turnover, yet they are repeatedly required to play second fiddle.” Business minister Andrew Griffiths said last week that he had spoken with the groceries code adjudicator, Christine Tacon, “to reiterate the importance of ensuring suppliers, and in particular SMEs, are treated fairly” by Asda and Sainsbury’s. or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

According to analysis by the think tank, the promised price cuts – Sainsbury’s CEO Mike Coupe has pledged a 10 per cent reduction for consumers – will be passed onto suppliers. The NEF found that a 5 per cent cut in output for these suppliers could lead to a loss of more than 1,200 jobs, while a 10 per cent cut could lead to a loss of up to 2,500 jobs.Former Asda exec slams Sainsbury’s deal and says it should be blockedSainsbury’s boss caught singing ‘We’re in the money’ before interviewSainsbury’s fights back amid tough retail market with Asda merger planIn addition, the NEF warned, total job losses connected to the merger could end up higher still “as these estimates do not cover the total supply chain, or the further impact of lost demand in local economies from reduced spending by companies, employees and their families, which could lead to further business closures and job losses outside of supermarket supply chains”.“If the proposed merger between Sainsbury’s and Asda is allowed to proceed, we are likely to see a classic case of monopoly-like power in a mark,” said Alfie Stirling, head of economics at the New Economics Foundation.“This is part of a broader picture, where time and again UK capitalism shows itself to be geared against small business in a way rarely seen in the rest of Western Europe. Small and medium-sized firms make up more than 99 per cent of all UK companies, 60 per cent of employment and nearly half of turnover, yet they are repeatedly required to play second fiddle.” Business minister Andrew Griffiths said last week that he had spoken with the groceries code adjudicator, Christine Tacon, “to reiterate the importance of ensuring suppliers, and in particular SMEs, are treated fairly” by Asda and Sainsbury’s. or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

They did so this year with added piquancy because it was the 50th anniversary of the famous “Mai 68” when, in the Latin Quarter of Paris, the Left Bank, the whole month was devoted to riotous assembly led by students. In contemplating these events, I recall Wordsworth’s often quoted phrase: “Bliss it was in that dawn to be alive” – unless, of course, you were struck by a cobblestone hurled by a student demonstrator or soaked and knocked off balance by a police water cannon.Presumably those who were demonstrating in Paris last Tuesday have now resumed their normal lives. The point about May 1968, however, is that they didn’t go back to college or to work the next day, they carried on, some of them for the whole month. Why was that? After all, economic growth had been unusually strong, the country was calm, both politically and socially, inflation was weak, living standards had been rising and there was little unemployment.Was it in a way a very 1960s thing? That question is prompted by a French historian of the period, Éric Alary, who observes that “May 68 is seen as a period when audacious moves seemed possible and during which society profoundly changed”. For that is an accurate description of the nature of the 1960s, whether in Western Europe or in North America.At the same time, there was a big rise in the sheer number of young people as a result of an increase in the birth rate in the closing stages of the Second World War and for some years afterwards. Thus, in France, the under-20 cohort rose from 30.7 per cent of the population in 1954 to 33.8 per cent in 1968. At the same time in France (1967), the school leaving age was raised from 14 to 16.  Two men take evasive action during a Paris street riot on 30 May (Getty)This required a massive expansion of teaching staff and building. As a result, students often found themselves being taught by hastily trained teachers in hastily built class rooms. In France, as in Britain, this was followed by a big expansion of the university sector. There was inevitably something ramshackle about it all, and students noticed. Yet the command structures of educational establishments remained unchanged. Nonetheless, universities are never just academic establishments full stop. For their campuses and their indoor and outdoor spaces lend themselves to meetings and debates and even to organising mini demonstrations. The intellectual gods of these 1960s students were Marx, Freud and Sartre, the French existentialist philosopher. In a famous passage, Sartre wrote that “God does not exist, and as a result man is forlorn, because neither within himself nor without does he find anything to cling to”. This struck home. For as Bob Dylan sang in 1965 – “How does it feelHow does it feelTo be on your ownWith no direction homeLike a complete unknownLike a rolling stone?”One had either to start things on one’s own without adult backing, or not at all. This was an unprecedented and intoxicating freedom. As the French student leader Dany Cohn-Bendit told the Paris demonstrators in May 1968: “There are no marshals and leaders today. Nobody is responsible for you. You are responsible for yourselves.”In fact, as is the way of things, Mai 68 began not in central Paris, but in Nanterre, a suburb seven miles to the northwest, and not in May but on 22 March. The construction of the university of Nanterre campus in a bleak shanty town had begun in 1962. In the spring of 1968 it was still not finished. The building were exceedingly functional and contained some 12,000 students. They were particularly shocked to find themselves living and doing their studies in what was in effect a building site. They demanded, too, the right to circulate freely between the residences of males and female students, still forbidden in what one might call pre-1960s style. There was a lot of justified discontent.Daniel Cohn-Bendit  was known as ‘Dany le Rouge’ because of his politics as well as the colour of his hair (Getty)Some 150 students, including far-left groups together with a small number of poets and musicians, occupied a building. The police surrounded it. After publication of the students’ wishes, they left the building without any trouble. But then they took their protest movement to the Sorbonne in the very middle of the Latin Quarter. That was how Mai 68 started.In a drastic action, the authorities shut down the University of Nanterre on 2 May. The students who had decamped to the Sorbonne were bound to think that this was a hostile act, an outbreak of war between the university authorities and the student body. It had been natural to head to the Sorbonne, France’s premier university, which had the prestige of its ancient foundation 700 years earlier. This meant nothing to the police, of course, who invaded the Sorbonne the next day.In response, on 6 May the national students’ union and the union of university teachers organised a protest march. It was one of the key events of the month. The head of the Paris police was obsessed by the need to protect the Sorbonne and its surroundings from a massive invasion by the students. He placed 1,500 officers in defence. But then came 6,000 protesters in waves. Overnight the confrontation was particularly violent. Thousands of cobblestones were ripped up and used as projectiles by the demonstrators. The police responded with teargas grenades. Dozens of gendarmes were taken to hospitals. Students were wrenched from the arms of the police by their colleagues.The next day, students, teachers and increasing numbers of young workers gathered at the Arc de Triomphe to demand that all criminal charges against arrested students be dropped, that the police leave the university and that the authorities reopen Nanterre and the Sorbonne. But negotiations broke down. When the students returned to their campuses to find that the police were still in occupation, a near revolutionary fervour began to grip them.The lyrics of Bob Dylan captured the sense of isolation and alienation felt by many young people (Redferns)The events were broadcast on radio as they occurred, and the aftermath was shown on television the following day. This demonstration of heavy handed police brutality brought on a wave of sympathy for the strikers. Moreover, in a highly significant move, the major union federations called a one-day strike and demonstration for Monday, 13 May. The workers were going to march with the students.They had their own grievances. There had been sporadic industrial trouble since the beginning of the year. More than half of them put in a 48-hour week. They feared that their standard of living had ceased to improve. Unemployment, albeit from a low base, was beginning to rise. As a result this was no longer a Paris event, for workers took to the streets throughout France. Their slogan was “Ten years! That’s enough!” referred to Charles de Gaulle’s long period as president.French politicians Michel Debre and Andre Malraux at the tomb of the unknown soldier, demonstrating their support for De Gaulle (Getty)The events the next day, 14 May, were as important. For workers began occupying factories, starting with a sit-down strike at the Sud Aviation plants near the city of Nantes. If students could occupy their universities, then workers could seize control of their factories. By 16 May, workers had occupied roughly 50 factories throughout France and 200,000 were on strike by 17 May. That figure snowballed to two million workers on strike the following day (18 May) and then ten million, or roughly two thirds of the French workforce on strike the following week (23 May).The unions assumed that the workers simply wanted more pay. So, when they were able to negotiate substantial pay increases with employers’ associations, they thought their job was done. But workers had also demanded the ousting of the De Gaulle government and in some cases demanded to run their own factories.The demonstrations and the strikes went on. Meanwhile on the morning of 29 May, De Gaulle suddenly boarded a helicopter and left the country. He went to the headquarters of the French military in Germany and called a meeting of Council of Ministers for 30 May back in Paris. On that same day, the unions led 400,000 to 500,000 protesters through Paris chanting “Adieu, De Gaulle”. The head of the Paris police carefully avoided the use of force.Sensibly De Gaulle responded by dissolving the National Assembly and calling a new election for 23 June. He ordered the workers to return to work immediately, threatening to institute a state of emergency if they did not. The Communist Party agreed to the holding of the election. Immediately revolutionary feelings began to fade away. The police retook the Sorbonne on 16 June. And the Gaullists won the greatest victory in French parliamentary history.The May days of 1968, it turned out, had been a convulsive moment, nothing more enduring than that.

However, animals were not the only threat. Kenya was at the time a British colony.During the Mau Mau uprising of the 1950s, white families were fair game to the rebels thanks in no small part to the brutal nature of colonial rule. (In 2011 William Hague expressed “sincere regret” for the thousands who had been detained and tortured.) When Sheldrick was nine months pregnant she survived an ambush by Mau Mau fighters.Chained and tortured: The horror inflicted on India’s elephantsSo when a wild elephant she had mistaken for one of her hand-reared orphans turned on her in 1994, she took it in her stride.“I opened my eyes. I could feel the elephant gently insert her tusks between my body and the rocks,” she wrote in her autobiography, Love, Life and Elephants: An African Love Story, in 2012.“Rather than a desire to kill, I realised that the elephant was actually trying to help me,” she added. “I knew then and there that I had an absolute duty to pass on my intimate knowledge and understanding of Africa’s wild animals and my belonging to Kenya.”Born Daphne Marjorie Jenkins, Sheldrick came from a family of settlers who left rural Scotland for Africa in the mid-1820s. Her great-uncle Will, a successful farmer in South Africa, began the family’s connection with Kenya after meeting governor Sir Charles Eliot. Eliot was offering free land to families prepared to move to his new colony. Among the families that subsequently boarded the boat to Mombasa were Daphne Sheldrick’s great-grandparents.The author’s work on the Ban the Bloody Ivory campaign drew in stars including Joanna Lumley (front, centre) (Rex)The settlers arrived to an uncertain future in a country with none of the comforts of home. They could not move their livestock inland without first swathing them in cloth to foil the tsetse fly. The new railway was notorious for the number of workers eaten by lions during its construction. And the 5,000 acres of virgin bush gifted by the British government were in fact already home to the Masai. After an arduous four-month journey to get there, Sheldrick’s family had to move on again.I knew then and there that I had an absolute duty to pass on my intimate knowledge and understanding of Africa’s wild animals and my belonging to KenyaBy the time Sheldrick was born, third of Bryan and Marjorie Jenkin’s four children, the family was established on a farm in Gilgil in the Great Rift Valley. Marjorie Jenkins was determined to instil in her children a love for the natural world. Family walks included not just the farm dogs but an impala, a waterbuck and Rikki-Tikki-Tavi, a brown-furred dwarf mongoose. At the age of four, Sheldrick was given responsibility for the care of an orphaned infant bushbuck.It was an idyllic upbringing but it was hard to run a European farm among African predators such as lions and leopards. At the same time, the global picture was changing rapidly. With the Second World War reaching Ethiopia, the British government looked to Kenya to feed the troops. Bryan Jenkins was tasked with shooting thousands of wildebeest and zebra in the Southern Game Reserve. He set up a portable biltong factory, assisted by two Italian prisoners of war. It was while camping nearby that six-year-old Sheldrick was woken by lions. Attracted by the smell of meat, they stayed to lick salt from the tarpaulins.The author’s work on the Ban the Bloody Ivory campaign drew in stars including Joanna Lumley (front, centre) (Rex)As soon as she was old enough, Sheldrick, who could speak Swahili, was sent to boarding school. She was a keen student, graduating eighth in her year and winning a university bursary. However, she was already in love with Bill Woodley, a student from her brother’s school, and chose instead to leave full-time education to be with him.Khurshid Drabu: Britain’s first Muslim judgeRemembering Avicii, Swedish superstar of electronic dance musicLeila Abashidze: Georgian actress who became a star of Soviet cinemaJanka Nabay: Musician who brought Sierra Leone’s bubu to the worldIsao Takahata: Japanese animation master who co-founded Studio GhibliAt around the same time, a state of emergency was declared in Kenya after Mau Mau guerrilla fighters, drawn from the Kikuyu, Meru, Embu, Kamba and Masai people, rose up against white colonial rule. The insurgency was put down with shocking brutality by British colonial officials and Kenyan “home guards”. Thousands of civilians were rounded up in mass detention camps and subjected to beatings, sexual assault and even castration, allegedly sanctioned at the highest level. (Finally, in 2013, after a long legal campaign, the British government apologised.)Mau Mau retaliation was equally bloody and Sheldrick’s family did not escape the violence. During a Mau Mau raid on her great-aunt’s farm, five people, including three children, were burned alive. Sheldrick’s grandparents were beaten and left for dead in an alleged Mau Mau robbery. Meanwhile, a worker on the Jenkins’ farm wasted away and died, convinced he was cursed after refusing to kill his employers at the Mau Mau’s behest.The David Sheldrick Trust has been reintroducing orphans back into the wild at Tsavo National Park since 1987 (Rex)In the midst of this unrest, Sheldrick married Woodley, visiting the United Kingdom for the first time on their honeymoon. After their marriage they moved to Tsavo National Park, where they worked as wardens. In January 1955, Bill took the now heavily pregnant Sheldrick back to visit her family in Gilgil. Returning in darkness, they were ambushed. “A terrifyingly loud sound erupted and in the arc of the headlamps we could see crazed, menacing figures, clad in skins, coming towards us in a great swirl of anger and noise. Some were wielding pangas, some were hurling enormous boulders and others were firing at us from point blank range.”Sheldrick continued working into later life (Rex)Bill Woodley saved his wife and unborn daughter, Jill, by driving straight through the Mau Mau attackers. A year later, the capture of Mau Mau leader Dedan Kimathi marked the official end of the “Emergency”, but the rebellion continued underground for almost a decade.The Woodleys survived the ambush but soon after their marriage foundered. Sheldrick, still Mrs Woodley as she then was, had fallen hopelessly in love with her husband’s boss with whom she had much in common. David Sheldrick was a keen naturalist dedicated to ending poaching. During his anti-poaching campaign, more than 25,700lbs of ivory was recovered and in 1959 and he was duly awarded an MBE. Meanwhile, Bill Woodley’s passion for hunting, so much at odds with his role as warden, was beginning to grate. Sheldrick left him for his high-minded superior.Sheldrick married David in 1960. Their family quickly expanded to encompass a variety of furry and feathered orphans, such as Gregory Peck, a buffalo weaver-bird, and Old Spice, a civet cat with a passion for the aftershave that bore his name. Soon after came a human daughter, Angela.We had come to Kenya as children of pioneering families who had lived through difficult times as their parents struggled to farm the land, and when grown had served Britain with distinction in its world warsDavid Sheldrick had already raised two orphaned elephants, Samson and Fatuma. His observations of the pair formed some of the first studies on elephant diet and migration. Daphne Sheldrick took charge of further orphans including one she named Aisha. In an interview, Sheldrick explained: “She came to us as one of the smallest elephants I had ever seen, with soft fuzz and ears as soft and pink as petals. When she arrived, my heart plummeted as we had never been able to save an elephant this young.”The Sheldricks had already discovered that elephants do not thrive on traditional baby formula and after a few days on glucose and watered down cow’s milk, Aisha was wasting away. As a last resort, Sheldrick tried coconut oil. It worked. Aisha began to thrive on Sheldrick’s recipe and the future of many more orphaned elephants was assured.Sheldrick leaves two daughters, four grandchildren, and a huge family of elephants, rhinos and many more (DSWT)By the early Sixties, the Mau Mau Uprising may have been over but the “winds of change”, as referenced in Harold Macmillan’s 1960 speech in South Africa, were blowing across the continent. When it came to Kenya, the British government decided that continuing colonial rule required more force than they were prepared to expend and Kenya was granted independence in 1963. The Duke of Edinburgh presided over the handover to Jomo Kenyatta.They suffer loss and heartbreak on an almost daily basis, they grieve and mourn the loss of loved ones just as deeply as us, but they turn the page to focus on the living, and I try to emulate thatThe change of rule caused much anguish for the white settler families, who, as Sheldrick described, “had come to Kenya as children of pioneering families who had lived through difficult times as their parents struggled to farm the land, and when grown had served Britain with distinction in its world wars. Britain began to turn its back on those people – even the daily BBC programme previously announced as ‘Home News from Britain’ became ‘News From Britain’, a subtle change that did not go unnoticed.”Sheldrick’s husband was among those who struggled to renew his British passport at the time. David Sheldrick put the situation succinctly: “There was no question about me not being British when the Second World War broke out and I was called up to fight for your bloody country.”In 2016 Sheldrick warned that if the ivory trade continued, the African forest elephant could be extinct by 2025 (Rex)The Sheldricks worried that the transition to independence would adversely affect Kenya’s national parks but it was their success in making the park a safe haven for elephants that caused the next problem. The elephant numbers at Tsavo had grown dramatically – from an estimated 5,000 to 15,000 – and the increased competition for food led to the devastation of much of the forest landscape. However, David Sheldrick firmly resisted the idea of an artificial cull and, in time, the more open grasslands created by the elephants’ indiscriminate browsing attracted new species, including antelope and buffalo. The Tsavo lions thrived.Money, corruption, greed and ignorance motivates the evil ivory and rhino horn tradeIn 1976, the parks were finally brought under government control, merging with the Government Game Department. Sheldrick explained that for the park’s “wild inhabitants, especially rhinos and elephants, who became instant targets, it was the death knell”. Shortly afterwards, David Sheldrick was offered a desk job in Nairobi and the family left Tsavo to an uncertain fate.David Sheldrick died that same year. After his death, devastated Sheldrick began to raise funds in his memory to continue the work that meant so much to him.‘Born to be Wild’, narrated by Morgan Freeman, shone a spotlight on the rehabilitation efforts in Kenya (Getty)The first official fundraiser was a film by former warden Simon Trevor. Somali gangs, armed with AK47s, had been gunning down entire Tsavo elephant herds, turning the park into a no-go zone. Trevor’s film on the crisis, Bloody Ivory, came to the attention of President Arap Moi, who agreed to attend the premiere. Alas, Moi was a no-show, but a few months later the Vatican proposed a papal visit to Kenya, during which the pope wished to bless an elephant and a rhino calf. Sheldrick obliged. The logistics were difficult but the publicity was priceless.Sheldrick was named one of the most significant conservationists ever (DSWT)In 1987, the David Sheldrick Memorial appeal became The David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust (DSWT), with a mission statement declaring it “embraces all measures that compliment the conservation, preservation and protection of wildlife”. Over the next 30 years the trust expanded to three sites: the elephant nursery at Sheldrick’s home in Nairobi, and two centres in Tsavo where the orphans were reintroduced into the wild.There was no shortage of infant elephants to be reared. Though President Moi tried to signal an end to the ivory trade by publicly burning Kenya’s stockpile in 1989, the international appetite for ivory remained undiminished. Between 2003 and 2013, the DSWT saw a 500 per cent increase in the number of orphans rescued, driven by demand for ivory from China. In an interview in 2016, Sheldrick lamented that elephants were being killed at a rate of 50 a day, telling Bohotraveller: “Money, corruption, greed and ignorance motivates the evil ivory and rhino horn trade.”UK ivory trade ban a positive step but what next for Africa’s elephantConservationists warn its too early to celebrate elephants\u0027 safetyEurope must choose: elephants or ivoryYoung Kenyans care for nature but are detached from conservation Wildlife conservancy grows cattle feed to fend off droughtFamily of elephant conservation pioneer pledge her legacy will live onSheldrick spread the word about the crisis facing the elephants with numerous television appearances. She published four books, including her autobiography. Meanwhile, her work was recognised all over the world. In 1989, she was appointed MBE. She was awarded an honorary doctorate in veterinary medicine by Glasgow University. In 2001, the Kenyan government awarded her the Moran of the Burning Spear and in 2006 Sheldrick became a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire, “for services to the conservation of wildlife, especially elephants, and to the local community in Kenya”. Her knighthood was the first to be awarded in Kenya since the country’s independence in 1963, something that Sheldrick said “left me dumbfounded but nevertheless extremely proud”. At the time of Sheldrick’s death in April 2018, the DSWT hand-reared more than 200 orphaned elephants, more than 100 of whom were successfully released into the wild. As the trust approached its 40th anniversary last year, Sheldrick told Eluxe magazine: “I have always turned to the elephants for inspiration in the face of adversity. They suffer loss and heartbreak on an almost daily basis, they grieve and mourn the loss of loved ones just as deeply as us, but they turn the page to focus on the living, and I try to emulate that.”As Sheldrick wrote in her autobiography: “Elephants are, indeed, just like us, and in many ways better.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

He lived his last years exiled in London, where he authored the Communist Manifesto, his best-known work.All the ways in which Marx was unexpectedly right“Karl Marx was a philosopher, who thought into the future had creative aspirations, and today he stands for things, which is he not responsible for and which he didn\u0027t cause, because many of the things he wrote down were redrafted into the opposite,” Mr Juncker said in a speech at a church in Trier.“One has to understand Karl Marx from the context of his time and not have prejudices based on the review, these judgements shouldn\u0027t exist. Karl Marx was lucky in life as he was born in Trier. He grew up in the city, actually the shortest period of his vita.”Drawing on the philosopher’s legacy, Mr Juncker said the European Union’s instability could be addressed by focusing more on social welfare, which he said had been a neglected part of European integration so far.“It will be a task of our time to create a lively reality out of the social rights we set up for Europe, for the ones who live today and often are sad or blackmailed by life and won\u0027t have enough social rights and the ones, who will be born tomorrow,” he said.Marx\u0027s birthday is being celebrated across the world(AP)“The European Union is not a flawed, but an unstable construction. Unstable also because Europe\u0027s social dimension until today remains the poor relation of the European integration. We have to change this.”A former student of the philosopher Hegel, Marx developed the theory of historical materialism which he argued explained the development of human society and the development of social classes. His work argues that capitalism’s creation of a mass of workers who owned no property will be its downfall. He argued for the establishment of a “dictatorship of the proletariat” through which workers would become the dominant class.Brexit so far: in picturesBrexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

It is estimated between just 30 and 40 per cent voted in some areas of Beirut, the country’s National News Agency reported, with voters reportedly frustrated with the country’s stagnating economy and apathetic about the main political parties. The elections are the first since war broke out in neighbouring Syria in 2011, sending over one million refugees to Lebanon, a country with an estimated total population of just 4.5 million. The war has ided the country, pitting parties supporting the Iran-sponsored Hezbollah’s intervention in Syria to aide President Bashar Assad against Saudi-aligned parties opposed to it.Hezbollah is expected to emerge stronger after the elections, a result that would affirm Tehran’s regional ascendancy from its own borders to the Mediterranean.Sunni Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri is the frontrunner to keep his job and form a new coalition government.Lebanon holds first elections in almost a decade Former sniper’s lair is chilling reminder of Lebanon’s civil warUS pledges support for Lebanon’s army after Israeli ‘Hezbollah’ claimPiles of rubbish wash up on Beirut beach amid national waste crisisFor the younger generations it was the first opportunity to vote in a national election after parliament twice extended a term that expired in 2013. Early on voting day, reports suggested turnout would be low and President Michel Aoun appeared on television late in the afternoon to urge people to vote.Although the election used a new proportional system, many voters said they expected the country’s entrenched, sectarian elite to remain on top, but others were optimistic.“We hope we will open a new era,” said Mahmoud Daouk, voting in Beirut in one of the areas where new faces were taking on the old sectarian elite.The vote was held under a new proportional system that has confused some voters and made the contest more unpredictable.But it still preserves a sectarian power-sharing system and another coalition government including most of the major parties, like the one Mr Hariri has led since 2016, looks likely, analysts say.While foreign monitors gave a generally positive assessment, tensions flared in several locations. Missiles were thrown during street clashes in Beirut, a candidate claimed her car was attacked in the Bekaa Valley town of Zahle, and rival groups clashed in the northern city of Tripoli.Lebanon holds first elections in almost a decadeInvestors are keen to see a government in place quickly as a guarantee of economic stability. Lebanon has one of the world’s highest debt-to-GDP ratios and the International Monetary Fund has said its fiscal trajectory is unsustainable.“The situation is actually worse now, not better ... We lost the chance to hold them accountable nine years ago,” said Fatima Kibbi, 33, a pharmacist.Informal results are expected to start coming in overnight and official tallies in the coming days.Analysts are closely watching the performance of Mr Hariri’s Future Movement party and that of the Shia Hezbollah group and its allies.Iran and Saudi Arabia have often battled for influence in Lebanon as part of their wider regional rivalry. An anti-Hezbollah alliance led by Mr Hariri and backed by Saudi Arabia won the majority in 2009.But the anti-Hezbollah alliance known as March 14 has disintegrated since then and Riyadh has turned its focus and resources to confronting Iran in other parts of the region.Alhough Hezbollah’s opponents still want it to disarm, the demand has slipped down the political agenda. Lebanese leaders are mostly concerned with a dire economic situation and the strain of hosting 1 million Syrian refugees.Donors pledged $11bn (£8bn) in soft loans for a capital investment programme last month, in return for fiscal and other reforms, and they hope to hold the first follow-up meeting with the new government in the coming weeks.Debt ratings agencies had stressed the importance of Lebanon going ahead with the election after parliament had extended its term several times.After the last election in 2009, the onset of Syria’s civil war, the arrival of over a million refugees and a series of militant attacks aggravated internal political rifts.Rival blocs in parliament could not agree on a new president between 2014-16 and repeatedly decided to delay elections, partly because of a disagreement over moving from a winner-takes-all system to a proportional one.The new rules are seen as unlikely to undermine the long-entrenched political elite, a group that includes local dynasties and former warlords.World news in picturesWorld news in picturesRussian police carrying struggling opposition leader Alexei Navalny at a demonstration against President Vladimir Putin in Moscow.

A vibrant metropolis, at ease with its diverse, tolerant self.A shining example to the world of how folk from different backgrounds and cultures can rub along together.At least, that’s what we’re invited to believe. But the truth is this depiction of our capital city is not one recognised by millions of its citizens. That’s because London is, in fact, a tale of two cities.There are the gentrified hotbeds of liberal cosmopolitanism — the Islingtons and Camdens — top-heavy with the professional classes and cultural elites, the type of areas that were a bedrock of Remain support in the EU referendum.But then there are those places outside the bubble. On the one hand the grittier, traditional working-class areas — the Canning Towns and Bermondseys — populated by those steamrollered by globalisation, for whom austerity and mass immigration have exacerbated the problems of low wages, poor housing and under-pressure public services.On the other, the middle-class suburbs — the Upminsters and Eastcotes — inhabited by those who sense that their “small c” conservatism is increasingly incongruous with the image of their city as a beacon of progressive modernity.It is between these places that a new and unintended coalition has emerged, born out of resentment at having  to watch their old-fashioned, socially conservative — what some describe as “faith, family and flag” — views shunned and disparaged by the liberal elite.You can see something similar writ large across England: An accidental alliance between once-loyal Labour voters in the post-industrial towns and Conservatives in the shires.It’s an alliance which manifested itself most starkly in the Brexit vote.For the Londoners that fall within these groups, their city is not the harmonious and cohesive ideal seen through the eyes of the chattering classes.It is, instead, a place increasingly atomised, where millions feel a diminishing sense of belonging and in which entire communities within a few hundred yards of each other live utterly parallel lives.Take, for example, the borough in which I grew up, Barking and Dagenham.As working-class as it gets, it was once the very essence of a traditional Labour heartland. Never affluent, but stable, close-knit and settled.Centred around a sprawling 1930s council estate and with generally healthy levels of employment — the dominant Ford factory being at the heart of local industry — Barking and Dagenham enjoyed its steady constancy, its social and cultural familiarity.For those short on money and opportunity, the concepts of place, belonging, identity and relationships take on so much more meaning.But then things changed. Over a few very short years, around the turn of the century, there was a sizeable influx of migrants, precipitating rapid social and cultural transformation.The demographic convulsions meant stable, settled Barking and Dagenham found itself in the eye of the storm of the debate over mass immigration.The indigenous population cried out for respite. The letters page of the local paper was filled with correspondents begging to be heard. But nobody in power took a blind bit of notice, other than to patronise them with trite arguments about improved GDP and cultural enrichment.Rather than rally to their support, the Left — including, shamefully, the Labour Party and trade unions — treated these marginalised working-class folk like an embarrassing elderly relative, imploring them to “stop blaming migrants” (something they hadn’t done in the first place).What was genuine bewilderment and disorientation on the part of local citizens was, inexcusably, dismissed as casual racism and bigotry.Yet it wasn’t their sense of race that had been violated by the sudden upheaval in their community. It was their sense of order.So, in 2006, locals took the only route of protest they thought left available to them and returned  12 British National Party councillors at the local elections.The noxious far-Right, which previously had never gained a foothold in the borough (though it had penetrated areas close by) now formed the official opposition on Barking and Dagenham council, not because thousands of locals had overnight turned into vile racists, but because they had repeatedly been ignored by a tin-eared establishment.But even then, nothing changed. Locals were told to get with the zeitgeist.Women in their eighties who had lived in the borough for most of their lives, had raised  families there and in many cases now lived a life of lonely isolation, were told to embrace the vibrancy of the new multiculturalism.That was the level of condescension to which the liberal establishment had sunkSo thousands of people simply upped sticks and left. In the first decade of the new century, Barking and Dagenham experienced a vast exodus of families who had been rooted in its streets, workplaces and  institutions for generations.It was the only home that many had ever known, but they went all the same. They departed for the Essex coast or Kent. It wasn’t “white flight”, for skin colour was irrelevant to most of them.It was, instead, a flight to familiarity.The tragedy was that most of these people never were anti-immigration. They would not have objected to the integration of a modest and manageable number of arrivals over a reasonable period.But the whole debate around immigration has been toxified by what the ruling elites imposed on places such as Barking and Dagenham.They shook a kaleidoscope then stood back in surprise when the pieces didn’t fall exactly where they wanted. Remember all this the next time you hear someone speak of London as the greatest city in the world.Chances are the words are being spoken by a politician or a celebrity or a middle-class liberal from one of the trendier parts of town.For there are, in reality, two Londons. One half — alienated, neglected and resentful — represents a potentially formidable army at the ballot box.Who will speak for it?Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Well, the customs partnership idea, which would involve the UK collecting tariff revenues on the EU’s behalf, would make the UK a much less attractive country to do trade deals with.To be fully effective, it would also  require the UK  to essentially copy all EU regulations on goods.With the scheme also leading to the European Court of Justice getting involved in Britain’s affairs, it would not be “taking back control”.But even after the remarkable rebuff it received from the Brexit inner Cabinet on Wednesday, despite the Prime Minister putting her authority on the line by making clear her support for it, No10 won’t give up on the idea. It believes that, with a few changes, it can be made to work.Ministers are now bracing themselves for a huge effort from Theresa May’s allies to get them to change their minds.Already, No10 is telling ministers that what really matters is getting out, and that once the UK is no longer a member of the EU, all these problems can be ironed out at a later date.I understand that one minister has even been warned that the whole Brexit project might collapse without a customs partnership.The argument is that there is “no deal” without a customs partnership, which the Government views as being  key to solving the Irish border question.Without a deal, Parliament could turn on Brexit.The Chief Whip has also told Cabinet colleagues that he hasn’t got the votes to defeat a customs union amendment in the Commons. So, the best way to see that off is to embrace a customs partnership instead.But the local election results show that the Tory vote is becoming more and more Leave dominated. Number crunchers estimate that 70 per cent of Tory voters are leavers.As one influential Tory warns, this means that if Mrs May loses Brexit Secretary David Davis or Boris Johnson from the Cabinet over the customs partnership “and is seen to be selling out Brexit, the Tories will be utterly screwed electorally”.Another problem with the customs partnership idea is the message it sends the EU.As one insider tells me: “The EU is trying to force us into a false choice between a customs union and no deal — and we’re encouraging that by not being clear enough in our negotiating position.”Rather than trying to pressure ministers into backing her customs partnership idea, Mrs May should tell the  EU she wants a free trade  deal with sensible customs arrangements that keeps red tape to a minimum.Once she has been clear, she might find the EU more willing to negotiate.THE country is there for the taking. The local election results show neither Labour nor the Tories are able to break the political stalemate.If these results were replicated at a General Election, we would have another hung parliament.It is easy to declare that the country is permanently split, and that’s why no party can win a big majority. But I don’t think that’s right.Rather, the problem is that neither Labour nor the Tories are capable of reaching out.If Labour was led by a working-class leader from the Midlands who stood up for the country, then they would be on course for a proper majority. Equally, if the Tories were led by a Brexiteer whose upbeat, optimistic vision could appeal in Remain areas then they would be beating Corbyn comfortably.  Indeed, these local election results suggest that Labour under Corbyn has stalled – that it hasn’t kept up the progress it made in last year’s General Election.Now, Labour are highly unlikely to change leader before the next election.Jeremy Corbyn and his allies have seized control of the commanding heights of the Labour Party, and the new members who so fervently believe in him wouldn’t back a challenge to him whatever Labour MPs do.But the Tories will almost certainly change their leader before 2022. These results are a reminder that they need to show  they have delivered on Brexit by the time of the next election. Government whips have been calling round to ask Tory MPs what they think of handing the  NHS a funding boost on its 70th birthday in July, and how they would pay for it.These results suggest they would be well advised to portray this money as the beginning of the Brexit dividend for the health service.This might stick in the craw of Tory Remainers, but  voters now expect them to deliver on Brexit promises.When the Tories pick their new leader they need to go for someone with cross-over appeal – someone who can firm up their support among Leave voters but reach out to Remainers too.I am told that Bercow, who is currently under pressure over bullying allegations, doesn’t feel   he can say this publicly. But I am assured that this is his plan. It remains to be seen whether the knowledge that Bercow will go  will curtail calls for him to quit.Many in the Commons feel  the claims against him must be properly investigated if Parliament is to show  it is serious about protecting its  staff. Senior figures in Government are also keen to see the back of  him because they suspect him of encouraging Labour’s use of an arcane procedural device – “a humble address” – to try to winkle embarrassing information out of ministers.PENNY MORDAUNT presented to Cabinet on the gender pay gap this week.She turned in an assured performance less than 24 hours after being appointed minister for women and equalities, telling ministers to demand a plan to close the gender pay gap from the sectors covered by their department.But as one female Cabinet minister points out, no one mentioned the elephant in  the room – the fact that the second most senior woman  in the Cabinet had to quit  her job, only to be replaced by a man.Only five of the 23 full members of the Cabinet are women.  The Government might want to concentrate  on improving this balance before they lecture business any more.PHILIP HAMMOND and Michael Gove are clashing over the powers of the post-Brexit environmental regulator.The Environment Secretary wants it to have the  same power to hold the Government to account that the European Commission  has.  But the Chancellor is sceptical. Senior Treasury figures tell me he does not think it is sensible or necessary to continue these restraints post-Brexit.The dispute is causing some raised eyebrows. One Whitehall source describes it as part of the “constant war” between the pair.  The two obviously disagree on Brexit.But Hammond is also deeply unenthusiastic about Gove’s green agenda.James Forsyth is political editor of The Spectator.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Yet neither defendant called for an ambulance.Adjourning the case, Judge Hancox told Herbert: The jury found you wilfully neglected [the child] in not seeking timely medical attention for him.This is an offence which can be punished by a sentence of imprisonment, but I am going to re-admit you to bail."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000404137380.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"uk weather latest bank holiday monday hottest ever","story":"Temperatures could hit 29C as hot air arrives from southern Russia -

surpassing the 28.6C of the Saturday of the Bank Holiday weekend in 1995.Met Office forecaster Greg Dewhurst said: We have smashed the warmest Bank Holiday Monday for early May, but for the whole bank holiday weekend itself we have got to be over 28C (82.4F).The highest temperatures of the day will be around 3-4pm so we will probably know more then.Bookies have slashed the odds that this month ends as the hottest May on record in the UK after taking a flurry of bets over the last couple of days.Coral is offering 5-4 that the record high of 32.8C is recorded this May, while they are 1-2 that it is 20C or higher during Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s wedding.Yesterday the mercury hit 22.3C in Edinburgh, while 20.8C was recorded in Katesbridge in County Down -

No, these are the views of Labour’s Big Beasts on the Marxist puppet who stole their party.Brighty - The SunThursday’s local elections suggest Brexit will be the battlefield for the next election, with Labour alienating millions who voted Leave.Alastair Campbell and David Blunkett led the attack on Jeremy Corbyn, blaming him for allowing Jew-baiting anarchists and union paymaster Len McCluskey to kill Labour’s dream of power.“If we cannot beat this shambles of a Tory party, we don’t deserve to be in the game,” warned Tony Blair’s old spin doctor.Campbell, a ferocious Remainer, tore into Corbyn for missing open goals over Brexit, Windrush deportees, the Grenfell inferno and the never- ending NHS ­crisis.But he is especially appalled by Labour’s “Militant-style nastiness . . . anti-Semitism . . . and the feeling that some in the leader- ship feel greater animus against Labour supporters than the Tories.”Blunkett’s attack is even more personal. “Jeremy’s ­leadership is going nowhere,” he warns.The ex-Home Secretary blamed Corbyn directly for the wave of anti-Semitism that cost Labour dearly in London and the reign of terror against anyone who dared to speak out.“He could have cauterised the loathsome views of a very small group of far-Left fanatics who joined the party only after he became leader,” fumed Blunkett. “He has fudged and prevaricated.“I’ve seen the personal vitriol activists endure from some Corbyn supporters. I’ve seen the threats of deselection from Len McCluskey.“I’ve seen good Labour MPs traduced and insulted.”Such vicious public attacks from Blairite heroes make nonsense of pundits’ claims that nothing has changed since last week. Labour is in meltdown.Tories bracing themselves for humiliation on Thursday night were let off the hook. Labour’s retreat across swathes of ­Britain prove JC will never be PM. Labour should be 20 points ahead, not level-pegging.They are lumbered with their useless leader. The legion of “Oh Jeremy Corbyn” fans adore him. And who would take over if he stepped aside?Not John McDonnell, for sure.This new blame game exposes the quiet but corrosive civil war tearing Labour apart since Jezza seized the crown.Last year, moderates had been secretly plotting a leadership coup on the assumption Labour would lose the General Election.That was before JC emerged startled but triumphant from Theresa May’s “strong and stable” fiasco.Now the knives are out. And Brexit is splitting Labour as much as it is the Tories.Ex-Europe minister Caroline Flint ripped into Corbyn for siding with Brexit wreckers and using the issue to bash the Tories. Intriguingly, she believes Britain would have voted OUT whenever the referendum was staged in the last ten years — even if Labour had been in power.Now she believes Remainers should accept the voters’ ­verdict and help deliver the best Brexit deal possible.The Doncaster MP aimed her remarks at Corbyn but she might as easily have been talking about Alastair Campbell, who is campaigning for a ­second referendum.“Two-thirds of Labour MPs represent Leave-voting areas,” says Ms Flint. “We are alienating many traditional Labour voters.”Even Corbyn’s own supporters want him to ditch his opportunistic sabotage tactics.Steve Howell, who helped run his 2017 election bid, ­predicted a voter backlash with Labour shut out of power for a decade.“Labour is seen as too Remain,” he said. “We ignore this at our peril. We would hand Leave-voting areas over to the Tories and be destroyed at the next General Election.”Thursday’s elections prove voters of all parties are sick of Westminster shenanigans and will punish the party they blame most for a bad Brexit.Right now, that looks like Labour.“I feel pity for the women and contempt for the men,” she writes. “The man walking in pride, showing us his caught prey.“The law of this country, the law of all countries, should change. Covering a face is literally killing an identity. I would love to see men covered with burkas, for a few hours, when it’s hot.“Let’s ask them, ‘How are you feeling? Good?’”This heatwave Bank Holiday is the perfect chance to try this experiment, chaps.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

You’re better than this. The cartoon, drawn by Neil Kerber, was printed in the pro-Remain newspaper The New European.

Asked if accusing the government of lying over the death figures in the Grenfell disaster was an example of fake news she stuck by the claims. She said: I don’t know exactly how many people died, but I know what the general consensus in the community is, and that is that more people than have been accounted for died in Grenfell. Allen, who is known for being outspoken about politics and is frequently abused on social media for her left-wing views, gave a wide-ranging interview with the Observer in which celebrities including Jeremy Corbyn and members of the public submitted questions.

If everybody came together to fight these forces, then maybe we could stop this fascist regime we’re living under, she said.  In all seriousness, that’s what’s happening, isn’t it?

Theresa Dolan, 35 says her son was seen by at least 20 doctors before he was given the right antibiotic treatment for Lyme disease - after being bitten by a tick roughly two and a half years ago.  Patrick Dolan suffered the bite in the family\u0027s garden in December 2015 at the age of three. Within a few days a bulls-eye rash appeared around the bite - symptom of the disease, which can cause liver damage and heart problems if not treatment promptly or with sufficient antibiotics. A week after the rash appeared the young boy suffered flu-like symptoms, his temperature soared and he experienced seizures.  Despite having three blood tests for Lyme disease, his mother says he is only now receiving the right dose of the antibiotic Amoxicillin. Patrick is receiving the antibiotic from a private Dublin-based consultant, and Theresa hopes it will giver her her little boy back. Over the past two years the five-year-old has suffered recurrent, extreme fevers, fatigue, tremors, breathing problems and joint paint. The family, from Howwood, Renfrewshire, has spent thousands on private healthcare, as well as having countless hospital trips and numerous admissions. They were living in Dubai when Patrick first became unwell. Mum-of-two Theresa, 35, who is a teacher, said: Patrick had come in with a bite but wasn\u0027t complaining about it.  It gradually got bigger and within a few days it was bulls eye rash. He was absolutely fine but within 10 days, he became very unwell with a high temperature. It was Christmas and he was barely interested in presents or Santa. The doctors there did a test for Lyme disease but weren\u0027t able to interpret it properly. They basically advised us to take him back to the UK. The family moved to Ireland, where dad Diarmaid, 34 and a mechanical engineer, is from and Patrick received six weeks of treatment for Lyme disease in December 2016. He seemed to improve but then in March and April last year started to suffer from erratic fevers for a few days at a time. The family moved back to Scotland in May last year and since then has been to A\u0026ampE at least four times.  Patrick is now receiving an intensive course of antibiotics from a private consultant in Dublin which his family hope will finally set him on the path to recovery. Theresa said: I don\u0027t know whether it\u0027s partly because they don\u0027t know enough about it but there seems to be an unwillingness by doctors to consider Lyme disease. Lyme disease is a bacterial infection that is spread to humans by a bite from an infected tick. The symptoms tend to start with a distinctive rash shaped like a bullseye. Not everyone gets one and this can make diagnosis tricky.

The day of drinking has become a tradition at the university, drawing thousands of students to Jesus Green ahead of their exam season. It\u0027s is usually held on the Sunday of the Bank Holiday weekend, and according to Cambridge legend, began as all good parties do: with a dispute over a bottle of booze. The event is said to have originated from a disagreement about 80 years ago between two drinking societies who quarrelled over a bottle of stolen Pimm\u0027s.  These days, Caesarian Sunday marks the last hurrah before it\u0027s time to knuckle down for exam season.      In the past, the event has attracted controversy over heavy drinking and vomiting, with the university previously appealing for students not to attend.  Previously, the event began with a wrestling match between the Caesarians and their Girton College drinking society rivals, until the compeition was banned by the colleges.                   In 2016, a student dressed as a sheep was set on fire.  But photos this Sunday\u0027s event documented merry scenes, as students made the most of the spring-time sun, turning out on the green dressed as Oompa Loompas and brides, wielding drinking funnels and inflatable toys.

Just 66% of passengers were satisfied with it, say figures from Transport Data. The second worst score was given for the station serving Gatwick Airport (66%), followed by Oxford (67%) and Clapham Junction (69%). Also among the bottom 10 were London Victoria (72%), Hull (73%) and Cardiff Central (75%). The top four stations have all undergone major refurbishments in recent years - London King\u0027s Cross (96%), London St Pancras (95%), Birmingham New Street (92%) and Reading (92%). Independent watchdog Transport Focus surveyed more than 28,000 passengers, with 56 stations where at least 100 people responded included in the ranking.  The survey was conducted between September and November last year, shortly after a \u0026pound100 million modernisation project began at Glasgow Queen Street. Nine months into the work, some passengers are still unhappy with the station\u0027s condition. Cameron MacIntosh, 32, a sales adviser from Stirling, said: The station is an absolute bomb site at the moment. It really looks like a place from the third world. I try and avoid it. John McInnes, a 46-year-old technician from Cumbernauld, commented: I hope they are going to finish it because it looks a disaster just now. It\u0027s embarrassing bringing friends or relations here. They can\u0027t believe the mess of the place.  Receptionist Margaret McGinley, 36, from Larbert, said: It will look bad for a while, but I think it\u0027ll be amazing when they\u0027ve completed the renovation work. The Abellio ScotRail-operated station was used by 15 million passengers in 2016/17, making it Scotland\u0027s third busiest station. One Gatwick Airport passenger who responded to the survey reported that the West Sussex station is small and cramped with long queues for tickets and overcrowding on platforms. Another described it as an appalling welcome to the UK. Other critical respondents include one who claimed London Victoria is grubby for what should be a flagship station, and another who bemoaned the platforms at Cardiff Central for being very run down. Transport Focus chief executive Anthony Smith said: While Glasgow Queen Street is being redeveloped it\u0027s vital that the ScotRail Alliance continues to talk to passengers about the improvements and makes sure staff are on hand to help. Investment in stations can improve passengers\u0027 satisfaction when targeted at features which make a difference to their experience. Passengers\u0027 top priorities for stations include arrival time information, waiting rooms and the overall look and feel of the station. A spokesman for the Rail Delivery Group, which represents the rail industry, said: As part of the partnership railway\u0027s long-term plan, and to deliver on our commitment to boost local communities, we\u0027re investing to improve 178 small and medium-sized stations right across the country.

Her tennis star sons Andy and Jamie attended the primary school when a gunman killed 16 pupils and a teacher. Judy, 58, said she had hoped other shootings in the States would prompt changes to gun control laws there. But in February, 17 children were shot dead at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School near Miami, Florida. Judy said: “[I cried] when I heard about the most recent school shooting.” Addressing the US President, she went on: “Learn from what happened in Dun\u0026shy\u0026shyblane. Our Government acted and there hasn’t been an incident like it since. “In America, shootings happen on a regular basis. Trump could flick the switch and change all that.”  Her call came as Dunblane survivor Aimie Adam, 27, said she wants to meet the US leader when he visits the UK later this year, to question him about gun laws. She was five when Thomas Hamilton shot her twice at the primary school, near Stirling, shattering her thigh and back. Private ownership of handguns was banned after the 1996 horror. Mental health nurse Aimie, who was left with permanent injuries from the attack, said: “I know there are people who don’t want Trump to come to Scotland, but I do want him to come.  “I want to meet him, and hopefully I can twist his arm by letting him know what it is like to have your life devastated by gun violence. “I would also tell him there is something that you can do about it. We changed gun laws after Dunblane and we have never had another school shooting.” Judy’s sons were in the school when Hamilton, who the family knew, killed pupils and teacher Gwen Mayor, before turning the gun on himself.

The two pictures, which were taken by mum Kate Middleton, were shared around the worlds within seconds of going live. But eagle-eyed fans were quick to notice something familiar about the two photos - the clothes. It seems thrifty Kate is using some of her fashion recycling magic on her children as well, as we\u0027ve seen both the outfits before.  The little white jumper Louis is wearing in the photo of him on his own is the same one big sister Charlotte wore in her first official photos. We can\u0027t see exactly as the old photo of Charlotte was cropped, but it looks like he\u0027s wearing the same little bottoms as well.  And little Louis isn\u0027t the only one in hand-me-down clothes. Princess Charlotte\u0027s cute blue jumper with white detail is from big brother George\u0027s wardrobe. We last saw it in one of the official photos released for the Queen\u0027s 90th birthday.  Kate, who is a keen amateur photographer, took the photos on Charlotte\u0027s third birthday on Wednesday. Unfortunately, we didn\u0027t get a photo of all three Cambridge children together as George is absent from both. Since stepping into the public spotlight Kate has been known for re-wearing a lot of her fashion pieces - something many other royals don\u0027t do. While she was expecting with Prince Louis she recycled a lot of her maternity clothes from her previous pregnancies.  We\u0027ve also seen her wearing a number of her stunning dresses several times, including this red McQueen number.

New mum Michelle Hands, 33, first got into the building industry after university when she took on a summer job as a quality assurance engineer and fell in love with the job. But four years ago Michelle decided she wanted to take a more hands-on approach and delved into the world of heavy civil engineering - more often than not as the only woman on a building site.  A far cry from her teenage dreams of being an actress, Michelle says working in construction is the perfect job despite a constant battle against sexism - and some men even refusing to work with her.   When the freelance project manager and her university lecturer hubby Tom Quarmby, 34, found out they were expecting a baby last year, Michelle worried about how the builders on her team would react. But the mum of one had a refreshingly positive response and her colleagues helped out when Michelle needed to step back from the more physical aspects of her role to keep her baby safe. Since giving birth to Archie Quarmby 12 weeks ago, Michelle has decided to share her experience as a pregnant construction worker and the feat of \u0027building two things at once\u0027 to inspire women and girls. Michelle, of Leeds said: Tom and I were so excited when we found out I was pregnant but I was dreading the idea of breaking the news to the team. I wasn\u0027t sure how it would be received or if I would be let go straight away. Being self-employed there\u0027s no maternity pay so I needed a plan. Wearing big high-vis clothes I could hide my baby bump for a little while while I decided what to do. It was definitely noted that I was using the porter loo more often. I\u0027m pretty sure everyone noticed that I was eating for England as well. I would come in with a packed lunch and it would all be gone by 9am.  I broke the news to everyone at the 14-week mark. I was conscious of it from a health and safety point of view and obviously for the safety of my baby and myself, it was coming to the point where I couldn\u0027t keep doing all the physical side of my job. Everyone took it really well. They told me to keep working for as long as I wanted to and loads of the guys I work with have families so they were really excited for me. I did get the occasional comment pulling me up on stuff if I was suffering a case of baby brain but I would just come back with \u0027I\u0027m building two things at once\u0027 and they couldn\u0027t say anything else. It was the best response. Last year was actually my first project management role and we were building a retail park. I did it all while pregnant so my hormones were all over the place but I just got on with it and did my job. At the time I didn\u0027t see it as anything special but when I got to the end of the project I thought \u0027wow, people say women can\u0027t do this and can\u0027t do that but we can\u0027. It was never easy project managing, engineering and building a tiny human at the same time. But I am so glad I battled through to prove that women shouldn\u0027t be scared to commit to a career in construction for fear of also wanting to become a mum at some point. As long as you take care of yourself physically and keep a stress-free mind, it can be done. I hope sharing my experience shows girls out there that you can be both a mother and engineer.  After finishing a geography degree, Michelle was struggling to decide on her next step as she knew she would \u0027never survive\u0027 a desk job. When a friend recommended an environmental job working alongside a construction company, Michelle decided to give it a go. What was meant to be a temporary stint liaising between construction companies, their clients and the environmental agency soon turned into a 10-year career as Michelle loved the seasonal nature of the work. In the three to six months of the year she wasn\u0027t working, Michelle dedicated her time to travelling around the world with Tom and pursuing her passion of film-making and photography. A lover of the outdoors and a sociable work environment, Michelle decided to delve more into the engineering and construction side of the building industry in 2014 and hasn\u0027t looked back. Stepping onto building sites dominated by men and their \u0027pack mentality\u0027, Michelle has faced more than her fair share of obstacles with some male colleagues telling her \u0027women don\u0027t belong in construction\u0027.  Not always on the receiving end of the sexist remarks, Michelle has also witnessed the catcalling and crude comments towards other women that builders are renowned for and feels it is her duty to make a difference. As an engineer and project manager, Michelle surveys the sites, marks out the plots by hammering giant pegs into the ground with a sledge hammer and manages the construction process. While she certainly stands out at just 5ft 5ins and 9st, Michelle has fought to prove she can pull her weight - both mentally and physically - on any building site. And Michelle, who is determined to inspire girls to pursue their dream job even if it defies feminine stereotypes, says she is ever grateful to her parents Brian Hands, 59, and Margaret Hands, 60, for supporting her career choice. Michelle said: I\u0027m very sociable. I like meeting different people every day and being outdoors. Engineering is the perfect mix of both, it\u0027s great. Don\u0027t get me wrong, there are times when it\u0027s the middle of winter and I\u0027m stuck out on a building site and I curse myself but during the summer it\u0027s beautiful. Like any job you take the rough with the smooth. Eighty per cent of the time it is the best job in the world but it hasn\u0027t been easy. I work in a heavily male dominated field and I do get sexist comments. I\u0027ve had people ask me if I\u0027d rather be behind the counter at Boots and tell me women don\u0027t belong in construction. I\u0027ve even had architects refuse to work with a female engineer.

Most Brits are so baffled by washing instruction labels that thousands of pounds worth of garments are ruined. Fewer than one in seven of us can correctly identify the six most common washing symbols. As a result one in three simply sling clothes in the machine without checking labels. Most of us admit to having accidentally washed items that are dry clean only. Men tend to be more careless, with 78% always using the same washing programme. But almost half of women use just three programmes or fewer. Yet these are not the only startling stats to come out in the wash in school uniform supplier Trutex’s survey.  Care for our clothes after they are taken out the machine also leaves a lot to be desired. Some nine in 10 people did not know some items should never go into a tumble dryer. And six out of 10 do not check the setting needed for ironing. Nearly all women learned how to wash clothes as young girls by helping their mums and know about separating whites from colours. In contrast, just 15% of men assisted their mothers. About 70% did not use a washing machine until they left home and that tended to be at a laundrette.  One in six men have never used one. Matthew Easter, managing director at Trutex said knowledge of labels can save time and money. He said: “This is especially important when it comes to school uniforms which are worn five days a week and often treated very roughly and require frequent cleaning.”   ANSWERS:  1 Hand wash. 2 Machine wash. 3 Water temperature not above 30C 4 Machine wash (permanent press). 5 Machine wash (gentle cycle). 6 Do not wash. 7 Do not bleach 8 Tumble dry. 9 Do not iron. 10 Do not wring.

British bridegroom Jamie Fox and his bride-to-be were canoeing in the Zambezi river above the Victoria Falls when the giant beast struck from below. Former national tennis player Zanele Ndlovu had her right arm torn off and her left hand bitten in the vicious attack.  Jamie went to her rescue and managed to save her but she was losing so much blood it was feared she may die from the wound. A family friend said: During the attack the crocodile gripped her arm and ripped it off while her partner made frantic efforts to save her. They are lucky to be alive. “The boats used in that activity are inflated and the crocodile attacked their vessel and in the process deflated it before attacking her.  A make-shift tourniquet was applied and she was rushed to hospital where surgeons managed to save her life but she lost most of her arm. Incredibly despite her horrific injuries she was determined not to miss her wedding day and was allowed to use the hospital chapel to get married. A Minister presided over the ceremony at the Mater Dei Hospital in Bulawayo where the remarkable service took place on Sunday. It is believed the couple had gone to the Victoria Falls to get married but the crocodile attack meant a drastic change of venue was needed. The bride can be seen in her white sleeveless wedding dress walking into church with her stump heavily bandaged, holding pink roses in her left hand.  As Jamie places the wedding ring on her left hand a canula can be seen attached to her wrist and her hand is also heavily bandaged. When she signed the register, a huge round of applause broke out from family and friends. A witness said: It is a quite remarkable love story and it really does show their love for each other. The crocodile attack made no difference. “Their feelings and love for each other are even stronger than before if anything. A short video clip from the ceremony shows the emotional moment the groom kisses the bride.

Jenna Thompson, 31, was diagnosed with interstitial cystitis after hundreds of trips to her GP around 13 years ago. The painful condition, which causes her bladder to swell up, often leaves her totally unable to walk or stand up.  In her own words, Jenna, a journalist for the Hull Daily Mail , spoke about her life living with the debilitating condition.   I was 18 and at a music festival when I first noticed something was wrong. For those of you who have ever had cystitis, you will know the symptoms are unmistakeable: that urgent, desperate need to go to the toilet RIGHT NOW, and the burning pain that comes with a trip to the loo. It’s horrible to feel that way when you’re in the comfort of your home, but at a festival, where you’re sleeping in a tent, and the only toilet available is a dirty Portaloo, is not an ideal place to be suffering. After trying to tough it out, I eventually gave up and went home early. Usually a bout of this unpleasant infection can be cleared with plenty of water and some antibiotics. But for me, it was the start of an illness that has lasted 13 years so far and will likely be with me for the rest of my life. Despite antibiotics, lashings of water and a tonne of cranberry juice (which I would later realise has the opposite effect on my condition), the symptoms simply didn’t budge. In fact, they got worse. Doctors were sympathetic but just kept handing me dozens of different antibiotics to try and find the one that would cure me. Little did they and I know that nothing would. At the height of my illness, I was pretty much housebound and going to the toilet up to 60 times a day. Each time I went it would sting and burn, but that pain was nothing compared to the feeling in my bladder as it (sort of) filled up a deeply uncomfortable pressure that makes it almost impossible to sit down or walk, interspersed with stabbing, sharp bursts of pain that took my breath away.  It took two years of these symptoms and hundreds of trips to the GP and hospital – including some extremely painful tests and exploratory surgery - before I was given a diagnosis of interstitial cystitis (or IC, sometimes referred to as painful bladder syndrome). A chronic, long-term condition, the NHS describes IC as “poorly understood bladder condition that causes long-term pelvic pain and problems with urination” that can have “a significant impact on your lifestyle, work, emotional health and relationships”. Perhaps it is poorly understood because, as with anything relating to going to the toilet, people don’t talk about it very much. The only time I have seen any mention of it in the media was a short segment on Embarrassing Bodies (which really makes you feel better…) and an article on a national newspaper website which described it as simply cystitis (it is so much more complicated than that). Bladder Health UK says “bladder conditions can be seen as ‘socially unacceptable’ which are not often discussed in public”. It suggests this can lead to social isolation among sufferers. I understand people’s reluctance to talk about it. I have been a journalist for more than 10 years now and my natural instinct is to write about things, but it has taken a long time for me to be able to find the confidence to speak about it publicly.

The verbal heckling was captured on mobile phone by the musicians who filmed their encounter with recruitment boss Matthew Morehead in a street in Lichfield, Staffs, on Friday. The footage, which one of the buskers posted on Facebook, begins with the row already underway - and with Mr Morehead apparently objecting to the group performing their music in the street near his offices and \u0027how bad they are\u0027. When he realises he is being filmed he leans into the camera and says: My name is Matthew Morehead and I run TRSG. We are a recruitment agency and what we do is we put people to work. One of the buskers off camera interrupts him and says: Bully people... you bully people!  Mr Morehead replies: No, we go to work and pay our tax. The squabble soon turns into a heated row as the volume increases. As voices become raised, Mr Morehead proclaims: I can be louder, I\u0027m ex-Special Forces. My voice is louder than yours! These people... they are not going to pay tax, they are going to ruin your lives and also probably, from the sound of it, try and cause people a problem with their business. People pay money to be here - not to sit here and scrounge off everybody else! Again off camera, one of the buskers can be heard to insist: We\u0027re not scrounging!  Mr Moorhead replies: Yes you are - scrounger... Four of you and not one of you has got a real job. One of the musicians then points out that one of the group Mr Morehead is referring to had served with the Armed Forces for 16 years. Mr Morehead then turns to speak to the busker in question and asks him: What unit was you with? The busker replied: I was in the Marines. Mr Morehead replies abruptly: Well I\u0027m ex-9th Squadron Airborne. - before then apparently offering to help him find a job. Mr Morehead tells the man: So, do you want to stay here with these kind of losers mate? (unintelligible) ...they wouldn\u0027t deal with these kind of d****. Another busker replies: The only one being a d*** is you.  Mr Morehead replies: (Unintelligible) ...I\u0027m not afraid of little girls like you... you can\u0027t get a real job! The row descends into chaos - with Mr Morehead condemning the buskers for \u0027swearing around children\u0027 in the street - before becoming even more bizarre. As Mr Morehead moves away, one of the musicians strikes up a song - singing with the first line: I\u0027m a bully... Mr Morehead replies singing his own words: I\u0027m a waster with a life! At this point one of the buskers uses the advantage of his microphone and speaker volume to call Mr Morehead an absolute f****** moron! Then another row about swearing in front of children breaks out. One of the buskers later told MirrorOnline that Mr Morehead has since apologised and has offered to make a \u0026pound200 donation to charity. The group claimed the row started when Mr Morehead became angered by performances staged outside his office in Lichfield city centre - and alleged that he tried to surreptitiously obtain his details to complain to the council and threatened to destroy his equipment before the camera started rolling.  The buskers included Joshua Sole and Gary Conway - who both regularly gig around the West Midlands. In a Facebook video uploaded today, Joshua said: This guy came storming out asking for my details. What he said was \u0027hi mate I think you\u0027re really good can I have your details for weddings\u0027. I was like yeah here\u0027s my name and then he went aaah you f****** idiot. Now I\u0027m going to report you to the police because you didn\u0027t give your details to the council. I work there and you\u0027ve been disrupting my f****** business all day and next time I\u0027m going to smash your amp up with 30 of my mates. Joshua claimed he received a message from Mr Morehead on Sunday in which he apologised and offered to pay \u0026pound200 to a charity of the musicians\u0027 choosing after reflecting on his behaviour. He said Mr Morehead claimed he had been abused online since the video surfaced.

The 2018 best teacher winner Mandy Manning was silent at the ceremony, but wore six politically-themed badges on her dress, as Trump presented her with the award. She also didn\u0027t shake the president\u0027s hand.  Claiming she wasn\u0027t allowed to read the speech at the time, yesterday she instead read an excerpt to CNN\u0027s Van Jones.   The teacher said she promised her pupils she would use her audience with the president to present him with a stack of letters from members of the Spokane, Washington community where she works, and the refugee children she teaches.    Dunblane massacre survivor says she wants to meet Donald Trump to \u0027make him see he is wrong on guns\u0027  Manning told how she and her family had their photograph with the president during the ceremony last week, before she took the opportunity to present him with the letters. She said she told Trump:  \u0027It\u0027s really important that you read them\u0027 — and he did. He took them so graciously, he thanked me and said he looked forward to it and had them put on his desk. According to her award application, Manning teaches English and maths to refugee and immigrant students in the Newcomer Center at Ferris High School in Spokane. The application says she is her pupils\u0027 first teacher once they arrive in the US, and she uses projects like map-making to help the young refugees process their trauma, celebrate where they are from, and learn about their new home.   Nightmare on Downing Street as Donald Trump confirmed to visit UK on FRIDAY 13TH July  She instead read aloud an excerpt of her speech on Jones\u0027 show, referencing refugee and LGBT issues. In the speech she said: Over the next year, I will be sharing my students\u0027 stories and profound insights into our country throughout the nation — like Sultan\u0027s — a refugee from Syria, who escaped war in his country and understands the importance of the United States to be peacemakers. I am here for refugee and immigrant students for the kids in the Gay-Straight Alliance, and for all the girls I\u0027ve coached over the years, to send them the message that they are wanted, they are loved, they are enough, and they matter. Go out today: seek an experience you have never had before, get uncomfortable, challenge your own perceptions to find clarity.  Be fearless, be kind, meet someone new.

Baggy flares, massive statement belts, stripy highlights, those skirt-trouser things, inflatable everything, bubble writing - there was a lot going on.  Happily, apart from the odd rogue trend which has since resurfaced, many of these have stayed in the noughties and quietly died the death they so richly deserve.  But one fashion statement is set to make a comeback and, call us nostalgic, we\u0027re actually really excited. Remember Groovy Chick? If you\u0027re of a certain age, then you definitely will.  Groovy Chick didn\u0027t really do anything other than adorn Bang On The Door merchandise - of which there was a lot (stationary, bedding, clothing, you name it) but that wasn\u0027t the point, Because in doing so, she became a sort of fashion phenonmenon. There were other Bang on the Door characters too Fairy Girl, Beach Babe - but Groovy Chick was the Big Dog.

You\u0027ve had to endure months of cold, dark, rainy morning commutes to work - followed by cold, dark, rainy evening commutes home from work. So when we get a bit of sunshine it\u0027s only natural that it should change our whole outlook on life: tops come off, music blares and we get lairy at 4pm after a few pints in the sun. This weekend has seen glorious weather across the whole of the UK - and this could be the warmest Bank Holiday in years.  Here are 21 things British people are guilty of doing at the first sign of sunshine Recognise yourself or any of your friends in this? 1. Talk about the weather non-stop Oh my god, I just can\u0027t believe how sunny it is! Can you believe how warm it is? It was cold this time last week!   Good chat. 2. Drink in the daytime - just because you can You might not head to the pub at 3pm in miserable weather, but sunshine means you can have a beer, cider or G\u0026ampT in the afternoon and not feel guilty.  You also find yourself going \u0027for one\u0027 after work. As the evenings are lighter, you end up staying out much longer than planned. 3. Blast music from cars Craig David tracks blaring from your car windows in October would earn you some strange looks.   But when the sun\u0027s out it becomes perfectly acceptable to turn your vehicle into a mobile boombox. 4. Sun\u0027s out? Guns out! There\u0027s something about the start of the British summer that makes men think they\u0027re on a lads\u0027 holiday in Ibiza - when they\u0027re actually just walking around the local shops.  It\u0027s not that hot. Put your shirt back on. 5. Complain about the weather I can\u0027t stop sneezing and it\u0027s just too hot for me. I can\u0027t wait for winter, I\u0027m more of a winter person.   In a few months you will take this back and have a moan about how cold it is. 6. Rush to an ice cream van Is there anything more British than a wafer cone, soft-serve ice cream and a Flake?  If the sun\u0027s out and you hear that music playing, you\u0027ll be running to the van just like you did when you were a kid. 7. Complain that a 99 flake doesn\u0027t cost 99p anymore  How much!? In my day they were 99p! Yes, the price has gone up quite a bit since the 1990s, when you could bag this treat for under a quid. Inflation, we hate you. 8. Spontaneously decide to have a BBQ Ah, what a wonderful idea. Let\u0027s all rush to the nearest Asda and buy as much bread and meat as possible.  There\u0027s no way we\u0027ll be able to eat it all, but it\u0027ll be nice to dine outside - BECAUSE WE CAN. 9. Remember you have no idea how to light the barbecue It\u0027s been so long since you last used it, your barbecue has gone a bit rusty and you can\u0027t for the life of you remember how to get it going.   Half an hour (and half a newspaper) later, you\u0027ve managed to produce some tiny flames. Great success. 10. End up eating inside because it\u0027s raining It took you so long to get the grill hot enough to cook with that the heavens have now opened and your buns are getting all soggy.  You end up eating your burgers on the sofa anyway while the nominated chef takes refuge under an umbrella in the garden. 11. Descend on the nearest beach  Because sunbathing when it\u0027s still so cool you have to wear a jumper is a really good look. 12. Forget the sea is freezing here  You head for a paddle, then realise that our waters definitely weren\u0027t made for swimming - unless you have a wetsuit to keep you warm. You retreat to your towel, defeated. 13. Get your pasty legs out Who wears short shorts? Everyone, apparently. Cue the annual contest to wear as little fabric as possible to maximise on your leg tan opportunities.  After all, you\u0027ve been wearing tights, leggings and jeans all winter, so you\u0027re looking pretty pale. Oh and if you\u0027re not wearing something that resembles a denim belt, you\u0027re not doing it properly. 14. This.  No explanation necessary. 15. Sunbathe in the front garden You wouldn\u0027t usually sit on your front door step, half-clothed, in full view of all your neighbours. But when your house is facing the wrong way and it\u0027s the only place you can soak up some rays, you\u0027ve got to do what you\u0027ve got to do.   16. Realise you missed a spot  When putting on sun cream, there\u0027s always that hard-to-reach place on your body that means you end up with oddly-shaped sunburn marks like this one when you fall asleep in the garden. Stay safe in the sun, people. 17. Leave your coat at home Because you \u0027don\u0027t need it anymore\u0027. Soon you are cursing that cool breeze and then hating yourself when the sun goes down and you\u0027re shivering.   18. Post arty pictures of sunshine and cocktails on social media   You know, just to make your friends jealous that you\u0027ve got such a great, summery social life. 19. Got a convertible? That top is coming down  Been waiting all winter for that one sunny day when you can enjoy the perks of your convertible car? Doesn\u0027t feel like such a perk when you\u0027re freezing and your hair is getting messed up. 20. Head straight to the nearest park  Usually with a ball or frisbee. If you\u0027re organised, you\u0027ll remember to take a picnic blanket to sit on so you can avoid the dreaded grass-stains-on-bum situation. 21. Remember that you have allergies  Parks and daisy chains probably aren\u0027t the best thing to be around right now - and you have no idea where your packet of hayfever meds from last year has gone. If you\u0027ve got any more to add to the list, tweet them @YourMirror or email yourmirror@mirror.

The Egyptian Antiquities Ministry said in a statement yesterday that months of studies by Italy\u0027s Polytechnic University in Turin has shown that no area exists. Mostafa Waziri, Secretary-General of the Supreme Council of Antiquities, said: The studies have shown that no chambers exist, or even an indication that any threshold or door frames, which contradicts the previous theory that had assumed the existence of passages or chambers adjacent or inside the burial chamber of King Tutankhamun. Experts have been divided over the existence of a concealed room behind the tomb, which some believe could be the final resting place of the lost Queen, Nefertiti.  There is huge international interest in Nefertiti, who died in the 14th century B.C. and is thought to be Tutankhamun\u0027s stepmother. Any confirmation of her final resting place would be the most remarkable Egyptian archaeological find so far this century.

Standing in the Grand Kremlin Palace\u0027s ornately-decorated Andreyevsky Hall with his hand on a gold-embossed copy of the constitution, Putin swore to serve the Russian people, safeguard their rights and freedoms, and defend Russian sovereignty. Putin was inaugurated for his fourth term as president two months after more than 70% of voters backed him in a presidential election in which he had no serious challengers. His most dangerous opponent, Alexei Navalny, was barred from running in that vote and on Saturday Navalny and hundreds of his supporters were detained by police while protesting over Putin\u0027s new term under the slogan: Putin is not our tsar.  Putin, who is 65, embarks on his fourth term in office buoyed by widespread popular support but weighed down by a costly confrontation with the West, a fragile economy and uncertainty about what happens when his term ends. The Russian constitution bars him from running again when his new terms ends in 2024. Putin has been in power, either as president or prime minister, since 2000. When his fourth term ends he will be Moscow\u0027s longest-serving leader since Soviet dictator Josef Stalin.  Navalny called for demonstrations against Putin in almost 100 cities and towns.  Navalny asked his supporters during Saturday\u0027s protest: They said that this city belongs to Putin. Is that right? Do you need a tsar? he asked, eliciting a collective roar of No. Footage showed five policemen hauling him to a waiting van by his arms and legs, a scene that was repeated dozens of times with his supporters. In total it is thought roughly 1,600 people were detained by police during the protests.  Another opposition politician, Ilya Yashin, said police planned to charge Navalny with disobeying a police officer. The penalty for such an offence, if repeated, can be a fine and up to 30 days in jail. Navalny, who has been detained and jailed numerous times for organising similar protests, said he was proud to have made it to the rally. "}]
