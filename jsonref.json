According to Mammoth author Chris Flynn, the American obsession dates back to the 1700s• Read more about  Australia’s Unmissables seriesBarack Obama had two Portuguese water dogs, Bo and Sunny. George W Bush had scottish terriers named Barney and Miss Beazley. Bill Clinton had a cat called Socks. John F Kennedy doted on his canary, Robin.US presidents have always had domestic animals at the White House, although the farther back we delve, the more ferocious the menagerie tends to be, particularly where Republican presidents are concerned. Calvin Coolidge owned a hippopotamus and two lions named Tax Reduction and Budget Bureau. John Quincy Adams is said to have kept an alligator in a bathroom. He supposedly found it amusing to surprise guests by sending them in there to conduct their business, presumably causing them to do so prior to removing their pantaloons.Theodore Roosevelt took animal ownership to extremes. During his tenure, a lion, a hyena called Bill, a coyote, a black bear named Jonathan Edwards and a zebra lived at various times on the White House grounds. He also shot a reputed 11,397 creatures. Among them were lions, leopards, cheetahs, hyenas, elephants and endangered rhinoceroses.I uncovered this curious power dynamic while researching my new book, Mammoth. It began with Thomas Jefferson, who, in an attempt to overcompensate for feelings of US inadequacy, appropriated symbols of strength from the animal kingdom to show that America was the greatest nation on earth.Jefferson’s nemesis was the French naturalist Georges-Louis Leclerc, le Comte de Buffon. In volume five of his 1781 book Natural History, General and Particular, Buffon coined his Theory of American Degeneracy. In it, he claimed that animals in the US were weaker, smaller and fewer in number than in the rest of the world.As minister to France, Jefferson was determined to prove America’s virility to the Europeans. On one trip he packed a large panther skin with the idea of shaking it under Buffon’s nose. Later he produced a moose. The French were unimpressed. Desperate for America to appear bigger and better than everyone else – and to promote US democracy as the superior form of government – Jefferson then hired several groups of hardy pioneers to secure him a mammoth.He had heard rumours of large bones found by explorers in various wilderness locations. He believed they belonged to a mastodon larger than anything that had ever existed in Europe, and he actively promoted the idea that such a beast might still roam the country’s west.“The bones of the Mammoth which have been found in America, are as large as those found in the old world. It may be asked, why I insert the Mammoth, as if it still existed? I ask in return, why I should omit it, as if it did not exist? Such is the economy of nature, that no instance can be produced of her having permitted any one race of her animals to become extinct,” he wrote in 1781’s Notes on the State of Virginia.Jefferson’s gambit paid idends. Mammoth bones were unearthed from farmland and displayed by iniduals such as the Philadelphia painter Charles Willson Peale. Mammoth fever gripped the nation. A 20lb vegetable grown in New York was proclaimed to be a mammoth radish. A Washington man ate 42 chicken eggs in 10 minutes and declared himself a mammoth eater. In Cheshire, Massachusetts, a Baptist pastor and ardent republican, John Leland, urged his congregation to produce a mammoth cheese weighing 1,235lb. It was gifted to Jefferson, who had it for lunch on New Year’s Day, 1802.Jefferson procured and assembled his bones, spending many evenings in the White House poring over his treasures. His obsession led to accusations of negligence from colleagues and rivals alike. Little could they know that the legacy of a perceived inferiority complex would embed itself deep in the American psyche and endure for hundreds of years.Modern presidents have, for the most part, softened their stance on trophies and the appropriation of powerful animal symbols, choosing instead to enjoy the companionship of dogs, cats and horses. Democratic presidents have tended more towards cuddly critters. In addition to his beloved canary, Kennedy had a rabbit called Zsa Zsa. Lyndon B Johnson had hamsters. Jimmy Carter had an adorable Siamese cat called Misty Malarky Ying Yang.Donald Trump, for the record, is the first president in history to have no pets. None with four legs, at any rate."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/321a7cbaa7ad67b55ddfccc395eebacf4499e270/0_137_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=344ad2820a01abc44df2c8e4b29f2898","title":"uk lockdown sends retail sales to record low but alcohol sales rise","story":"Economists predict bigger fall in April after coronavirus panic-buying boosts March figuresRetail sales recorded their largest fall on record in March as consumers restricted their trips to high street stores and local shops under the government lockdown.Panic-buying of fridge freezers and food ahead of the lockdown and household goods bought online prevented a bigger slump, leading to predictions of an even bigger fall in April when the full impact of the government’s measures to combat Covid-19 will be felt.Government to back £330bn of loans to support businesses through a Bank of England scheme for big firms.

It is time to give up on the fantasies of British exceptionalismIf there is a simple way of showing how out of step this government is with the rest of the world on coronavirus, it can be found in the gap last week between the five criteria that Dominic Raab said the country must fulfil before the lockdown was lifted and the six tests the World Health Organization set. Missing from Mr Raab’s list was that health system capacities ought to be “in place to detect, test, isolate and treat every case and trace every contact”.What ides these two approaches is the “science”, which is why claims of following it ring so empty. On one side we have those who believe that testing, tracing and the isolating of infected iniduals is needed to defeat coronavirus. In this camp are public health experts such as Anthony Costello of University College London and Jeremy Hunt, the former health secretary.They have facts on their side. South Korea registered its first 10 deaths of patients with Covid-19 by 25 February, and by following the WHO’s advice Seoul had suppressed the epidemic within 22 days. Prof Costello says that by the time the UK had recorded its first 10 deaths, by 13 March, the government had stopped all testing and contact-tracing in the community. How has that gone? South Korea sees 17 new cases daily, while the UK records 5,000. These numbers convinced the health secretary, Matt Hancock, who on Thursday outlined his “test, track and trace” strategy, which would start “as the new number of cases begins to fall”.On the other side are those who believed the UK ought to go it alone – with a response determined by mathematical models and control measures while waiting for the silver bullet of a vaccine. In this camp appeared to be Mr Raab, the chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, and his deputy, Jenny Harries, who condescendingly claimed South Korea’s outbreak was atypical and akin to controlling that found in a single care home. Sir Patrick Vallance’s promotion of “some kind of herd immunity” put him, as chief scientific adviser, at odds with public health doctors. The evidence suggests that was also the case for Dominic Cummings, the prime minister’s chief adviser, who has long been entranced by computational modelling “fast enough for epidemic ‘war games’”.Yet there is no official word to explain clearly why the Republic of Ireland, which has followed WHO advice, records a death rate a third lower than that in Northern Ireland, which follows UK advice. Such are the delusions of national character that too many members of the government, from the prime minister down, suffer from. People are dying. It is time to give up on the fantasies of British exceptionalism."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b72bff2a682aaca63053be15e63ffec62981826e/0_93_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8a32986b61d17de43c8be4e0c960eb5","title":"lockdown kids screen tween culture real world","story":"My five-year-olds’ screen time is creeping up. Yet when we step out into the real world, everything seems more vivid to them “There’s a ghost fish called Hank in Bora Bora,” said my daughter, finding me in the kitchen after a morning spent on screens.“Fiction or non-fiction?” I said. We bring this question, previously raised by the librarian at my girls’ kindergarten, to every hideous video they watch. It makes me feel slightly better about the whole school of YouTube.“Non-fiction?” she said, and after a long pause, “what’s Bora Bora?”Over five weeks of lockdown, my kids’ daily screen time has crept up, along with the age bracket of the stuff that they’re watching. Gone are the days of endless slime videos and Ryan’s Toys. Now it’s hours of Minecraft and Roblox. YouTube is largely out. TikTok is in. I try to filter the content as much as I can, but at five years old, they’re definitely getting a crash course in tween culture. “You’re the worst,” yelled one the other day – it was like a rehearsal of the slammed doors to come.There are various tricks I perform to make myself feel better about all this – chiefly persuading myself that there’s no other way to occupy two five-year-olds and get any work done. I tell myself that, as kids, we all watched uninterrupted hours of TV and still managed to read books and go to college. I remind myself of those parents who severely limit their kids’ screen time and are, invariably, the same fusspot parents who make their kids go to bed early in the holidays and are one step away from making them wear school uniforms at the weekend.And not all of the screen stuff is as bad as it seems. Minecraft, along with Block Craft and its other versions, is less passive than the baby video stuff. You can build and explore. You can get killed by a zombie, or run away from a wolf. In Roblox, a seemingly infinite series of digital worlds, my kids can be in the same game at once, and when I hear them chatting and strategising I breathe a sigh of relief.I’m trying to hold various lines. I won’t pay for in-game accessories, no matter how hard they beg. And after we’ve done a long day at the coalface, there are no screens in the evening. Being inside and online all day has also changed the way we experience the material world. At the weekend, after spending the best part of the week in our apartment, we go out for a walk and the effect is amazing.The sky is insanely blue. The world, as Louis MacNeice put it, is “suddener than we fancy it”. You’d think my kids had never seen colour before. All of us stand, rapt, before a bank of red tulips, while I take a stab at remembering how pollination works. The online world looks suddenly very shallow and dim, and I’m reminded that misinformation exists IRL, too. Later, my daughter looks at me expectantly after the question about Bora Bora. “It’s in a country called Afghanistan,” I say with confidence."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26ee9dec82c7159d8e7eec96fbf183ab41a7fbdf/476_0_3983_2390/master/3983.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e5006c8bc04dac2194752adf3f7efa4b","title":"newspapers journalists coronavirus press democracy","story":"Journalists are excelling in holding government to account over coronavirus. If the press suffers, so does democracyAt last it is MPs who are asking questions. On Wednesday, after parliament’s long Easter holiday, the new Labour leader, Keir Starmer, asked five questions in the House of Commons. But the questions – about statistics, supplies, tests, care homes – have been around for weeks. Ministers have been challenged, comparisons drawn, mendacities exposed. Democratic accountability had functioned, sort of. But not by MPs, by the press.I do not often bang the drum for my industry. Newspapers are institutionally smug. When the coronavirus mess is over, I doubt if the public will line the streets clapping journalists on their way, even if the way is to closure and bankruptcy. Other media have being doing their bit. I have valued the BBC’s More or Less and Briefing Room, and Channel 4’s scientists’ debate. But for a relentless daily alternative to Downing Street’s wooden press conferences, we must turn to the serious press.If this week we were to rely on ministers and their in-house scientists on the question of wearing face masks, we would be clueless. If we had relied on government press statements on Covid-19 deaths, we would never have known they were just deaths in NHS hospitals, not care homes or any other homes. Independent epidemiologists disagreeing with Whitehall’s virus model from Imperial College had to challenge it in newspapers. It has been left to journalists, not MPs, to track down the chaos over protection equipment, key worker testing and the capital’s underused intensive care beds.Of course, media exposure can be the problem as much as the solution. An addiction to human interest and bad news leaves worst-case scenarios and personal tragedies hogging the headlines. The BBC’s News at Ten has become unwatchable for its vox pops of random anguish, merely boosting the government’s message: obey or die. The promotion of fear gets people watching, but it never aids public understanding. Just now, the yawning chasm between known and unknown is too susceptible to the politics of terror.With politicians in absentia, it has been journalists who have had to penetrate ministerial obfuscation. Only with the latest charts from the Office for National Statistics has the UK begun to appreciate what the Cambridge statistician David Spiegelhalter calls “the only unbiased comparison” of Covid-19 deaths against other and seasonal deaths. That is the figure for “excess mortality from all causes” against a five-year average. It is not happy reading, but at least it means something. No one mentioned it in parliament that I can see. It was in the press.As for the looming debate over “lives versus economics”, that too must be left to the media. The government is in intellectual lockdown over an exit strategy. Alone in the free world, it refuses discussion on the grounds – says the acting prime minister, Dominic Raab – that this would undermine its casually authoritarian policy. This cannot be right. With an economy more jeopardised than it has been since the second world war, and with parliament indolent, deep scrutiny of government strategy is essential. It is also psychologically important for the public. Information is reassurance. Debate is empowering, it allays fear with reason. If ministers want to impose extreme curbs on personal freedom, they must show personal trust.Thomas Jefferson’s famous preference for “newspapers without a government”, if the alternative is government without newspapers, may be stretching a point. It remains strange that so vital a pillar of democracy as an independent and erse press should be at the mercy of a private market. Over the years, that pillar has been damaged by chicanery, bias, vulgarity and sensation. Yet for all that and in most democracies, the market has more or less delivered. In the digital age, that is no longer guaranteed. The newspaper industry is experiencing a bizarre phenomenon, a surge in online popularity amid a commercial meltdown. , the Times, the  and the Financial Times have seen soaring online readership in some cases it has doubled. The craving for reliable, edited, evidence-based news is clearly huge. But it is near impossible to monetise. The bulwark of the press, revenue from advertising and circulation, is plummeting. Newspapers are bearing the costs of good journalism Google and Facebook are garnering the profits. Many local newspapers appear unlikely to survive this crisis, while the outlook for printed papers of all sorts is grim. The predators half acknowledge this. The BBC is already subsidising some local newspapers whose market it has damaged through its local newsrooms. Google is offering grants to small- and medium-sized publications – tossing a liferaft to the ships it has torpedoed. I dislike the idea of state support for an industry whose essence is independent news and debate. Depending on how government acts in the coming months, I still believe most newspapers can keep going. Ministers are already throwing crumbs of NHS advertising in their direction. Last year’s Cairncross report suggested substantial payments from digital platforms to the press organisations that supply them. This might well be part of a wider new order for digital regulation.For the present, newspapers can only continue to bring peace of mind to those enduring the present agony. But if they start to disappear, they would not be just another victim of this government’s coronavirus policy. If they suffer, democracy suffers. Remember Betjeman: “It’s strange that those we miss the most Are those we took for granted.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a9fbd59e707a8ccb825b5ed7b41b6168e1af51e/3_0_1682_1009/master/1682.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1c3404bf4e9040100a8f794ec604c897","title":"should we blame bats for the terrible coronavirus we should not bats are our friends","story":"Some people are angry at bats which is ridiculous.

In Scotland, the government has announced a £5m package of emergency financial support.The NUS has called on the government to supply a £60 million hardship fund that would provide students with a “safety net” during the coronavirus lockdown. The NUS also demanded that universities reimburse students’ tuition fees and allow them to retake the year to make up for the disruption to their degrees.This has been echoed by cross-party MPs, who have asked the chancellor to set up emergency maintenance grants for those who are not entitled to claim universal credit.Lily Taylor, a master’s student at Sheffield Hallam University, lives off £90 a week after being furloughed from her bar job, along with her savings that will run out soon. “The hardest part is having no space to study,” she says. “In the house I rent we have a high-up dining table with stools. I have a bad back after an accident a couple of years ago and I can’t sit here for longer than 20 minutes without it being a strain.”Taylor tried asking her university if it could supply her with a desk chair. She was told to apply for the university’s hardship fund, but says her application was denied. “I’m stuck on my own in Sheffield, 160 miles away from my friends and family, and I’m worried about how I’m going to be able to complete my dissertation.”Sheffield Hallam has launched a crowdfunding appeal to raise money for struggling students after its usual hardship fund was overwhelmed by requests from students as a result of the pandemic.Similar measures have been announced by the University of York and the University of Greenwich. Greenwich has also offered free laptops and broadband for students and staff, while students at the University of Loughborough can request free meals if they are struggling to cope financially while stranded on campus.But students will need to meet certain eligibility criteria to receive support. Sophie Cartwright, a master’s student, applied for the University of Birmingham’s hardship fund after losing her income from three part-time jobs. Although she comes from a single-parent, lower socioeconomic background, she says she doesn’t meet requirements.“The university requires any postgraduate applicant to have a minimum average of £180 a week in income throughout the academic year in order to even apply to the fund. This is extremely counterintuitive as it means those who most need the financial support are immediately not eligible,” she says.Some students who have lost their jobs were employed by universities themselves – in campus shops or student unions, for example – and are frustrated by the lack of clarity around the future of their employment.Issy Emmitt, a third-year student at the University of Bath, was working two jobs on campus before the outbreak, as both a student ambassador and in the campus supermarket. When the lockdown began, she and other student employees were informed via a Facebook page that there was no more work available at the shop.“Those of us working zero-hour contracts on campus still haven’t been told whether or not we have been officially furloughed or just plain fired yet – four weeks on,” she says. “A coursemate of mine lost three campus jobs and estimates her losses to be already around £1,000.” In the meantime, Emmitt is worried about how she will pay rent. “I have no savings because of how expensive living in Bath is, and so I’m suddenly in a position where I not only can’t afford my rent, but even basic living necessities,” she says. “I also can’t move home at the moment as my father is severely immunocompromised.”Rent is a major concern for hard-pressed students. Nearly 75,000 students have signed a petition for universities to suspend all student accommodation rent for those who have returned home due to Covid-19.For students like Cartwright, the financial pressures may be too much. “If I do not receive additional support, I will likely not be able to finance somewhere in Birmingham to live for the remainder of my degree,” she says. “I won’t be able to afford a deposit or save up rent upfront for the new property. Due to the hands on nature of my degree, I need to be in Birmingham to complete my dissertation. I do not wish to drop out, but this is something I’m unfortunately forced to consider.”Some names have been changed"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70b1df72795ce06ae25c7c73dbf6bfd75d1ba117/0_275_4724_2835/master/4724.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2d1f67acb0fae7ae5cc77d44a083f7cb","title":"italy home schooling coronavirus lockdown what weve learned","story":"Schools in northern Italy were the first in Europe to close. Since then, teachers, parents and kids across the country have all had to adapt to a new existence – and the results have surprised everyone. By  Tobias JonesMost of us in Emilia-Romagna, in northern Italy, remember the weekend of 22 February very clearly. To begin with there were just rumours – phone calls and messages flying around between friends – but then it was confirmed: all schools in the region were going to close for a week.The decision was, in many ways, shocking. At that time, there had only been three deaths from Covid-19 in Italy, and only 152 reported infections. It seemed strange that education was the first social activity to be sacrificed. I guessed it was because it wasn’t perceived to be economically productive. Nothing else was closing: football grounds, bars, shops and ski resorts were still open for business, and no schools in any other European country had closed.Still, to our three kids – Benny (15), Emma (13) and Leo (9) – the idea of a week off seemed like bliss. We had moved back to Parma from the UK three years earlier, and by comparison with the UK, education here seemed relentless. Many pupils go to school six days a week and there are no half-term holidays. But my wife, Francesca, who is Italian, and I were both worried. She works with Syrian refugees, which isn’t a job you can suddenly drop, and I had just been offered a 9-to-5 job, after 21 years of being freelance. We, like all our friends, suddenly had an acute childcare crisis.The announcement had been so sudden that schools had few plans or resources in place to teach remotely. Italy spends a lot less on education than almost every other western country. Spending per student (from primary school to university) equates to $8,966 per annum, compared to $11,028 in the UK and $11,502 in Sweden. The under-investment is so serious that in December 2019, the education minister, Lorenzo Fioramonti, resigned in protest.Nor did many Italian teachers seem to know how to approach this new world in which they found themselves. There is minimal teacher-training in Italy. University graduates are often thrown into a classroom without any knowledge of pedagogic theories or practical experience. Inspections are almost unheard of. The result is that Italian education is, at its worst, particularly conservative and condescending: the pupil is seen as an empty vessel to be filled with knowledge that is regurgitated in exams.But if Italian schools weren’t perfect, they were surely better than nothing. The idea that we now had to recreate formal education within the narrow walls of a city flat with no garden was daunting. We lacked the time, energy or even knowledge to replace their teachers. Nor, the kids made it clear, did they even want us to try.Parents and teachers across the country had to scramble to devise ways continue our children’s learning. But slowly – over the course of two months – something rather unexpected happened. As we started to ponder how this experiment of home schooling could best be delivered, it began to feel as if it was us, the parents and teachers, as much as the pupils, who were being educated.The first week off school was the lull before the storm. It genuinely felt like a holiday. Being pragmatic and slightly puritan, we don’t let the kids watch TV, or ourselves drink alcohol, on weekdays. When it was announced that school was closed, we lifted the rules. On 1 March, another week of school closures was announced, so we went up to the mountains, half an hour outside the city, to plant trees and play cards. On 4 March, a new government decree announced that every school in Italy would be suspended the following day.In those early days it was all fun. I left the children spelling tests under their plates or pillows, and if they wanted to watch TV they had to learn elements of the periodic table or the bones of the human skeleton or how to tie knots. It felt as if we were, finally, the right side of that ancient Roman dichotomy of “otium-negotium”, an idea to which Italians occasionally refer. Otium was the time of creative repose when you were able to freewheel and follow your fancies – unlike negotium, which was all about business and the practical side of life.We had a few advantages, I suppose. The ages of our kids mean that there are no tantrums at one end, and no alcohol or boyfriend issues at the other. We enjoy just hanging out together. I’ve also spent much of my life teaching. I’ve taught everywhere from primary schools to prisons and universities. For years, at home, we’ve had mealtime quizzes. One Christmas, Benny even gifted the family three bells of the kind they have in hotel receptions so that we could truly have “fingers on buzzers”.The few educational theories I have come from the British psychoanalyst Donald Winnicott, who believed that play is the path to a child’s wholeness and wellbeing. Games give children the chance to make decisions for themselves and provide an opportunity for spontaneity, fun, deceit and calculation. So for those first two weeks we played incessantly: perudo (“liars’ dice”), blackjack, euchre, backgammon and epic table-tennis tournaments with various handicaps (playing left-handed or subtracting your age from your score). The kids weren’t learning much, but at least poor old Leo was learning to be a good loser.Being the youngest, he needed some fun, and since at this point his class had as yet no lessons organised, I asked his teacher if we could make 10-minute English lessons for his classmates. The aim was as much to cheer them up as to learn English. We would wear wigs and teach his peers the English names for body parts by sawing them off and using lots of fake blood. We taught grammar through declining lavatorial verbs. Emma would edit the videos and we would send them to the class WhatsApp group, which had, until now, been a basic tool for school admin and parental gossip.Despite all those good intentions, it was hard not to feel inadequate, even anxious. Well-meaning messages were circulating among parents about which museums, theatres, aquariums and zoos had opened their virtual doors. Many were posting pictures of their well-behaved children clicking their way through the Guggenheim, while ours were watching House on Netflix. We quickly felt defeated by the sheer volume of offerings, and guilty that we weren’t sharing these cultural delights with our children.The following weekend, on 8 March, the government announced that the whole of Emilia-Romagna (plus Lombardy and the Veneto) was to be placed in lockdown, and that schools would be closed for at least another month. Three days later, on 11 March, the entire country went into full lockdown.We were slowly realising how dark things were becoming. On 12 March, we passed 1,000 nationwide deaths, and only four days later passed 2,000. There was defiance and denial as we sang on balconies and people hung out bedsheets with the wrong-headed slogan “andrà tutto bene” (“it’ll all be fine”), but the mood was turning as the death toll continued to rise.It was at this point that teachers dumped a load of homework on their pupils. Having had a fortnight to plan how to teach through the crisis, many decided that the best way was to send out entire chapters of books for children to learn, and hundreds of pages of exercises to complete. After a fortnight of freedom, pupils were now overloaded.The other thing that changed was that my new job started. For the first time this century, I had bosses and meetings and responsibilities. It brought to an abrupt end my educational clowning. Suddenly no one in the family had much spare time and nor, it seemed, such good cheer.The closing of all Italy’s schools meant teachers found themselves having to invent a new kind of classroom from scratch. There were no ministerial guidelines or approved websites. “The entirety of this new form of online teaching,” said Daniele Martino, a middle-school teacher in Turin, “was created by us teachers at the last minute.”At the beginning, it was chaotic. There was little coordination between different teachers within the same schools, let alone across different schools, and parents reported finding themselves boggled by a vast array of IT platforms: Meet, Classroom, Zoom, Jitsi, Edmodo. The problem wasn’t only that sites and servers crashed as the country’s almost 8 million students all logged on. Many kids couldn’t connect at all.At the start, I got the sense that no one really knew how to do what was becoming known as “DAD” – didattica a distanza, or long-distance learning. When teachers were struggling with IT, it was often their pupils who came to the rescue. “I have an exceptional digital consultant”, said Claudio Dionesalvi, a literature teacher in Calabria. “He’s 11, and is one of my students. He’s like a junior version of Mr Wolf in Pulp Fiction.”The teacher-pupil balance also shifted. In an online classroom, if pupils aren’t interested or motivated, they can hide far more easily. They can feign technological issues, freeze the camera, mute the microphone. Around this time, I did a few online lessons for various schools and saw the problem close up: when the pupils weren’t engaged they would drift away and, not having them there in front of you, you couldn’t bring them back into the circle.Teachers were having to learn new ways to draw their students out. “I could no longer do the classic head-on, knowledge-passing lesson,” said Betta Salvini, a history teacher in Parma. “I now involve them all the time, I turn the lesson upside down so that they are the protagonists, so that I hear their voices.”But school was also being reinvented because Italy’s traditional educational stick had been removed. Usually pupils are given many tests each month and if, at the end of the year, their average score is insufficient, they’re bocciato – failed – and have to repeat the year. Now, teachers quickly realised there was no way to stop students cheating in tests. When someone is in their bedroom, and all you can see is their face, you have no idea if they have the book open on their lap, or are messaging friends or Googling the answer.Traditionalist teachers were beside themselves. One parent in Umbria told me how a teacher stormed out of the virtual classroom when she discovered how many pupils were cheating. Then the new education minister, Lucia Azzolina, suggested that in the circumstances, no pupils would be sent back to repeat the year again. Between the cheating and the automatic promotion to the next school year, teachers who needed a big stick suddenly found themselves disarmed.“Many of my colleagues are really struggling”, said Riccardo Giannitrapani, a maths teacher in a secondary school in Udine. These two months, he told me, have been more about a re-education of teachers than of pupils. “Before, we used to discuss students in meetings by giving them numbers, even down to decimal points – 5.4, 5.5.” These marks, he said, became an end in themselves, creating acute anxiety among not only the children, but also their parents.There has always been a battle in Italy between hardliners and child-centred reformers such as Maria Montessori. It now seemed as if progressives had the upper hand. Salvatore Giuliano, a headteacher in Brindisi and a former deputy education minister, told me: “A child of 15 has far more creativity than we have. Every time you give them the freedom and tools to create something, they will astonish you.” Giuliano described some memorable student-led presentations he has seen in recent weeks. His favourite was an extended family – parents, siblings and grandparents – all dressed up as the planets and moving around the room.Many teachers have had to soften their approach, to take into account what their pupils were going through. “Some of them have lost a grandparent”, said Paola Lante, a primary-school teacher in Milan. “Their parents are losing their jobs or are fighting at home. At the end of the day, a teacher has to be a steadying influence, a social worker and a psychologist.”At the beginning of the lockdown, Giannitrapani, the maths teacher in Udine, published an open letter to his pupils saying that he shouldn’t be the one overloading them, but vice versa – they should be bombarding him with their questions. Sara Scotellaro, in Naples, has 120 pupils in various classes: “They no longer have a timetable and you have to be constantly available”, she said. “They have this need to be immediately reassured – that their work has been received, that it’s OK, that you’re happy with them.”That fluidity of boundaries has had advantages and disadvantages. In video lessons some pupils have found it embarrassing to share their personal spaces – their bedrooms and, in the background, even their embarrassing parents. Many teachers describe seeing a new side to their students. “There’s no longer the intimidation of the pack,” said one teacher, “and so they’re bringing out what they really know. I’ve got a 13-year-old, the son of two ex-offenders, who has produced some diaries of extraordinary depth.” Lante told me about a very timid student who never speaks in class but who, it only now emerges, is exceptional at languages. “It makes you understand”, said Lante, “that we need a very varied form of education”.By the third week of March, after a month with no school, Francesca and I were also beginning to see our children in a new light. Like most kids, they’re monosyllabic when describing their days at school – “fine” usually does it. Now, as lessons were literally taking place in the kitchen, we were unexpectedly in the classroom with them. We could see what was going on.It was both painful and funny. We realised that one of our children, exuberant and confident at home, often froze when asked a question in class. Another, usually conscientious and honest, was asked by her teacher to show her artwork. Because it hadn’t turned out too well, she held up her drawing up against the window, and held the painting she was supposed to have copied behind it, so it showed through behind her own. That mini-deceit made her work look rather sophisticated.Another consequence of lessons taking place at home was that the greatest problem in schools – boisterous disturbances – suddenly subsided. One of our children has a class that is usually very noisy: the kids misbehave and the teacher yells, and soon everyone is shouting over each other. Now, with the children subdued by their parents’ presence, and the teacher aware that parents could be listening, there was a new-found calm to the lessons and, we thought, a genuine warmth to the encounters.But there was no timetable to our children’s lessons. There were odd hours here and there, sometimes in the early morning, sometimes mid-afternoon. Our elderly laptops and wifi were often inadequate, and so the only working devices were passed around. There wasn’t a lot of rhythm or relaxation to our day. Francesca and I were still trying to take up a lot of slack, but as March turned into April, our initial energy had subsided.We had passed 10,000, then 15,000 deaths from Covid-19. Even though the kids had enough spare time to be habitually bored, they were no longer cleaning the house or doing their daily learning tasks. Spelling tests and fitness regimes were forgotten. They seemed to have become – if not agoraphobic – certainly “agora-meh”. They wouldn’t even walk around the block. They were getting up later each day, and even when vertical, it became hard to persuade them to get out of pyjamas.As often happens when you stop doing something, you suddenly wonder why you were doing it in the first place. Benny, who has been obsessive about ballet all her life and attends a dance academy, entered a profound crisis. She said she wanted to stop dancing altogether. Even Leo, a football fanatic, barely mentioned or played with a football any more. It felt as if their passions had evaporated somehow.It’s hard, as a parent, not to be frustrated, especially if – as a writer – you regret that they never read books. Every time I emerged from my office, I would see them all on their screens, headphones on. Lessons had become indistinguishable from down-time. For all the idealism about digital learning, it seemed extraordinarily passive to me.I tried to take things in hand. Mealtimes were raucous because they had so much pent-up energy, so I thought “if they’re not going to read, I’ll read to them”. I would bring a book to table, not realising that I was becoming just like one of the conservative teachers I had always scorned, force-feeding them my passions and using knowledge to sedate and subdue. They would snigger and scoff. “I just don’t get poetry,” Emma grumbled.Fortunately they have a wiser mother. We have no garden, but four balconies, and as spring came on, Francesca was planting and weeding. The children were drawn to the gardening, perhaps because it was everything their schooling isn’t – outdoors and manual. Emma propagated her succulents and so needed more shelf space, and went to the garage to do some carpentry. They began sewing, and cooking cappelletti, croissants and – their much-missed English snack – digestive biscuits.It’s hard to know how much it was more to do with psychology or spare time, but they all began rearranging their bedrooms, moving beds and desks. It was as if they were rearranging their internal and external furniture. Photographs, pictures and books were culled, others were added. They asked for new haircuts. Francesca and I watched it all and tried to work out ways to keep bringing them out of both their closed bedrooms and their private worlds.I changed my approach. I know that theatricality is sometimes helpful in teaching, so one evening, as I read a poem, I put a small shiny box on the table. They pretended to listen, but were all watching that box, wondering what the game was. I had chosen to read Seamus Heaney’s Digging. It’s a poem about how we look up to, and down on, our parents. It’s about the difficulty of a writer feeling worthy of agricultural ancestors because the pen is nothing compared with the depth of a spade. But it’s also about the need for children to go their own way and not, perhaps, feel unworthy. When I had finished, I just passed them the box. Inside I had cut up all the words of the poem. “Go on then,” I said, “write it your way.”Suddenly they were excited about poetry. They snatched words from each other, tried them out here and there. As they laughed, the slim pieces of paper flew around the table. With its farmyard diction – “squelch”, “slap”, “rump” – the poem now seemed earthy rather than erudite. Instead of being told to admire a Grecian urn, they now had the clay in their hands.As they found their new hybrid role of being both pupils and teachers, we said they could award themselves marks both for content (a letter) and effort (a number). It was really, of course, just a way to show them that marks aren’t about approval (external) but honesty (internal).The more you look at the educational conundrum in lockdown Italy, the more you see everyone’s vulnerabilities. Students have always felt fretful because of their weekly tests and the stigma of being held back a year. But now many teachers feel insecure, too: not just because education seems like the last priority of government, but because they are scared of digitalised learning and fear being replaced by screens.Even those who relish the technology, like the Calabrian teacher Claudio Dionesalvi, are concerned: “Distance-learning is a strange video game,” he said, “but in the end it’s a torture. A teacher can’t be holed up in front of a screen. They risk becoming two-dimensional – an artificial TV personality.”Many parents are anxious, not just because their children are losing out on formative months of learning, but also because – without those marks – they have no measure of their offspring’s progress. Chiara Esposito, a middle-school teacher, told me “parents are the most conservative element in the school ecosystem. They become paranoid if their child isn’t ‘an eight’ or hasn’t completed the set book. They’re the ones we really need to educate.”Surprisingly, even the education technology firms promoting digital learning platforms to schools feel apprehensive. Lorenzo Benussi is the chief innovation officer of the Fondazione per la Scuola della Compagnia di San Paolo, which promotes inclusivity and creativity in education, and a former technical adviser to the minister of education. He is concerned that teachers are using new tech to reproduce the same old teaching methods, instead of grasping this opportunity for a completely new kind of teaching. “When all this talk about digital learning began back in March,” he said, “I was very, very worried, because it’s not about technology. Technology is just a means. Its effectiveness depends entirely on your didactic approach.”Edoardo Montenegro from Betwyll, which is launching a new social reading app with educational publisher Pearson for Italian schools in September, says something very similar: “A WhatsApp video call or a Zoom meeting isn’t digital learning. Those encounters can be just as frontal and rhetorical as an old-style professorial lesson.”No one knows when formal schooling will resume, and everyone feels uncertain of what their role will be when it does. But uncertainty is, according to the great educationalist Loris Malaguzzi, actually a vital ingredient for inclusive, collegiate learning. Only “a willingness to question all your own abilities and knowledge”, he said in 1992, two years before his death, leads to humility and listening. That, he said, “is how we educate each other together.”It’s exactly two months since the schools closed in Emilia-Romagna. And to us, in our city apartment, it does feel as if, in the gentle argy-bargy of family life, we’ve been educating each other. Maybe it would have happened anyway, but it’s changed how we see ourselves. The girl destined to be a ballerina seems to be mourning the end of that dream. The perfectionist has glimpsed a goal that’s deeper than marks out of 10. The boy who seemed riotous has been revealed as nervously studious. The teacher has become an accompanist and the gardener our guide. And with almost five months to go until schools (possibly) reopen in mid-September, I’m sure we’ve still got a lot to learn.• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/91563b8e3f4441bff411667b078e8b219edef27e/0_322_5159_3095/master/5159.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=01577ce060389dadbe3b48e6b1dbbb39","title":"new helpline help parents struggling home schooling","story":"StarLine service will provide general tips on behaviour and mental health as well as specific advice on tricky academic questionsParents and carers struggling to teach phonics to one child and physics to another at home during the coronavirus lockdown will now be able to call up expert help.A group of schools in England have set up a national helpline operating six days a week to allow parents to find someone who can explain the mysteries of trigonometry, oxbow lakes and the Schleswig-Holstein Question if they cannot.Justine Roberts, the founder of Mumsnet, is one of those backing the StarLine service, which aims to offer confidential advice to families from qualified teachers and parenting experts, including advice on behaviour and timetabling as well as help for those looking after children with special educational needs or disabilities.“On our forums we’re seeing thousands of discussions, covering everything from anxiety about the impacts on GCSE and A-level pupils, or questions about key stage one literacy, to worries about children’s socialisation and mental health, to frustration about having to make one laptop stretch between three kids,” Roberts said.Hamid Patel, chief executive of the Star Academies schools trust, which is behind the helpline, said: “We understand that this is a time of additional pressure for many parents and carers. The combination of working from home, caring for our loved ones and trying to educate our children is a difficult juggling act.“Together with our partners, we want to use our educational expertise to support parents and carers who are grappling with the challenge of trying to maintain their children’s learning.”StarLine said its advisers will share techniques and resources with families, to help children follow good study habits, and practical steps to take with specific subjects such as algebra or English, or tips on how to manage the learning of several children.The helpline, to be officially launched on Friday, is supported by a group of multi-academy trusts and Oak National Academy, the new digital platform created by teachers since the start of the lockdown to help schools and families access relevant learning materials and online classrooms.Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, said the service was a welcome addition to the support available to help children learn from home. “StarLine represents another inspiring example of teachers and education experts working together to share their knowledge, resources and expertise with schools and families,” he said.The StarLine group says that no external or additional funding has been received for the project, with all costs being met by the project’s partners. Calls to the helpline use a local rate number, 0330 3139162, from anywhere in the UK."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b7a119dddf1166836d43b1c80d3272c54352c4fc/0_0_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=63bf88d4489ee8cb2c4539248370251c","title":"the best oversized dresses for all ages in pictures","story":"Comfortable and chic, these are perfect transitional pieces for spring.

But how bad could it be?I have a good excuse. When Forrest Gump came out in 1994 and conquered the world I was an undergraduate at New York University’s film school. I was, to put it bluntly, at my apogee of cinematic snobbishness. I was gobbling up my ABCs (Antonioni, Bergman and Cassavetes) and when I went out to see contemporary work, it was low-budget, independent material from directors like Jim Jarmusch, Hal Hartley and Gregg Araki. Forrest Gump was not on my radar.It was rare that I’d see something wide-release, and if I did it was done ironically. “We want a bus! Show us a bus!” my obnoxious friends and I chanted as we sat down to see Speed. When the opening sequence began, I shouted: “We were promised a bus, not an elevator!” and someone shushed me. Rightly.So there was no way in hell I was going to see Forrest Gump. Especially when it won the Academy Award over Pulp Fiction, and became all that was wrong with our culture – confirmed by the Bubba Gump Shrimp Company restaurant that soon opened in the newly neutered Times Square.But things change. Three years ago I was in Florida and hungry for dinner, and the only restaurant without a waiting list was a Bubba Gump’s. The jambalaya was actually very good.And when Tom Hanks recently announced that he and Rita Wilson had tested positive for coronavirus, I realised how much I loved him. His performances are always great and his public persona as a typewriter-loving Dad joke-spewer has brought me great joy. Learning that Hanks had Covid-19 took the illness out of abstraction and gave it a familiar face. Then came an internal voice: Call yourself a Tom Hanks fan? You haven’t even seen his most famous film! So now I am about to press play …Oh, Christ, that was truly awful.The whole thing, from first frame to the last, was really rough. And even a bit offensive. I get annoyed when people criticise movies from the 1940s for being politically incorrect, but for something as recent as 1994 Forrest Gump is one sexist film.Is Robin Wright’s character Jenny anything other than a White Knight’s wet dream? A poor girl in desperate need of saving who, unlike Forrest, goes out into the world and ends up as a tossed-around plaything who eventually dies of Aids? Oh, if only she’d stayed down on the farm to let American exceptionalism do its thing! She would have just lucked into enormous wealth, like Forrest did. Maybe I’m overthinking it, but the mind has to go somewhere during this movie. If it stays focused on the screen, you might throw up. I don’t know what’s more cringeworthy, the “Run, Forrest, run!” scene(s), seeing Forrest teaching Elvis to dance (and inspiring John Lennon to write Imagine), or the rolling assault of on-the-nose needle-drops during the Vietnam sequence.Cultural osmosis had pre-familiarised me with the broad strokes of this beloved comedy, but I did not know that there were violent “action scenes” involving napalm and machine guns. That came as a surprise.Another surprise was meeting the Bubba (of Bubba Gump restaurant fame). I didn’t realise he was killed by the Viet Cong. What the hell kind of family restaurant is that place? Gary Sinese’s Lt Dan is the only truly good thing about this movie. His character’s adjustment to being a double amputee is a far more compelling story than the one given the spotlight.Plus, it’s real acting, not whatever the hell it is Hanks is doing with those wacky faces and cartoonish accent. Yeah, I know he won the Oscar, but other than the scene at Jenny’s grave (which was touching, I grant you) how far a distance is it between Forrest Gump and any early Adam Sandler character?I’d say it’s about six feet – the distance we’ve been told to maintain to steer clear of Covid-19, that wretched disease that pushed me to finally watching Forrest Gump. Truly a pox on the world."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95e3bb9e4f7cbc227a35156927a5e8ff39a17cca/23_137_3400_2039/master/3400.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=51141459266ba39435c21983ccd5a996","title":"my favourite game when cambridge drew at home to eight man cardiff","story":"Nothing better sums up my experience of being a lower-league fan than a goalless draw against a team with eight menOn 28 December 1999, Cambridge United drew 0-0 at home to Cardiff City in Division Two (now League One). Nothing remarkable there. Until you realise that Cardiff City had three men sent off – one for deliberate handball on the line. Yet Cambridge still couldn’t get three points.My memories of standing on the north terrace that day are pretty hazy. But I distinctly remember being excited that David Elleray was the referee. Who knows what mistake he’d made in the Premier League the week before to be sent down to our level but he was by some distance the most famous person on the pitch. And he meant business.He sent off one of their players before half-time, another with half an hour to go. Finally, with seven or eight minutes left, their substitute Lee Phillips made a decent save and Ellery gave the penalty and sent Phillips off.By then the atmosphere in our end was a mixture of disbelief and hilarity. Eleven v nine was ridiculous enough. It was a training game. But we just could not score. We barely looked like scoring.As Martin Butler placed the ball on the spot – against eight men – I obviously wanted him to score. We’d had our fun. We’d laughed at how we couldn’t beat nine men. Now we’d have both victory and a funny story for later. Butler was a lovely footballer and a decent penalty taker. But Jon Hallworth – all blonde hair and blonde eyebrows – saved it, and Cardiff held on, very briefly going down to seven men when one of their players was stretchered off in injury time.I urge anyone to listen to the Cardiff commentary from that day. I recently mentioned the game on a podcast and the commentator Phil Stead got in touch. “I had just started working for the club and recorded it on a dictaphone to try it out as a new fangled audio download. It was my first and last commentary. We played it on the bus speakers on the way home.”As a one and only commentary, it is sensational – improved by the terrible audio quality and the fact he’s just standing in the away end. The words without the atmosphere don’t do them justice, but it’s quite the monologue.“Elleray must blow up any second. We’re in the third minute of injury time … And it’s all over and Cardiff City celebrate as they draw 0-0 with eight men. A remarkable performance. Cambridge United nil, Cardiff City nil. And we celebrate! We celebrate as if we’ve won the European Champions League! A great day in the history of Cardiff City. And this is emotional … this is emotional here in Cambridge. This is what it’s all about. Cardiff City! The greatest team in the world. Richie Humphries come here my son. And he goes into the City crowd. The man’s a hero. They are all heroes … We are surely the greatest team in the history of football. This is what it’s all about. Man United? No. Chelsea? No. Tottenham? No. Barcelona? No. Real Madrid? No. Cardiff City. That’s what it’s all about!”Sadly for Cardiff, we beat them 4-0 at Ninian Park when it was 11 versus 11 and they got relegated that season, finishing four points below us.From a Cambridge perspective, this game epitomises what it means to be a lower league fan. Most of it is bad. Occasionally hilariously bad.There have been great victories - Chesterfield in the first play-off final at Wembley in 1990. Those cup runs in the 90s – 5-1 v Bristol City in a fifth-round replay in 1990 and 4-0 over Sheffield Wednesday the following year. There have even been stoic defeats - 2-1 to Arsenal in 1991, when Dion Dublin equalised and David O’Leary should have been sent off, but nothing sums up my supporting experience better than a goalless draw against eight men."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42f4f80d146edda4d37eb8ee9f36fd95b08df0f2/76_170_2924_1754/master/2924.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c3b6fad05c89a0a8ec9b48239063a010","title":"manchester united setup seniors help locked down youngsters","story":"Club’s compassionate approach recognises that lockdown life ‘leaves a big hole’ for children ripped from their usual routinesLast Friday I had a good old-fashioned nosy at Ryan Giggs’s kitchen, close enough to check out his fancy light fittings – if only virtually. Like much of the past month, it was a surreal experience, this one conjured up by the youth development team at Manchester United.When, one Saturday morning in 2014, a man in a padded jacket slid along the touchline to hand me his number on a scrap of paper, I looked at him blankly. He said he was a scout for United and would like to get my son down to the development centre to take a closer look. I was pretty dubious – our little boy was only five.Five and a half years later he’s still pulling on the red kit once a week, effervescent with excitement on the drive to Carrington, hidden away among the flat fields and winding lanes just off the M60. In a perverse way, from a parental point of view, we’ve been lucky he’s had all the thrills but not reached the heady heights of the academy, where a much more intense level of commitment and sacrifice is required from all members of the family.It has been a fascinating experience by proxy, watching a erse selection of boys come and go, some fleetingly, others fast-tracked, and trying to work out why each one is special. What unites them is a complete devotion to the game and their football education. There must have been incidents with discipline but I’ve never seen one, and the silence as they train never stops being a surprise. In a way unusual for groups of young boys, there is a real seriousness about their purpose. They are told that they are here for a reason, show it.United don’t over-promise. There seems to be no desire to make the kids too professional, too soon – they just let them play. They try to do cultural things, educate recently the under-12s curated an exhibition at Carrington on Walter Tull, one of the first black footballers and the first black British officer to lead white troops – and United’s senior squad came across from their building to be shown around by the younger boys.A few days into the lockdown, an email arrived from the academy. It was thoughtful, kind. It reminded us that parents are the biggest influence on a child and encouraged reading and a regular bedtime. It went on: “During the coming weeks we still want the boys to enjoy their childhood, explore learning for themselves, use their imagination and be creative. Some of the best learning to take place during this prolonged period of time at home will be created by the boys themselves.” It advised parents “not to force your boys to practise. Let them practise because they are in love with football”.There has been regular contact since. They’ve sent worksheets, encouraged the boys to look after their wellbeing and made a short film of all the fitness sessions that the boys designed and sent in via WhatsApp. And then there are those hour-long Friday morning Q\u0026ampA sessions, each watched by nearly 200 children. The first week they were able to question Michael Carrick the second, Ole Gunnar Solskjær, whose Scando-Manc commitment to the academy sing-songed through each answer then Giggs and, on Friday, comes Marcus Rashford, a local boy who grew up on free school meals, and who in the past few weeks has helped to raise £20m for FareShare, a charity aimed at relieving food poverty.The programme was drawn together from scratch in a few days by the academy head, Nick Cox, and his team. “The consensus was that we had to do something,” says Cox. “Football brings together people from all walks of life. Some boys will be enjoying time with their families, for other boys it will be very difficult some will be struggling financially or health-wise, living in cramped conditions at the top of a block of flats. Some of these kids will normally be with us four or five times a week – it leaves a big hole in their lives.”Before arriving at Old Trafford four years ago, Cox was at Watford and Sheffield United. Both have great youth setups but United is different. It is just so huge and has, in Cox’s words, “an absolute commitment to youth which surpasses all others”. Last December the club celebrated their 4,000th consecutive game with an academy player in their match-day squad, a sequence going back 82 years. Cox has had no problem persuading big names to help him with his Friday interviews: “It is what Manchester United is about – they all understand the value of the academy.”This is just one small story about a huge club. It has nothing to do with the vats of cash swilling around at the top – though huge sums are ploughed into the academy – and everything to do with human relationships at ground level, supporting the boys and girls who are never happier than with a ball flicking, flicking, at their toes. Alongside United continuing to pay casual staff despite there being no games for them to steward, and City and United giving a joint donation to Greater Manchester food banks, it illustrates that nothing is simple that Premier League football may be greedy and selfish, but it can also be life-enhancing and compassionate.It is quite possible, of course, that none of those boys hanging on to Giggs’s every word as he advised young wingers, and admitted that Sir Alex Ferguson could be “a scary man”, will make it as a professional footballer. But they might remember that during a very confusing time in their lives, when their freedoms disappeared and the thing they loved best was taken away, their club didn’t forget them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a01e8edafbd47ba01475440bf860740f97f38bf6/166_0_1107_664/master/1107.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=70fd820b12c8db702a061048197b7365","title":"soap and solace scarce as sri lankas tea pickers toil on amid lockdown","story":"Workers in a sector with a history of exploitation face hazards including a lack of masks and overcrowded accommodationIn Sri Lanka, police have been enforcing tough lockdown measures and a strict curfew since March. The country’s inspector general has instructed police to take action against social media users who criticise the government or spread “malicious” pandemic information.An exception has been made, however, for the country’s tea pickers. A caveat on the country’s lockdown order, issued on 20 March, read: “Paddy farming and plantation, including work on tea small holdings and fishing activities, are permitted in any district.”The Ceylon Workers’ Red Flag Union say coronavirus public health measures mean little on estates. There are no facilities to wash hands with soap during a shift and masks are not always issued, even though it has been mandatory to wear them in public since early April.Some workers have bought their own masks. Others improvise with handkerchiefs and serviettes. Where companies provide a cloth mask, the cost can be deducted from wages. In the humidity and heat, Red Flag has observed women constantly touching their faces to wipe away sweat. The union is concerned that, without health education, the masks may not be washed daily or used correctly. A pressing concern is living conditions. Accommodation on tea estates generally consists of overcrowded, tin-roofed “line rooms”, usually five consecutive rooms in long rows. Each 30-square-metre room is a household, making social distancing impossible. Toilets are sometimes communal.Because of the curfew, partners and children working and living in urban areas have been returning, so rooms are more overcrowded. Where household members work in neighbouring estates, cross-area infection is a risk.With the political environment ominous – Human Rights Watch fears the country may be using the pandemic to curtail free speech – the critical voice of plantation trade unions has played a vital role in fighting deepening inequalities in a semi-feudal sector with a long history of exploitation.Tea, along with rubber and coconut, is among the country’s leading exports. The plantation system, devised by British colonialists in the 1820s, was run with an indentured workforce, uprooted from India’s Tamil Nadu. The population of about 840,000 people only gained Sri Lankan citizenship in 2003.Today, the work remains physically demanding, with poverty and debt bondage weighing heavily on estate communities. Smallholder tea farms, a more recent development dating back to the 70s and 80s, are believed to offer better working conditions.The labour force, consisting predominantly of women from the island’s “plantation Tamil” communities, is marked by social exclusion and grinding poverty.Demonstrations by civil society groups last year highlighted the chronic immiseration of tea workers, with protesters asking for a doubling of the minimum wage to 1,000 rupees a day (£4.22). And ethical brands do not guarantee better pay.A 2019 investigation by the Thomson Reuters Foundation found take-home wages in some tea estates certified by Rainforest Alliance and Fairtrade were as little as 26 rupees a day (£0.11) after the deduction of debt repayments, salary advances and other fees.With the pandemic curfew, even basic foods such as rice and lentils have been scarce, and women are struggling more than ever to maintain the health of their householdsMalnutrition was identified by a 2017 World Bank study as a significant problem for women and children on plantations.Reports of domestic violence and child abuse have also risen during the curfew.Red Flag has been in negotiations with the Sri Lanka State Plantations Cooperation (SLPC) to make sure the health of plantation workers is prioritised. Using daily updates from its local representatives, the union is trying to resolve problems quickly and successfully intervened over salary payments after some estates delayed paying wages.“We have written to the president demanding that workers get paid 25 days of salary for two months, regardless of whether they are working or not,” said Menaha Kandasamy, an adviser to Red Flag. Dilhan Fernando, chief executive of ethical tea company Dilmah, says the business has implemented several safeguarding measures, including social distancing, ensuring access to hand washing, food and medicines and paying employees a bonus of one month’s salary.Fernando said all tea pluckers are given a mask, while factory workers are provided with masks, gloves and sanitiser. Despite a lack of evidence, workers are being advised to gargle with salt water. Fernando described how “education on the critical importance of the precautions as well as daily disinfection in and around the accommodation and production areas is carried out”.SLPC have not responded to questions on line rooms, hand washing and masks on their estates."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/101846dcb4d1599fd14a421c040b692ec3c9631f/0_0_2952_1772/master/2952.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a8a0fd4f1344cd1adcc17474d112113c","title":"calling her lifts my spirits three parents on isolation away from their children","story":"As the UK remains in lockdown, parents share their stories about how they’re connecting with their children via technology …With much of the world in lockdown, staying connected with our loved ones has never been more important. Whether we’re checking in with a call, keeping ourselves entertained by taking part in online pub quizzes, or updating the family WhatsApp with our latest baking attempts, we have a burning desire to keep in touch. Our home broadband has gone from “nice to have” to the lifeline between us and the outside world.For some mums and dads who find themselves self-isolating away from their young children, this lifeline is critical. Here, three parents describe how they are managing to stay connected with their families from afar …Rosie: ‘I haven’t seen my son in four weeks’ “Dropping my son off with his father without knowing when I’m going to see him again was the most impossible thing I’ve ever had to do. And that feeling hasn’t lessened over all these weeks of self-isolation. My son is only three years old he’s so young. I feel ready to run out of here and scoop him up at any moment – to hell with it all.“I have to remind myself constantly why I have to take self-isolation so seriously. I’ve got bad asthma. So when my doctor advised that I stay indoors for 12 weeks, I decided it would be best for my son if he was with his dad, who has lots of outdoor space. We broke up in October, so I was only just getting used to the separation. And now this.“It’s been four weeks already, which is the longest I’ve ever been away from my son. FaceTime is essential, but it can be incredibly painful as well – I have to be positive because naturally I just want to burst into tears. I call him on my laptop as it has a bigger screen and his face is the normal size. At the end of the conversation he’ll hug the phone he’s using.“He recently showed me that he can now put his own socks on and told me that he’s being ‘independent’. He’s learned quite a few new words – I’m really proud of him. He’s also been collecting sticks and stones as presents for me when we’re reunited.“We talk at breakfast and dinner – it’s like how we used to sit around the family table, and he finds it entertaining to try to feed me bits of his food through the camera.“We’ve also had some family group calls – we had a lovely one with my sister and her son, my ex-husband and my son, and my dad and my stepmum. My son was playing the keyboard, and his cousin, who has just turned two, was dancing. It was so good!”Leo: ‘I had to isolate away from my daughter when I became ill’“When I started to feel ill a few weeks ago, with what I assume was coronavirus, my 12-year-old daughter was with her mum so it was easy for me to self-isolate.“As the illness took hold, I could do nothing but be in my bed. One bright part of the day, though, was FaceTiming my daughter, which isn’t something we did much previously. My ex and I share equal custody, so I’m used to seeing her every few days.“We’ve WhatsApped each other a lot, too. That way I got to check she was OK, what she was up to and, of course, my knowledge of emojis became fairly impressive.“My symptoms are now subsiding, but we feel it’s best that she stays at her mum’s until I’m completely clear, so the video calls have been such a help. We don’t have to talk every day, but knowing I can see her lifts my spirits. The distinctive sound of the FaceTime ringtone, and then seeing her face and that she looks so well, and isn’t bored or scared, makes this all much easier for me.“It has been very hard to be away from her especially because we don’t know when this is going to end. Several years ago I went to Brazil to work for a few weeks, but this will be the longest I haven’t been with my daughter. I know she is OK, though, and I know that right now she is in the best place with her fantastic mum, and in a wonderful home.“Loneliness, of course, comes into it, but weirdly with everyone in the same boat, you can sort of move away from thoughts of pure isolation. Knowing my daughter is only a video call away helps me so much.“We chat about what we’re doing, laugh about how mad we’re going, and I can put her mind at rest about any questions she has right now. We give each other a kiss on the camera, but we can also just sit in relative silence. She is painting a lot and during one call when I was ill and quite weak, she just got on with that while I watched and relaxed. That was lovely.”Mark: ‘We haven’t told my daughter I’m back in the UK yet’“I travel a lot for work and had recently spent a month in New Zealand away from my family – but when it began to look like everything was shutting down I decided to catch a flight back to the UK so I wouldn’t be stranded.“After discussing it with my wife, we decided that it would be best if I didn’t come straight back to the family home and – as a precaution – I would spend two weeks in isolation. I was very lucky that a good friend had moved in with his girlfriend during lockdown and he kindly offered me his flat to stay in.“However, this meant telling my little girl, who is seven years old, that I was still away. Although she doesn’t totally understand everything about what is going on, she knows enough that she’s been scared of things she’s heard on the news and fearful of us getting ill. So my wife and I decided we didn’t want to worry her even more.“Every day I FaceTime her as I normally would when I’m away, and it’s been a real lifeline for me to be able to see how she’s coping and reassure her that I’ll be home soon. We even watched a film together and her mum made her popcorn just like when we have family movie nights. Doing my best to pretend that everything is normal is the right thing for her, and it helps me cope with this awful situation too.“It’s really difficult to be away from my wife and daughter, especially when this is the time you want to be close to the people you love most in the world. Hopefully one day, when this is all over, we’ll be able to laugh together about how Daddy was hiding in a flat around the corner when she thought I was calling from New Zealand.”Vodafone #KeepingtheUKConnectedWe know that now, more than ever, it is important for you to stay connected to your family.That’s why every day, we at Vodafone are working hard to maintain our network.

He’d even taken money from Mum, and I was upset that he could put her through so much stress – I just couldn’t bring myself to speak to him. But after chatting to Mum over the past couple of weeks and hearing that he’d been helping her with food deliveries while she’s been in isolation, I decided to reach out. I sent him a text first and then he called me and we chatted about coronavirus and how we’ve been coping – a few days later, he FaceTimed me and gave me a tour of his new flat that I’ve never visited. I’d wanted to reach out to him before, but I was struggling to know how, so while lockdown is a very weird situation, it gave us both an excuse to push our differences to one side.“I also realised that life is too short – if my mum could move past what had happened, so could I. In fact, I’m probably speaking to him more now than I ever did before.”Michael: ‘Lockdown made me realise what’s important’“My ex-partner and I split a year ago and we share a young daughter, but our relationship has been really rocky ever since we broke up. We’d fight all the time and nasty words would be fired back and forth at each other over text message. But when the lockdown happened, it really made me take a step back and think about what’s important.“I reached out to her via text and also sent her some money for petrol, as she is driving our daughter between our two houses during this time – I wanted to make sure she knew I appreciated that she was helping me to see my daughter. It has felt like a real turning point for us and our relationship and it’s a really positive outcome from a situation that is out of our control. Now my daughter is with me and I’ve been sending my ex-partner pictures and we’ve been having civil conversations. Without this happening, I don’t know if we’d have ever reached this point.”Jo: ‘I’m connecting with family members I haven’t spoken to in years’“We have an extended family WhatsApp group made up of the descendants of my grandparents, both of whom sadly passed away recently. We used to use it every so often to share pictures from when people visited them, but over the years as inidual families grew, and as my grandparents got more frail, we didn’t have the same opportunities to gather together. And for some of the family, my only contact was an annual Christmas card. Since everyone has been staying at home for the past few weeks, though, the group has blown up with almost daily messages – pictures of the great-grandchildren doing their home school work, baking or learning to ride bikes without stabilisers in abandoned car parks.“My mum and dad both work in the NHS, with more than 60 years of service between them, so everyone shared videos from the 8pm clap for the NHS in recognition. And my brother, who’s a musician, livestreamed a gig on Facebook and lots of the family who’ve never had the opportunity to see him play before got to watch. It’s really lovely to feel connected to everyone, particularly as the two people that held us all together are no longer here.”Vodafone #KeepingtheUKConnectedFamily has rarely felt more precious, nor has staying in touch with each other and the world.

But under lockdown, it’s always quietI live in the keepers’ lodge in London zoo. It’s a big shared house on site where eight zookeepers run a rota to care for the animals and man phones overnight. My mum loves telling people I live in Regent’s Park. I grew up in an animal-loving household. At one point there was me, Mum and Dad, two cats, two dogs, two rabbits, a hamster, a tortoise and a cockatoo, so it is normal for me to be surrounded by animals.After studying marine biology at university, I worked for the RSPCA, taking in injured seals and ducklings near the Norfolk coast. But I had always had my sights set on London zoo. For two weeks, I went there every day, handing out my CV to anyone in a suit until I got an interview. I started work as a zookeeper in November 2001.Eleven years later, I applied for it to become my home, too – a select group of experienced keepers are allowed to live on site in the lodge. It’s an experience like no other, and one every zookeeper wants. There’s a competitive interview process which includes vetting, problem-solving, and an assessment of your housemate credentials. It took me three attempts, but I eventually made the cut.The responsibility was scary when I first moved in. Tiny noises startled me. I didn’t sleep for a month, even with security on site. These days, though, I consider it home. Every morning I wake up at seven when our gibbon, Jimmy, starts singing loudly. I take a coffee into the garden and chat to the harrier hawks and the ibis in the aviary behind the house. We’ve hand-reared baby animals in our lodge. We took turns to feed our sloth, Edward, through the night when his mother couldn’t, and built him a jungle gym from broom handles. Beanie, a newborn giant anteater, lived with us, too.The best time is sunset, when the gates have closed. I’ll take a walk around and hear Bhanu, our male lion, roar and the ringtail lemurs crawl out and relax it sounds as if they’re chuckling.A keeper will say they don’t have favourite animals, but it’s a lie. Mine are small monkeys called emperor tamarins. I helped a pair breed a family of 10 by playing Barry White when I worked in the rainforest house.I’m on overnight duty three times each fortnight, which can involve sleepless nights: answering building alarms, administering medicine to animals or taking calls from the public. Sometimes they’ve found injured animals, which we refer on to the RSPCA. Occasionally someone says an animal has escaped but I’ve never known it happen. Once, the police called for advice when a bag of snakes was dumped outside a tube station.In normal times, I’m allowed to have friends over – as long as they don’t wander off – and we’re close to central London so I can go to the pub when I’m off-duty. My wife of two years lives down the road. When I’m not on duty, I’ll go to her or she’ll be here with me. When we got married, we took our guests around the zoo before opening time.Coronavirus has changed everything. On 21 March, the zoo closed to the public for the first time since the second world war, so it’s always quiet now. Some keepers moved into our overnight visitor experience lodges and about 50 staff are still working shifts. I miss answering visitors’ questions and showing off our animals. The pygmy goats miss being petted and are getting extra massages from staff. We’ve hidden food for the meerkats to find, and puzzles for the squirrel monkeys. The big cats are less fussed and enjoy the spring sunshine.We wear personal protective equipment to prepare food and activities. Colds have passed between humans and primates we’re unsure if coronavirus can, but it’s important to be safe.The animals are being well looked after but this is still a worrying time. The zoo is a charity, so entry tickets fund our conservation work, which filters through to scientists in the field. That’s all dried up now.Living and working here is an unusual existence but, at 42, it can’t get any better for me. I have animals in my back garden that are threatened or extinct in the wild. Even though we’re in lockdown, if I feel low I can stretch my legs and have a chat with a lion or an okapi. It’s a dream job. I couldn’t imagine doing anything else.• As told to Deborah Linton.Do you have an experience to share?

Cheap as it is to link a song potentially eight years in the making to this current moment, lyrics about time being elastic and needing love to soothe the roiling currents within happen to be the perfect thing for it.X weeks into lockdown and what have most of us got to show for it? A weird, yeasty smell (neglected sourdough starter, obv) and an intense familiarity with the back of the fridge. Meanwhile, Charli XCX is making a whole album from scratch. This first taste rattles like a metal shack haunted by a lovelorn sprite, a far more accurate rendering of the nation’s mental state than the corona-ballads doubtless to come.While you should probably question the judgment of someone trying to prove they’re not a Canadian one-hit wonder by emulating the sound of someone who pretty much failed to prove they’re not a Canadian one-hit wonder, Hideaway hitmaker Kiesza turns out to be extremely good at Carly Rae Jepsen’s brand of a) high-intensity earnestness, and b) taut chart pop straight out of 1986. And in this economy, who’s complaining?Speaking of one-hit wonders, Tones and I takes the wearying, serious artiste route with the follow-up to Dance Monkey. She’s savvy: singing about troubled children hitting back at their haters doubles as her own retort to anyone inclined to suggest that Rag’n’Bone Man will probably be wanting his big stomping boots and EDM basics patch back.Well, the sex man act worked out poorly for Liam Payne, didn’t it? Five months after his all-time stinker of a debut album, he has followed Bieber in pivoting to devotion, and boy, he’s a natural. “Time enjoyed wasted’s not wasted time,” he sings at his paramour, undoing his own, er, logic with a lyric that takes three times longer to understand as it does to sing. A perfunctory banger in every sense."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64d676195751f59d70f6c1efc5840565bcb9d8b4/0_288_4240_2544/master/4240.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d070ca789e8fa874136f7376ade41c81","title":"kirsty merryn our bright night review","story":"(Self-released)Merryn’s second album is full of pared-back, piano-led mood pieces, her voice a treat for the soulAs a spring like no other in our lifetime begins, Kirsty Merryn’s second album takes us into darkness. It begins at Twilight, literally, and moves us towards Dawn, taking in beaches, waterfalls, Westminster and ruined convents as we go. We encounter thieves, sailors and monks on the way. It all feels impossibly risque.The New Forest-born, London-based Merryn has been a dedicated explorer since her 2017 debut LP, She \u0026amp I, which comprised originals about neglected women in history, their stories constructed like folk narratives, giving them authority. But this is more of a mood piece, piano-led, every touch of a key like a warm breath on the neck, withan oakiness that recalls the early 70s solo albums of Sandy Denny. (It fits that Merryn supported Richard Thompson at the 2019 Sidmouth folk festival.)Contemporary subjects are never far from Merryn’s eye. The title track looks at women who lost sanctuary during the dissolution of the monasteries, urging: “Courage, sisters.” Mary is structured like a traditional courting song, but takes place in a near-future where seafronts have been tarmacked, and woods felled. Traditionals softly creep into the album’s edgelands, such as Outlandish Knight, in which a woman outsmarts her pursuer. Well-known folk regulars provide support throughout, including singer Sam Kelly, and Show of Hands’ Phil Beer.Merryn’s voice is also a balm for the soul right now, wide-open and heady. Her production offers spaciousness at times, it recalls Talk Talk’s more bucolic moments. Elsewhere, it often plays like more mainstream crossover record, softly delivering its bliss. You can imagine Merryn’s dreamy, mellow tones soaring over Radio 2 with no trouble at all.The intriguingly titled Muggington Lane End is the solo debut by Trembling Bells’ vocalist Lavinia Blackwall. Never a typical folk rock performer, Blackwall updates the late-60s sound of baroque chamber pop. Imagine songs veering off from the Village Green Preservation Society-era Kinks, delivered by a wayward, confident choirgirl. Eliza Carthy and Ben Seal’s Through That Sound (My Secret Was Made Known) sees folk regular Carthy delving into her love of wayward jazz. The Lute Girl’s late-night smokiness suits her particularly well. The Unthanks’ Diversions Vol 5: Live and Unaccompanied is also their most striking record yet, Rachel, Becky and Niopha Keegan’s voices bare, bruising and stark together on stage."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f8ac97c024b6042e0e81d8a73cd141a12e9a6744/279_352_3505_2102/master/3505.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=97c02afb9429ee114ca52a721b24d9bd","title":"niall horan lockdown listening thin lizzy dua lipa 5 seconds of summer one direction","story":"The former One Direction star talks about his love of Thin Lizzy, Dua Lipa and 5 Seconds of Summer – and how he’s writing songs about dating in lockdownI’m in London in my apartment, cooking – I’m making a Victoria sponge right now – and writing a lot: two songs yesterday. I had to cancel my tour, so I might as well go on the hunt for a big song. I started writing a Hey There Delilah-type one about when this is all over, called, well, When This Is All Over, and I was also writing about the idea of meeting someone without actually meeting them, and getting to know them because of this crisis. It’s an odd one: it’s actually a good way to get to know someone. Usually, say you went to a bar for a date, you’re probably drunk after five drinks and you forget everything you’ve learned about them. Now, you actually have time to ask questions. There’s no romances as of yet, but I wouldn’t mind if they started to blossom.I come in the kitchen every morning, put on the kettle, and straight away I’m listening to acoustic music. Me and my two cousins live together, so we listen to a lot of the same stuff – Ray LaMontagne, Damien Rice, Angus and Julia Stone, Chet Faker, DMAs, things like that in the morning.A lot of pop music, you wouldn’t sit down and delve properly into it. That’s probably quite an ignorant thing to say! But when it’s melody based and dance-y, you don’t always break stuff down and see what they’re talking about. So a lot of the new pop albums I’ve properly delved into: Dua Lipa, 5 Seconds of Summer, the Weeknd. His album is insane, incredible – everything he touches he turns to gold, but he’s written his best stuff now. Dua was like: “I wanted to make people dance but write really sad lyrics.” I was in a similar spot. I wanted a few uptempo songs and to have a laugh with it, but also disguising the sad lyrics in some fun stuff. And she’s done that so much. Don’t Start Now is the perfect example.The 5 Seconds of Summer boys smashed it this time. I’m not sure if they’d be pissed off at me for describing it like this, but their new album is like EDM punk-rock: they’ve got these drops, but they’re guitar driven. There’s a song called Best Years that has this really random, cool moment where it sounds like the Edge is playing: one of those Where the Streets Have No Name riffs.I’ve been doing this 30-day song challenge – name a song you like with a person’s name in the title, or a song from the year you were born. Thin Lizzy were on my list yesterday, with their song Sarah. This is a rock band in the 70s in Ireland, with a guy with a big afro, and it’s: “You came into my life and changed my world, my Sarah.” It’s storytelling, and very on the nose.I wouldn’t say I was a major hip-hop fan, but my cousin is a big fan of Aitch. I must live under a rock, but apparently that fella has been doing unbelievable things – he played me a few tunes that are really great. I’ve also delved deeper into the artists I love anyway: Fleetwood Mac, the Eagles, Crosby Stills and Nash, Tom Petty, Bruce Springsteen. When I sit down to sing a ballad or play the guitar, I’ll always play a Bruce-type melody. If I write with a pop writer, they always say my melodies lean in a bluesy, rocky way – I have that ingrained in me. But I don’t want to be a rebel either. I know there are people out there who want to hear certain stuff from me, so I like to put my own tinge on it.If I’d come out of One Direction and made a straight pop record I don’t think people would have been shocked at all, and it would have been the easiest thing for me to do. But I just don’t believe in it. I’m either going to put out something I love or not put out anything at all.It’s not the easiest music industry right now – it’s tough out there. The quality of music is so high, and quality artists are more prevalent than ever, like the Weeknd, Billie Eilish, Taylor Swift. You go to these award shows and you see the calibre around you and you’re like: fucking hell, I’d like to stay at this level. Pop is definitely at its best right now, and it’s good for everyone – it keeps you on your toes. I just have to hope that the next time I open my mouth and sing into a microphone it’s a good melody. That’s why I’m writing a lot now. I know the types of melodies I can write when I’m at my best – I just need to get to them. I’m going through the shit water to get to the clear water.• Niall Horan’s album, Heartbreak Weather, is out now."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff0bcbcb829219e4d069e711e0c1d6301986d019/280_8_3023_1814/master/3023.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=87308b6d8bfdf012918359698be33024","title":"taylor swift disowns new live album scooter braun big machine","story":"Singer complains of ‘tasteless’ release amid coronavirus crisis by former label Big Machine, owned by frequent adversary Scooter BraunTaylor Swift has disowned a new live album released under her name, calling it tasteless and “shameless greed” amid the coronavirus outbreak.The album, Live from Clear Channel Stripped 2008, was recorded when Swift was 18, around the release of her Grammy-winning second album, Fearless. The live album has been released by Big Machine, Swift’s former label that was bought by music manager Scooter Braun from its founder, Scott Borchetta. Swift has frequently criticised Braun and Borchetta – leading Braun to allege death threats from fans to his family – and is planning to rerecord and rerelease her six albums put out by Big Machine to regain some control over her back catalogue.In a post on Instagram, Swift said: “This release is not approved by me. It looks to me like Scooter Braun and his financial backers, 23 Capital, Alex Soros and the Soros family and the Carlyle Group have seen the latest balance sheets and realised that paying $330 MILLION wasn’t exactly a wise choice and they need money.”She added: “In my opinion … Just another case of shameless greed in the time of coronavirus. So tasteless, but very transparent.”Swift’s criticism of Braun has a long history. After he bought Big Machine, Swift accused Braun of “incessant, manipulative” bullying over the years via orchestrated feuds with his clients Kanye West and Justin Bieber, which Braun denied. She later claimed he was preventing her from performing her own music at US awards ceremony, which Braun also denied."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e46285aebe27b12c15ed82b49e1f74de18862520/0_96_1280_768/master/1280.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=486f46441ef4bb24e9cbe9c47eccda36","title":"toddler hears via magic of the internet inflight meals and a 36 hour bike ride","story":"Girl has implant switched on remotely, charity saves unused meals, and boy, 12, completes epic ride for NHSIn these challenging times, joy can be found in the most unusual places.

I cannot praise them enough really, the effort of the team - they were just brilliant and they made it happen. The possibility of Margarida calling me Mummy one day would mean the world.”Over a million frozen airline meals have been saved from going to waste after plans were announced to distribute them to people in need across Greater Manchester.The meals were preserved by Open Kitchen MCR after being labelled as “waste” following the cancellation of flights due to the lockdown.

Even if we were coming to the end of this pandemic by then, businesses will be not be prepared,” said Lowe, who described himself as optimistic that a free-trade deal could be done by the end of the year, albeit a poor one.This week’s talks centred solely on the future relationship. A separate strand of work is under way on the implementation of the withdrawal agreement signed off in January.Here is an overview of who is involved in the discussions and what areas are covered.Featuring Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, and Maroš Šefčovič, a European commission vice-president, the committee met for the first time on 30 March and will make decisions on recommendations made by civil servants who will staff six specialised committees.Those committees cover the Northern Ireland protocol citizens’ rights British sovereign army bases in Cyprus, the orce bill, Gibraltar and “other separation issues”. Who is on the committees, how often they will meet and precisely what they will be exploring has yet to be disclosed.The Ireland Northern Ireland specialised committee (INISC) will meet for the first time on 30 April. The Cabinet Office has confirmed that the INISC will be “comprised of official-level representatives of the EU and the UK” and will “meet as regularly as required to facilitate engagement between the UK and the EU on protocol implementation”.A working group will also be set up to feed into the committee. TheCabinet Office says it will act “as a forum for the exchange of information and mutual consultation” on implementation. So expect industry bodies and experts to be asked to submit to this group.The remaining specialised committees have not yet been scheduled.Thomas Lieflaender, the deputy head of the European Commission’s Brexit task force, is being tipped to lead the INISC along with a senior figure from the Northern Ireland office, possibly Andrew McCormick, the executive’s director general of international relations.One concern is that civil servants cannot make decisions on politically charged issues such as what checks will be conducted and where. Jess Sargeant, a researcher at the Institute for Government thinktank, said the INISC was likely to make recommendations to the joint committee. One urgent task is to look at what goods will be subject to tariffs when crossing the Irish Sea using data on trade journeys and the goods “at risk” of entering the single market by crossing the border into the Republic of Ireland.The location of border inspection posts for controls on goods crossing the Irish Sea has yet to be decided, unsurprisingly given Johnson has insisted there would be no checks. The EU would prefer posts to be located in places such as the ports of Liverpool and Cairnryan in Scotland.This is one of the most contentious areas and the EU has said there will be no deal unless agreed in outline by June. The chances of progress in this week’s talks have been hampered by the failure of the UK to issue a legal text giving detail to how it envisages its new status as an independent coastal state to work. The EU issued text for all areas but the UK issued a partial text. “This means the text the negotiating teams will be discussing is the EU’s text, not the UK’s,” a source said.Gove told parliament as recently as February that the UK needed an army of 50,000 customs agents to deal with cross-border trade from January 2021.

The situation is particularly dire for the millions of Brazilians living in densely populated favelas where physical distancing is almost impossible. But Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro doesn’t seem to be taking concerns over the virus seriously, accusing the media of “hysteria”. And he has clashed with Rio de Janeiro’s governor, Wilson Witzel, who has ordered the state’s 17 million citizens to stay at home – and off the city’s beaches.Helping in the effort to keep people safe and away from public areas is NudgeRio, a department in Rio’s city hall that uses behavioural science to influence people’s decisions. The team has helped produce messages to encourage people to stay at home, including a photograph of Ipanema beach with accompanying text that reads: “Rio’s landscape gives the hint. Let’s flatten the curve.”For the past week, city hall has been sending drones around the city with audio messages, created by NudgeRio, to remind people to avoid crowded areas and to wash their hands. “We have produced three messages so far, but will be doing more,” says Jose Moulin Netto, who set up NudgeRio in 2018. The team is also involved in a project to combat growing domestic violence, a global problem exacerbated by lockdown situations. Moulin says the team is considering developing an app with a panic button for women, as well as one for men to deter them from committing acts of violence.The nudge theory was put forward in a 2008 book of the same name by economist Richard Thaler and political scientist Cass Sunstein. One of Thaler’s insights is that people do not always behave in their own best interests. From this, he developed an argument that nuanced changes can trigger desirable shifts in behaviour for iniduals and society.The UK government’s early response to the pandemic was thought to be largely influenced by the behavioural insights team. But this was subsequently changed and, as Tony Yates, a former professor of economics at Birmingham University, pointed out in early March, the UK strategy was an outlier: “If the nudgers have got it right, why are so many other countries taking a very different view of the ‘science’?”Before coronavirus took hold, the four permanent members of the Rio team were working onchanging messaging to tackle flooding. In April 2019, Rio de Janeiro recorded its worst level of rainfall in 22 years, with storms that left 10 people dead. Monsoon rains impact poorer communities worst, especially those in favelas on steep hillsides. This year alone, about 150 Brazilians have been killed or are missing following heavy rains, landslides and flooding. Summer in the city is always “problematic”, according to Thais Miguelino, a spokeswoman for the Rio operations centre that monitors traffic, accidents and weather and manages crisis situations, including the pandemic. “We need to know how to communicate with people so they know what they need to do,” she says. “The idea is to change people’s thinking so we can save lives.”The centre wants to work out how best to use its social media channels to communicate messages that will encourage people to stay put and avoid travel during a storm, or advise them how to get to a place of safety. To do this, NudgeRio has created different personas, including a mother with a baby and an older person, and seen how they might react to events such as flooding or a landslide.“The rain in Rio is unpredictable and varies according to which region of the city you’re in,” explains Rafaela Bastos, a member of the NudgeRio team. “It’s very important that the population knows how to take decisions in certain situations, to be prepared and reflect on what to do with the information available.” Other NudgeRio projects relate to tax collection, school registration and reducing jaywalking and have led to savings. But the team faces challenges getting people to take nudge seriously and proving the impact of projects. “It’s hard to convince people and to get employees involved,” admits Moulin. Innovation in the public sector is always a challenge, he adds: “The public sector has to abide by certain rules. There are very specific definitions of what you can do. It’s so much harder.”There has also been criticism of the nudge approach. Sometimes it’s seen as a sticking plaster for gaping holes in public services that need more investment. Rio’s summer weather, for instance, has always been unpredictable, yet the same problems keep reappearing, suggesting a more structural approach is required. Moulin and the NudgeRio team acknowledge the pitfalls but remain excited by the potential impact. They cite a project with the city’s education department as an example. Every two years, the Brazilian government holds a national exam to measure the academic performance of public school students aged 10-11 and 14-15, with a mock test a month beforehand. Last year NudgeRio was asked to try to increase participation and students’ grades.“I can’t emphasise it enough,” says Moulin. “This message was sent at 7.30pm in the evening on the day before the exam and yet there was a significant increase in grades. I still get goosebumps when I think about it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/807b538573d19eac5591668374a744bb4fc3bb70/32_0_1798_1080/master/1798.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4bef8c3340c0bb107eab3b408d14e7b7","title":"nfl virtual draft television abc espn","story":"As a TV event, the NFL’s lockdown draft felt slapdash, a little weird and less eventful than those in recent years. It was also the first time in over a month things felt slightly back to normalThe first round of the NFL draft should have been a series of fireworks, owing as much to do with the wonky set-up the league found itself in. The mock run-through had been a veritable disaster – a spouse pulling a plug on a GMs computer, the technology chopping in and out, general managers struggling to fly solo in trying to figure out the technology and trade situations.Chuck a bunch of high-wattage, ready-to-go, star players, from high-profile schools at the most important positions in the game, and we should have been in for a broadcast that was equal parts exhilarating and weird.And then … blah. The draft went off, more or less, without a hitch, unless you happen to share a home with Aaron Rodgers. The technology worked fine. The broadcast networks did a commendable job of patching it all together. The teams sat and waited, no one was willing to mortgage their future to jump into the top 10 or shuffle up towards the top five with so much uncertainty over what the next season might look like.Given the downsized feel and general unease of the whole operation, there was a lack of zest running throughout the broadcast. Teams at the top of the board didn’t help their decision-makers were altogether too sensible. The quarterback-needy teams hoovered up the best signal-callers, while Oakland grabbed the quickest available receiver. The Patriots traded down, as they do.The first eight or so picks went off exactly as projected and had mostly been confirmed by the broadcast network’s own talent in the run-up to the first round. The only real action came when Oklahoma receiver CeeDee Lamb slipped to the Cowboys and the Packers traded up to grab Utah State quarterback Jordan Love.Things were supposed to ignite with the third pick, if not the fourth then fifth. Teams were calling about trades, we heard. ESPN’s cacophony of voices was happy to say Joe Burrow and Chase Young would be selected first then second, then the real fun would begin. But that anticipation was met with a collective pffft when everything ran chalk. Without that initial spark, everything fell a little flat.The virtual draft removed all of the excesses and indulgences that make the event so wacky and wonderful in the first place. ESPN leaned into the human interest side of things – understandable given current circumstances – but it left little room for talk of football or team-building or what’s next and stripped an awful lot of fun out of an event that is, objectively, ridiculous. Remove the hilarity of the thing and you’re just left with Roger Goodell delivering his best humanoid impression as he reads 32 names. It’s a little dry.Without an obnoxiously large stage and a crowd and the analysts all sat at a desk together, there was a loss of all of the pomp and circumstance that has come to make the NFL draft such a fun and funky show. The broadcast partners did their best to inject in some of that flavor, offering an overwrought serving of all things Americana. There were shots of a flyover, a musical crossover, and the flogging of anything and everything that could leave you with a hangover. Nobody does chest-beating then beer selling like the National Football League, pandemic be damned.The most interesting subplot of the night: evaluating the home décor choices of all of our main protagonists. Does so and so have an aquarium? I like Mike Zimmer’s fireplace. What’s on Bill Belichick’s book shelf? Is Jerry Jones making his picks from a $250 million mega yacht? Yes. Yes, of course he is. Is Jerry the only one practicing social distancing? I did not have that in the office pool.Why the main broadcast team didn’t have someone on to ponder these questions remains a mystery. A little color, a little fun would have been most welcome.It was left to Goodell to provide the levity. As always, he stole the show. Some standout moments:The draft, at its core, is about hoping and dreaming. Draft picks and prospects can be anything! Much of its entertainment value is in the discussion of football philosophies and economics and team building. But to work as a primetime TV event, it also needs all the bells and whistles – or to lean completely into the nerdy analyst stuff. Thursday night was a little slapdash, a little stuck in the middle, unsure what tone to take and when. And how could it not be given the circumstances?Regardless, for many, this writer included, Thursday was the first time in over a month that things felt slightly back to normal. This year’s first round was different, a little weird, and less eventful than those in recent years. But it was nice to just feel a little bit back."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c4c29607fc4e804f540514e9c7948d7f67d7179a/0_133_4002_2401/master/4002.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c43cc7c67d2abfe40a12d92b975df860","title":"zoom update security encryption bombing","story":"Company has struggled to meet security needs as user base has risen sharply amid coronavirus lockdownThe video-conferencing platform Zoom has released a new update this week in an effort to address an onslaught of security concerns surrounding the service.Zoom says the newest version of its app, Zoom 5.0, includes encryption and new privacy controls, updates that are part of a 90-day plan to improve security and privacy on the platform.“I am proud to reach this step in our 90-day plan, but this is just the beginning,” Eric Yuan, the company’s chief executive officer, said in a call on Wednesday. “We will earn our customers’ trust and deliver them happiness with our unwavering focus on providing the most secure platform.”Zoom has struggled to meet security needs as the platform has scaled up its user base to unprecedented levels in recent months.Since the coronavirus lockdown, Zoom’s daily active users shot up from around 10 million to 300 million as people use the platform for happy hours, work meetings, support groups and even funerals.Users struggled with persistent “Zoom-bombing”, a new kind of attack in which bad actors enter video meetings and shout slurs and threats in an attempt to disrupt them. Narcotics Anonymous and Alcoholics Anonymous meetings were targeted in particular.Zoom 5.0 will allow hosts to “report a user” to Zoom with a new security button and the app now defaults users to a “waiting room” feature, which requires participants to be approved to enter a meeting. All meetings will now require a password to enter.Zoom also added a new encryption standard, called AES 256-bit GCM encryption, which is considered the “gold standard” of encryption and is used by the US government to secure data.The change will help prevent meetings from being hijacked by hackers, said Thomas Hatch, the co-founder and chief technology officer of Utah-based software firm SaltStack.“The end-to-end encryption that has been introduced improves the liability that existed before where video conferences could be hijacked out of line,” he said. “This adds a much better layer of privacy that was not present before.”In addition to Zoom bombing concerns, the app had also received criticism over major bugs in recent months, including one that would allow a hacker to take full control over the user’s computer. To address these concerns, Zoom has beefed up its bug bounty program, incentivizing security professionals to alert them to bugs before hackers can exploit them.In a call on Wednesday, Yuan reiterated that Zoom will not sell user data. Zoom had been forced to clarify policies around data sale after a story from Motherboard at Vice revealed Zoom sends data from users of its iOS app to Facebook for advertising purposes, even if the user does not have a Facebook account.Zoom is not the only video conferencing platform, but it is easily one of the most popular. That is largely because of how easy it is to use, said Hank Schless, a senior manager at tech security firm Lookout.“The widespread use of conferencing solutions like Zoom shows how people are OK with putting convenience ahead of security,” he said. “Zoom got a lot of attention because users were not turning on many of its security settings. Despite that, they continue to log in every day because they assume the likelihood of being a victim is too low to affect them.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/696674319126a29d26d9e6ec4800049e222ec7d8/0_169_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=645\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e01e2c37e2b1a6441a7e576c6198e844 645w","title":"the best places to rock climb in the world in pictures","story":"We can only dream of travel and adventure right now, but a new book about the best climbs across the world might provide inspiration.

Think about whom that really benefitsOne consequence of Covid-19 is that we are now all being urged to hustle harder than ever. Isaac Newton discovered gravity and invented calculus while in quarantine, we are told. Shakespeare allegedly wrote King Lear on lockdown.I’ve received emails urging me to use the presumed downtime I now have to learn a new language, or to take a business course to more effectively monetize my photography skills. It seems like every second that I don’t put toward building a side business, making money from a hobby, or improving myself is in some way a second wasted.The pressure is convincing. I have at various points vowed to code a new website, study for every standardized admissions test I could potentially need to take in my life, train to bike nearly 500 miles across my home state, and reach the coveted inbox zero, in addition to doing my actual job.But then I stop myself and I wonder: who is “hustle culture” actually benefiting, and is this really the best way to be spending my free hours in isolation?The language of the hustle was embedded in the pre-corona world. Back when we could travel, hotels encouraged us to be more productive on vacation. The shared workspace company WeWork instructed us: “Don’t stop when you’re tired.” According to one ad that ran in London, sleep was for the weak. It’s no wonder these pressures are being felt more keenly now amid mass economic dislocation. I don’t necessarily blame the people peddling hustle culture, however – the fitness influencers trying to make a sale, or the economic advisers who suggest we cash in on any skill sets we have lying around to deal with the current financial insecurity.Glorifying the hustle is part and parcel of late capitalism, where dependable employment with benefits and a living wage feel increasingly out of reach. Many in my generation are far less likely to experience the kind of financial stability our parents did, despite working longer hours.The concept of the hustle helps reconcile these contradictions, and can be weaponized to justify income inequality in nearly any context, promoting an illusion that if you hustle hard enough, the playing field can be equal for you, too. So while the gig economy undermines worker protections and reinforces the expectation that every free second is monetizable, we scramble to assemble a collection of small side gigs to fill in the gaps. The emotional impact is profound. We live in a political and social climate where our sense of self-worth is often reduced to our productivity.I know all this, yet I’m no stranger to the side hustle. I have a full-time job working for the United Nations World Food Programme, but I also run a photography business, work as a freelance journalist, edit books, teach English, freelance as a translator, earn money as a bhangra dancer, and do policy research to supplement my income when I’m not on the clock.Here’s what I have to remind myself. Being more productive is actually made harder by the disruption in daily routines, or by having no way to escape from roommates or family. Many people have have spotty internet or cell service. And the constant barrage of confusing and overwhelming bad news can make us sick and exhausted, exacerbating underlying mental health conditions for those who have them. For women, new and unexpected childcare pressures and the new reality of having to prepare more meals at home make it harder to get work done.Acknowledging that we are all living in an impossible era with little, if any, extra free time is an important first step in breaking free of hustle culture, especially if you can laugh at the absurdity of it all.The next step is understanding that narratives around the wonders of constantly working primarily benefit a small group of bosses and investors who pocket the profits their workers create, rather than inidual workers, no matter how productive we are. The way so many institutions and employers have treated their staff in recent weeks only adds to this impression, as companies from Instacart to Trader Joe’s have failed to provide employees with hazard pay or adequate protective equipment for work in high-risk conditions. After doing all of that? Try getting involved in a network that addresses the problems with the systems of work and value we live under, like one of the thousands of mutual aid projects that have been organized from coast to coast.Even though hobbies may seem frivolous or non-essential at a time like this, taking space to do things that aren’t necessarily productive, or part of a pages-long to-do list, reminds us that there is more to our time on this planet than just getting things done.In the last few weeks, my favorite moments have included making a batch of homemade butter for the first time and getting my violin out after years in storage. I was reminded that in addition to a productive employee, I am also someone who loves to cook and who has a passion for music. I remembered that I am more than the economic value I generate, the perfect antidote to a lifetime of indoctrination otherwise."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d292c8666b5f56825313835ab305b8eaf02445ec/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=6fd9d3f09a2f00756d4b215a875a3caa","title":"coronavirus testing to be offered to england key workers and families","story":"Millions of workers and relatives will be able to book appointment online from FridayTesting for coronavirus is to be made available to millions of key workers and their families in England, with appointments to be booked online, the health secretary has announced.The system, unveiled at Downing Street’s daily press conference, involves a dramatic expansion of the people who can be tested for the virus, as the government continues to try to reach its target of 100,000 daily tests by the end of April.The government estimates that there are 10 million key workers in the UK who will be eligible for the swab test, which has previously been available only to health workers. The tests will also be offered to the families of key workers, and it is expected that the devolved administrations will follow suit.The health secretary, Matt Hancock, said: “We can make it easier, faster and simpler for any essential worker in England who needs a test to get a test.“Any essential workers who need a test will be able to book an appointment on gov.uk themselves directly. This applies for people in essential workers’ households too, who need a test. It’s all part of getting Britain back on her feet.”The main focus for tests, available from Friday, will be the antigen variety, which tells people whether they currently have the illness. Antigen swab testing can show medics what treatment a patient should receive and who should isolate and who is able to return to work.An antibody blood test showing whether someone has had the illness in the past, which some have argued is more useful, will be used by the government in its forthcoming survey of the disease.The government has so far been under fire for setting an ambitious target of 100,000 tests a day by the end of the month, while drive-through testing facilities have been shown to be underused and difficult for care workers to access if they do not own a car.Capacity currently stands at 51,000 tests a day. In the last 24 hours, 23,560 tests were carried out on 14,629 people.Professor John Newton, director of health improvement at Public Health England, who is coordinating testing, told the press conference that the government was on track to meet its 100,000 target.Contact tracing will be rolled out on a “large scale” with a new NHS app, Hancock said. If you are unwell, you can inform the app, which can let other people with it downloaded know that they have recently been in contact with someone with suspected coronavirus.To “kickstart” tracing, the government will hire 18,000 people, including 3,000 clinicians and public health experts, who will be trained over the coming weeks.The range of jobs classed as essential is extensive, and includes teachers and support staff, people in the justice system, charities, workers delivering key frontline services, transport workers and those working for local government.The process is free and results will be sent out by text, with a helpdesk set up to deal with queries.The shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, said Labour had consistently asked for a testing and tracing strategy. He said: “It is crucial that greater numbers of critical workers such as care staff are now able to access testing.“We will continue to hold the government to account for the promise it has made of 100,000 tests a day by the end of the month.”Teaching unions and school leaders have welcomed the announcement that school staff will be able to access coronavirus testing, with some calling it an essential precondition before schools are reopened.Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: “School staff have been on the frontline in the national response to coronavirus. We have been clear from the start that governments across the UK understand they must honour this effort with the appropriate level of support and safety.“If testing can be delivered effectively, then it will be welcomed by the education sector.”Kevin Courtney of the National Education Union said the immediate priority was for teachers who were self-isolating to get tested, and that so far the government had been slow to respond.The number of drive-through test centres will increase from 30 to 48 and the army will run 48 mobile testing units, which will be used to target care homes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5dce3d248d84607f0407955455eb4a27bbd61ab/0_246_5064_3038/master/5064.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ad79408df2e10177473a30856b48f84a","title":"from italian hotel to us state coronavirus lawfare takes hold","story":"Deluge of legal claims expected around world as people seek compensation for damage caused by negligence or misinformationAn avalanche of legal claims is about to descend on courts around the globe as people seek compensation for deaths and economic disruption caused by alleged failures to prevent the spread of Covid-19.An Italian ski resort hotel, the US state of Missouri and others have already announced actions, despite doubts that pursuing financial redress will succeed and criticism that it is a means of redirecting blame.The primary target has been China, reflecting widespread suspicions that Beijing failed initially to alert the World Heath Organization to the outbreak and suppressed evidence.Earlier this week, the attorney general of Missouri lodged a civil lawsuit in local courts against the Chinese government. The claim alleged that China arrested whistleblowers and concealed the contagious nature of coronavirus, leading to economic harm and loss of life in the US state.“The impact of the virus is very real,” said Eric Schmitt, the state’s attorney general. “Thousands have been infected and many have died, families have been separated from dying loved ones, small businesses are shuttering their doors, and those living paycheck to paycheck are struggling to put food on their table. The Chinese government … must be held accountable for their actions.”Class actions have already been filed in other US courts by private groups pursuing damages, with the aim of recovering trillions of dollars in compensation from China.“These lawsuits face significant legal challenges,” warned the London-based international law firm Volterra Fietta. “The US Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 strictly limits the possibility of suing foreign states and their agencies before US courts.“The principle of foreign state immunity is widely recognised in international law – the vast majority of states have enacted legislation that provides for sovereign immunity.”In Italy, a ski resort hotel in the Dolomites presented a subpoena to a local court seeking compensation from China’s health ministry for its loss of business. The hotel was fully booked for the season, including the period of 18-22 March, when the Alpine Ski World Cup had been due to take place.“The early and sudden closure led to disastrous consequences, including the dismissal of all staff and the cancellation of contracts with suppliers,” Marco Vignola, the lawyer representing the hotel, told Italian media.ONEurope Onlus, which organises projects to help immigrants integrate in Italy, has backed the action. Codacons, the Italian consumers’ association, is evaluating possible class action against the Chinese government through US courts.“Blaming China for our current predicament, now using legal means, is a reticence to take a harder road: local leaders accepting political responsibility for decades of undermining public health systems, while building a more socially inclusive and resilient global order.”The Chinese ambassador to the UK on Thursday dismissed the legal claims as reminiscent of 19th-century European colonial wars. “This disinformation about China covering up, about China hiding something – this is not true,” Liu Xiaoming said.“The Chinese government was transparent and very quick to share data. Some other countries, their local courts sued China – it is absurd,” he said. “Some politicians, some people, want to play at being the world’s policeman – this is not the era of gunboat diplomacy, this is not the era when China was a semi-colonial, semi-feudal society.”China is not the only target. The blizzard of legal activity includes claims by hundreds of tourists against local authorities in the Austrian ski resort of Ischgl, accusing the authorities of exposing the tourists to the virus. Austria’s consumer protection association alleges that the resort was kept open despite the risk to skiers.Günther Platter, the governnor of Tyrol state, has said all decisions were taken “together with experts on the basis of the existing knowledge”.In other contexts, commentators have devised the term “lawfare” to denigrate claims deemed to be misusing legal principles to pursue political aims through courts. Such accusations may surface in the months to come.While many lawyers around the world are enduring enforced idleness due to Covid-19 restrictions, they could soon be busy. Those sued may well invoke the legal principle of force majeure – that extraordinary events alter parties’ obligations.Apprehension over the scale of claims about to hit courts has already prompted the Medical Defence Union, which represents many UK doctors, to suggest that legal immunity might be granted to medics risking their lives during the pandemic.Several US states, including New York, New Jersey and Michigan, have adopted laws that provide healthcare professionals and hospitals with “immunity from civil liability for any injury or death alleged to have been sustained because of any acts or omissions undertaken in good faith” during the crisis.

I find that very puzzling.”Woolhouse said that while it was understandable that saving lives was the top priority, the idea of doing this at any cost was naive.“With any disease there is a trade-off. Public health is largely about that trade-off. What’s happening here is that both sides of the equation are so enormous and so damaging that the routine public health challenge of balancing costs and benefits is thrown into incredibly stark relief. Yet that balance has to be found.”Sridhar said the failure to fully consider the perspectives of experts beyond epidemiology may have contributed to misguided decisions. Models appear not to have factored in the role of hospital staff shortages, which may have erted attention from the urgent need for adequate personal protective equipment, she said.The concept of shielding the most vulnerable “looks beautiful” in models, she said, but in reality care homes are facing major outbreaks and multigenerational households are struggling to isolate the vulnerable. “You can’t take these people out of the system and isolate them as if they were a data point on a graph,” she said.“There’s a real problem if you have a collection of people from the same background, the same field, the same institutions that can lead to blindspots and groupthink,” Sridhar added. “Diversity is clearly important for better decision-making.”Some fear the prominence given to science in supporting political decisions risks burdening scientists with unrealistic expectations and could ultimately erode trust in their expertise.“The government isn’t using expertise simply to validate claims, it also appears to be using it as an insurance policy,” Prof Christina Boswell, a political scientist at the University of Edinburgh, wrote this week. “If things go wrong – and the curve gets too steep – it will be the scientific advice that is to blame.”Prof Chris Whitty: the truthtellerChief medical officers have a tradition of speaking their mind, often to the chagrin of governments. Whitty, however, has appeared to be in perfect harmony with the UK government at the Downing Street briefings on Covid-19. The reality is probably that ministers are in step with him – or even a step behind. On Wednesday, Whitty, a practising NHS consultant physician, told a starker truth than politicians have dared: that physial distancing needs to be in place until at least the end of the year.Sir Patrick Vallance: the political naifVallance has had a career in medicine at University College London and St George’s, University of London, researching vascular biology and endothelial cell physiology, and also in the pharmaceutical industry. From 2012 to 2018, he was president of research and development at GlaxoSmithKline, where, unusually for the industry, he advocated greater openness about innovation and partnerships with other companies.He left to become the government’s chief scientific adviser, but is not an instinctive politician. He was partly blamed for the government’s flirtation with the notion of herd immunity, saying in March that the strategy was to reduce the peak, not suppress it completely. “Also, because the vast majority of people get a mild illness, to build up some kind of herd immunity so more people are immune to this disease.” Afterwards it was denied he meant herd immunity should be the goal it was simply an outcome.Neil Ferguson: the workaholicFerguson leads the modelling behind the UK response through the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis, which he founded with colleagues at Imperial College. He has a long history in modelling epidemics, originally with Roy Anderson’s unit at Oxford University, where they worked on BSE, vCJD, foot and mouth, Sars and swine flu – sometimes attracting controversy.Ferguson is a mathematician, an epidemiologist and a workaholic who, before the lockdown, moved seamlessly between Downing Street, university and press briefings. Even while recovering from Covid-19 himself, he gave evidence to MPs and did interviews. His team’s work is at the heart of the lockdown strategy, predicting the numbers of deaths it will save.Dr Jenny Harries: the ‘national treasure’The deputy chief medical officer has been called a “national treasure” by Vogue, which may reflect the fact she is a rarity – a woman on the Downing Street briefings podium. With degrees in pharmacology and medicine, she joined Public Health England in 2013. Like her boss, Whitty, she is independent-minded, and she warned at the end of March that the lockdown could last for six months or longer. She also suggested couples living separately could “test the strength of their relationship” during the lockdown by moving in together.Prof Jonathan Van-Tam: the flu expertJonathan Stafford Nguyen Van-Tam is a widely published expert on influenza and the vaccines and antiviral drugs used to treat it. Now one of the government’s two deputy chief medical officers, he is regularly deferred to by Hancock. He spent four years in the pharmaceutical industry before returning to the public sector to head the pandemic influenza office of the Health Protection Agency, which is now part of Public Health England, and was a member of Sage during the 2009-10 swine flu pandemic. His grandfather Nguyễn văn Tâm was the prime minister of Vietnam in 1952.Prof Stephen Powis: the NHS’s defenderA kidney specialist, Powis is a professor of renal medicine at UCL and was the medical director of the Royal Free hospital until 2018. Now the medical director of NHS England, his job is to defend it against the threat of Covid-19. As such, his comments at Downing Street briefings have not always stuck to the medical need. With Michael Gove on 4 April, he criticised people sabotaging 5G phone masts under the illusion they were implicated in the spread of the virus. “I’m absolutely outraged, absolutely disgusted, that people would be taking action against the very infrastructure that we need to respond to this health emergency,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/74bb0f1eb07c1558f3bb9cdfc221c972c34dd728/0_182_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a3541f6e08475cf1eeac2e22410bfc2f","title":"tornadoes us south texas louisiana oklahoma mississippi","story":"At least six people were killed after severe storms tore through a number of southern states late on Wednesday, adding to weeks of extreme weather that had already killed more than two dozen people and destroyed hundreds of homes.More than two dozen tornadoes hit four states overnight.In Louisiana, a man was found dead after he lost his footing and was swept away by floodwaters.

Harvey has to take the lift to leave the building, which does not allow for social distancing.“When the lockdown first started, people were still cramming themselves into the lift. There must be people in the building who are shielding, who can’t get out at all because of the lift,” she said.“When our flats were built, they were aimed at single adults, but with the desperate need for social housing they’ve become homes for families, in buildings that were never intended for that. There isn’t a lot of space for young people to play,” she said. “There’s a resident garden with a notice saying no ball games.”Harvey and her son are two of many people in Britain living without their own access to green space. As the lockdown enters its second month, many are struggling without gardens or balconies to get fresh air and sunshine throughout the day. For them, the lockdown is a very different experience.“The current lockdown has created two classes of people : those with outdoor space and those that haven’t,” said David Nunn, 40, who lives in a second-floor flat in London. “If I had a garden over Easter I’d have been out there all day, having a BBQ, sunbathing, or gardening. For a lot of people living in cities, we don’t even have balconies. Once you’re inside your property, there’s nowhere else to go.”Nunn is considered to be at high risk of getting severe symptoms of coronavirus, so has been told to stay indoors for 12 weeks.“I can sit on the windowsill and the position of the sun in the late afternoon means I can dangle one leg out at a time,” he said. “That’s about it for my sunshine for now.”For many without their own green space, daily walks have become a lifeline.However, many parents are struggling to keep children exercised and entertained without gardens.“The gates on the local nature reserve have been closed, and all the local sports facilities have been shut down. Even the basketball hoops have been removed,” said Natasha Dunbar, who lives with her two daughters, aged 10 and 15, in a flat in Essex.Her youngest daughter, Jada, enjoys sport in school. “I’m getting on quite well, it’s been quite fun because I’ve been enjoying time with my family, but wish I had a garden and a bit of space, and a trampoline,” she said. “I really enjoy PE at school – I do gymnastics and swimming – and I miss it. A garden would give us more fun and exercise.”Epidemics of infectious diseases behave in different ways but the\u0026nbsp1918 influenza pandemic\u0026nbspthat killed more than 50 million people is regarded as a key example of a pandemic that occurred in multiple waves, with the latter more severe than the first. It has been replicated – albeit more mildly – in subsequent flu pandemics.How and why multiple-wave outbreaks occur, and how subsequent waves of infection can be prevented, has become a staple of epidemiological modelling studies and pandemic preparation, which have looked at everything from social behaviour and health policy to vaccination and the buildup of community immunity, also known as herd immunity.This is being watched very carefully. Without a vaccine, and with no widespread immunity to the new disease, one alarm is being sounded by the experience of Singapore, which has seen a sudden\u0026nbspresurgence in infections\u0026nbspdespite being lauded for its early handling of the outbreak.Although Singapore instituted a strong contact tracing system for its general population, the disease re-emerged in\u0026nbspcramped dormitory accommodation\u0026nbspused by thousands of foreign workers with inadequate hygiene facilities and shared canteens.Singapore’s experience, although very specific, has demonstrated the ability of the disease to come back strongly in places where people are in close proximity and its ability to exploit any weakness in public health regimes set up to counter it.Conventional wisdom among scientists suggests second waves of resistant infections occur after the capacity for treatment and isolation becomes exhausted. In this case the concern is that the social and political consensus supporting lockdowns is being overtaken by public frustration and the urgent need to reopen economies.The threat declines when susceptibility of the population to the disease falls below a certain threshold or when widespread vaccination becomes available.In general terms the ratio of susceptible and immune iniduals in a population at the end of one wave determines the potential magnitude of a subsequent wave. The worry right now is that with\u0026nbspa vaccine still months away, and the real rate of infection only being guessed at, populations worldwide remain highly vulnerable to both resurgence and subsequent waves.“I’m finding it hard, especially on days like today when it’s hot out,” Dunbar said. “We have the window open, and go for walks, but it’s not the same as having a private space. I don’t think people with gardens know how hard it can be … The government keep saying we’re all in this together, but we aren’t.”“It’s really difficult for anyone with kids, especially young kids, because it’s hard to explain why everything’s changed,” said Sarah, a single parent of a two-year-old son who lives in a flat without any outside space in Somerset. “The play park we used to go to twice a day is locked up, and my son can’t understand why.”“I know we shouldn’t, but we have to go out twice a day, in the morning and afternoon,” she said, adding that they are careful to avoid others. “My son wouldn’t manage with no outdoor space. On the days we didn’t go out twice, it’s been tantrums and screaming fits, and he doesn’t sleep properly. He’s too young for arts and crafts, he just isn’t interested.”“I have friends with paddling pools, and swings, in the garden. I’ve just got the telly. It’s not the parent I want to be, I feel guilty about that,” she said.The lack of space and contact with other adults is impacting Sarah. “We used to go to the park, have playdates, go to nursery. We don’t get to do any of that. I miss people, and human interactions. I’m a single mum by choice, so I planned lots of things, but never for a global pandemic,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2b6a508c29c975dc758fafacac9885b1a35a3448/298_0_6806_4084/master/6806.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c6d7cb14082fd8e10e13f10fb8903d2d","title":"austrian ibiza of the alps vows to ditch party tourism after covid 19 lockdown","story":"Ski resort that became European coronavirus hotspot plans to switch to a more ‘upmarket apres-ski culture’The Alpine ski resort of Ischgl, at the centre of Austria’s biggest cluster of coronavirus infections, has said it wants to move away from “party tourism” as it emerged from more than a month under quarantine.Ischgl is near the point where Austria, Italy and Switzerland meet and has described itself as the “Ibiza of the Alps”. It is now clear that more than 800 cases spread across Austria can be traced back to the resort and the surrounding Paznaun valley.In February and early March the virus found a breeding ground in crowded apres-ski bars. Hundreds of foreign tourists were infected in Ischgl and then unwittingly took the virus home with them.“We will question developments of the past years and, where necessary, make corrections,” Ischgl’s mayor, Werner Kurz, said in a statement issued by the tourism authority for his town and the Paznaun Valley, which on Thursday came out of a quarantine imposed on 13 March.Kurz said the town’s image as a party destination was unfair because that was just a small part of its offering, but he said he would work with local businesses to make changes.“That means more quality and less party tourism, prioritising skiers and fewer day-trippers on buses who only come to party,” the tourism authority said. “We are also thinking with all businesses about what an upmarket apres-ski culture can look like.”Iceland declared Ischgl a risk area on 5 March after tourists returning from the resort were found to have been infected, but the provincial government of Tyrol, which includes Ischgl, responded by saying they probably caught the virus on the plane home.The first concrete measure was taken on 9 March, when a bar was closed after one of its barmen became the first person in the town to test positive, on 7 March. The resort remained open until 13 March.Tyrol’s Governor, Guenther Platter, has acknowledged that mistakes were made, and the national government has said there would be a review of what went wrong.

The month of fasting and reflection, which has begun with the sighting of the crescent moon, will be observed by the world’s 1.8 billion Muslims mostly in private.Mosques will remain closed to evening prayers and feasting will become a more intimate affair, within the confines of family homes. Large public banquets, provided by authorities, or benefactors, have been outlawed in much of the Islamic world, where curfews and lockdowns remain rigidly enforced.Over the past two months, Muslims in the Middle East and other parts of the world have become accustomed to a variation on the call to prayer, caused by state restrictions on social gatherings. From mosques across the world, the familiar summons “come to pray” has been replaced by “pray at home”. And with the arrival of the year’s most sacred month, the ban on getting together has become more pointed.“I’m not really looking forward to fasting this year, said Firas Mahmoud, a resident of the Lebanese capital Beirut. “It’s in spring this year, which is better than the last nine years of summer, but having no one to break the fast with, it feels like suffering. It feels flat.”Ahead of the fast there was even discussion about whether going without sustenance for much of the day might have an effect on immunity – , and hence people’s capacity to fight off Covid-19. However, with no clarity about whether this is the case, and evidence to support the contrary – that fasting may in fact be beneficial – the premise of this year’s Ramadan remains unchanged.“The mosques will remain virtually closed the usual charity meal tables will be absent from the streets and the frequent family socialising associated with Ramadan will be suspended.”Ramadan under lockdown is the antithesis of the festival. However, as Covid-19 took hold in the lead-up to the fast, religious authorities and governments were determined to ban congregational activities – a move that could deny the impoverished more than the chance to fraternise. Charity is also an important part of the month, with cash, food and other donations regularly given to those with few means to afford them.Mosques across the Middle East and North Africa – in Egypt Tunisia, Morocco, Algeria, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Jordan, Iraq and the United Arab Emirates – have largely been shuttered throughout the crisis and will not offer shelter or seclusion to those fasting this year.With global travel grinding largely to a halt, supply lines have also suffered and there are fears that food may be in short supply in some areas. “This is the first time we’ve had to worry about that,” said Bashar Abu Samra, from the northern Lebanon city of Tripoli. “A scarcity of food during Ramadan. Can you imagine?”Some states have amended their curfew times to make it easier for people to shop during fasting hours. The virus has even taken a toll on traditional Ramadan TV fare, with distancing disrupting filming in the run-up, leaving shows unfinished. Clerical bodies meanwhile have encouraged families to embrace this year’s restrictions by focusing on intimate family members.In a statement earlier this month, Egypt’s Grand Mufti, Shawki Allam, said: “We must look to the positive aspects during these exceptional times that have compelled many people to be quarantined in their homes and turn this into an opportunity for bonding and forgiveness and restoring the spirit of serenity and cooperation.”In north-west Syria, where the fasting may at least put a stop to relentless war, Ahmad Mustafa, a shopkeeper in Idlib, said the month was still welcome. “Everybody can pause to see where they’re at. The world needs to change. And maybe this time it will happen for real.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc24f97344d879fc311ec250db5b5fac313caa32/0_87_3000_1799/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=67a0032e38bc3e460316c3f2852d3226","title":"key workers official list england who can now be tested for coronavirus","story":"Health secretary expands criteria to include all essential workers and their families in EnglandThe health secretary, Matt Hancock, has expanded the criteria for who qualifies for a free test for coronavirus to all essential workers and their families in England – up to 10 million people.

Self-ruled Taiwan has lost seven allies since 2016 when president Tsai Ing-wen was elected.The move came as China has increased its focus on the Pacific and sought to peel off Taiwan’s allies in the region.Kiribati is thought to be of interest partly due to its location – some islands are just 700 km from US military installations – and also due to Christmas Island, the world’s biggest atoll with a land mass of nearly 400 sq km. It lies just 2,150 km from Honolulu, home of the US Pacific Command and is far to the east of existing port facilities available to the Chinese navy.The lightly populated island already has a giant deepwater pier and a spare runway, and its lagoon could easily be turned into a port, experts say.“The Chinese could design the project as being intended for cruise ships, and incrementally turn it into a dual-use facility that could service Chinese warships,” said Patrick Buchan, who tracks China at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.James Fanell, a former director of intelligence of the Pacific Fleet, agreed. “It’s reasonable to think they will be helping renovate port facilities and airfields in order to help the country develop,” he said. “But having Chinese ships pull in at the big pier would be clearly threatening to Honolulu, no question.”The leader of the party that broke away from the government over its handling of the switch, Banuera Berina, is expected to be more sceptical in his dealings with China and to take a hard line against accepting loans. He and Maamau are expected to run in presidential elections due in June.Berina said that despite being the chairman of the ruling party when the diplomatic flip took place last fall, neither he nor a number of ministers were informed of what he later concluded were secret negotiations with the Chinese that must have gone on for months, if not years.He recalled that when the president gathered the backbenchers and cabinet members to announce the switch as a fait accompli, several members protested that Taiwan and its ambassador were widely perceived as helpful and generous in their districts, and they feared losing their seats.“But the president assured us we shouldn’t worry about that because we would be getting campaign money from China,” he said. “I was shocked.” Maamau has denied he ever said that he did not respond to requests for comment.Benuera said the president had told the backbenchers that he made the switch because President Tsai Ing Wen had not proven to be a reliable partner. Maamau allegedly said Taiwan repeatedly ignored requests that it contribute to Kiribati’s Vision 2020 development plan, centered on tourism and fisheries, notably by buying Kiribati a $30m Brazilian airliner. In March, when Tsai went on an official tour of the region, she also failed to visit Kiribati, which the government denounced as a snub.“Based on my knowledge of Taiwan politics,” said Natasha Kassam, who analyses Indo-Pacific strategy at the Lowy Institute in Sydney, “there’s almost no scenario in which Tsai would have skipped a visit to Kiribati when in the region except for one where Maamau wasn’t willing to entertain her.”Banuera said he broke with Maamau when he found out from Taiwanese sources that in fact Tsai had been very eager to visit but was told it couldn’t happen because Maamau would be in Fiji at the time.“The Taiwanese first offered to charter a plane so Maamau could get back in time, and when he refused, they even offered that President Tsai pick him up in Fiji on her way to Tarawa,” he said.The Chinese foreign ministry was contacted for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c4b19d0544f29ecec4b4db7011fe080f5c242a74/0_493_4133_2481/master/4133.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=57cf1c8f08844fa79af996b79159b744","title":"royal navy submarine captain investigated over rave barbecue","story":"Film showed sailors dancing in dockyard despite lockdown, after return from patrolThe captain of a nuclear-powered submarine is under investigation after being filmed having a “rave-themed barbecue” in a Plymouth dockyard.Cmdr John Lewis, the captain of HMS Trenchant, a nuclear-powered attack submarine based at Devonport naval base, has been sent home on leave. He could face dismissal from his role over the incident earlier this month.Footage of the crew showed sailors dancing and laughing, and a source told the BBC some were drinking alcohol.The submarine had been on patrol before having to return to Devonport for repairs. The crew were expected to stay with the submarine in isolation while the repairs were completed.The Royal Navy has placed Lewis under “administrative investigation” over concerns about his judgment.It is alleged that Lewis ignored instructions from his superiors not to approve an impromptu social event when his boat arrived at the naval base.The crew had reportedly been on a mission for several weeks but instead of returning home they were told to remain in quarantine.Footage of the party was first shared on a blog on Forces Compare, an independent search engine to compare insurance quotes. It was subsequently shared among military personnel on other social media sites, including WhatsApp and Facebook.Epidemics of infectious diseases behave in different ways but the\u0026nbsp1918 influenza pandemic\u0026nbspthat killed more than 50 million people is regarded as a key example of a pandemic that occurred in multiple waves, with the latter more severe than the first. It has been replicated – albeit more mildly – in subsequent flu pandemics.How and why multiple-wave outbreaks occur, and how subsequent waves of infection can be prevented, has become a staple of epidemiological modelling studies and pandemic preparation, which have looked at everything from social behaviour and health policy to vaccination and the buildup of community immunity, also known as herd immunity.This is being watched very carefully. Without a vaccine, and with no widespread immunity to the new disease, one alarm is being sounded by the experience of Singapore, which has seen a sudden\u0026nbspresurgence in infections\u0026nbspdespite being lauded for its early handling of the outbreak.Although Singapore instituted a strong contact tracing system for its general population, the disease re-emerged in\u0026nbspcramped dormitory accommodation\u0026nbspused by thousands of foreign workers with inadequate hygiene facilities and shared canteens.Singapore’s experience, although very specific, has demonstrated the ability of the disease to come back strongly in places where people are in close proximity and its ability to exploit any weakness in public health regimes set up to counter it.Conventional wisdom among scientists suggests second waves of resistant infections occur after the capacity for treatment and isolation becomes exhausted. In this case the concern is that the social and political consensus supporting lockdowns is being overtaken by public frustration and the urgent need to reopen economies.The threat declines when susceptibility of the population to the disease falls below a certain threshold or when widespread vaccination becomes available.In general terms the ratio of susceptible and immune iniduals in a population at the end of one wave determines the potential magnitude of a subsequent wave. The worry right now is that with\u0026nbspa vaccine still months away, and the real rate of infection only being guessed at, populations worldwide remain highly vulnerable to both resurgence and subsequent waves.A source quoted in the the Times described the party as a “rave in the dockyard” and went on to defend the event.The former naval officer said: “This really comes down to the nature of the order to not do it. If it was ‘you will not’ then that’s one thing. If it was more of a ‘do you think this is a good idea?’ then that’s another. But he’s been in a cramped submarine, just off patrol and they can’t go home. I know where most sympathy is going to lie.”A Royal Navy spokesman said: “An investigation is under way. It would be inappropriate to comment further.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/afcf923802ff34c7a5c528f2877e618d6f695736/0_196_2790_1674/master/2790.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f3415be1cd27f7e96e2e69c97f747f9c","title":"share your experiences of expanded coronavirus testing in the uk","story":"If you have applied or been offered an appointment we’d like to hear from youAll essential workers in England and their families will be able to book an appointment for a coronavirus test from Friday.We would like to hear from you about your experiences.

Photograph: Sean GallupGettyElectric vehicles (EVs) in circulation in Europe emit three-times less carbon dioxide on average than petrol and diesel cars once the impact of driving, power generation and battery production are factored in.That is the conclusion of the green NGO Transport \u0026amp Environment (T\u0026ampE) in a study which took into account “all possible criteria” to make the comparison, including when electricity is produced or fuel is burnt, as well as raw materials used in making batteries.Critics of EVs contend that when their full carbon footprint is taken into account they deliver negligible emissions savings compared to conventional cars. But T\u0026ampE’s study backs other research showing this is not the case with EVs still emerging as the much greener option even when the full carbon footprint is considered.It has also developed a tool that compiles all the most up-to-date data on CO2 emissions linked to the use of an electric, diesel or petrol cars – including the impact of particular models.“We have taken into account all possible criteria such as the amount of CO2 emitted when electricity is produced or fuel is burnt, as well as the carbon impact of resource extraction for batteries or of building a power plant,” explained T\u0026ampE’s transport and emobility analyst Lucien Mathieu.“We find out that electric cars in Europe emit, on average, almost three times less CO2 than equivalent petroldiesel cars.”In the worst case scenario, an electric car with a battery produced in China and driven in Poland still emits 22 per cent less CO2 than diesel and 28 per cent less than petrol. “And in the best case scenario, an electric car with a battery produced in Sweden and driven in Sweden can emit 80 per cent less CO2 than diesel, and 81 per cent less than petrol.”“We also see that electric cars will reduce CO2 emissions four-fold by 2030 thanks to an EU grid relying more and more on renewables,” he added.“This tool puts to rest the myth that driving an electric car in Europe can be worse for the climate than an equivalent diesel or petrol. It’s simply not true,” Mr Mathieu said. “If European governments are serious about decarbonising during the crisis recovery, they must speed up the transition to EVs.”The tool will be updated as new data is available, he confirmed.

Photograph: LivelineA 47-year-old man who contracted coronavirus and whose family was told he only had 24 hours to live has recovered from the illness and his medical records will now be used for research to help treat the virus worldwide.Mark Burke, from Co Wicklow, was in ICU in St Vincent’s Hospital, Dublin, for four weeks. He developed a problem with his bowels, his lungs were failing, and medics believed he would not survive. His family were told to say goodbye to him.Mr Burke’s wife and children dressed in PPE and went to say goodbye to him while he was in ICU.“When the kids walked in, he opened his eyes he heard their voices. If you saw it in a movie, you wouldn’t believe it. You would think that it is so far fetched. He’s in a coma, he’s not coming out of it. He was in double organ failure, his lungs had failed him, his bowels had failed him, but when he heard his children, he opened his eyes and the nurses were witness to that.”Mr Burke’s family returned home and awaited a call from the hospital to update them on his condition.However, the father of four who had no underlying medical condition survived the next 24 hours, and medics began to provide him with various medications in a bid to improve his bowels to the point where they could operate on him.“They said he had a 5 per cent chance of regenerating enough of the bowel to stabilise him enough for the operating theatre. And it did happen,” Ms Burke said.“On the following Wednesday, they decided right he’s lasted Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday - four days - and he didn’t deteriorate. He didn’t improve, but he didn’t deteriorate. That was shocking them.“They kept saying why is he not going into multi-organ failure”, why is he still with us? They couldn’t understand it. They said right, we’ve secured him enough, we’ve stabilised him enough. We were absolutely thrilled. We’re just so overjoyed with the outcome.”Mr Burke underwent surgery, made a full recovery and is now back at home with his family.Mr Burke said he “can’t imagine” what it was like for his family.“I don’t know how they did it. I personally think if I was in Joanne’s shoes, I would have caved,” he said. “I’m doing good. I’m in recovery mode. From my perspective, what they did for me in ICU is absolutely out of this world.”He added that his medical records are being released to “every medical board across the world” for research purposes.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4236815.1587716143!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"simon harris says behaviour over next 12 days is crucial","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for health Simon Harris during a press conference at the Department of Health on April 11th. Photograph: Brian LawlessPA WireThe Government will have greater options concerning coronavirus restrictions by May 5th if people continue to follow current measures closely, the Minister for Health has said.Simon Harris said the next 12 days matter and that people needed to concentrate on the present.“These next 12 days or thereabouts, between now and May 5th – you know there’s lots of speculation about what might happen then, including by people like myself, but we actually need to concentrate on the here and now,” he told RTÉ.“I need people at home to know that these next 12 days matter, because the more we can suppress the virus, the more headroom, for want of a better phrase, that we actually give ourselves in terms of options.”On Thursday, the deaths were announced of another 28 people who had been diagnosed with Covid-19, alongside a significant spike in diagnosed cases of 936. This brought the laboratory-confirmed death toll to 794 and the number of confirmed cases to 17,607.Ruairí Brugha, professor of epidemiology and public health medicine at the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI) warned on Friday morning that “we’re looking at the long haul” and that “we’re not going back to normal” with regard to hygiene and physical distancing.Speaking on Morning Ireland he also warned that if restrictions are eased “in a phased way” it is up to the public to take responsibility for their behaviour.“It is not enough to have four fifths of us taking responsibility. It takes only a small number behaving in a celebratory manner … I takes only two to three per cent behaving in an irresponsible way and the virus will jump up again.Prof Brugha said that Ireland will need to know “that we can manage the risks.”“If we don’t have a proven testing and tracking system, we won’t be in a position to risk new cases in the community.”The head of medical affairs with a company that manufactures vaccines also warned that it is difficult to put a time frame on the development of a vaccine for Covid-19.Jon Barbour, of GSK Ireland said developing a vaccine is a very challenging process and in some cases can take up to 10 years.The great challenge now is to come up with an effective vaccine in a shorter time. It was unprecedented that researchers, academics and the pharmaceutical industry around the world had come together to find a vaccine, he said.This level of global cooperation was unprecedented. “It’s a complex process with many working together”, he said. Experts agreed that a time frame should not be put on such efforts, but “typically it could take 12-18 months”.Mr Barbour also warned that as with the flu virus mutations were likely to happen. Because this was a new virus there was no natural immunity in humans.“All this is hypothetical,” he added.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4236460.1587673724!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"eu members expect weeks of talks on budget and recovery plan","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEuropean Commission president Ursula von der Leyen and European Council president Charles Michel after the video-conferenced EU summit. Photograph: Olivier HosletReutersWeeks of further talks are expected to try to bridge differences among European Union member states over how to fund the bloc’s budget and a recovery plan to counter the deep economic downturn caused by the coronavirus pandemic.The 27 leaders of the EU did not put out a joint statement after meeting over video conference on Thursday, which diplomats blamed on both the difficulty of the format of being unable to meet in person, and the extent of isions between the governments.They rubber-stamped a prior agreement by finance ministers to allow member states to seek support from the EU’s bailout fund, and for a package of loans to be made available for businesses from June.\u0026nbspBut the most contentious matter of how to pay for a recovery fund and what form it should take was given over to the technical experts of the European Commission for detailed development.\u0026nbspThere was broad agreement that the recovery plan should be linked to the bloc’s budget, and Germany signalled it was willing to increase its funding to give it more firepower to combat the slump.The heads of the European institutions said a large increase was required to fight a downturn “unprecedented in modern times”. “We are not talking billion, we are talking trillion,” said European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen. She noted that the economic damage of the pandemic would not be evenly felt across the EU, and warned that unless strong action was taken it would increase economic imbalances between weaker and stronger economies in the union.National priorities But several countries warned their approval would depend on how the contentious details are worked out. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said he had argued for “urgent financial support for farmers”. This reflects Ireland’s long-held position of protecting EU farming payments in budget talks, and is just one example of how national priorities will need to be balanced in order to agree a coronavirus recovery plan if it is linked to the EU budget.There is a broader philosophical difference over funding between members, and it breaks down roughly into two camps. The “frugal” states, including the Netherlands and Sweden, resist paying extra into the EU budget. They oppose taking on shared debt to fund the recovery, and believe that assistance to struggling states should be in the form of loans that must be paid back.The other side of the argument is represented by states such as Italy and Spain. They have called for swift and dramatic action to counter the deep impact of the pandemic, which has worsened the precarious state of weaker economies, and have called for assistance in the form of grants rather than loans that would further increase their debt.Ahead of the conference, nervousness on financial markets had pushed up the cost of borrowing for Italy, leading to concerns that urgent action was needed to prevent deepening of its financial trouble.Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte said work would continue but for now enough had already been agreed by finance ministers to avoid “acute financial problems”.But Greek prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said help should come in the form of grants – and quickly. “Europe must not once again do too little, too late,” he warned.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons april 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Can I see separated parents or move house during lockdown?

They are just excited to see their friends - even if playing with each other again comes with a whole new set of rules.Standing in the playground of Logumkloster School, in the south of the country, 10-year-old Zakarias Al-Tibi complained: “We usually jump and hug and fight and give each other high fives. But we can’t do that anymore.”When Denmark’s nurseries and primary schools were given permission to re-open on April 15, with over-12s remaining at home for now, it came with a list of government instructions designed to minimise the risk of children spreading the virus amongst each other.Class sizes have been cut by half and the children must wash their hands as soon as they arrive, and every two hours after, play outside in small groups and sit at desks and tables at least two-metres apart.At the same time they are not allowed to bring toys from home and the nurseries or school’s own toys and equipment has to be disinfected twice a day, along with surfaces such as sinks, toilet seats and door handles.Parents are asked to drop their children off at the front gates in a staggered system and cannot themselves enter buildings, leaving any change of clothes that might be needed outside. All this is putting a strain on the teachers who are required to make sure their charges follow the rules.“Every time you look around, the kids are touching each other,” said one teacher. “How many times can you tell them off for that?”Denmark was one of the first countries in Europe - after Italy - to impose a strict lockdown and its relaxation of restrictions came after the number of new daily infections began to fall from a high of 390 on April 6.Understandably there has been some anxiety among parents being asked to take part in this experiment.One mother of two, Sandra Andersen, drew 40,000 followers after setting up a Facebook group called ‘My kid is not going to be a Guinea Pig’. But after a fews days it appeared that by issuing clear instructions for children and adults to follow the authorities had won over the trust of most parents and attendance rates are back to 90 per cent in many schools.Responding to a survey by Denmark’s English language newspaper The Local, a parent named Maria wrote: “The video provided for the kids by the health authorities was a very good and positive way of explaining how things will be different, but fun and safe.But she confessed to mixed emotions at waving goodbye to her 6-year-old at the school gates, after weeks spent social distancing at home.My girl has been happy about the idea of being with her friends wrote Maria. We adults feel that this is a step we need to do, but not without concern and contradictory feelings. “After being so careful about distances, isolation, cleaning, and avoiding others, it feels a big step to \u0027get out\u0027 again. Schools are not the only places to be given the green light for a return to an altered form of normality.In a move which Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen described as “walking a tightrope”, hairdressers were given permission to reopen on Monday, alongside beauty salons, tattoo parlours (see picture below) and spa clinics. Sports not involving contact, such as golf and tennis, were allowed from Tuesday.The result was predictable enough in a country where people have been kept indoors for over five weeks. Denmark’s 5,000 hair salons and beauticians are now said to be working flat out.Connie Mikkelsen, President of the Danish Hairdressers and Beauticians Federation, told The : They are very, very busy right now. They are working long hours every day.”Here too there are strict social distancing and hygiene guidelines to follow.Like many of Denmark’s parents Ms Mikkelsen is putting her faith in the ability of the country’s authorities to negotiate a way out of the lock down without inviting a second deadly wave of COVID-19 cases.“If you obey the rules, I don\u0027t think it\u0027s dangerous,” she said. “I\u0027m sure they wouldn\u0027t have given us permission to open up if it was dangerous.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 24th april 2020","story":"Bocketts Farm in Leatherhead, Surrey, UK, are showing their appreciation for NHS heros and other key works by changing the spray paint markings on newborn lambs to rainbows for \u0027Clap For Our Carers\u0027.

A day after the press conference, Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser, gave a television interview suggesting 60 per cent of people would need to become infected to protect the population. Yet after Imperial College modelling suggested such a mitigation strategy could result in 250,000 deaths, the Government made a rapid volte face, imposing strict social distancing measures and closing businesses and schools on March 23.The impact of such extreme suppression means a second peak, far higher than the first, is now a near certainty – and that has major implications for how Britain must exit the lockdown if such a catastrophe is to be avoided.  Here is what we know about a second wave and how it impacts the future:In the first graphs shown by Mr Johnson in March, squashing the sombrero would cause the first peak to come towards the end of May. The rounded peak appeared to be about half the size of that expected if the disease was left to run rampant through the population.Under that scenario, the NHS would be able to cope and the virus would not present a problem later in the year. Sir Patrick told journalists: We want to… not suppress it so we get the second peak and also allow enough of us who are going to get mild illness to become immune to this to help with the sort of whole population response, which would protect everybody.However, under the current suppression plan, the trajectory of the disease has changed dramatically, with the peak moving to the middle of December. Alarmingly, it appears every bit as high and deadly as the unmitigated wave the Government was so keen to avoid. Although experts believe we have now peaked in the first wave, that is actually only a very low level of what could happen if lockdown is lifted without any means to suppress a second, far more deadly wave. Professor Neil Ferguson, of Imperial College, who led the modelling and sits on the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) said: There is almost no herd immunity and a very large risk of a second peak if we relax current measures without something to put in their place.One of the problems of Britain\u0027s lockdown strategy is just how effective it has been. Suppression modelling was based on all households reducing contact outside the household, school or workplace by up to 75 per cent. Workplace contact rates were to reduce by 25 per cent. On April 13, the Government released its first graphs showing how the public was complying with the lockdown. Workplaces were down 54 per cent, and retail and recreation down 85 per cent.Likewise, people appear to be doing better at self-isolating than was expected. It was assumed that just 70 per cent of people with symptoms of coronavirus would stay at home as instructed, but research by health experts Evergreen Life showed that, in most areas of Britain, more than 90 per cent are complying and even in the worst areas 75 per cent are still staying put.Although the modelling predicted that all schools would shut, it assumed 25 per cent of universities would remain open.Data published by the Department for Education this week showed that less than one per cent of children are going to school every day despite estimates from ministers that the amount would be up to 20 per cent. Likewise, it was thought that 50 per cent of people diagnosed with coronavirus would stay in quarantine for 14 days. Yet there is little evidence of people breaking quarantine, and powers of arrest have now been given to police to stop it from happening.A small study from the Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine found people had cut contacts by around 73 per cent, roughly in line with Government expectations.While such compliance has been excellent at keeping the virus under control, leading to a noticeable downturn in cases in the past week, it means few people are building up immunity.In the critical Imperial Paper, published on March 16, scientists warned that once restrictions were relaxed infections would inevitably begin to rise again and the bounce-back would be far worse if suppression was too extreme.The more successful a strategy is at temporary suppression, the larger the later epidemic is predicted to be, in the absence of vaccination, due to lesser build-up of herd immunity, the researchers warned.Experts on the Government\u0027s Sage committee now believe that only about five per cent of the population has been infected with the disease and that there is almost no herd immunity in Britain.Under the Government’s mitigation strategy, the reproduction, or R number, would reduce dramatically, but not to below one, so cases would rise, but only slowly, until hitting a peak.Under the suppression strategy, the reproduction rate falls from around 2.6 to below one and the virus dies away. But reducing infections now can store up problems for the future. The Government is carrying out a testing programme to determine how many people in Britain have recovered from the disease and work out current immunity level, but so far it has not published the findings.Several studies have now put it at roughly six per cent, and new results this week from the The Pasteur Institute show just 5.7 per cent of people in France will have contracted coronavirus by the time the country starts lifting lockdown next month.The institute researchers warned of the high risk of a second wave unless drastic social distancing is maintained.Karol Skiora, a private oncologist and Dean of Medicine at the University of Buckingham, has been carrying out his own antibody testing and believes that between eight to 10 per cent of people are likely to have had coronavirus so far. We\u0027re nowhere near herd immunity, he said. We could definitely have a second peak. It is a real worry.Imperial College predicted that strict lockdown measures would be needed for at least five months, but also warned that restrictions and widespread monitoring would have to stay in place until a vaccine was available in order to prevent a second wave. Dozens of research labs across the globe are working on vaccines and a team at Oxford believe they could have a viable jab ready by the autumn. Yet scaling up will present a problem and it is likely that only frontline workers will be given vaccines initially, leaving the general public waiting until at least next year. That delay means restrictions such as social distancing will be in place for many months to come. Sir Jeremy Farrar, a member of the Sage group and the director of the Wellcome Trust, said the virus would not be going away any time soon and future waves were likely.We must assume and prepare for the fact that this is not a discrete one-off episode, he said. My belief is that this is now an endemic human infection. It is likely that this is here with the human race for the future. We\u0027re going to have to find ways to deal with that.The real moving forward is we have to have new tests, we have to have drugs that treat this infection, and critically we need to have vaccines so we can prevent what we should assume are future waves.In recent weeks, journalists have questioned why the Government is continuing to invest in huge numbers of intensive care beds at Nightingale hospitals while cases are on the decline.The possibility of a second peak is likely to be the reason.While the current epidemic appears to have stabilised below 1,000 cases a day, modelling of a second wave suggests that it could be far higher if it is not brought under control through mass testing, contact tracing and isolation after lockdown.Asked whether the Nightingale hospitals were being kept for a possible second wave, a Downing Street spokesman said: I am certainly not aware of any plans to stand down these Nightingale hospitals, and some are still being built.Fears of a second coronavirus wave have made governments around the world nervous about lifting their lockdowns too early and too quickly, and Britain is no exception.A safety net of widespread testing, contact tracing and isolation of those infected must be in place to ensure cases are not allowed to rise, while squashing the sombrero of a second peak may now be a viable option.Ilan Kelman, professor of disasters and health at University College London said: A second peak of infection could be manageable if we protect those who are vulnerable, treat those who get sick, do not reduce other medical services and meet all healthcare worker needs. Another possible strategy is a staged stand-down of lockdown to flatten a second peak, provided that those who are told to remain in lockdown, or who cannot work because of it, are given all the support they need to avoid difficult effects of being isolated while others resume life.In China, a spike in infections after weeks of falling rates has forced the authorities to impose new restrictions.In the north-eastern city of Harbin, a 22-year-old university student who returned from the US was identified as the source of more than 40 new infections, while Chinese citizens returning from Siberia via the border town of Suifenhe led to more than 400 confirmed new cases.The examples show the huge problem in restarting life again after a strict lockdown when so few of the population are immune. In Germany, credited with keeping its outbreak under tight control through its use of extensive testing and contact tracing, there has been a rise in deaths as the country was re-opening some small shops and preparing for children to return to school from May 4.The director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned on Tuesday that any second wave of coronavirus was likely to be even more serious if it coincided with the start of flu season.Robert Redfield told The Washington Post: There\u0027s a possibility that the assault of the virus on our nation next winter will actually be even more difficult than the one we just went through.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/04/24/09/alexandra-palace.jpg","title":"alexandra palace drive in opera eno english national","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Series of accessible opera works will begin in September 2020, and will play to audiences of 300 vehiclesEnglish National Opera (ENO) has announced plans to stage a series of drive-in opera performances at Alexandra Palace, in what is thought to be a world first.This September, the north London venue will host accessible, shortened productions of works including Puccini’s\u0026nbspLa bohème​ and Mozart‘s\u0026nbspThe Magic Flute.The audience will be able to watch the live performances from their cars, while the musicians and singers are safely spaced out on stage to comply with social distancing measures.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesStuart Murphy, the chief executive of ENO, told\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspthat it is “a bit of an experiment and if it works it might be a way of bringing the artform to people in a totally different and authentic way​”.“I miss seeing my brother and sister, seeing my mates close up, and I miss seeing something live.

Larger firms have received £11.2bn through a credit facility with the Bank of England while 500,000 SMEs have had grants totalling £6bn, Mr Sharma said.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The average value of a CBILS loan stands at £171,000. Business groups say that is not enough and are calling for urgent changes to the scheme.Tej Parikh, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said: “It is positive to see the scheme ramping up, but cash still needs to get to more businesses quickly. Reforms have started to bed in, and more money is getting out the door. However, there are still swathes of businesses facing processing delays and restrictive viability criteria, and many are reluctant to engage with the system at all.”He urged the government to relax affordability criteria for small loans and to increase state backing for lenders’ losses.Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) chair\u0026nbspMike Cherry called on banks to consider firms at the heart of communities such as small shops, restaurants, gyms, manufacturers and mechanics, many of whom are looking for relatively small loans.“These figures mark an improvement,” Mr Cherry said. “But we need to see far more from the banks where the speed of processing applications and making money available to the smallest businesses are concerned.“The government should up its guarantee on emergency loans with values under £30,000 from 80 per cent to 100 per cent. That, combined with the streamlined application process that should be in place for facilities of this size, should help to get more cash to the small firms that really need it.”Part of the problem is that while the government is backing up to 80 per cent of banks’ losses on the loans, that still leaves them on the hook for 20 per cent. Given the potential size of the scheme, that represents a risk that some lenders appear reluctant to take.Banks may also need to change some of their operations to allow them to approve commercial loans under £25,000 because of consumer credit rules.Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey suggested last week that the government should look at guaranteeing business loans under £25,000 so that banks can avoid carrying out standard credit checks that have blocked some applications.Tracking the coronavirus outbreak around the world in maps and chartsWhen can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsListen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastTreasury officials are understood to be concerned about potential abuse of the system if guarantees are increased to 100 per cent. But those fears must be weighed against the danger of exacerbating economic damage caused by the pandemic if thousands of businesses run out of cash and go bust.Mr Sharma also said he would look to introduce measures to ease commercial rent demand within the next week.“I do think the majority of landlords and tenants are working well, they are reaching agreements on debt obligations but I am certainly aware that certain landlords are putting undue financial pressure with aggressive debt recovery tactics,” he said.“What I’m very happy to say to you is I will look to introduce temporary measures on this particular issue which will ease commercial rent demand and protect the UK high street ... that is something I will be doing very very shortly.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The firm should work with the customer to resolve these difficulties in advance of payments being missed, the FCA said.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Larger firms have received £11.2bn through a credit facility with the Bank of England while 500,000 SMEs have had grants totalling £6bn, Mr Sharma said.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailHe added: “I think you have to look at the totality of what we are offering ...\u0026nbspif you look at what the Swiss are offering in terms of fiscal stimulus, as I understand the majority of it has gone through these particular loan schemes.”Mr Sharma conceded that there was a need to “get more loans out there” but said that the number of accredited lenders had increased to 48 with the addition of peer-to-peer platforms like Funding Circle.Businesses demand more help from banks during Covid-19 pandemicFigures released on Thursday by banking trade body UK Finance show that 16,624 of the 36,186 small business finance applications for CBILS facility have been processed and approved. The average value of a CBILS loan stands at £171,000. Business groups say that is not enough and are calling for urgent changes to the scheme.Tej Parikh, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said: “It is positive to see the scheme ramping up, but cash still needs to get to more businesses quickly. Reforms have started to bed in, and more money is getting out the door. However, there are still swathes of businesses facing processing delays and restrictive viability criteria, and many are reluctant to engage with the system at all.”He urged the government to relax affordability criteria for small loans and to increase state backing for lenders’ losses.Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) chair\u0026nbspMike Cherry called on banks to consider firms at the heart of communities such as small shops, restaurants, gyms, manufacturers and mechanics, many of whom are looking for relatively small loans.“These figures mark an improvement,” Mr Cherry said. “But we need to see far more from the banks where the speed of processing applications and making money available to the smallest businesses are concerned.“The government should up its guarantee on emergency loans with values under £30,000 from 80 per cent to 100 per cent. That, combined with the streamlined application process that should be in place for facilities of this size, should help to get more cash to the small firms that really need it.”Part of the problem is that while the government is backing up to 80 per cent of banks’ losses on the loans, that still leaves them on the hook for 20 per cent. Given the potential size of the scheme, that represents a risk that some lenders appear reluctant to take.Banks may also need to change some of their operations to allow them to approve commercial loans under £25,000 because of consumer credit rules.Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey suggested last week that the government should look at guaranteeing business loans under £25,000 so that banks can avoid carrying out standard credit checks that have blocked some applications.Tracking the coronavirus outbreak around the world in maps and chartsWhen can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsListen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastTreasury officials are understood to be concerned about potential abuse of the system if guarantees are increased to 100 per cent. But those fears must be weighed against the danger of exacerbating economic damage caused by the pandemic if thousands of businesses run out of cash and go bust.Mr Sharma also said he would look to introduce measures to ease commercial rent demand within the next week.“I do think the majority of landlords and tenants are working well, they are reaching agreements on debt obligations but I am certainly aware that certain landlords are putting undue financial pressure with aggressive debt recovery tactics,” he said.“What I’m very happy to say to you is I will look to introduce temporary measures on this particular issue which will ease commercial rent demand and protect the UK high street ... that is something I will be doing very very shortly.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

All three companies say that they have used the period of closure to assess how to properly implement social distancing guidelines, but how will they ensure they keep staff and customers safe?Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesDIY retailer B\u0026ampQ is reopening 61 of its 155 of its stores after closing them when the government announced the lockdown last month. The company is allowed to open as it’s designated as an essential business.Services like paint mixing, timber cutting and key cutting have been suspended.

There had been a number of reports of other construction companies not operating proper social distancing measures.Taylor Wimpey plans to re-start building on 4 May after “meticulously” planning how to modify working practices to enable workers to return to safely to sites.Taylor Wimpy said it had created\u0026nbsp“detailed new site operating protocols developed in compliance with strict social distancing requirements”.The company said it had assessed each and every aspect of site activities to comply with guidance issued by the Construction Leadership Council (CLC).All employees, subcontractors and visitors will have to sign up to a new code of conduct.

It produced a number of films, including Father of the Bride (1991) and Fly Away Home (1996), as well as several Parton projects – most recently her Netflix anthology series Dolly Parton’s Heartstrings.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIt also produced the original Buffy the Vampire Slayer movie, released in 1992 to dismal reviews. It was Gail Berman, then an executive at Sandollar, who still believed there was potential in the property, and proposed launching the concept as a TV series.Both Berman and Gallin are credited as executive producers on the Buffy series, along with its spin-off series Angel, though Parton herself is not. She did, however, play a fundamental if often forgotten role in bringing Joss Whedon’s creation to the screen.How Normal People captures the angst of young romanceBBC’s Big Night In – a joy marred by Little Britain’s racist returnSopranos fans are only just discovering Lady Gaga was in an episodeWhile it has never been confirmed, some have suggested that Buffy Summers’ on-screen birthday (19 January) is a secret tribute to Parton – the country star herself being born on the same day.The resurfaced news of Parton’s uncredited involvement in Buffy has sparked shock among fans.“I was today years old when I found out that Dolly Parton was an uncredited executive producer on Buffy the Vampire Slayer,” wrote one person on Twitter.Another added: “There’s no emoji for the look on my face.”Running from 1997 until 2003, the Buffy the Vampire Slayer TV series starred Sarah Michelle Gellar as a young woman tasked with protecting the world from vampires and demons.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

One participant was given a dose of the vaccine, while the other was given a meningitis vaccine for comparison.Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Prof Gilbert said the team was looking to recruit hospital workers “who will be at greater risk of infection” to increase the chances of confirming the vaccine’s efficacy.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesShe said they were “not convinced” that Covid-19 is still prevalent enough in the UK for the trial to produce results as quickly as they would like.“We’ve been accelerating the trial as much as we possibly can and we’re not looking to, for the next phase of the trial, specifically recruit people who work in hospitals who will be at greater risk of infections, because while there are still cases in hospital, that’s where the virus is,” she said.Tracking the coronavirus outbreak around the world in maps and chartsWhen can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsListen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus Podcast“We’re going to try and increase our chances of getting the vaccine efficacy result by doing that. But we accept that we may not be able to do that in this country so we’re also making plans to set up trials in other countries where the transmission of the virus has been a bit slower to get going because we may need to go and test the vaccine somewhere else.”In order for the vaccine to be deemed successful, researchers need to test the actual vaccine against a placebo in large enough groups of people to determine its effectiveness. Researchers are testing for three things – the vaccine’s safety, its ability to induce immune responses, and its efficacy in stopping people from contracting coronavirus.According to Prof Gilbert, the team are hoping to get at least 5,000 people in the trials.However, the fall in the rate of infections could potentially delay the production of the vaccine. The Oxford team had hopes of having at least a million doses of its candidate ready in September.“It could still happen over the summer and maybe we will get signal of efficacy, a trend towards efficacy, a hint that it’s working here and then be able to add to that by doing trials in other countries.“This is all very unpredictable, obviously,” she added.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailOther questions focus on whether easing restrictions could be reversed if needed, whether there would be a positive economic benefit, a positive effect on well being, and a positive impact on inequality.It comes as the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said easing the UK’s lockdown depended on the speed at which the number of new Covid-19 cases falls, a factor he said is as yet “unknown”.The number of new cases is being tracked through hospital admissions, a new testing study in the community announced on Wednesday, and data that will be gathered from people coming forward for tests under an expansion of the testing programme, Mr Hancock said.However,\u0026nbsphe suggested there is no prospect of easing the lockdown yet, and that coronavirus cases need to drop substantially before the next phase of isolating infected people and their contacts can be truly effective.Through a process of mass testing and by isolating infected people and their contacts, ministers hope future localised outbreaks of corornavirus can be kept under control.“Now that we’re at the peak, and we very much hope that things will start to slow down and, if and when they do, then the speed with which the number of new cases reduces will frankly will determine how long we need to keep the measures on and that is as yet unknown,”\u0026nbspMr Hancock told Radio 4’s Today programme.He said it was not quite the case that mass testing and contact tracing needed to be in place before the current restrictions are eased, but said contact tracing worked better when the number of infections was pushed right down.“The truth is that we need to get the number of new cases down, right down, and the lower you go, the more effective contact tracing is because the more resources you can put into each inidual case that gets a positive test.“You can really make sure you can get hold of all of their contacts and get them, in many cases, to self-isolate.“The smaller the number of new cases, the more effective the test, track and trace system will be.”Social distancing was driving down the numbers, Mr Hancock said, adding that the contact tracing operation would be functioning in a “matter of weeks”.\u0026nbspHe said mass testing, contact tracing and a new contact tracing app “are so crucial to holding down the rate and level of transmission of the disease.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But a new study suggests that such visitors might have been alongside us all along.The researchers suggest that the objects came from other stars, billions of years ago, and have been orbiting around our Sun undiscovered ever since.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe objects were first pulled out of another\u0026nbspsolar system in the relatively early days of the universe, when the stars were closer together and so upset each other\u0027s gravity more easily.\u0026nbspThis enabled asteroids to be pulled from one star system to another, said Fathi Namouni, lead author of the study, in a statement.Just as with those other visitors, researchers hope they can use the objects to understand the differences between objects that have spent all of their time in our solar system and\u0026nbspthose alien visitors.“The discovery of a whole population of asteroids of interstellar origin is an important step in understanding the physical and chemical similarities and differences between solar system-born and interstellar asteroids,” commented Dr.\u0026nbspMorais.The researchers came upon the discovery after running computer simulations that allowed them to look at how the solar system may have looked in its earliest days. When they looked the asteroids in question, they found they were orbiting the Sun in a distant region beyond the disc of gas and dust that would form the rest of the asteroids, and along a different orbit to the other planets and asteroids.That strange placement led the researchers to speculate that the asteroids were not native at all but had actually been plucked out of interstellar space as the planets were forming.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

The firm should work with the customer to resolve these difficulties in advance of payments being missed, the FCA said.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We know in some cases it’s their only main meal for the day and they’re not able to get much else.How to support our campaign“I am seeing some scared elderly people on their own, so if I speak to them from the pavement, I’m just trying to reassure them and keep their spirits up,” he adds.Briana LeBold, 47, works in fashion production and was furloughed by her company soon after the lockdown began. She has been volunteering as a food delivery cyclist a few days a week.“I decided worrying about work isn’t going to change anything,” she says. “I thought what Made in Hackney and some of the food charities were doing was wonderful, so I just wanted to get involved to support the work.“There isn’t a huge amount of interaction with people, obviously, but they do let us know how much they’re enjoying the meals. Even if it’s just a wave and a ‘hi’ – it’s still really nice to see people and feel like you’re helping in some way.”Tais Lima, a 41-year-old yoga teacher, is volunteering one day a week. “I like getting out on my bike with a sense of purpose,” she says. “There’s a lot of lonely and vulnerable people out there, but it’s rewarding to see they’re getting a meal that changes their day.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Her staff identified 420 iniduals and families in the London borough in dire need of food each day, and asked for volunteers to help drop off the vegan meals between 2pm and 6pm every afternoon.Kitchen staff at the Angelina restaurant in Dalston have helped with the cooking so they can meet a target of delivering 30,000 meals over the next three months.“We knew there was going to be this incredible level of need out there, so we ripped up our job descriptions and threw ourselves into this work,” says Ms Bentley. “It’s been pretty emotional at times, pretty intense to see what people are going through. We want to be able to help more people if we possibly can.”She told The Independent how one family had no food at all in the house for more than two days before they began getting daily meals out to them.One of those receiving a delivery each afternoon is David Pavlovic, a 63-year-old with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and heart disease, who was told not to leave home for a 12-week period.“I’ve got family outside of London and friends across the city – but they have problems of their own with job losses,” he says.“I did get worried for a while about having enough food, so it was just a massive relief to get meals delivered. The charities like The Felix Project and Made in Hackney are doing really important work, and it seems like they enjoy doing it too.

He picked up a van at a depot in northwest London, drove more than 100 miles to pick up two tons of surplus food, returned to the depot to unload, and then headed back out across the capital to deliver fresh produce to hungry children and adults. He works a 65-hour week –\u0026nbspand has done so since the start of the coronavirus outbreak –\u0026nbspfor no pay.MacNichol is a volunteer for The Felix Project, our Help The Hungry appeal partner. Since lockdown, Felix has quadrupled food deliveries to vulnerable Londoners to a staggering 100,000 meals a day. But they have had to manage this with a small staff of 22 and a 30-fold reduction in volunteers – from 3,500 to just 115 – as many of their volunteers are over 70 and can no longer work due to Covid-19 restrictions.These super volunteers are the backbone for London’s fourth emergency service –\u0026nbspfood provision to the capital’s hungry –\u0026nbspand Felix could not function without them. Today we meet six of them and ask why they joined and what volunteering means to them.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHow to support our campaign“Going back 10 years, we were instructed by our bosses at Sainsbury’s to destroy all surplus food, but then the likes of Felix came along and suddenly there was no excuse for waste. I was so impressed by Felix’s operation that I promised to volunteer when I retired. Since coronavirus, I do a 65-hour week. I start at their Park Royal depot, drive to Hello Fresh in Banbury and to Mindful Chef near Birmingham, returning with a two-ton\u0026nbsppayload. Later I deliver to community hubs, charities and schools that have set up food drop centres.“Recently I supplied a school in Ealing and as I arrived one boy said to his friend, “now we’ve got something to eat tonight”, and I thought, bloody hell. To think some parents have to choose between paying rent and feeding their children and that Felix is the only reason they can do both — it brings a lump to your throat.”Retired facilities manager for City officesRuns a fundraising\u0026nbspconsultancy for charities“I came across Felix when it launched in 2016 and was hired to help them raise funds. I promised myself that one day I would go back and volunteer –\u0026nbspand that’s what I did last November. It was amazing to see how Felix had grown into a major lifeline for thousands of Londoners. I thought, incredible growth, incredible impact –\u0026nbspit really does walk the talk. In my job, I see the distress inequality causes, but when I go out in a Felix van, I feel I am doing something good for the community. It might sound schmaltzy but, for me, it’s my war effort.”Economics graduate, works for Cisco Systems“I started volunteering for Felix in January and the thing that struck me when I first walked into their Park Royal warehouse was the unbelievable quantity of food that would otherwise go to waste. It is such a bustling place and since coronavirus, it’s even busier because major suppliers like Hello Fresh and Sainsbury’s have even more surplus food. It’s a boost for my morale to help during lockdown and satisfying to see the smiles on people’s faces as you arrive in the green Felix van.”Tracking the coronavirus outbreak around the world in maps and chartsWhen can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsListen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastLawyer and non-executive director of Investec Wealth“I joined Felix last year because my friend Gary had been there 18 months and loves it, so I went out in the van and got hooked. I started doing one day a week but since coronavirus, I have been doing two full days as a co-driver. It’s hard physical work but it never fails to put a smile on my face. Since lockdown, my partner Rob drives me and today we were on the road for four hours delivering 16 crates of food to six charities and each time we were made to feel like Father Christmas.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A number of our churches across the capital, particularly those that host and run food banks and homeless shelters, have successfully partnered with Felix in the past. Never has there been a greater need for us all to come together to support the vulnerable in our local communities.”Imam Mahmoud, who ran a half marathon to support Felix in 2017, said: “I applaud the good work that The Independent and The Felix Project are doing to feed and support the elderly and most vulnerable members of our community during this time of crisis. In difficult times, it is important that we all come together regardless of background and support each other as a community and as a nation, the best we can.”With the start of Ramadan today, Imam Mahmoud added that he was particularly “moved by the good spirit” that people have shown towards others of late. “This project is close to my heart because I’ve seen first-hand the benefit that it has bought to the community. I urge everyone to continue to support Food for London Now and other projects like it.”Rabbi Mirvis called for a sense of community at a time when many feel isolated. He said: “The great Jewish sages taught that ‘anyone who saves a single life is considered to have saved the whole world’. In these extraordinary times, it is not only the heroes of the NHS who are called upon to fulfil this noblest aspiration. The efforts of The Independent and The Felix Project, together with their partners, make it possible for us all to play our part in saving the lives of the most vulnerable among us.“Today, as many thousands of people face the agonising uncertainty of not knowing where their next meal is coming from, we must reach out to them with compassion and reassurance.

Northern Powerhouse Rail have asked government for £25 million to get on with working up the outline scheme that they want to do, Sir John told the Commons transport select committee.Those are the sort of thing that the government can do to get things moving because in the first place it\u0027s not about digging holes, it\u0027s actually about doing lots of environmental work assessments, design, consultation, land acquisition. There\u0027s several years of work that will take place on Northern Powerhouse Rail before you can start digging holes.The scheme is backed by northern cities and will share some infrastructure with HS2, the north-south high speed railway whose construction was green-lit by the government last week.Sir John said the best way the government could ensure there was capacity to build multiple schemes at one was to give more certainty to its long-term plans and long-term strategy so that contractors would feel able to invest long-term in their capabilities.The chair of the Commission, which is conducting a review into phase two of HS2 past Birmingham into Manchester and Leeds, said the construction of new lines was a good idea.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It\u0027s called High Speed 2 but frankly it\u0027s more capacity to the north. Rail will continue to grow, the demand is there.He warned critics of the project that it was difficult to accurately draw up an economic business case for the project as it would involve predicting the future.We\u0027re talking about a project that is going to be beneficial to the country for the next 75 years at least and forecasting how those long-term socioeconomic benefits will play out is difficult enough for anyone. I think occasionally you need to say \u0027this looks a sensible thing to do, so let\u0027s go ahead\u0027, he said.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The cruise ship Ruby Princess departs from Port Kembla, some 80 kilometres south of SydneyAn activist performs on the roof during Earth Day in Wroclaw, PolandMalaysian army personnel set up barbed wire in the locked down area of Selayang wholesale market in Kuala LumpurA trader walks inside a pen as he arrives to purchase vegetables and fruits at the Agricultural Produce Market Committee market in Navi Mumbai during the nationwide lockdownA bride, poses for a wedding photographer next to East Lake in WuhanPeople shout at police officers during a demonstration of conspiracy theorists as other demonstrators protest against the lockdown imposed to slow the spread of the coronavirus in BerlinA pair of rare morepork owl chicks have become the first in more than a decade to survive on Norfolk Island, in the South PacificA squirrel runs across a fence as the sun shines in Berlin\u0027s Kreuzberg districtElection officials count after general election voting in Seoul, South KoreaNotre-Dame Cathedral in Paris, which was damaged in a devastating fire one year ago todayWild bluebells, which bloom around mid-April turning the forest blue as they form a carpet, pictured in the Hallerbos in BelgiumPope Francis delivers his Urbi et Orbi message following Easter Sunday Mass behind closed doors at St Peter\u0027s Basilica in The Vatican, during the country\u0027s lockdownA man watches Krakatau spewing ash during an eruption, in Serang, Indonesia\u0027s Banten provinceWomen queue for distribution of food for those suffering under Kenya\u0027s coronavirus-related movement restrictionsFirefighter Sittiporn Singthong, dressed up as Spider-Man, sprays disinfectant at the Wat Tha Mai Buddhist temple in Samut Sakhon province, ThailandTulip fields in Plomeur, western FranceA employee and a resident of the house for the elderly De Ravenstein react as nurses dance and sing in the garden, following the coronavirus disease outbreak, in Boortmeerbeek, BelgiumA man stands in the balcony of his home with the moon in the background in Cali, ColombiaA man holds a traditional lamp from the balcony of his house as torches and candles illuminate houses and high rise residential buildings as Indians mark the country\u0027s fight against the coronavirus pandemic a suburb of New Delhi, IndiaMedical staff load an infected patient into an ambulance at the Nimes air base, south of France, during an evacuation operation from the hard-hit east of the country where hospitals are overwhelmedA man prays inside the closed Moussawi Grand Mosque in BasraA City Hall health official wearing a protective suit sprays disinfectant at the entrance of City One condominium as the residential building was placed under lockdown after 17 cases of COVID-19 were detected, in Kuala Lumpur, MalaysiaMigrant workers wait on marked areas on the ground to maintain social distancing as they queue to receive food packets at an industrial area during a government-imposed nationwide lockdown as a preventive measure against the Covid-19 coronavirus, in ChennaiWedding dress and evening wear designer Friederike Jorzig adjusts a mannequin wearing a wedding dress with matching protective mask in her store Chiton in BerlinA stray dog walks in front of an empty historic India Gate, as nationwide lockdown continues over the coronavirus in New Delhi, IndiaA man watches a TV screen showing a file image of North Korea\u0027s missile launch during a news program at the Seoul Railway Station in SeoulHong Kong\u0027s skyline is seen with some of its lights turned off to mark the Earth Hour, an environmental campaignUkrainian citizens queue at the Polish-Ukrainian border during the coronavirus pandemic in Korczowa, Poland.

His government has “made mistakes” — and so has ours.But presidents and prime ministers have a lot on their plates. When it comes to health alarms, they rely on experts.It would take a very brave prime minister indeed to ignore the people appointed to safeguard the nation’s health when lives are at risk.And the advice from those experts — the sprawling Public Health England in particular — was that Britain faced no more than a larger-than-usual dose of winter flu.PHE was against German-style mass testing and, when caught flat-footed, rejected help from commercial laboratories in providing those tests.PHE failed to build stocks of personal protective equipment — including masks, gowns and gloves — despite a  test run showing these were a priority.PHE dragged its feet over sourcing ventilators for intensive-care patients and extra hospital beds.Frequently when running short of crucial gear, PHE resisted offers of outside help, leaving the NHS scrambling to catch up.And when it came to opening London’s ,-bed Nightingale emergency hospital, it was the Army that did the job in nine days.It was also PHE who insisted the British public would be protected by “herd immunity”.The sooner  per cent of the population had contracted the virus and become immune, the better, it said.Boris faithfully followed their lead until another expert, Prof Neil Ferguson, issued a nightmare prediction of , dead unless Britain was locked up overnight.It was Ferguson who in the Blair years forecast mass burials on the scale of the Great Plague during the “Mad Cow” scare and the foot-and-mouth outbreak.Neither Armageddon scenario came remotely close.Once this is over and the inevitable inquiry is held, Boris and his government will inevitably be in the dock.So will PHE, a fiercely territorial quango with a giant £.billion budget.Much of this goes on pay and perks for well-cushioned executives, with  staff on six-figure salaries — a nanny-state rich list.Its website boasts its job is to “protect and improve the nation’s health and wellbeing”.And yet this box-ticking bureaucracy — obsessed with sugary drinks and ersity — has failed at the first hurdle.It shares with the higher reaches of the NHS a suspicion of fleet-footed commercial rivals and deep-seated hostility to the “profit motive”.Criticism, still muted, is widespread within the medical community, including frontline doctors and consultants.Every Thursday at pm, a grateful nation stands and applauds NHS staff working around the clock to save lives at the risk of their own.The same cannot be said for the inflexible, politically correct quango that binds the hands of medical staff in the name of an outdated socialist credo on health provision: State good, private bad.Much will need to change after Covid-. And that change must start with Public Health England.MINISTERS are looking at a traffic-light system to lt lockdown. Red for Stop, green for Go, with amber in between.Overzealous cops and councils are being reined in. ­Common sense is taking over. Families can now attend funerals.We might be able to say goodbye to dying ­relatives. Parks will reopen to the ­public. Benches have been deemed safe to sit on.So how about allowing non-contact sporting activities that boost both physical and mental health Swimming pools are surely safe.

The very concept of privacy barely exists when the state can use sophisticated technology to keep watch on our behaviour.This vision sounds like a nightmare, but it could become all too real thanks to the coronavirus.In its fallout, Covid- may end up causing as much damage to our essential freedoms as to our health - with the new menace of Big Brother on its way.Already the current emergency has led to the first comprehensive lockdown in British history.Evenit has been necessary to slow the spread of the virus, it is nevertheless a draconian measure that would have been unthinkable only a few weeks ago.Effectively the entire public has been placed under house arrest.Normal le has been brought juddering to a halt, while the police have been given unprecedented powers to enforce the quarantine.Even sitting for too long on a park bench or taking a leisurely drive have become offences against the state.With heroic stoicism, the vast majority of people have accepted this policy, seeing it as the only realistic means to protect the NHS and lessen the transmission of coronavirus.They hope that once the worst of the crisis has passed, there will be ato the Britain that they love, where inidual rights are respected and the power of the state is limited.Above all, this is my deepest wish too - though the chances look slim.One of the reasons why I, as an Irishman, admire this country so much is because of the British tradition of liberty, reflected in Magna Carta, parliamentary democracy and the defeat of Nazi tyranny.Unfortunately, even when the current lockdown is lted, it is possible that heavy-handed control by the state will remain.Quarantine may be temporary, but authoritarianism could be permanent.This is because officialdom, shaken by the unexpected scale of the coronavirus crisis, will be determined to prevent its resurgence by any means necessary.That will involve far more than just the maintenance of social distancing and the wearing of face masks.An arsenal of other measures could be deployed in the fight.One will be the reintroduction of curfews at the first sign of any new flare up in cases.If there is such a setback, the mood of the authorities will be even more intolerant towards any breaches. Fines will be heavier, jail terms longer.The skies will be filled with the sound of helicopters and the sight of drones as police — or even the Army — embark on ruthless enforcement.Another change is likely to be the advent of biometric identity cards, backed up by a comprehensive database of the entire population.Such a system has long been the dream of bureaucrats in Whitehall, and the aftermath of the crisis provides the perfect excuse for its imposition.Its appeal is all the greater because the latest type of cards operate with biotechnology that scans eyes and fingerprints.Only last year, the European Union passed a regulation requiring all national identity card systems on the continent to comply with new biometric standards.The British state will not stop there in its new crusade.In the name of health protection, mobile phone companies could be required to share data on their clients.According to the New Statesman, British Telecom, which owns the EE network, is already “in talks with the Government about handing over phone location and usage data” for the purpose of monitoring adherence to the lockdown.Similarly, tracking apps on devices could also be made obligatory so that the Government will be able to trace the contacts of anyone infected and ensure compliance with quarantine rules.Just as some criminals on release have to wear electronic tags, anyone who has tested positive for the virus may be ordered to wear a medical wristband even when self-isolation is over.Alternatively, those who test negative could be given immunity certicates.These initiatives will be accompanied by a political drive to reinforce support for the state, as happens in wartime.In a distinctly un-British way, people will be encouraged to snitch on those who fail to abide by the rules.Challenges to ruling orthodoxy will be seen as a form of subversion.If that sounds far-fetched, consider how laws to tackle discrimination or terrorism are now used to uphold fashionable ideology, as highlighted in the outrageous recent case where Lincolnshire businessman Harry Miller was questioned by police for allegedly sending a “transphobic” tweet.In the new Britain scarred by corona, the whole relationship between the state and the public will be inverted.The Government is meant to be accountable to the people.But, burdened with ID cards, curfews and tracking apps, the people will be accountable to the Government.There is an echo here of the George Orwell’s novel , which painted a terrying picture of Britain under totalitarian rule.In Orwell’s society gripped by permanent crisis, the citizenry were monitored day and night by the state.The propaganda and all-seeing eye of Big Brother could never be avoided, “always watching and the voice enveloping you, asleep or awake, indoors or outdoors, in the bath or in bed.In the present global crisis, many look to the experience of Asia, which has had far lower Covid death rates than the West.But that is a dangerous stance. First it ignores the fundamental point that China is responsible for the spread of this disease through its cover-up, persecution and lies.The country should be in the dock, not garnered with praise.Second it glosses over the oppressive nature of many of these Asian regimes, particularly that run by the tyrannical Chinese communist party.China has eagerly embraced new technology, like tracking devices, facial recognition cameras, eye-scanning security barriers and online data gathering, precisely because they drastically enhance the power of the state machine.Indeed, the country likes to boast that it is building the “world’s largest camera surveillance network”.As an example, in Guangzhou province, the commercial hub of southern China, tablets have been recently installed on buses to promote safety.Passengers are expected to lean their foreheads close to the tablet so that their photos and temperatures can be taken.China is also establishing a sinister “social credit system”, where behaviour is monitored to assess a citizen’s trustworthiness.Those given high ratings by the state can receive rewards like employment offers, shorter waiting times in hospitals and discounts at hotels.It is a recipe for bureaucratic despotism and political infantilisation.Other Asian nations, while nothing like as cruel as China, are also using technology as a tool to corral their public.Hong Kong has introduced mandatory wristbands for those in quarantine so they can be tracked.Taiwan has a monitoring system known as “the electronic fence” where those who are meant to be in isolation will be visited by the authoritiesthey turn off their mobiles.In South Korea, the government gathers huge amounts of data from phone records, CCTV images, and credit cards to help track citizens during the Covid crisis, while in Singapore, phone users are encouraged to download the “TraceTogether” app.This keeps a record of all the other numbers that have been in close proximity to the smartphone, making it easier to trace anyone who might have been near the owner in the event of a positive Covid-test.Not all of these developments are bad, provided they are genuinely used as weapons against disease rather than vehicles for the expansion of state power.But we have seen since   how the excuse of security can be used as a cover for bullying by the authorities, with the result that international air travel is often a miserable experience.A No spokesman said: “The NHS is doing a fantastic job and the nation will want to find a way to say thank you when we have defeated this virus.”SAS hero Andy McNab added: “The award of a George Cross would show an emotional appreciation.”We are asking our readers to please sign the petition below.We should not allow the same to happen on a national scale in the wake of the pandemic.As the great author C.S.Lewis wrote: “Of all tyrannies, a tyranny exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive.It would be better to live under robber barons than omnipotent moral busybodies.”To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

As I say, this baffling statement will make zero dference to their already fractured relationship with the UK.In an ideal world, every media outlet worldwide would form a pact that they will never again write about or use a photograph of the Sussexes.The effect would be swt and damning.For without the oxygen of publicity, what are they Married to a home-body, I have always rather envied those whose other halves travel frequently for their job.It gives you the house to yourself sporadicallyand makes you appreciate them when they .But in lockdown we are faring well because we are already used to being together most of the time.A friend whose husband usually travels for work called me the other day to say that his sudden, constant presence in the home was causing friction.And yesterday, Boyzone star Shane Lynch announced the sad news that lockdown has put his -year marriage to Sheena White under intolerable strain.He says: “I’m not even in my family home right now because me and her were at each other’s throats.“It wasn’t a good time or a good space.“I’m usually on the road and for the first time I’ve spent three months in my house . . . it can be a struggle.”Indeed it can. Let’s hope they sort it out for the sake of their two children.Now the dust has settled around Professor Neil Ferguson’s original estimate of , Covid deaths, it’s perhaps time to stand back and take a logical overview of the situation.While the death toll is still worrying, the mantra that we are critically harming the economy to protect the NHS from being overwhelmed is undermined by the news that many of the private hospitals repurposed for Covid patients are lying virtually empty and the ,-bed facility set up in London’s ExCel centre is only treating  people.It’s adding credence to the burgeoning mindset that, perhaps, those who are considered vulnerable should remain in lockdown while the rest of the country makes a gradualto school or work while maintaining strict social distancing measures.On GMB yesterday, a gruff, Swedish professor, whose name escaped me, was asked to explain the thinking behind his country’s policy to keep everything open.He replied: “People are not stupid.”In other words, the Swedes are taking personal responsibility for how they behave and, as of earlier this week, the death rate was starting to decline.It remains to be seen whether Sweden’s outlier stance proves to be the correct one, but one thing is for certain: Its economy may be weakened at the end of it, but it won’t be on the critical list like ours.Model and businessman David Gandy talked about the importance of fostering at the weekend, under the headline, “OMG. He’s so cute!”Indeed he is, was my immediate thought. My second was that I would happily foster him anytime.However, it turns out the headline and suggestion of benevolence was aimed at Dora, his rescue pup from Battersea Dogs Home, for which David is an ambassador.He says: “What I love about the evenings now is the calmness of a tired, sleeping dog at your side. I watch Dora dreaming.”Lucky Dora.One wondersshe knows that, when it comes to good fortune, she has won the canine equivalent of the Lottery.Last year, I read to kids in a primary school and, with rare exception, every time I asked what they wanted to be when they grew up, they replied: “A YouTuber.”Yet last week, while queuing behind a mother and her daughter outside the supermarket, the young girldeclared her desire to become a nurse when she left school.Now that is something positive to come out of the Covid- crisis.Jigsaws are getting me through the long days of lockdown.Despite The Bloke’s lame attempts to hide the last pieceI completed my fth at the weekend and, as an exercise in mindfulness, it’s right up there with any yoga retreat.So imagine my joy when Kodak announced last week that it has produced the world’s largest jigsaw with, gulp, , pieces.It is  separate images of world landmarks and, when finished, covers  square metres – about the size of a standard living room. Sadly, it also costs £, so I’ll stick to my ,-piece cheapies. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

First, the EU scheme has spectacularly failed to deliver anything.Indeed — as I suggest below — the EU is coming apart at the seams over this virus.And second, the invitation to join the scheme was sent, by those EU genii, to the wrong address.

Why Professor of Law Elizabeth Bartholet said: “It’s always dangerous to put powerful people in charge of the powerless.”.She added that it gave parents “authoritarian control” over the kids.You mean like the authoritarian control they’ve had from the teachers all these years, love It’s comforting to know that even in this crisis, the liberals are still as deranged as ever.You’ve got to feel sorry for Victoria Beckham, haven’t you Poor woman says that last week was the worst of her le.She’s bitterly disappointed with you, the British people.She thinks we were all terribly arsey about her when she decided to use our money to furlough her fashion company workers.How could we be so mean as to expect a woman who has an estimated wealth of £million – acquired largely through singing badly – should dig into her own pockets.Rather than scrounging off the taxpayer.The stinking rich really don’t get it, do they No self awareness whatsoever – and even less shame.But then never mind the witless Posh, whose useless company loses millions every year.Look at old beardo Branson – Sir Richard, entrepreneur and “philanthropist”.He wants YOU to pay HIM £million to bail out his airline, Virgin.This is a man who has paid not a single penny of income tax in the UK for fourteen years.But when his company is in trouble he expects you to bail him out.And this from a bloke who has already been coining it from the taxpayer for his awful rail franchises.This kind of bare-faced cheek almost beggars belief.Or there’s Apple boss Tim Cook boasting about sending a few safety masks to the UK.SO kind of you, Tim.Now how about your company pays its proper share of tax in the UK  Then we might not need your charity.Pope Francis has pleaded with the EU for countries to “come together” to fight the virus.Ha.

after Government scientists said last night that social distancing could continue until .In a press conference this lunchtime she said that ato normal as we knew it is not on the cards in the near future.But she wanted to be frank with you every step of the way and encouraged the public to engage in her plans to ease ruled and restrictions in the coming weeks.She told the nation that the lockdown was working but it was also doing long-term damage.It was causing harm to the economy, living standards, to children’s education, to aspects of our physical health and metal health and wellbeing.Her proposed plan for relaxing the lockdown included:Ms Sturgeon stressed the strict measures were still absolutely necessary, but said Scotland needs to chart a way forward to live with the virus over the coming months.What we must do is find a new normal, a way of living alongside this virus but in a form that keeps it under control and stops it taking the toll we know it can do, she said.The First Minister also said that the reproduction rate of the virus must be kept below one, with best estimates putting the figures somewhere between . and one.Some measures could be lted but others could be made tougher, she suggested, like Dominic Raab has previously suggested.And any lockdown could come back at any point - possibly with short notice, she warned.We want to ease restrictions but must be prepared for them to be reimposed as well as lted, Ms Sturgeon said.Echoing Professor Chris Whitty last night, she said that social distancing might have to be in place for at least the next year.The First Minister also urged Scots to engage with this discussion - and stressed that no decisions had yet been taken.Documents from the Scottish Government talked about the need for a transition into the next phase - much like the Brexit period Britain is in now.They also discussed the possibility of dferent areas with dferent rules, such as cities and towns having to abide by dferent lockdown measures.The documents stated the Government were considering dferent restrictions in dferent areas dependent on how the pandemic is progressing.But while they are helping save lives, who is there to help them The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealEarlier Ms Sturgeon revealed students may be allowed back to school part-time, with social distancing still in place.She told Heart Radio: We might have kids going back to school for certain days a week.We may have to have children in a classroom so that we can have social distancing.However, the UK Government has made it clear the UK will not leave lockdown unless several conditions are met - including a steady drop in new infections and deaths.And ministers have insisted they will not begin to talk about how the measures will end just yet because they dont want to muddy the water by talking about an exit.The focus should be on staying home, Government ministers have repeatedly said, and they dont want to confuse the message.Ms Sturgeons intervention comes as Brits start to head to parks and more people travel on the roads in defiance of lockdown restrictions as the weather heats up.More traffic was reported in last nights Downing Street press conference, as some begin to tire of the measures in place.Last night Professor Whitty said the nation was still weeks away from seeing a signicant decline in numbers.He said: We are working with a disease we are going to be with globally for the foreseeable future. lots of options which ministers will have to consider.They key to ending lockdown was to ease measures in way where no infected person is, on average, infecting more than one person.Ms Sturgeon also said she could introduce dferent measures in Scotland to that of the rest of the UK - comments Northern Irelands leader has stressed too.At the moment the UK is working together on a plan and there are no dferences in the approach for the four nations.Northern Ireland First Minister Arlene Foster has said measures could be eased at a dferent pace than in other parts of the UK.She said the criteria for easing restrictions will be set down and agreed by the Northern Ireland executive as well the UK Government.She told Cool FM this could mean dferent parts of the UK movedferent times.Discontent is also growing among Conservative backbenchers who are calling for a clear, safety-first exit strategy from shutdown to protect the economy.Treasurer of the  Committee Sir Geoffrey Clton-Brown is one of the leading voices in the demand for answers.Sir Geoffrey told BBC Radio : We need to start this discussion of how we get back to normality.Whatever we do needs to be done gradually, when the figures start to stabilise more in three to four weeks, hopefully we could begin to think about whats the next step.We have to think about the number of small businesses, who unless they get some form of business, may have to cease trading.We have to accept that at the moment a relatively small amount of the population has been exposed to the virus - we are going to expose more people to the virusHe said it was essential to open up parts of the economy, to rescue them from being completely decimated by the lockdown.I see no reason why garden centres, DIY stores with proper social isolating couldnt begin to open.Sir Geoffrey and other members of the  Committee of Tory backbenchers called a private meeting yesterday where they unanimously expressed deep concern of the continual lockdown, according to The Times.Sir Geoffrey said: The nation is quite ided on this and its up to the government, I think, to exercise leadership.Unless we do something fairly soon the economy is going to take a real hit.Vice Chairman of the committee Sir Charles Walker said There has got to be an economy to go back to.All MPs right now are dealing with dozensnot hundreds of local businesses that are fearing for their future.Building capacity within the NHS, reducing infection rates has to be the precursor to lting the economic lockdown.

At its best, the monarchy shines light on dark places, telling stories that would otherwise go untold and standing up for what’s right.It has been said that the Royal Family’s first obligation is to give back to the British people who fund them. I agree wholeheartedly. It is gravely concerning that these former royals, over many years, have sought to insulate themselves from taking accountability for what they say or do — even when they know it to be distorted,  and completely tone-deaf.When power is enjoyed without responsibility, the trust we all place in these very privileged people is degraded.It is a really hypocritical way of doing business and, quite frankly, it bores every corner of society.I have watched the Duke and Duchess of Sussex ditch crown and country at a time of need, by private jet, to make millions in Hollywood — for no good reason other than the fact they simply cannot bear the fair and honest reporting a free Press brings.With that said, please note I will not be engaging with Harry and Meghan’s PR spin. There will be no corroboration and zero engagement.This policy is also being instated for their long-suffering communications team. My heart truly goes out to their lone UK staffer James Holt, although I have far less sympathy for the dodgy practices offered by Hollywood PR company Sunshine Sachs— a side of the industry relating to celebrities readers never see.This policy is not about avoiding criticising Harry and Meghan.I’ll always be honest. It’s not about shutting down public conversation or censoring accurate reporting.The media have every right to report on — and indeed, have an opinion on — the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, good or bad. But it can’t be based on their lies.I also want to be very clear: This is not in any way a blanket policy for all royals .I’m looking forward to working with other dukes and duchesses all over the country, engaging with members of the Royal Family senior and junior and young up-and-coming royalsto spotlight issues and causes that desperately need acknowledging.And I look forward to doing whatever I can to help further opportunities for more under-represented royals, who are needed now more than ever .What I won’t do is offer myself up to the constant spin, fact-twisting and putdowns of their family members I’ve had to put up with from Harry and Meghan’s long-suffering staff for the past two years.I’m that encouraged this new approach will be heard and respected.Sun readers deserve to know what’s REALLY going on.NETFLIX managed to achieve the impossible this week with sex-obsessed new reality show Too Hot To Handle.They found a cast of millennials more backstabbing, vain, stupid and horny than ITV have ever managed with Love Island, which looks totally tame in comparison.It’s the biggest mind-numbing abomination I’ve seen on television in a very long time.But can I be totally honest with you – I absolutely loved every minute. px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-BBC--.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-BBC--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-BBC--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-BBC--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-BBC--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-BBC--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-BBC--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-BBC--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-BBC--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-BBC--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-BBC--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-BBC--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-BBC--.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\"  px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-R-KELLY-.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-R-KELLY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-R-KELLY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-R-KELLY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-R-KELLY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-R-KELLY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-R-KELLY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-R-KELLY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-R-KELLY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-R-KELLY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-R-KELLY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-R-KELLY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-R-KELLY-.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\" Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Ministers face fresh questions over an RAF plane which finally touched down yesterday after days of headlines. Cabinet minister Robert Jenrick first claimed on Saturday that a very large consignment of protective kit including , gowns would arrive the next day.Yet it was repeatedly delayed and eventually arrived at RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire at .am on Wednesday.Downing Street today refused to sayit contained the full shipment of protective kit.

Now the Health Service Journal reports that the consignment contained just , gowns - far short of the , promised.According to the respected publication for medical experts, the NHS currently goes through around , per day. The Department for Health and Social Care has been contacted for comment. It comes amid furious criticism of the government over the supply of personal protective equipmentfor NHS staff. Just before the HSJ story was published, Downing Street refused to give any detail on the Turkey flight.  The Prime Ministeraposs official spokesman told journalists: Iaposve got absolutely nothing for you on the Turkish flight, beyond saying that it arrived back in the UK yesterday, the items are being processed, and will be given to the NHS. Iaposve not got any details of that flight. The spokesman said million items of PPE were delivered to NHS trusts yesterday including gloves, aprons, masks, eye protectors and gowns.

The tests, until now restricted to frontline NHS and care staff and care home residents, will now be available to up to  million across the UK. The critical workers and their families will be able to book a test on a Government websitethey are displaying symptoms. Some , contact tracers will be hired to identy those who have come into close contact with an infected person so they can be quarantined. The dramatic expansion is part of the effort to ramp up both testing and contact tracing as the Government considers how to ease restrictions. Public Health England wants the system up and running in three weeks so it can be usedthe Government wants to ease restrictions at the next lockdown review on May . Health Secretary Matt Hancock said it was part of “getting Britain back on her feet”. He added: “Testing, tracking and tracing, done effectively, can help to suppress the transmission in a way that allows you to have lesser social distancing rules.” But with testing capacity standing at slightly over , – and just , actual tests carried out Thursday – there are fears the Government will struggle to meet demand. I It remains some way off from delivering on its pledge of , tests by the end of the month, with NHS and care staff already struggling to get them.  The criteria for which key workers qualy for tests will be similar to those used to decide whose children can still attend school. They will have to display current symptoms for the tests to work, as no successful antibodies test has yet been devised. Tests will be offered at dozens of drive-through sites, at mobile laboratories or at home, with up to , kits a day sent out via Amazon. Results from the drive-through sites will be sent out by text within  hours, and within  hours of collection of the home delivery tests.  Wales has already announced plans to expand testing to key workers including delivery drivers, food production workers, utility workers and key public service staff. Another  hospital deaths were announced yesterday, taking the total to ,, though the true figure including care home deaths could be more than ,. At the daily No press conference yesterday, Mr Hancock claimed capacity for carrying out tests had expanded “ahead of our plans”. Chief Scientic Adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said the Government was “on track” to delivering , tests a day in six days’ time. There are now just  drive-through sites – though ministers promised up to  within a week – and just four mobile labs, though the Army is expected to help deliver more. Cabinet minister Brandon Lewis said: “I think it’s dreadful that we can’t get more people tested. That’s why it’s important we do upscale the ability for people to access these tests.”  But Shadow Health Secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: “We have urged the Government to do more testing and consistently questioned why ministers were not moving to a test-and-trace strategy. It is crucial that greater numbers of critical workers are now able to access testing.” It came as the first two volunteers – a microbiologist and a cancer researcher – started trials for a coronavirus vaccine at Oxford University on Thursday. One was given the coronavirus dose while another was given a meningitis vaccine for comparison. Microbiologist Elisa Granato, who took part in the trial on her nd birthday, said: “I felt like this is a very easy way for me to support the cause.” Cancer researcher Edward O’Neill said: “It seems like the right thing to do.” Prof Sarah Gilbert, leading the team, said she was optimistic about the chances of success. The Oxford Vaccine Group hopes to repeat the process with six more volunteers on Saturday, moving to larger numbers on Monday. Up to , participants will be recruited across study sites in Oxford, Southampton, London and Bristol. The Cabinet met virtually yesterday to discuss how to start lting restrictions as the UK gets through the peak of the virus. One minister told the Mirror: “Testing, tracing and tracking is now the key priority. We hope the testing will now accelerate.” Yet just weeks ago Government health experts said mass testing, as carried out successfully in South Korea, was “not appropriate” for the UK. Downing Street appeared to admit yesterday that some of the restrictions could have to stay in place until next year.  The Prime Minister’s spokesman did not deny claims by England’s Chief Medical Officer that “very socially disruptive measures” could be needed into next year. Mr Hancock has set out plans for , people in England to take part in a study to track the virus in the population and determine how many people have developed antibodies. Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty warned the public must be “realistic” that the only way back to normal le is a vaccine or treatment. He added: “The probability of having those in the next calendar year are incredibly small.” "},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus home testing kits run","story":"NewsCoronavirus home testing kits run out within hours as key workers scramble to sign upTen million key workers are now being offered coronavirus teststhey need them - but just , home testing kits were available on the first day.

The key change however is that people now cannot now leave or remain away from their main residence It comes ahead of an announcement by the First Minister Mark Drakeford of a new framework and seven key questions to help lead Wales out of the pandemic. This will help determine when the right time comes for the stay-at-home restrictions to be eased. The government says the changes, which come into effect this weekend, will help clary that those who leave their home with a reasonable excuse - such as going to buy food, for healthcare or work - can’t remain outside to do other things. There are some new relaxed rules that also allow people with health conditions or disabilities to leave home to exercise more than once a day. This will help families with children with learning disabilities and autism in particular. The changes announced today will also allow some businesses in Wales to re-open and operate click and collect services. Mr Drakeford said that when the time is right lockdown could be left in three phases like a traffic light in reverse. The red phase would see only the most careful and controlled lting of restrictions, he told BBC Radio Wales. The amber zone would see more restrictions lted and,the virus is not re-emerging, Wales could then move to the green zone, he said. This period would look much more like the lives we had before the crisis hit, Mr Drakeford told Radio Wales Breakfast with Oliver Hides. Asked when Wales might enter the red zone, the first minister said I hope we will be in a position to do that at the end of the current three-week lockdown period. However he warned this would only happenWales had met the tests set out in the Welsh Governmentaposs framework for exiting the lockdown, which will be published later on Friday.

Health Secretary Matt Hancock set out his plans for easier, faster and simpler testing so more people can access a Covid- test to tellthey currently have the virus. At the daily Downing Street briefing, Mr Hancock said the capacity for carrying out tests was now ahead of our plans, with the ability to carry out more than , tests a day. But he still faces a huge hurdle to climb to reach his , target - almost double current levels - in a weekaposs time. Because capacity has now increased so substantially, we are now able to expand who can get the tests, he said.Our ultimate goal is that everyone who could benefit from a test gets a test. Mr Hancock said: Itaposs all part of getting Britain back on her feet. But you may have to drive for a -minute round trip to get a test and there could be heavy demand on new kits to be posted to your home. Hereaposs who is eligible and how the system will work. Who is eligible for a test  Those who the government has classied as essential workers in England and members of their households. The government say they hope that the devolved administrations will follow suit. In the UK there are around million people classed as essential workers but their households will also be eligible under the scheme. NHS staff and care home workers are already being referred for testing by their workplaces. But now other workers will be eligible. It it the same list of occupations used by the government to determine whether or not you can continue to send your children to school during lockdown. Key workers on the list are the same as those for access to schools, and include NHS and social care workers, police officers, teachers, social workers, those in the justice system, undertakers, some in local government, supermarket and food production workers, journalists, transport workers and some people in utilities and IT. A full list is below or on this web page. How sick do you have to be   You need to show symptoms in order to be tested. The main two are a new and persistent dry cough and a temperature. But other people who have tested positive for covid- include losing taste and a sense of smell.    It will showyou currently have Covid-. This is useful to proveyour symptoms are actually the virus. It does not showyouaposve had Covid- in the past. It will help people work out when they and their household members canto work safely. Where do I log on to book a test  Visit the governmentaposs web page. Where do I go to get tested     The first port of call is a drive-through testing centre -  of which are currently open, with  promised by the end of April. The government expects you to be able to drive for up to  minutes from your home to get to a drive-through site, leaving some with potentially a -minute round trip. WhatI canapost drive     For those who donapost live near enough to a testing site or canapost drive there are other options. The government has pledged that Royal Mail and Amazon will deliver home testing kits for the first time from Friday. The availability of these will be limited at first, at just , per day. Officials hope for this to scale up to , a day by the end of April. What about other ways of getting tested  Meanwhile apossatelliteapos test kits are also being sent directly to care homes to enable residents with symptoms to be tested. And the Army is helping set up mobile testing units which will travel the country to places like care homes, police stations and prisons. Itaposs not clear how these will help workers without a mobile unit or satellite kit at their place of work. How long will I wait for results     Test results from the drive-through sites will be sent out by text within  hours, the government says. For home delivery tests, the waiting time is  hours. Itaposs not clear how quickly a test will be booked in once youaposve asked for it - presumably it depends on demand. Why are essential workers getting tested  The aim is simple - to ensure they can get back to work. Because the test showsyou currently have Covid-, it also can given an indication that your cough is just a  alarm. So people whoaposve been self-isolating to protect others due to a mild cough can get back on the front line. Whataposs it like getting the test   The test involves taking a swab  of the nose and throat - and it goes back pretty far, so be prepared. A single swab is used to collect a liquid sample from the back of your throat and your nose. This swab is then placed into a sample tube and securely packaged, where it is sent to the lab for testing. Depending on where you get tested, you will either have a clinician take your swab or be asked to do it yourself.

Mr Hancock resisted demands for more transparency about how the lockdown would be ended. The Health Secretary said: I understand the thirst for knowledge. The tests that we have set out, which are the basis from which others - for instance the Scottish Government - have then developed their plans, those tests are the critical tests for when changes can be made. Of course, monitoring what is happening and making sure that we move at the right time is absolutely critical.  But the message remains the same - that people need to stay at home to protect the NHS and save lives. The reason that we have clarity on that message is that it has succeeded in bringing down and flattening the curve, but we are not through that yet and thereaposs an awful lot of work that still needs to be done, and we are absolutely determined to avoid a second peak. Chief scientic adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said people must keep up their commitment to social distancing, saying: Itaposs heading in the right direction, we must stay firm with the measures weaposre taking. Sir Patrick said there may be up to two or three weeks dferences in some places - so itaposs not that London is two weeks ahead of everywhere.  Thereaposs actually a lot of similarities across a number of areas, including big urban areas, and so I donapost think you should take the message at all that there is two weeks dference between London and the rest of the country. He said reducing lockdown measures was not as straightforward as saying that because you hit the peak two weeks early you can release things two weeks early. What needs to happen before lockdown is lted   . The NHS must be able to cope The slogan that the Government has championed from the start has been clear - Stay at home. Protect the NHS. Many of the measures put in place - including the opening of the Nightingale Hospital at the NEC in Birmingham, have been to reduce the burden that Covid- is having on the NHS. The last thing the Government wants is thousands upon thousands of patients needing medical treatment all at once, so until there is confidence that the NHS can cope, lockdown will remain in place.  . Fall in deathsThe daily death total makes for a grim reading each day, with hundreds of deaths recorded in hospitals as a result of coronavirus.And sadly, with deaths occurring in public and care facilities, the real number is almost certainly much higher. Mr Raab said the government will want to see a apossustained and consistent fall in deathsapos before any decision to lt restrictions will be made.

Health Secretary Matt Hancock yesterday claimed that tracing was “critical” to keeping the virus under control. Yet, just a few weeks ago we were told that tracing not appropriate. While the change of heart is welcome, the public will want convincing that the Government, which has a poor record on delivering PPE, has the ability to implement this new “test, track and trace” strategy. Ministers are still reluctant to provide a route map out of the lockdown. This is in stark contrast with Scotland’s Nicola Sturgeon, who yesterday explained the trade-offs involved in lting the restrictions. We could do with such honesty from our politicians in England. Slashed budget  The shocking rise in kne crime is a human tragedy and a political scandal. Last year saw the highest number of kne offences since records began. Behind each statistics is a person who lost their le or was seriously wounded. With the focus on Covid-, this may not get it attention deserves. But do not let the Government off the hook. The rise in kne crime is the direct result of a decade of austerity, in which police numbers were cut and youth centres were shut. Boris Johnson is now promising to recruit more police. But the PM deserves no gratitude for simply replacing the number of officers the Tories have cut. The Tories can never again claim they are the party of law and order.

The measures are due to next be reviewed on May  and Health Secretary Matt Hancock, in an indication the lockdown will be eased then, said he was preparing to ramp up contact tracing on a large scale as a way of keeping the virus under control. In the Commons on Tuesday, Mr Hancock said he was confident the country was at the peak of the outbreak but stressed that continued social distancing was currently needed to bring the number of new cases down.  He also said a contact tracing app which will alert peoplethey have been in contact with somebody with the virus and should self-isolate was currently in trials. He said: “We have to make sure we’ve got that evidence before we start touting around ideas. “The minute we can responsibly do so based on the evidence, we will.” Passenger numbers in London are down around % on the Tube and % on buses, cutting income from fares to a fraction of normal levels.

Mark Beaumont, , has been left devastated after his we Sharon, , died after contracting the killer virus.The mum-of-five passed away on Good Friday at the Princess Royal Hospital, in Orpington, Kent. Mark has driven Gareth and the team to and from the St Georgeaposs Park training ground, Wembley for matches and airports for international fixtures, for almost five years.  Following his weaposs death Mark received an outpouring of love and support from his community with £, being raised through a GoFundMe page. And Mark has revealed how he received a call out of the blue from Southgate offering his deepest sympathies and telling him: If there’s anything I can do, all you have to do is say the word. It was a touching offer from Southgate but came as no surprise to Mark. Mark said: “We’re just like one huge family.  When you see them out there, playing at Wembley, people don’t realise what it takes to get them there, what goes on behind the scenes. “I get involved in the kit as well, laundry. I’m not just the driver. I’ve been doing it for four or five years. “And to get a personal call from Gareth, he just said ‘If there’s anything I can do or the FA can do for your family, all you have to do is say the wordapos. “It’s just nice to hear. “We’re all just get on like a house on fire, he’s just fantastic. What you see is what you get.”  Sharon was rushed to hospital on March  after she began suffering from a temperature and cough over the weekend - before losing her sense of taste and smell. And she tragically passed away in intensive care on April  despite doctors working around the clock. The mum-of-five leaves behind daughters Laura, , Chantel, , Georgia, , son Lewis,  and granddaughter Amia, two. Tragically, Mark and Sharon lost their first daughter Chloe, after she was born with spina bida, a condition where the spinal cord and spine do not develop properly. Paying tribute to his “unbelievable darling” we, who he had been to married for almost  years, Mark said: “It’s a great loss to all of us. “Over the weekend, she started to have a temperature, dry cough and lost her sense of smell and taste. “After a few days, it just didn’t seem to be getting better so I rang  and they told us to self isolate for seven days but ring for an ambulancewe needed.  “On the eighth day, about am, she just couldn’t sleep, her temperature was up and down and I just knew she’d had enough. “I rang , and they redirected us to , which I did and they asked us to go to hospital. It was quite strange, there was no one  there. I was only allowed to stay for an hour. The next day, the family were told that Sharon had been diagnosed with pneumonia.  And two days later, Mark was told that she had also contracted coronavirus. He said: It just really escalated from there. She was on a normal oxygen mask first but then it turned out that she required a lot more oxygen. So she had to go on what they call a ers mask, which looked really uncomfortable. At that point she was on FaceTime with me and the family. It was so tough because at that time, we didnapost think it was going to end up the way it did. When she was on the ers mask, she couldnapost really say a lot because we couldnapost understand what she was saying. But, you know, obviously, she was looking at us and we were telling her she could get through it.  Then Iaposve got a phone call a couple of days later to say aposIaposm really sorry, Mark, but, unfortunately, sheaposs got to go on a ventilator.apos  Then the communication had to stop, it was an agonising time.Sharon, who had high blood pressure and Type  diabetes, was put in an induced coma - which she never came out of.Mark said: It was all up and down after that. One minute she looks like she was responding and it wasnapost happening. Then sadly, her kidneys started to fail so they put on dialysis. Then, I got the dreaded phone call from the doctors on Good Friday morning asking me to go to the hospital. I went into the hospital and spoke to the consultant and the head nurse.  And they said aposHonestly and truthfully, weaposve honestly done all we can for Sharon. But sheaposs got massive organ failure and internal bleeding as well.apos So I went and sat with her and FaceTimed her mum and it was just an awful time. And I got to say my goodbyes and be there when she passed. I came out and I just felt numb and empty. It felt like I was in a dream Iaposd wake up from. Mark then had the terrible task of telling the coupleaposs children that she had passed. Mark said:  Obviously, they knew that she was in hospital and I kept them informed all the time. We all prayed, Iaposm not a religious person, but Sharon was Catholic so we had candles and we had prayers every night. On the day she passed, they knew when I went that there was nothing  they could do. It was heartbreaking. Now the dedicated dad is planning her funeral - which can only have  guests due to coronavirus limitations. He said: We can only have  at the service, which is just immediate family. So thataposs been extremely dficult although it will also be on FaceTime. Itaposs just awful. You hear about it on the news and you hear about other people that may have contracted it and itaposs not too bad But when it when it hits home, itaposs just knocked us for six and the lockdown doesnapost help. But lucky for me, Iaposve got all my children around me and my little granddaughter. Weaposre all isolated together anyway, we did that from the onset, and itaposs the best thing weaposve ever done. Now Mark says he can feel the spirit of his we keeping him going amid the tragic circumstances. He said: I think sheaposs behind me pushing me. Sheaposs obviously saying to me, aposLook, come on Mark, you need to be strong for the family,they can see youaposre strong, theyaposre not going to feel so bad.apos I think her funeral is going to be one of the worst times. The couple met at a coach station in Harlesden where they were both working. Mark said: We both worked for the same company, I was a driver and then I was taken off the road. Sharon came in as secretary to the chairman. And I turned on the charm and when didnapost work, I just asked her out. The couple were set to celebrate their nd wedding anniversary on May th. But now, ahead of Sharonaposs funeral - the devoted husband has planned one final gesture to highlight his weaposs spirit. He said:  If there was one thing that me and Sharon were famous for, it was being late. Even on our wedding day, she was late. So Iaposve requested the undertaker to be five minutes late at the crematorium. Sheaposd thank me for this and sheaposd probably be laughing. Now Mark says he has been so grateful by the outpouring of love and support for his we. He said: Iaposm just so overwhelmed I havenapost got the words to express to people. I need to put out there a huge thanks, especially in this time of lockdown, when people donapost knowthey have jobs to go back too or much money. Itaposs times like this that our country pulls together. The amount of love weaposve been shown from people that I didnapost even know that knew Sharon, itaposs incredible. I just donapost have any words. I just get all choked up and start crying.

Last weekend it was claimed Government officials had drawn up a three-stage apostraffic lightapos system to end the UKaposs nationwide coronavirus lockdown.  The plan could see some non-essential businesses re-open in early to mid-May. This first phase green would reportedly include small, non-essential shops, hairdressers and nurseries - though travel would still be discouraged. The amber phase would see schools reopen, as well as small businesses and restaurants with strict seating rules. Wearing a mask on public transport would reportedly be compulsory in this phase, expected towards the end of May.

The Duchess of Sussex is bringing legal action against Associated Newspapers Ltd, publisher of the Mail on Sunday and MailOnline, over an article which reproduced parts of a handwritten letter she sent to her father, Thomas Markle. In court documents outlining Meghanaposs claim against the publisher, her solicitors say that the letter was obviously private correspondence and she did not expect the contents to be made public - and with no warning. They say her thoughts and feelings about the relationship with her dad were detailed by her at a time of great personal anguish and distress. Associated Newspapers wholly denies the allegations.  Sections of the letter, which was sent to Mr Markle, , in August , were published in February in the Mail on Sunday and on MailOnline. The headline on the article read: Revealed: The letter showing true tragedy of Meghanaposs rt with a father she says has aposbroken her heart into a million piecesapos. In one extract, the Duchess wrote: Your actions have broken my heart into a million pieces - not simply because you have manufactured such unnecessary and unwarranted pain, but by making the choice to not tell the truth as you are puppeteered in this.

She was one of four neighbours from Cumbria who scooped a share of £k playing People’s Postcode Lottery. And the surprise windfall, delivered on the  March, came on the very day she was due to welcome her two new bundles of joy into the world. Thrilled Caroline said: This year, we’ve been very lucky, it’s amazing. It’s also quite weird how our prize arrived on our twins’ original due date. I think we’ll use the money first to go on holiday, maybe two, somewhere like the Canaries so not too far for the kids.  I’m so happy we started playing People’s Postcode Lottery a few years ago. It’s a mix of a feel-good factor knowing you’re helping charities by playing and that there’s a chance of winning yourself – it’s double awesome! Caroline’s partner, Paul, added: It doesn’t seem real, but it is. It does mean a lot of arguing about who gets to spend the money though! We’ve only been in this home for six months and the cellar needs dug out and the outbuilding is needing done up. This will help us a lot to get that going.” People’s Postcode Lottery ambassador, Judie McCourt, visited Caroline and Paul to give them their prize in person. Judie said: “Handing over the golden envelope to Caroline and Paul on what was their twins’ original due date, was utterly heart-warming.

Helen Shires, , from Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, drank four cans of Stella Artois for aposDutch courageapos before yanking out the gnasher with dental floss. She initially used a kitchen kne to loosen the tooth up after enduring three agonising nights without any sleep. The mum-of-two took matters into her own hands after she called  and was told there was nothing they could do unless it was le-threatening, she claims. She told : I was using a sharp kitchen kne. I got the tooth loose and I could feel with my tongue the root was exposed. Then I got the floss, wrapped it around and twisted it under and wrapped it around again and kept tugging. I didnapost dare do it so I had some alcohol for some Dutch courage.I just pulled it and it shot across the garden. The pain stopped instantly. I had to search for it ... I found it in the grass.She previously had an appointment booked to remove the gnasher, however this was cancelled when the coronavirus lockdown was announced.She rang the practice for help when her toothache became too much, however her call went straight through to voicemail.  Ms Shires said she finally removed her tooth on April  after being told by  that all they could do was ask a dentist to ring her.

She said the showers will start in the north and are likely to drt their way southwards with the country continuing to get cooler into next week. Met Office weather maps show temperatures in the mid teens on Monday, but will feel much cooler with winds gusts of almost mph.A far cry from the scorching heat of the last week - though it will help to average out some of the rainfall the land has been lacking so far this month. According to Met Office forecaster Simon Partridge, at the start of the week the UK had already seen  per cent of its average sunshine for April, but just  per cent of its rain. While the Met Officeaposs long range forecast predicts a risk of further showers on Tuesday, as well as plenty of cloud and perhaps some heavier downpours of rain and breeze. Though this month has been sitting more than C above the average for April, though despite bookies slashing the odds it appears unlikely the C high on April recorded in Treknow, Cornwall, will be beaten before the summer.

Branding those who have been panic-buying supplies such as toilet paper absolutely ridiculous, he continued: That is the sort of person that is causing the problem in the whole country.

He claimed that he had as many as  people working with him to buy up the highly-sought after commodities.

season in the lower isions and dish out much-needed prize money.That was after the American’s initially-intended “no” vote changed to a “yes” to allow the resolution to pass in exchange for firm promises on league reconstruction five days later.That sparked an outcry from the club’s fans over the U-turn which saw Dundee United crowned Championship winners.And the Dundee Supporters Association – which is made up of  clubs comprising , members – sent an email to the Dens supremo asking for “clarity” over the change in position and how it would benefit the Dark Blues.Nelms responded with a club statement to reiterate he “got the best deal possible out of a situation that was going to be bad for us in any iteration proposed” and followed that up with a phone conversation with DSA chairman Kenny Ross.The DSA committee then released a statement stating they were pleased that the push for league reconstruction shows Nelms and owner Tim Keyes “are in this for the long haul”.The statement included: “We were pleased that the club not only released an updated statement later that day but that managing director John Nelms also personally contacted a member of the DSA committee by phone.“Mr Nelms was more than able to adequately explain the club’s thought processes and position and demonstrate how he was able to get the best possible outcome for Dundee Football Club in an impossible situation.“When Dundee realised their vote hadn’t been cast on April , the dynamic changed and it is clear to the DSA that Mr Nelms has worked tirelessly since and as a result of the SPFL releasing the results of the ballot before all of the member votes were in, was put in an unfair, undemocratic and dficult position.“With regards to league reconstruction we suspect that none of the  SPFL chairmanpushed harder for it than John Nelms and, as a result, a working party has been established to discuss it, which was not on the table in the original resolution.“It would not have been convened had Dundee voted ‘No’ as they had originally intended and this has to be a good thing and in the best interests of Dundee FC.“We were therefore pleased to learn that John himself will be on that working group and gives proof,any were needed that John and Tim Keyes are in this for the long haul.“The DSA are therefore happy and satisfied that Mr Nelms worked in best interests of both Dundee FC and Scottish football in general and got the best possible outcome for our club in a very dficult situation.“The Dundee FC Supporters Association has had a good working relationship with Mr Nelms and his board in recent years and we are grateful that he responded to our request swtly and satisfactorily and look forward to this relationship continuing in the future.”EXCLUSIVE: John Nelms answers fan worries saying #yes# vote got best possible deal for Dundee\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp exclusive-dundee-fans-want-answers-from-john-nelms-over-vote-u-turn embed # secretVsoNNDXU\" data-secret\"VsoNNDXU\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\""},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/02/5a7adc2de81c8-557x564.jpg ","title":"dundee united dave bowman monchengladbach jim mclean","story":"Dundee United legend Dave Bowman believes their  win over Borussia Monchengladbach trumps Barcelona and Roma as the club’s greatest-ever result.United saw off the Germans - at the Bokelberg Stadion  years ago today to reach the Uefa Cup Final thanks to second-leg goals from Iain Ferguson and Ian Redford.They had beaten Barca - on aggregate in the previous round, while a -  European Cup semi-final first-leg win over the Italians at Tannadice is in the history books despite United not making the final.However, Tangerines hero Bowman remembers the Monchengladbach result with most fondness.“Monchengladbach were a really big team at the time, both them and Barca were, but I think the big thing was Monchengladbach got us into a final,” the former United midfielder said.“Nobody remembers who loses the semi-final. I wasn’t there at the time but nobody really remembers the Roma European Cup semi-final too fondly but they’ll always recall Barcelona and Monchengladbach.“Getting into the final was a massive thing for the city and the club but at the time, as players, nothing was really a surprise for us.“We were expecting to get there so when we did it was great to do, don’t get me wrong, but it wasn’t as much of a surprise to us as it was outsiders.“At that time there was the European Cup, Cup Winners’ Cup and the other teams went into the Uefa Cup.“When you think about that in recent terms, Liverpool didn’t win the league last season but they won the Champions League.“That was the sort of level we were up against. It was a huge achievement.”Bowman recalls United going into the second leg riled up after witnessing some premature celebrations from the Monchengladbach players after a stalemate in Dundee.The -year-old also remembers a rare occasion where legendary boss Jim McLean inidually congratulated his players after the final whistle.Bowman, who made  appearances in tangerine, added: “Under wee Jim we were always taught, unless it was the second leg and you had to win at home, as long as you didn’t lose a goal it was OK.“That was the biggest thing, from our point of view, we didn’t get beat and we weren’t up against it.“I remember they were celebrating after the first leg and that probably gave us a bit of impetus to go on and beat them.“They were high-fiving each other because they got a - and thought the tie was over so that annoyed us a bit.“It made such a dference for us going there at - and Iain getting the goal just before half time.“They had to really come at us because they needed to score two.“Going into half time it was a massive advantage but I can’t really remember us being under that much pressure.“We knew they had to score two which was a tough ask against our defence. It was quite comfortable.“They didn’t have a lot of chances. Big Thommohad some great games and made some big saves that season but I can’t really remember him having to be brilliant.“Heggiesaid to me after it, ‘You should take this all in,’ and I was probably very naïve and just thought this happens every year, we’ll do it again next year.“I probably didn’t appreciate it as much as what I probably should have. It’s only when you look back.“It’s probably one of the only times I can recall Jim coming round and shaking everybody’s hand in the dressing-room after the game.“He really pushed us to our limits and got the best out of everybody. If he could see you had something he would get it out of you, how he did it was irrelevant.“He was very guarded towards us but he went round and congratulated everyone inidually.”United went on to lose the final - over two legs against IFK Gothenburg, with a - Scottish Cup Final defeat to St Mirren sandwiched in between.Bowman believes had they beaten the Buddies they might’ve gone on to secure the Uefa Cup, too.He continued: “It shows how much the SFA helped us at the time! We played the Scottish Cup Final on the Saturday and the second leg of the Uefa Cup Final on the Wednesday.“It was for the good of Scottish football we were trying to win it as well. I thinkwe’d beaten St Mirren, we would’ve had a lot better chance.“There’s no way of saying we’d have definitely beat Gothenburg because they were a decent team but the St Mirren loss was the first down we’d had that season.“Everything was on the up all the time, even with the amount of games we’d played that year.“It was the first time the press had questioned our fitness because we’d played that many games.“You’re never tired when you’re winning but as soon as you get beat that can quickly change.“Personally, all the finals don’t mean anythingyou don’t win. You want to have success by winning and savouring that.”🔵 In these troubled times, when many people are struggling to get out for their paper, we are pledging to help readers by providing a FREE digital edition of the Eveningfor three months.

In an ideal world I’d like to see an even bigger league with Dundee given the chance to join United in the Premiership.Whether that can happen, we’ll have to wait and see.We’re right at the start of the process so I’m sure almost anything is still on the table.I hope all the clubs in this area get something out of reconstruction. What we get should be better for Scottish football.I just hope we can avoid the same sort of voting farce we had  days ago with the SPFL.Dundee and managing director John Nelms were left in an impossible position, evensome of the behaviour has been questionable.As far as I’m concerned we should move on now and look to a better future. Ideally one with United and the Dark Blues in the top flight together.I know the existing Premiership clubs would certainly want the Dee up, too.What we know for sure, having seen the goings-on for the past couple of weeks, is clubs will only vote for something that is in their own interest. That’s just the way the world is.The good news, I think, for Dundee in all that is having them catapulted into the top flight would be seen to have plenty of plus points for it.Just ask Aberdeen – having both our city clubs back in the top flight gives them more decent away crowds coming to Pittodrie and their fans good away days.They wouldn’t be the only ones that benefit from having the Dundee derby back in the Premiership.We need the biggest teams at the top table – make it happen!It’s a few days ago now but I want to offer my congratulations to Robbie Neilson and his team after Dundee United were crowned Championship winners.The Tangerines have been in pole position right from the first whistle and it’s more than deserved for all at Tannadice.We don’t know what the top flight might look like come next season but the main objective has been achieved by Robbie – get United back in the big time.That’s been the target for four years now.It’s taken far longer than anyone associated with the club would have liked but they’ve finally done it.With all the noise going on over the past couple of weeks over the season, just having their top spot confirmed must be a huge weight off their shoulders.With the way the world is, relief will be the main feeling I’d bet for Robbie, Tony Asghar and Mark Ogren.They’ve done their bit – now it’s about improving the team for a shot at what is likely to be a bigger Premiership next campaign.Well done United!Having only seen the info that’s come out in the press, I’ve found Dundee United’s fall-out with a supporters’ group strange.It sounds like the money the Dundee United Supporters’ Foundation were looking to put into the club would be a benefit for everyone at Tannadice.There’s obviously been a disagreement behind the scenes but it doesn’t sit right with me having a go at your own fans – and on the day before the club were crowned champions, too.Jackie McNamara being up and about again was great to see last week. We were together in Scotland squads and he helped me a lot at that time. It’s fantastic to hear he’s on the mend again after a real health shock.🔵 In these troubled times, when many people are struggling to get out for their paper, we are pledging to help readers by providing a FREE digital edition of the Eveningfor three months.

They weren#t.In the end, Bus made three starts, although he did find time to score an own goal against Inverness Caledonian Thistle # a performance then-EE columnist and club legend Stewart McKimmie described as #simply woeful#.Midfielder Fabiano made nine starts for the Dons in the   season under Ebbe Skovdahl and then Steve Paterson.The Frenchman had formerly been at PSG and Swansea before arriving at Pittodrie.Made similarly few appearances in the French lower leagues after his Reds spell.

Included in this is the Isle of Jura.This is as shockingly reckless as it is offensive.The Isle of Jura is not a #bolthole# as the Daily Mail has chosen to state but a very beautul island steeped in culture and rich history.On both Jura and Islay we, like so many rural areas, are struggling to deal with all of the challenges related to the Corona virus out break. Our local health services have very limited resources as it is, along side a population that has many elderly residents who are more at risk to the virus.We have seen a local uptick in people traveling to Islay in camper vans and this is happening at a time when the UK government is advising against non essential travel.Those who are choosing to travel to our islands of Islay, Jura and the many other islands in Argyll and Bute in order to avoid the coronavirus may end up inadvertently spreading it to islands who arenot as much affected in the same way as so many built up urban areas are. Such actions are as reckless as they are selfish and I would implore people who do not need to travel to our rural constituency to avoid doing so until this global pandemic has passed.Jura, Islay and the rest of Argyll are some of the most beautul places you will ever visit and you won#t find an area where the people are more hospitable and friendly but while this crisis is ongoing I would ask everyone who is not currently living here to avoid traveling here for the time being.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands ward.To the Scottish public,During this time of unprecedented uncertainty, we are all concerned about the safety and wellbeing of our families, friends and colleagues.Our hearts go out to those who have been affected personally by the outbreak of coronavirus , as well as the many communities around the world that are facing extreme measures in an attempt to slow its spread.We appreciate and are mindful of the challenges iniduals are currently facing as well as the impact this pandemic has had on our vital emergency services as well as the grocery retail sector, supply chain and producers.Like our retail partners, we want to take this opportunity to assure you that Scottish farmers, auctioneers, hauliers, processors and butchers are doing everything they can to maintain the ongoing availability of fresh, locally sourced Scotch Beef PGI, Scotch Lamb PGI and Specially Selected Pork.We would like to thank all those who work in the Scottish red meat industry and their families for their ongoing and unwavering efforts to keep our supermarket shelves and butcher shops stocked, fuelling Scotland with top-quality red meat during this challenging time.As bodies supporting the Scottish agricultural and red meat industry, we are constantly reviewing the developing situation and are doing all we can to support everyone involved in putting nutritious food on your plates.Alan Clarke, chief executive, Quality Meat ScotlandMartin Morgan, executive manager, Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers Duncan Todd, secretary, Scottish Beef Association Jen Craig, president, National Sheep Association Scotland Penny Montgomerie, chief executive, Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs and Gordon King, executive manager, Scottish Craft Butchers.What on earth is going on  It was banal enough when Ben Goldsmith # English financier and environmentalist # tweeted that #overgrazing# by upland sheep farmers, was responsible for the devastating floods in South Wales, rather than record-breaking torrential rainfall.Unbelievably we now have a government official, Dr Tim Leunig, suggesting the whole of the UK does not need farming, and his comparison of the UK to Singapore in this context is absolutely ludicrous. You truly have to wonderthere is something in the water that he is drinking – could it be flood contamination Surely, every person having a full and ing set of neurons and synapses, the complete opposite is the truth, as we dearly need our hard working farming community.The UK Government should be fully supporting the farming industry and indeed, good land management. The Welsh Assembly has totally lost its way with its mindless policy of devastating Welsh forests with thousands and thousands # an understatement # of trees being felled for wind farms, and compounding the felony by covering acres of land with very limited electricity generating solar parks # Wales is not the Sahara and the sun disappears at night! Solar  will generate about  per cent of their maximum capacity in the UK.Returning to farming perhaps some kind person should tell Dr Tim Leunig that the answer lies in the soil and then lead him to a darkened and quiet room so he can lie down and contemplate the truth # wise men recognise that truth is the daughter of time, not of authority.Dave Haskell, Cardigan."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part 10","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat a night! All of us were agreed that never had we experienced anywhere a worse one and we were glad we had been in Loch Aline on Sunday night not in Tobermory as intended as, from what we heard, that night had been similar but twice as bad.It was a wild night lashing with rain and a big swell was rolling in from the north-east causing us to pitch and roll horribly. Everything banged and rattled and the ropes, despite their lashings, slapped on the mast, the chain rugged continuously on the bobstay, and there was one most annoying thump that kept everyone awake .We could not trace its origin until in desperation the Pilot donned oilskins, sou’wester and seaboots, and went on deck and found it was the tiller end bumping on the bulwarks. The Pilot had a very justiable grouse about this as he had suggested lashing the tiller, but the Skipper had said that he did not think it necessary and that we would lie easierit was allowed to go free.About six we heard Murdoch in Venture hailing us and the Skipper and Pilot hurried on deck. The yachts in the harbour were all lying higgledy-piggledy owing to the swell, to there being little or not wind, to the strong surface current from the swollen river, and to it being about the turn of the tide.Venture and Fulmar were lying stern to stern and what had aroused Murdoch was that the Venture had got her mizzen boom over our main boom and as we pitched we had lted it up crutch and all – how nothing was broken was a miracle. She had then swung round and her now free boom had knocked the cap off our jackstay. As the Skipper came on deck Venture again surged towards us and started pitching and her counter came down with a terric slam not six inches from our bulwarks. We put our helm over and swung clear.Murdoch and Barclay were both in their dog-house and the Pilot and Skipper stayed in ours until the new tide took charge and the boats began to swing in normal fashion and all were able to retire once more to their bunks. Luckily the rain had cleared off shortly before this episode took place.At a quarter to eight we heard the usual poor forecast but for the first time since the cruise began there was not a gale warning for any area. The glass had risen well during the night. What wind there was was from the north-west.The Skipper went ashore for the milk and rolls. The dinghy had a lot of water in it and owing to the rolling it was impossible to get into it and balance on the thwarts till it was baled so the Skipper got his feet thoroughly soaked – the simple remedy of wearing seaboots had never occurred to him. Again the rolls were sold out and again he had to take porter biscuits.On board the Pilot lit the fire then started in to get our breakfast of bacon and egg.

From his throne he dispensed news, advice and anecdotes – albeit not always historically accurate. His inimitable irony, perfectly-timed humour and the occasional reprimand to a wayward customer were all fuelled by a generous glass.As former president of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association and Keeper of the Quaich, Donald knew the intricacies of the business intimately from personal experience. His taste was eclectic and his appetite substantial, extending from Dom Perignon and Saint-Émilion Grand Cru to Tennent’s lager and Glen Dronach single malt. On a hot day he’d have an icy Martini or a gin and tonic, proportionately scaled up in a pint glass. Being askedhe had time for a quick ‘small one’, he would reply: #I’ll decide the size for myself,you don’t mind.#The records suggest that his frequent claim to be Scottish Slimmer of the Year, after getting his weight down from  stone to  stone, was fancul.Big D, as he was often called, was fastidious about standards in the little public bar, training his regulars to clear tables of empty glasses and plates promptly, and to keep the log fire stoked on winter evenings.If one of his regulars turned up untypically well-dressed, Donald would raise an eyebrow in mild surprise:  #What’s the occasion for the suit   A funeral   Your latest marriage   Or has your court case come up #In summer, an erratic stream of foreign tourists would have their first encounter with a Scottish pub, standing in the doorway bewildered as to what happens next – sit or stand  Fight their way to the mobbed bar or go to a table and wait for the non-existent waitress  Donald would call them over to his corner and was soon plying them with drinks, food and conversation, not infrequently paying the entire bill for his astonished guests.When a tourist asked him about the quaint red GPO telephone box in Church Square, he told them: #We have the fastest modern communications here – telephone, teletext and tell Donald.#Donald was a Francophile and loved his summers in Collioure, where #Le Grand Ecossais# was almost as well-known as in Argyll. A fixture of the local bars and restaurants, and frequently crossing the border to patronise Spanish hostelries, he revelled in the region’s seafood, wine and culture.His hobbies included cooking, opera, reading and lively conversation on a sweeping range of topics from local history to civil engineering. His knowledge was genuinely wide, but when occasionally encountering someone with a superior command of the topic in question, he would quickly change the subject and admonish: “Och, you’re showing off now.”Donald Clark was born on  July , in Rotten Row hospital, Glasgow. He was the youngest child of Donald Clark and Elizabeth Inglis, following by nine years his only sibling, Fiona.His early years were spent in Inveraray where family le revolved around his parents’ hotel in the little white-washed town.He was schooled at Inveraray Primary and Larchfield in Helensburgh, then Strathallan from  to  where he acquired his love of sports. Contrary to what his dimensions in later le would suggest, he was athletic when young, excelling at rugby and playing for his school and West of Scotland First XV and the old boys’ As.Donald also enjoyed curling, motor boating, snow skiing and water-skiing, where his party piece was to mono-ski down Loch Fyne while drinking a pint of beer.Although not a shinty player, he used his sports experience to coach the Inveraray team in the s and like his father chaired the club.

We have three dogs and three cats in foster that were in place before the lockdown. We are trying to support them as much as possible.\"Unfortunately, the lockdown means that we cannot re-home any animals at this time. We had people lined up to come and meet two of the dogs on the week that the country went into lockdown and had to cancel their appointments due to this.\"Also, Pal, who has been waiting for over a year for a new home, was due to go away to his new home that week which has had to be put on hold. And we have no idea when he can finally go to his new home.\"And the centre isnt just coping with the stress of caring for the animals during a crisis, theyre also facing potential financial strain as the weeks progress.\"Our centre relies heavily on income generated from our four shops,\" added Lee-Ann. \"Seventy per cent of our annual income is generated via the shops so loss of income is a real concern.\"We have had to cancel fundraising events during the key fundraising period of spring summer. This includes our Annual Dog Show in May which is one our biggest fundraising events.\"We are hopeful that not all staff go down with virus at same time.\"We are managing the situation to the best of our ability and [despite] that our weekly income has reduced very signicantly, and we need people to donate to help keep our centre operational whilst our shops are closed.\"All our animals are still being looked after and cared for by our excellent and committed staff.\"Sonia Graham from Borders Greyhound Rescue added: \"Were trying to make the best of the situation.\"We have  dogs at the moment because we cant get dogs in or out. Its dficult.\"Weve had some under fostering, but unless they are greyhound people they wont be going to foster.\"Its frustrating because for people who want dogs, youd think this was the perfect time to have one as theres time for one-on-one training.\"And a lack of volunteers is a key factor in the dficulties facing the Greyhound Rescue now, with the charity normally taking in up to  regular helpers to care for  dogs.\"Without volunteers, its been a real struggle,\" said Sonia. \"Were family-run and we have a farm too, so were just trying to fill the gaps left by volunteers.\"Another problem which has reared its head for Sonia and her family is the knock-on effect of this lockdown.Sonia explained: \"People who may have lost jobs or their business, they wont be thinking of taking on an animal.\"People cant afford to pay vet bills. I can see this being a dficult year.\"If anything, we may see animals being handed in. People will misjudge and panic about the situation. And it wont just be dogs being brought to rescues but being dumped.\"It will be interesting to see how this all works out.\"And to help ease the strain on the rescue, Sonia has created an Amazon wishlist for donations to help keep the dogs fed.The wishlist gives donors the option to either donate physical items, such as a bag of food, or they can gt a cash amount straight into the Greyhound Rescues account to spent on vital products.On the other hand, the Arthurshiel Rescue Centre, in St Boswells, hasnt seen an increase in their four-legged residents, with the charity manager Shona Middlemass saying: \"Were managing fine\".She added: \"Weve not had an influx of animals, any strays that get raised with us we share over Facebook.\"Fingers crossed everything keeps going smoothly, weve not had any problems.\"We dont have any cash coming in. Cat and dog boarding is our main source of income.\"Wed normally have five or six dogs, And Easter last year we were full with ten cats boarding.\"We rely on people going on holiday, and weve now had cancellation right up to July.\"However, the rescue has received some good news recently.Border Terrier Teddy, who went to a foster home last month, has been dubbed a failed foster, as he is likely to be kept by his foster family, finding his forever home.And its not just your average pets who are being impacted by the pandemic.The Scottish Borders Donkey Sanctuary, which was due to reopen for the Spring season in mid-March, still has donkeys available for adoption and sponsorship, and is operating as business as usual.John from the Sanctuary said: \"We hope to continue routine hoof trimming, tetanus booster injections , worming and de-lousingas and when they are due on a welfare basis.\"All the rescues are doing their best to meet social-distancing guidelines while also ensuring the well-being of their animals.Borders Pet Rescues Lee-Ann added: \"Please do not come to the centre and only contact centre by phone or email and the staff will help you as much as they can.\"If members of the public have any donations for the centre or charity shops, then we ask that you please keep them until it is safe to deliver them.\"People can donate via our Facebook and web page.\"For more information on these four rescues, you can find them at: Borders Pet Rescue, www.borderspetrescue.org Scottish Borders Greyhound Rescue, www.greyhoundtrust.org.uk Arthurshiel Rescue Centre, facebook Arthurshiel-Rescue-Centre- and The Scottish Borders Donkey Sanctuary, donkeyheaven.org"},{"url":null,"title":"ex-radio-borders-dj-went-rome-become-priest","story":"A Galashiels priest-in-training has spoken to the Borderabout his time in the Vatican and what it was like being filmed by the BBC for a new documentary, which is being aired this weekend.Former Radio Borders DJ Bobby Taylor was in his fth year at The Scots College in Rome when filming for the BBCs Priest School began in September . He is now coming to the end of his sixth year.The -year-old, whose mother is Catholic, had always had the inclination to become a priest, even applying to train before, but for reasons-unknown never followed up on these applications.It wasnt untilgoing to confession in Melbourne in , not long after the passing of his father two years earlier, that he started seeing a path to priesthood laid out clearly in front of him ndash particularly thanks to guidance from his own parish-priest in Galashiels.When we spoke to Bobby, who is back in Galashiels, he told us: \"Since filming ended, the most visible thing thats changed is that when were in Rome now were wearing collars.

The school has an approximate  percent drop-out rate as the young men learn more of what God is calling them to do, and as they face the sometimes hard-to-accept vows which they must take.\"Every guy is dferent,\" said Bobby. \"To be honest, Im not  percent sure  percent is the rate of drop out Ive experienced over the past few years Ive been there. Theres only been two or three guys out of - whove left.\"Me, personally, my first year was probably my toughest year. It was a big adjustment from that freedom I had, and having gone from earning quite a healthy wage working at sea, then going to seminary in a foreign country ndash it was quite a challenge.\"There was a period where I did have to really, seriously, pray about it and think about what I was being called to do.\"I think everybody goes through it, and I think its a good thing that everybody goes through because ultimately thats what seminary is about.,params: .push\"Seven years isnt a number plucked out of mid-air, its a period where youre doing a lot of study but youre also doing a lot of work to understand what it is youre being called to do, andits being called to priesthood because its not a light undertaking, its quite a serious undertaking ndash but a good one, and a positive one.\"And the problems facing Bobby and his fellow seminarians have only grown since the COVID- lockdown.He added: \"From about six weeks ago being in Rome and studying in the university with my class of about  other guys, Im now sitting in a dining room in a Catholic church house in Galashiels studying on my own.\"So things have changed quite a bit. But study still continues, its not like theyve stopped. Theres been a couple of weeks, this week and last week, which would have been the Easter holidays anyway.\"Although we may be spread out, back to our home countries, were still persevering with study.\"And in June, Bobby hopes to sit his exams which will see him move into his seventh year at the Scots College.

But the lockdown has compelled me to spend more time in the natural world on my back doorstep.And within the embrace of my gardenrsquos re-wilded forest horizon, although only a space of around  metres by , I have discovered the truth contained in the wonderful book by Scott Sampson How to Raise a Wild Child.In his book, Scott states: ldquoWhen I began on this book, I had a certain sense of self-satisfaction, convinced that a letime of outdoor play, hiking and campinghellip had forged within me a deep bond with naturehellip Instead, I found that, like most of us, I was oblivious to most of the natural goings-on around me.He explains how he then spent time with his daughter absorbing the sounds and sights of nature on his doorstep, which fostered their lsquointernal wildnessrsquo more than any trip to a remote wilderness. They listened to birdsong and sat quietly as small creatures played out their lersquos dramas under the shadow of their house. ldquoWildness just outside the front door, Scott writes, ldquowas helping us deepen our bond with nature. Such interactions, I have come to realise, are essential to nature connection.Reading this has given new meaning to the confinement imposed by the lockdown. Never before have I had such time to simply sit and absorb the tiny goings on in the garden, embraced by my own mini forest horizon.A garden is a privilege, of course, and I understand many donrsquot have one. But wildness can also be found on our walk to the shops, on verges and public green spaces, with trees, bushes and wild flowers that grow in our urban spaces. The trick is to pause and absorb the wonder of it, listen and look for the wee miracles that we usually donrsquot notice and walk by. Itrsquos easier now, even on a normally busy street, with so much reduced traffic noise and absence of bustle.On my exercise walk yesterday I did just this and was overwhelmed by the beauty of renewed le. It occurred to me that this precious one-walk-a-day has intensied the connection it gives me to local nature.And never have I enjoyed the privilege of having a re-wilded garden so much. On Easter Monday I sat in it with my five-year-old son. His attention span can be short but I explained what we were doing and he stayed with me for  minutes. The first thing I noticed was the absence of normal background noise, which heightened the volume of naturersquos spring melody.Our garden attracts many birds which sit on the branches and sing their hearts out. I know they donrsquot sing for us, but my young son thought they were doing just that. In just  minutes we heard or saw coal tits, wrens, wood pigeons, willow warblers, magpies and a robin. Irsquod never have previously known what some of these birds were, but now we are in a mindset to get to know who is inhabiting our lsquodoorstep wildnessrsquo.We also watched a peacock butterfly explore our garden as it fluttered and paused in equal measure. The sound of bumblebees arrived and we saw them hover over the dandelions. Then a small honey bee made an entrance, likewise visiting the dandelions. As we sat quietly, the sound of honking above us raised our heads and we saw two V formations of geese heading north.When my boy got restless, I suggested we crawl like explorers in the grass to see what we could find. We spotted an incredible sight: young garden spiders emerging from their egg sack which was half hidden under a curve in a plant pot. My sonrsquos fascination at this was matched by my own! It was early for this to happen, and we found many other egg sacks where still unhatched.Within these  minutes there was so much le and wonder so many stories to discover. Where did the small birds come from, where were the geese going, why do bees suddenly appear and what did they do during the winter  Why are dandelions so popular with the bees, what is so special about them  Why do the birds sing dferently, are they speaking to each otherso, what are they saying How did the peacock butterfly get its name and where did it hibernate, was it in our garden shed  What was it looking for  Were the hatching spiders emerging early because their mother deliberately chose a warm corner in the garden to lay her eggs  Why do some spiders live in the garden, while others like hiding under your bed  Do you know how to spot the dference, and do they spin their webs dferently These were just some of the stories my son and I wondered about after our  minutes together in our garden wilderness. But such drama happens all around us. Little patches of mini wilderness are everywhere,we hone our senses to notice and appreciate them.I realise now the lockdown, although stressful, has created the conditions for the discovery of so many new things, with so many new nature stories to learn tales of survival and adventure, of lersquos drama happening on our doorstep and in our street.And the biggest story of all is that everything around us is ultimately related. We are part of naturersquos story because we are part of nature. We share a common ancestor with every creature and plant yes, even with the trees.So while I, like us all, yearn for the end of the lockdown for many reasons, I am also going to try to make the best of it by being more aware of naturersquos wonders that are literally outside my window, while I stay at home to help keep others safe."},{"url":null,"title":"uk-economy-braces-biggest-recession-300-years-due-lockdown---likely-recover","story":"While adjusting to le in isolation has been dficult, businesses have been hit particularly hard by the restrictions, with the budget watchdog now warning the country could suffer its biggest recession in  yearslockdown continues into the summer.The Office for Budget Responsibility has said the economy could shrink by  per cent this spring, with unemployment levels reaching . million over the coming months - its highest level since the s.The struggling economy has sparked comparisons to the financial crash in , and the Great Depression of the s, but experts are now predicting the outcome will be much worse.Experts now believe the UK is headed for its biggest economic slump since , when the country was hit by a deep freeze that spread across Europe.Temperatures plummeted on January , bringing with it the worst winter in  years and freezing over several countries, including France, England and Russia.The lsquoGreat Frostrsquo, as it came to be known, lasted for three months and sparked food shortages, thousands of deaths in France, and a huge deficit to the economy.The coronavirus pandemic could see the economy shrink by a record  per cent by June, the Office for Budget Responsibilityhas warned.A drop this big would mark the largest decline ldquoin living memory, Robert Chote, chairman of the OBR has said.However, Chancellor Rishi Sunak stressed that this forecast is just one possible scenario, and it merely suggests the scale of what the country is currently facing will have ldquoserious implications for our economy.He said: ldquoWe came into this crisis with a fundamentally sound economy, powered by the hard work and ingenuity of the British people and British businesses.ldquoOur planned economic response is protecting millions of jobs, businesses, self-employed people, charities and households.ldquoOur plan is the right plan.Mr Sunak assured that the government would not stand by and will act to support the economy, adding that the OBR expects the economic impact of the pandemic to be temporary.Despite being forecast for a signicant decline, the UK is expected toto its pre-coronavirus economic growth by the end of this year, with the OBR stating this amount will depend on how long the lockdown lasts.The OBR predicts that any drop in growth will be reversed in the three months to September, as the economy starts to recover.However, it warned that the pandemic may have a more lasting impact on unemployment, which is estimated to rise to . million by the end of June.Unemployment levels are currently . million, marking a rise from . per cent to  per cent.Unemployment rates are expected to remain high until , before dropping back to four per cent, according to the OBRrsquos forecast."},{"url":null,"title":"11-year-olds-thank-letter-delights-ambulance-staff","story":"Sarah Brady, , a primary seven pupil at Wallyford Primary School, was taking part in the first lsquoClap for our Carersrsquo event on March  with mum Samantha.She noticed the ambulance sitting at the end of her street so quickly drafted a letter and ran over with a rose and gave it to them.The letter read: ldquoThanks for everything yoursquore doing for the world, love Sarah Brady.Samantha said: ldquoThe clap was amazing.ldquoA few days later the ambulance had to come back to my house for my partner.ldquoThe ambulance lady said that two men were in Wallyford recently and someone gave them a letter and that they were really overwhelmed.

Adelphi is like the Linn of hi-fi, the Aston Martin of motoring, the Gleneagles of hotels ndash basically,you see anything with that name on a bottle, you know yoursquore in for a serious treat.So why does a company like this need to get involved in virtual tastings  Surely they donrsquot need the money, or the publicity  Connal Mackenzie, group sales manager with the company, says the reason theyrsquore doing it is much more basic than that.ldquoThis is the only way we can get out to the Adelphi people, he says. ldquoIf it wasnrsquot for this virus, wersquod be gearing up for festivals.ldquoWe were going to be launching a new whisky list anyway, and we usually try to fall in to some kind of festival to do that, get feedback them and pour some drams for people.ldquoWe wanted to bottle up some samples and get them to the people who are missing out on festivals around the UK and further afield.

Yet caring, sharing Jacinda Ardern has done exactly the same in New Zealand. No foreigners have been permitted to enter since the Antipodean country the lockdown.Nor is there any certainty that New Zealandrsquos borders are going to reopen any time soon. At the very least, future immigrants will have to put up with quarantine and long delaysthey are allowed into the country at all. Itrsquos a Brexiterrsquos wet dream.In Scotland, the Government is under pressure to explain why, as The Herald reported recently, , people have been allowed to enter the country apparently with barely any health checks at all. This seems to be a UK policy. Border controls are not devolved, and the UK Government seems to want to keep airports open for business.SNP MSPs and MPs are also talking about closing Scotlandrsquos border. MP Joanna Cherry has demanded, at the very least, rigorous health checks and quarantine at airports. Commentators, like our own Neil Mackay, are calling on Nicola Sturgeon to detach Scotland from the failing Westminster Government and introduce a rigorous independent policy of test, track and trace following Germanyrsquos lead.You only need to look at what is happening in Singapore to understand why voters are concerned about the UKrsquos laissez-faire approach to border security. This scrupulously tidy city state had been the poster child for Covid management. Thanks to its experience of SARS a decade ago it was well prepared.The lockdown was rapid and the country adopted mass testing and contact tracing from the start. By the beginning of April, Singapore seemed to be well on top of he disease. Then came the second wave.On Monday, Singapore recorded more than , new cases of Covid , its highest ever. The country of five million people now leads south-east Asia in the virulence of this disease.And who are they blaming  Well, the one million migrant workers, from countries like Bangladesh, who sweep the city streets and tend its butterfly gardens. The most virulent new outbreak is in their cramped dormitories.The Singapore authorities have quarantined thousands of migrant workers into what are to all intents and purposes Covid concentration camps. Eye witnesses report squalid conditions, rats and poor food.Now, New Zealand is one of the most liberal and open societies in the world. But it is going to allow migrants to enter the country freely any time soon  Is it going to allow the four million or so annual tourists  My daughter is one of them. Shersquos been in a Queenstown backpackers hostel under lockdown for the last month.The ethnic dimension to Covid is going to be a huge issue in the near future. Itrsquos already clear that BAME people are more prone to getting this disease. That may be genetic, or it may be to do with their social circumstances and over-crowding. But it means that, in authoritarian countries, they risk being singled out for epidemiological social cleansing.Covid is changing the world in dramatic and disturbing ways. We are seeing a big increase in economic nationalism. The European Union has been riven with tension over Germanyrsquos reluctance to share the Covid-related debts of Italy.Global companies are suffering billions in losses from the disruption of international trade and are repatriating supply chains. This re-shoring, as it is known, had already been happening before Covid, as wages have risen in China, making manufacturing there less attractive.Apple canrsquot market its new phones because of disruption to factories in China. It canrsquot rely on foreign sweatshop labour any more because the sweatshops are going to be transformed to combat the disease.But the pandemic has added yet another dimension to it. There is huge uncertainty about when andborders will relax. It is beginning to look aswe may have economic disruption until a vaccine is found, and even after that.This is why Mr Trumprsquos much-criticised travel ban makes a great deal of sense from his nationalistic, America First, politics. The Presidentrsquos Twitter rants seem arbitrary, contradictory, callous and unthinking. And they are. But they are also politically astute.The Democrats have got themselves into a mess by attacking Mr Trumprsquos border closures. They accused him of racism when he banned flights from the European Union back in February. And again today. But his voters only see him following the example of other countries.America is a vast country, with a erse economy providing most of what it needs from corn to cars. It could effectively shut the world out. Indeed, the US is arguably much better placed to do that than New Zealand because it can do without many of the imports other more open countries depend on.Here, SNP supporters argue that, since Scotlandrsquos death rate is currently running at around half of Englandrsquos, Ms Sturgeon should be following Jacinda Ardern and locking the border. There is immense frustration that Nicola Sturgeon appears to be dictated to by the UK Government.Health is devolved and the Scottish NHS could have pursued a dferent policy. However, as this column has repeatedly pointed out, the Scottish Government is following the same scientic advice as England. There is no evidence that Ms Sturgeon would have followed a dferent course had Scotland been independent.But social media is echoing to demands to lock foreigners out of Scotland for safetyrsquos sake.

We cannot afford to have exceptions.\"Each one of us will have to adapt to this as the new normal, at least until we are sure that we can be more protected by a vaccine or treatment.\"If, after easing any restrictions, the evidence tells us we are unable to contain the transmission of the virus then we will have to re-impose them, possibly ing to lockdown with little notice.\"While we will do our best to avoid this, it is possible that such a cycle may happen more than once until we reach a point when we have in place an effective vaccine.\"The document warns easing restrictions will not mean ing to how things were before the virus.It says ministers will take \"distinctive decisions for Scotlandthe evidence tells us that is necessary\".Options for ying the restrictions include full and partial lting of existing measures.Variations by geography, by sector, or by specic groups of the population could also be introduced.Ms Sturgeon said the number of people in Scotland who have died after testing positive for the virus is ,, up by  from , on Wednesday. A total of , people have now tested positive, up by  from , the day before.The number of people in intensive care and hospital in Scotland has fallen in the past  hours, by seven to  and by  to , respectively, which she said is cause for \"real optimism\".Her comments come as experts from Oxford Universitys Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine said their analysis of Covid- data in Scotland suggests the peak of the virus may have passed.Professor Carl Heneghan called on the Scottish Government to begin opening up the economy as soon as possible to help fight a second wave in winter as he believes the virus is seasonal.A Framework for Decision Making says Covid- causes harm in at least four ways.The first is the \"direct and tragic harm to peoplersquos health\", while the second is the wider impact on Scotlands health and social care services.The third is the harm to society, including the effects of isolation and the impact on childrens wellbeing from closed schools.The last is the \"enormous impact on our economy, with a potential fall of  per cent in GDP during the period of lockdown\".The document adds: \"This is unprecedented and is causing deep uncertainty and hardship for many businesses, iniduals and households.\"The damaging effect on poverty and inequality may be profound.\"Closures and job losses have been inevitable, even with the unprecedented support provided by government.\"And the impacts will intensy the longer the lockdown continues: we will see more businesses unable to recover and we risk the scarring effects of unemployment.\"The risks of increasing hardship and increasing poverty are real. This in turn risks damage to the health of the population.\"We must do everything possible to avoid permanent, structural damage to our economy.\"Ms Sturgeon said the paper is the start of an \"adult conversation\" about how lockdown restrictions could be lted.Matt Hancock, the UK Health Secretary, said maintaining a ldquofour nations approach was essential to tackling the pandemic, and suggested the Scottish Governmentrsquos plan was based on his five tests for relaxing lockdown measures.He also stressed the need for all four governments of the UK to continue working together.When asked by the Herald why Westminster had not been able to produce a similarly detailed plan to that of the Scottish Governmentrsquos, he said: ldquoWe have set out the five tests that are needed for us to make changes to the lockdown measures and the Scottish Government proposals are based on those tests.The minister said a united approach from Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland was ldquothe best way to go and said: ldquoI think that having the four nations of the UK work together on this has been important thus far, not just on social distancing but on testing. The country has essentially moved together.ldquoItrsquos important that us having set out our tests, and now the Scottish government has set out its approach, which is very similar and based on the five tests we have set out, that a UK-wide approach is the best way to go.Opposition parties welcomed the Scottish Governments paper, but also stressed the importance of a UK-wide exit strategy.Scottish Tory leader Jackson Carlaw said: ldquoThe priority remains to save lives, protect the NHS and social care system and ensure the ongoing protection and welfare of vulnerable groupsldquoWe should begin on a phased basis to restore non-essential public services and amenities and enable people toto work, consistent with ensuring the achievement of the first three priorities.\"Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said a phased approach to lting the lockdown was right, and should be based on the principle that saving lives and peoples health must \"take priority over commercial interests\".He said cross-border co-operation is critical.The Scottish Greens said more detail was needed, particularly on testing.David Lonsdale, director of the Scottish Retail Consortium, said it will shortly publish a guide for retailers to help the wider industry re-open stores \"in a safe way once government indicates they can do so\".________________________________________________________________News from trusted and credible sources is essential at all times, but especially now as the coronavirus pandemic impacts on all aspects of our lives.

The principle of social distancing would have to be applied to our educational settings.ldquoI want to make sure that we open schools as early as we possibly can do, that we do that consistent with scientic advice and that we must always be taking action which is in the interests of preserving public health and public safety, as we take those decisions."},{"url":null,"title":"quarter-firms-temporarily-closed-stopped-trading-coronavirus-lockdown","story":"The figures emerged as the UK Government came under fire from its political opponents over banks having approved less than half of applications for its guaranteed coronavirus loans.Meanwhile, Downing St revealed that there had been , applications to the Governmentrsquos furlough scheme, which it said covered . million workers at a cost of pound. billion.According to the ONS survey, two-thirds of firms which are continuing to trade said their financial performance was outside of their ldquonormal range with % of these saying their turnover was lower than ldquonormal.Of those businesses that continued to trade or had paused trading, % indicated an interest in at least one of the UK Government schemes on offer to them the scheme that was declared of interest most often was the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, which enables firms to furlough workers with the taxpayer picking up  per cent of wages, up to pound, a month.Of all the responding businesses continuing to trade, % said they were confident they had sufficient financial resources available while only % did not feel confident this was the case.The statistics came as the hospitality sector warned that an extended period of social distancing restrictions could cost one million jobs in the sector unless measures to protect businesses were put in place.UKHospitality, the sectorrsquos leading trade association, said pubs and other businesses would not be able to operate profitablysocial distancing had to be observed.Downing St made clear that the remark by Professor Chris Whitty, the Chief Medical Officer for England, about restrictions probably continuing for the ldquonext calendar year referred only to the end of  and not for another full  months.Nonetheless, pubs, hotels and restaurants will balk at the idea of social restrictions continuing for another eight months or so.UKHospitality has written to Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office Minister, recommending a plan to help the countrys pubs and restaurants reopen following the crisis and save jobs and businesses.The letter stressed the need for a phased approach to avoid a \"yo-yo effect\" of openings and closings, which could see businesses fail and up to a million jobs lost.The six-point plan sets out the level of support the sector needs to reintegrate into the economy, to avoid mass redundancies and to ensure local businesses and high-street brands can survive.Recommendations included extending the Governments furlough scheme beyond the end of June for hospitality businesses, legislative intervention on rent payments, improved access to capital and an overhaul of business regulation.Kate Nicholls, the associationrsquos Chief Executive, said: \"With social distancing measures still in place, reopening the hospitality sector without a plan would be catastrophic.\"The hospitality sector was one of the first hit by the crisis and the hardest hit in terms of lost revenue. It will also be one of the last to fully emerge from the lockdown.\"An extended period of social distancing will mean that many hospitality businesses will not be able to operate fully, and many will not be able to open at all. Hospitality is a sector built around socialising, so there must be Government support for businesses that continue to be hit by this crisis, she added.Emma McClarkin for the British Beer  Pub Association said: \"Pubs are the original social network, so reopening them with social distancing restrictions is going to be extremely dficult, for staff and customers alike.\"Its clear that the Government are going to need to give pubs special consideration for a re-start as well as specic support just for them.\"The Job Retention Scheme must continue for pubs throughout their closure along with a back to work scheme with the same level of support when they can reopen. Such measures will save jobs whilst the trade slowly recovers.Ms McClarkin said when businesses could reopen, trade could be down by as much as half and will take time for consumer confidence to build up again.Earlier, UK Finance, representing the banking and finance sector, said it had so far provided over pound.bn of lending to small and medium-sized enterprises through the Governmentrsquos Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme[CBILS].Total lending under the loan scheme had doubled in the week from April  with an increase of pound.bn. Over , loans had been provided in the same period with the total number approved increasing by almost  per cent to over ,. However, this remains less than half of the completed applications of more than ,, which the lenders had received.Stephen Jones, Chief Executive of UK Finance, insisted the banking and finance sector understood the critical role it had in helping businesses through the current tough times and stressed frontline staff had been ldquoworking tirelessly to get money to those viable businesses that need it as quickly as possible.ldquoWe stand ready to support many more businesses in the weeks ahead and will continue to work closely with the Government to ensure businesses can access the support they need, he added.But Labourrsquos Ed Miliband said the loan scheme was ldquoin no way equal to the scale of economic distress facing our firms.The Shadow Business Secretary said: ldquoProviding , loans in four weeks in a country of nearly six million SMEs is not good enough.ldquoIn an average week last year there was more than poundbn of new SME lending. The fact that CBILS are now only at that level at a time of the worst economic emergency in our letimes is a clear sign that they are inadequate.He added: ldquoThe Government must recognise the scheme is not working adequately and change it urgently. The future of many of our small firms depends on its decisions.The SNP said the level of loans to businesses was ldquowoeful.Nationalist backbencher Alan Brown, who sits on the Commons Business Committee, said: ldquoAlan Brown MP said: ldquoThis crisis is a crucial time for the UK Government to take the pressure off business but the support laid out by Westminster means that struggling businesses are missing out on billions of pounds of vital funding.ldquoBusiness and industry has been clear: they need urgent financial support to get them through this dficult time.

Age is revered within the Gothic Palace, no more so than in the gilded House of Lords, where time passes either slowly or very slowly.As time has passed for me and snow has now settled on the roof, I have seen novice MPs rail and rage against the antique practices of the Gothic Parliament, only for them a few years in to become zealous defenders of its noble traditions.Of course, it cannot be denied that some of the traditions are more noble than others. The days of MPs having to wear a top hat to make a point of order have thankfully passed.But there is sometimes an unseen logic behind some parliamentary practices.Calling someone honourable or right honourable might seem quaint but it is meant to keep the atmosphere in the chamber genial it is hard, so the theory goes, to be overly disparaging to a political opponentyou have to call him or her honourable. Although, wit and irony can be the greatest of parliamentary weapons.One of the more incomprehensible traditions that perplexes and annoys new MPs is the voting system. When legislatures around the globe use technology to cast votes in the blink of an eye, the denizens of Westminster have to traipse through wide, dusty corridors to have their names ticked off in a ledger, Hogwarts-style.Not long ago, the youthful SNP MP Hannah Bardell fell foul of the Commons Speaker when she took to social media to post a video from within the Lobby, showing just how ridiculous it all was for honourable members to go through -minute vote after -minute vote to decide on interminable parts of the Brexit process.While many would say the Livingston MP had an extremely good point, others would suggest there is a practical reason for what seems an inane impracticality the delayed process gives the party whips a chance to gently, or not so gently, encourage colleagues to file into the correct lobby pressing a button would rob them of the time to use the black art of persuasion.Resistance to change meant that in the late s there was, to say the least, a deal of opposition to the TV cameras being allowed in to broadcast democracy in action many MPs thought voters would be more interested in hairdos and clothes than what was actually coming out of the mouths of their politicians.But now, necessity has once again pulled up at the gates of Westminster and MPs are being asked to skip a century from the th to the st.The video-conferencing tool of Zoom is being used, which to many members was hitherto an ice lolly from their salad days of the s.As I write, the initial experiment has gone relatively well. There were, of course, a few glitches. David Mundell, the former Scottish Secretary, was, MPs were told, ldquounable to connect during the first digital PMQs. No comment.Learning to use the mute button seems to be one of the more important aspects. During the Lordsrsquo virtual session Green peer Baroness Jones admitted she was slow to unmute and eventually askedshe could put her question but was graciously told she was too late.However, the most embarrassing moment in this new age of digital parliamentary democracy came when Vaughan Gething, the Welsh Health Minister, turned the air blue with an expletive-laden tirade to make matters worse it turned out to be against one of his own Labour colleagues Jenny Rathbone.He later apologised to her but, somewhat disdainfully, brushed the incident aside on Twitter as an ldquounwelcome distraction at a time of unprecedented challenge. The unprecedented challenge being coronavirus, of course, not new technology.Asto demonstrate how our unhurried Parliament adheres to a process of evolution rather than revolution, MPs backed electronic voting well, almost.That model of modernity Jacob Rees-Mogg pointed out that a committee of MPs would first look at the procedure and assess whether it was \"workable\" or not.

Being ahead of everyone , what I can tell you is that being isolated from friends and family does have an impact on ones emotion wellbeing and mental health. I am becoming emotionally fatigued by it. I can also say that for the chief scientic and medical officers to continue to state such measures will continue into next year further compounds the dficulty.May I say, both UK and Scottish governments have to appreciate that it is totally unrealistic for the population to be asked to socially distance from family and friends for such an extended period. It is undoable. It would forever damage the fabric of what makes up community and society.I not only speak for myself, but many friends and family, who are abiding by the guidelines presently, are also voicing their view, a shared view that le is not worth livingthe one thing, social interaction is forbidden. My prediction is that community could possibly last a further few weeks, but then many, myself included, would break out and disobey the guidelines and the Scottish Government and even UK Government could do little against mass disobedience or it would risk civil unrest.The governments in the UK are democracies, not autocracies. The public must have a say in roadmapping what happens next and be given the opportunity to challenge or buy into it. It is our freedom that is being curtailed.Ian Johnstone, Connel, Argyll.THE best news to come out of France in recent weeks is the U-turn made by President Macron on his earlier decision to continue the confinement of the over-s after the restthe population was set free on May .In the wake of his earlier speech, pensioner spokespersons warned: \"The prolonged containment of elderly people will cause great physical and mental suffering, and almost certainly lead to a loss of the will to live.\"Mr Macron accepted this caveat, saying that \"the Swedish option will be available\" ndash that is, the final decision will be left to the inidual. How I wish we \"oldies\" were allowed such personal freedom by Holyrood and Westminster.Dr John Cameron, St Andrews.WITH veriable facts surrounding Covid- hard to come by, the only thing beyond dispute is that we are currently led by two of the most isive administrations in a generation who, for the last decade have fomented ision in society, in pursuit of their own ideological brands of nationalism: Brexit and Scottish independence. This fact makes it all the harder to give them credence, when in the midst of this crisis, they call for society to come together. They are lauded and decried in equal measure.The First Minister has, thankfully, kept the most ideological weirdos on her front bench away from the cameras, with only the Health Secretary getting a regular airing and even then, she mostly parrots whats just been said by the FM.Meanwhile, circumstances have dictated that the PM has had to rely on his Cabinet colleagues. The paucity of talent there has been obvious from Dominic Raab, who clearly baulks at being anything other than partisan, to the simply awful Gavin \"I was sacked by Theresa\" Williamson, they inspire no confidence whatsoever.That the politicians have let the scientists do the heavy lting so far, is another indisputable fact. One hopes that they have done this in order that they can bring their vast political experience to bear on how we turn the economy around  Here, we have to rely on their past record to give us hope that they can.But lets look at that record:  years of Tory LibDem, then Tory again, politically-driven austerity a nine-year SNP council tax freeze, again politically driven, to woo middle-class voters to the independence cause, which saw council budgets and services slashed, and the third sector left to pick up the slack. If there is hope in this mediocre bunch, I simply cannot see it.May you live in interesting times, someone once said. We certainly are at the moment. The other indisputable fact is that it will be our children and, to use the hoary old quote, our childrens children, who will be left to pay off the eye-watering debt that the pandemic has caused. Other than that, very little is certain at the moment.Stuart Brennan, Glasgow G.IT is true, as the Chief Medical Officer of England said, explaining why there is no Covid- testing of passengers at UK airports, that a person can be tested there, show no symptons of Covid-, but develop signs a day or two later in the wider community. It is also true that border control is not a Scottish Government competence, so it can only ask for review of UK policy . But once passengers pass passport control and customs, they come within the Scottish Governments competence and can be tested before being allowed to leave the airport, or placed in quarantine.The CMO of Public Health England may be correct about one passenger, but surely not of all coming off an aircraft, and it is most unlikely to be true in respect of every one of the , coming into Scotland on a weekly basis. We dont need a review of UK policy to institute testing at Scottish airports, and it would seem wise for the Scottish Government to exercise its powers to do so.Jim Sillars, Edinburgh EH.YOUR front page todayhighlights the problem of deaths other than from coronavirus. I know from the way I feel that we will avoid going to the doctor or hospital in case we get infected. But I also think that a big part of the problem is Boris Johnsons slogan \"Protect the NHS\".

The deaths in care homes are a disgrace and it would seem likely that some of the deaths would not have happenedthe patients had been transferred to hospital and given the best care.Jim McAdam, Maidens.WE are constantly hearing about challenges in procuring personal protection equipment and have heard recent reports of PPE being delivered to the UK from countries such as China, Turkey, and Myanmar. Why on earth arenrsquot we producing more of this vital equipment in the UK I was in a care home this week and was kitted out on arrival with the most basic face mask and gloves, and the flimsiest gown I could ever imagine. If a motor car business can adapt to making ventilators how canrsquot some of our textile and industrial clothing companies not adapt to making these vital items  We have better quality aprons and household gloves in our kitchen than I wore the other day. Surely to goodness some UK companies must be able to produce PPE to the specication required by our health protection agencies.Brian Watt, Edinburgh EH.AFTER Covid- has subsided we must tackle inequality by making sure the wealthy pay their fair share of taxes and clamp down on offshore investments, trust funds and the use of tax havens by companies and iniduals.However, the signs are not encouraging when Dominic Raab dismissed Ian Blackfordrsquos call at PMQs for a Universal Basic Income , and more so when the new Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer aligned himself with the Tories and the DUP by failing to sign the cross-party petition, which included many Labour MPs, calling on the Chancellor to introduce a Recovery Universal Basic Income in response to the coronavirus crisis.Last week Reform Scotland published a briefing paper ldquoOne For All: The Case for a Basic Income Guarantee proposing that every citizen, regardless of income, gender or employment status, received a set amount of money, free of tax, but in place of personal allowances, tax credits and a number of other benefits which would ensure no one would slip through the complex net of DWP bureaucracy. Reform Scotland suggests it is set at pound, per year for adults plus pound, per year for children.Fraser Grant, Edinburgh EH.FURTHER to the Issue of the Day article on contact tracing apps , it will be easy to undermine this initiativeconcerned about Big Brother: either leave the phone at home when you go out or alternatively switch it off.

Slightly awkward, standing with my cousin Noreen on my first trip away from home, I glistened and gleamed with shiny black hair and bright red lips. We went out in London, to a club and I remember feeling lsquoseenrsquo for the first time. It was like the much over-used shot in films where the camera moves through groups of people in a club. The little glances, and smiles from those we passed, people half-stepping out of our way to let us through, striking up interesting conversations with people we met for the first time. The attention was intoxicating and addictive. I confess, I loved being seen.Fast forward  years later, when I found myself in a club in Glasgow on an impromptu works night out. Two well-toned young men are sitting opposite me and my friend, every so often their gaze straying towards the dance floor. There are lithe girls in heels and bits of string, cleverly gyrating and somehow keeping the strings in place, blaring Latin American music that causes a disturbance in my right eardrum and strobe lighting that plays havoc with my ocals.Instinctively, I bend over, almost hitting my head off the table and scream, fishwe-like, above the music: ldquoThere you go boys. Is that better  Can you see now Seeing the Me at  posts inevitably makes us compare then and now, and for me came the realisation that in the space of  years Irsquod gone from being seen and enjoying being seen, to being invisible and I wondered how and why this happened and how I feel about that.Discussing this phenomenon with friends, Irsquove discovered Irsquom not alone. One -year-old fumes indignantly about being jostled in queues, cut up on pavements and ordered-over at bars by people standing behind her. ldquoItrsquos as , with my youth going, Irsquom not relevant or important, and thatrsquos quite hurtful. At parties or social gatherings she feels her voice isnrsquot heard and her opinions donrsquot matter. Talking to her puzzled me. With her sharp mind, great wit and an attractiveness I have always admired, she was the last person I would have thought of as invisible.Another friend, a comedian, has an explanation. She thinks we might be projecting how we are feeling about ourselves as we age. For her, it is more about how we, as women, were conditioned aged  to see our value. ldquoMy whole self-worth, when I was young, was based on how people, but mostly men, saw me. If they complimented me I valued myself. Now Irsquom older I donrsquot get the compliments so much, but whereas on the one hand you can lose your self-worth because of that, or like me, you can change the yardstick.In the intervening  years shersquod come to use a dferent yard stick, and maybe for some of us, we havenrsquot quite got there yet.But itrsquos more than that, I think. I have sat at the dinner table with my teenage sons and felt invisible. The way they jabber away excitedly about online strategy games or bits of new tech to one another, reminds me of Wendy Craigrsquos character Ria in s sitcom Butterflies ndash happy to see her boys cheerful and animated but ostensibly a ghost in her own home. And, asfulfilling the prophecy, we are encouraged to cut our hair short, wear more neutral tones , and tone down our make-up. I call it ldquoInvisibility Chic and it should really be resisted at all costs.Having said all that, therersquos a lot to be said for invisibility too. In the age of the selfie, Instagram and now, of course, video calls via Zoom, being lsquoseenrsquo, is  hours of being camera ready, with all the insecurities that can bring and the endless stream of looks-related comments on the social media feed from all corners of the globe.Uzma Mir: Are we all playing happy families during lockdown  No  Me neither...Being lsquoseenrsquo is being seen through the lens of a skin-tone softening, teeth-whitening filter that, once removed, leaves a sense of intense disappointment, and gut-wrenching fear of what people might be thinking or saying about the unfiltered material.Invisibility brings with it that sweet liberation of knowing that the worldrsquos gaze is averted where leaving us the power to just be our authentic selves, and to be comfortable with that.

Taking the best from history and finding a way to interpret it thatrsquos interesting or unexpected.All their spirits are made by hand in small batches of less than  bottles, with a direct-fired copper pot still, and aged on-site.Since launching in , they have released three distinctive gins starting with their London Dry. Believing that classics shouldnrsquot be messed with, they have stayed true to style by creating a punchy juniper-led spirit, easing into warming spices on the palate and a bone-dry finish.This was followed by their New Tom - a modern take on the ldquoOld Tom style favoured by Illicit distillers prior to London Dry. New Tom is sweeter in character: distilled with pink peppercorns, rosehips, and tonka beans, and sweetened post-distillation with bee pollen and honey.Finally, in late , Blacklist gin was released. Setting out to create a gin with the rich smouldering character of some of their favourite whiskies - bringing together Scotlands two great spirits - they smoked juniper berries over Scottish peat to impart a deep smoky flavour to the spirit.Complimented by the addition of black cardamom, lapsang souchong tea, black peppercorns, and finally infused with activated charcoal to anchor and enhance the flavour, the result is an unconventional gin - jet black in colour - and with a heady undercurrent of smouldering peat and warming spices.All three products are currently available to via their websitewith free UK delivery during the lockdown period.See illicitspirits shop"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"April ,  at : amThe Scottish Government is launching a national campaign to encourage people to seek medical help for urgent health issues which are not related to coronavirus .

However, he urged the Justice Secretary to reflect on what was happening in England and Wales, where court services were making use of telephone, video and other technology to allow remote hearings and procedural business to take place.Kirkwall Sherf Court has been closed due to the coronavirus crisis, with emergency business transferred to a ‘hub’ in Inverness. However, concerns have been raised about the impact of this transfer, as well as obstacles in the way of securing new ship orders and Powers of Attorney.The Justice Secretary acknowledged these concerns, and offered to pursue the issue with the Scottish Courts and Tribunals Service.Mr McArthur said: “Nothing is ‘business as usual’ at the moment, and the well-being of court staff and the wider public has to be the number one priority.  However, there are many aspects of civil court business that we cannot afford to put on pause.“Over recent weeks, I have been contacted by local solicitors in Orkney, extremely concerned at the dficulties they have faced in getting urgent business completed.  Delays in getting a new ship Orders or Powers of Attorney in place, for example, can have serious consequences. Vulnerable people rely on effective and timely court processes that make sure their rights are properly safeguarded.“In England and Wales we are seeing technology being used to enable more court business to be undertaken. There is no reason why a similar approach cannot be adopted in Scotland.  Indeed, Sherf Courts already conduct procedural hearings by tele-conferencing.“The justice secretary insists that progress is being made, but has offered to take up these concerns with the Scottish Court and Tribunals Service. I welcome that assurance and hope it will allow access to justice for more people in Orkney, and where in Scotland, who need it.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The yoga postures we’ll be doing in the sessions bring some easy, relaxing movements for the body. Mindfulness allows us to be in the present moment rather than worrying about the past or future which can make it easier to accept change and to make the adjustments necessary to feel well.”Angela Mitchell, national director of Diabetes Scotland, said: “We are proud to have over  local groups serving communities across Scotland. Of course, not everyone can attend a group, especially now when we’re advised against all but essential trips out of our homes.“We had already planned to introduce digital peer support groups this year but due to social distancing measures we brought our launch forward.  Many people at home are feeling isolated and,you’re also managing a long-term condition like diabetes, it can be even more challenging. We want to support people with diabetes in any way that we can at this time. As well as online peer support groups, yoga and mindfulness, we also have a helpline, online forum and the Diabetes Scotland team can be reached as we continue to work from home.”Groups meet in private sessions over Zoom. Peer support group times are still flexible while a schedule is created to meet demand. Mindfulness and yoga will run on Wednesdays at pm and Fridays at pm for the next four weeks.Anyone who is interested in joining either peer support or mindfulness and yoga should email scotland@diabetes.org.uk to be invited to a group and given instructions on how to access Zoom .Guidance regarding diabetes and coronavirus can be found at www.diabetes.org.uk coronavirus or by calling the Diabetes Scotland helpline on    or emailing helpline@diabetes.org.ukcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This might included certain businesses being allowed to reopen where customers can safely stay at a two metre distance, and the reformatting of classrooms before pupils canto schools.The First Minister has advised that restrictions are likely to continue in some form for at least the rest of this year, and possibly beyond that.She added that the Scottish Government would be relying on the latest data to inform it of what the best approach for Scotland will be and explained that work to expand the nations testing capacity was ongoing. When asked about whether certain regions of Scotland might undergo a more localised approach, the First Minister said she wasn#t ruling out anything that might help us deal with the virus.#Today I am seeking to start a grown up conversation with the public about the complex decisions that lie ahead of us as we look beyond lockdown,# she said.“As we have done all along, we will seek to inform the public with the best scientic advice possible, but the science will never be exact and we are in uncharted territory so we also need to make careful judgements and be prepared to adapt and change course as we go.“We want to ease restrictions, but we cannot rule out having to reapply them should the virus run out of control.#Nicola Sturgeon said she and her colleagues would be relying on the latest data to inform them of what the best approach for Scotland will be and explained that work to expand the nations testing capacity was ongoing.“Every day we see evidence that this virus causes real harm, but so too do the lockdown measures we are taking to contain it,# she continued.#This is causing harm to the economy and living standards, to children’s education and to mental health and wellbeing.“That is why we need to try to find a better balance than the one we have now, but as we do so we cannot take our eye off the need to suppress the virus and minimise the damage it does.“It is only when we are sure the virus is under control that we can even start to ease any of the restrictions because the virus will not have gone away.#Nicola Sturgeon has advised everyone to take part in the conversation about how we might leave lockdown.

The introduction of this technology is a huge step forward in aiding in early diagnosis of COVID- disease here in Orkney.”As it stands, only those who are in need of hospital treatment are being tested for the virus, alongside key workers and members of their household displaying symptoms.It is understood that a number of people who are suspected to have the virus have been asked to continue self-isolating at home while they are regularly monitored by health professionals by telephone. These patients will only undergo testingthey need to be admitted to hospital.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

In addition, recreational flying should not take place below  feet in the air space immediately around the airfields.The restrictions are in place to slow the spread of COVID- infection, save lives and protect the NHS.Brian Archibald, OIC’s head of marine services, engineering and transportation, said: “Higher risk recreational activities such as flying, yachting or mountaineering are actively discouraged and could be regarded as irresponsible during the pandemic.“In the event of an accident, the emergency and services and NHS could face considerable added pressure at a time when so much effort is going into the local and nationwide response to COVID-.”The airfields were reportedly used without prior permission being sought. Pilots are required to do this under the terms of the council’s license to operate issued by the Civil Aviation Authority.North Isles airfields remain open for Loganair flights, currently operating a reduced twice-daily service, for any medical emergencies, for the transportation of medical samples or tests, and for the delivery of medication and freight when required.Fire crews at the airfields are continuing to train and provide cover when flights are notied # to ensure that the communities they serve can receive the leline services they depend upon.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

For urban wildle, which includes mammals and birds living alongside people in towns, this will affect levels of disturbance from humans and food availability.In recent weeks there have already been reports of animals adapting to the reduced human activity including Kashmiri goats roaming around Llandudno, North Wales, troops of monkeys in Singapore, wild boars in cities across Europe and Coyotes wandering streets during daylight hours in the US.Lead researcher Professor Dawn Scott, an expert in Mammal Ecology and Conservation, will use this unprecedented time to try to collect information and answer the study’s overarching question # How have urban animals responded to changes in human activity during the COVID- lockdown The research will collect records on any observations of unusual animal behaviour during the lockdown, determine the effects of reduction in human activity in city and town centres on urban wildle, and the effects increased human activity in gardens and outdoors space is having. The data from the survey will then be combined with other data from media searches to produce a report on the response of urban animals to lockdown across the globe.Professor Scott, head of the School of Le Sciences at Keele University, said: “Urban animals have been able to adapt to our landscape and live alongside towns, cities and suburbs so we know they are already highly adaptable. This flexibility in behaviour means they can usually quickly respond to changing conditions, including the absence of humans, which is happening during the lockdown.“Across the world we have seen reports of animals roaming cities and in locations that they wouldn’t normally be seen during the day. Social isolation is an opportunity for many to learn more about nature and how we can support it. We’re asking people to take part in our study and help us discover how urban animals are responding due to our change in behaviour.”To find out more and take part in the study visit: www.keele.ac.uk wildlestudycopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Considering his past record as a caring inidual, including his efforts to help the homeless, that was not really surprising.But apart from manager Daniel Stendl, who waived his salary, others at the Edinburgh club appeared reluctant to follow Naismith’s example. Reports later suggested that no other Hearts player would be asked to take more than a  per cent reduction.Also last week it was claimed that Scotland manager Steve Clarke had accepted a  per cent cut, simply meaning his salary would go down from £, to £,.In England the men’s and women’s international bosses Gareth Southgate and Phil Neville apparently agreed to take  per cent less. In the former’s case he would still be pocketing £. million while Neville would get £,.At club level south of the border the situation is very inconsistent. Some managers, such as David Moyes, Eddie Howe and Graham Potter have volunteered to take a cut while Pep Guardiola donated a million euros to help fight the outbreak in Spain. There was a terrible poignancy to Guardiola’s generosity a few days later when it was reported that his -year-old mother had died as a result of the virus in Barcelona.But while most Premiership clubs have placed most non-playing staff on some kind of temporary leave, some receiving  per cent of their salary through the government’s job retention scheme, the situation with the majority of players is still unclear.This is a dficult situation and UK health minister Matt Hancock ruffled some feathers when he suggested that well-off footballers should consider doing more to help.Some journalists have even criticised Hancock, saying he was completely out of touch with what was actually happening. That was unfair. The minister was not speaking about the game in general, where players at lower-level clubs are paid a pittance compared with those at the top. He was merely highlighting the fact that many could easily survive with no pay at all for the foreseeable future.To put this in perspective, most players at Premiership level are earning several million a year, an increase of roughly two and a half times what they took home six years ago. A high proportion are on more than £, a week.At the top of the tree are Manchester United goalkeeper David De Gea and Man City midfielder Kevin De Bruyne, who are on over £ million and £ million respectively.Even a player I confess to never having heard of, Tanguy Ndombele of Tottenham Hotspur, is reportedly bagging £. million a year.In the Championship the average annual pay is considerably less, around £, a year or £, a week. And in the lower League Two it drops to £ or £ weekly, not all that much above the national average.During the current situation all these figures need to be taken into consideration. We should have no issue with lower-paid players still getting  per cent of their wages for doing nothing. They, like everyone , still have bills to pay.But for the multi-millionaires to grumble about being hit is about as hard to take as the coronavirus pandemic itself.: : : : : : : :No decision has yet been made about whether the football leagues in the UK will be completed, whenever the action begins again.In Scotland it has been proposed in some quarters that the title should just be handed to Celtic, as the Glasgow side had an almost unassailable lead when play stopped.Now a director of the other half of the Old Firm has suggested thatthat happened, their rivals would only be able to claim “eight and a half” in a rowthey were crowned champions.Personally I feel that this season’s scheduled fixtures should be played out, however long it takes. Only then should the - action start, evenit means a shortened campaign.: : : : : : : :There are currently eight premier ision football clubs in Shetland, all of which have been in existence for dferent s of time.Scalloway are the oldest, dating back to , with Lerwick sides Celtic and Thistle being able to trace their beginnings back to the early part of the th century.Spurs and Ness United both emerged during the s, with Whitedale, Whalsay and Delting joining the senior league more recently.Someone suggested to me that a best XI from each could be selected, to give players and supporters something to ponder over during the current period of uncertainty.There will no doubt be controversy over this, but that’s what opinion is all about. If anyone would like to submit their thoughts, or their own ideas of what their respective best sides would be, feel free to send them in.Next time I will give you the line-ups, in alphabetical order, from the past  years.

It is expected to be pressed into service as soon as possible.Health board chairman said demand for testing on the Scottish mainland had seen tests take up to five days for processing.But having the kit on-island, he said, would see results turned round in a matter of hours.Mr Robinson said he recognised there had been a #hiatus# after initial testing coronavirus had stopped.#We recognised in NHS Shetland that capacity for testing was going to be an issue. Testing in Glasgow was going from  hours to five days.#I think we recognised there was a need to get something locally.# raquoNHS Shetland, like many other essential service providers, employs people whose parents and grandparents did now grow up in Shetland, or even in the UK. Let#s allow them, women and man alike, to be fully welcomed as valued members of our communities, with equal status.Let#s make the changes needed to fully include them and their families and so appreciate the strength in ersity that is their much appreciated contribution to modern Shetland, modern Scotland and modern Britain.Peter#s choice of poetry is particularly relevant during a week when British farmers chartered planes to collect  farm workers from Romania.The manager of the airline says he has already put in a bid for the next six flights.These Romanians form the first link in a long chain that magically re-stocks our supermarket shelves while we lie sleeping in our beds every night.For those with an apatite for further contemplation, I would recommend the following article:Thanks for the helpful and interesting link Malcolm. It almost makes a case for education in the humanities to be compulsory into adulthood!Reading it helped me to reflect on how dangerous it is for us to accept a narrow and rigid definition of what makes for a permissible #Shetlander#,and how important it is to reject the idea that some are entitled to more of a voice in that discussion than others.Those wishing to contest the need for such points to be made should first read Malcolm#s recommended article and then reflect on how recently a SMUHA squad featured a black-faced member of the NHS.As the article points out there is a prospect that this visus will not lead to more harmonious societies.The price of the peaceful cooperation we should wish for with all our neighboursis vigilance against those who would needlessly turn us against each other.Ilove how Peter and Malcolm appear to be so in veneration of each other, just a tad too preachy for me. As for #an education in the humanities to be compulsory into adulthood!# I would respectfully suggest a basis eduction in the STEM subjects would be of far more value to humankind. That way most would understand what a virus is, how a vaccine works. The sort of simple science stuff that lives depend on.Humanities educated, Like Boris Johson and Rees Mogg. Go for it, Peter!One hesitates to perturb so a warm a socialist embrace. However, re the linked article, any author who discusses Nazism and bigotry in one breath and then Trump, Bolsonaro and Modi in the next while omitting to mention China’s Xi Jinping or the North Korean monster, Kim Jong-un, is clearly peddling a dishonest agenda.It#s a wonder people #educated in the humanities# didn#t see that. Interesting.Having installed himself as president for le, Xi is reportedly responsible for the most appalling, vicious repression and imprisonment of a million Uighur people and the relentless destruction of their culture in China’s Xinjiang province. The “ View” is clear: “Speak out or be complicit.”“Without sustained pressure, the grotesque human rights abuses seen in Xinjiang will not just continue but intensy. The time to speak up arrived long ago. Countries should be shouting about this from the rooftops.”If you want a chilling reminder of Nazism, guys, look no further.Does anyone want to remind John the NHS is socialist in intent and inception Did he learnall this from the wonderful British Empire ,I wonder, so ,he is a poor apprentice.John Tulloch#s unwillingness to engage with the main points previously made is unsurprising.Have I missed something here  An article about testing equipment arriving in Shetland allowing results to be available in hours rather than days has very quickly turned into a debate about immigrants, racism, humanities -v- STEM Education and extreme left right wing politics. It’s not always necessary to find something to disagree about.@Stephen Johnston, I agree. That#s precisely why I hadn’t commented on any coronavirus item, here or where, until my above post. The coronavirus pandemic is a rapidly unfolding tragedy, a national and global emergency. Using it as a political football is completely inappropriate.However, there comes a point when people pompously touting their supposedly superior educations to bolster bogus arguments, endlessly stirring the pot of social ision and bitterness, must be challenged. Ideally, we would support those faced with tackling the crisis # at all levels # and keep our criticisms constructive. Or keep quiet and let them get on with it. Lessons can be learned later, with the benefit of hindsight, once all the facts are knownAs they say, # you won#t help, at least, get out of the way.#JT, straight from the right wing playbook# Tell them to be quiet. It#s an effective way to silence people # who could disagree that the coronavirus is a terrible tragedy after all  But#JT, How is the racism suffered every day for thousands of NHS staff not up for discussion  Why do you wish to silence that discussion Why don#t you deal with issue, rather than making a series of accusations and personal attacks What facts about racism faced by NHS staff are not known  Maybe not known to you, but lived by the people in the poem. Maybe for you racism and anti-immigrant sentiment is a political football to be put away until you see fit. But for the people who have lived with it through their lives, suffered because of it, it is a matter of day to day struggle. And yes, a political issue.When John declared that “People pompously touting their supposedly superior educations to bolster bogus arguments, must be challenged” I assumed that he was going to say something about Dr Mr Lt.Cdr Tinkler.For what it’s worth John, my own qualications are an HGV and PSV licence sothat’s what you regard as a superior education, you must have the mother of all inferiority complexes.Whenever anyone tries to bring up subjects like racism or social exclusion on this forum, the same few iniduals fly into an apoplectic rage and you, John, are always one of them.As someone once said:“If you won’t help, at least, get out of the way.”Malcolm Henry Johnson, O dear me, that chip on the shoulder. It was actually Surgeon Lieutenant Commander with  years training in Nuclear, Biological and ChemicalWarfare including triage and casualty care. I rejoice I never had time to waste on the humanities, more important work to do, like keeping people breathing.I know, tell me about it Ian. I for one would be fine without HGV drivers. In fact, I have been training our blessed grandson on how to handle a mule and cart . On a side note, I was exposed to radiation as a child in the s. The triage nurse was excellent and the radiation never did me any harm. So what I am saying is you are both valued by old John Thomas.I’ve often pondered the nature of predictability and wondered: What came first, the Surgeon Lieutenant Commander or the wind-up, clockwork toy To Peter Hamilton and John Thomas I say, thank you, for exemplying my point about using the coronavirus tragedy as a political football. Perfect.I hadn#t commented about NHS or care home staff. However, relatives of mine are currently benefitting from their work and their courage and conviction is truly admirable. Whatever their race or nationality, I heartily applaud it.Call me what you like. I won#t be drawn into an unseemly, polemic#Punch and Judy# food fight over the crisis by personal attacks. I invite readers to check my above points and judge for themselves.Have a nice day, boys.JT:#I won’t be drawn into an unseemly, polemic “Punch and Judy” food fight over the crisis by personal attacks. ##pompously touting their supposedly superior educations to bolster bogus arguments,#Pot meet kettle.

Prof Pennington said the Western Isles, which at the start of the week had only six confirmed cases of Covid-, could exit the restrictions as a “test-bed” before wider lockdowns were lted.Politicians said the idea was worth considering, but still carried risk.Prof Pennington said: #There could soon be a case for a geographical lting of restrictions # such as in some of the Scottish islands and the Highlands and Grampian.#The Western Isles and Orkney are the obvious candidates to be the test beds for an exit strategy for the country. Travel is restricted because they are islands and have extremely low levels of confirmed cases. You can control access to them and re-open things like shops and churches etc and get back gradually to normal le again.#As for people travelling to the islands it is to be remembered that the vast majority of people have not been affected.”He added that effective testing facilities, which would give a quick result, must first be in place to allow any restrictions to be eased.Western Isles MSP Alasdair Allan said that while the idea had merit, islanders would be alarmedthey felt their health was being compromised as part of an experiment.He said: #It is unfortunate that the language of ‘testbeds’ has been used by some to describe the Western Isles, which has disturbed a number of people who have contacted me about this subject.“We have a population that is more elderly and more vulnerable to this virus than most, and so slowing down the spread of the virus has to be our overriding priority.“Despite the fact we have a low number of confirmed cases, the true number of infected islanders is likely to be signicantly higher. There is certainly now a need for more testing locally.#We need to keep observing the social distancing guidelines and cannot allow any room for complacency.“Given that we may well be behind the infection curve for the rest of Scotland, there is a good case to be made for a regional approach to lting lockdown restrictions, when that happens. However, this also has to ensure that the islands are not subject to any influx of travellers from other areas where the virus has already peaked.”Highlands and Islands Conservative MSP Donald Cameron added: “Any proposal to trial a relaxation of the lockdown rules must have the full support of local residents with the protection of the most vulnerable remaining paramount, as well as ensuring the NHS is not put under any unnecessary strain.“However, the geography of the islands means they are suitable for a possible trial and Professor Pennington’s suggestions certainly deserve serious consideration.“Given the fragile nature of the islands# local economy at this time, we need to give our communities every chance of not only getting through this pandemic but also kick-starting a recovery as quickly as possible.

Owners around Northern Ireland have said they are keen to open when it is safe to do so.But anxiety is growing that government guidance could require measures such as rooms being rested for three days between guests - a move which would halve occupancy rates.Tourism NI said accommodation does have to comply with current UK government guidance for non-healthcare settings, which advises that usual cleaning methods kill the virus, which would leave rooms fit for reuse straight away.However, housekeeping teams are advised to review their processes.Joanne Stuart, the chief executive of the NI Tourism Alliance, said operators would have to consider whether it is viable to reopen.We have to consider how long it will take people to get ready, and what are the guidelines for health and safety that they#ll need to put in place to meet requirements on social distancing, she said.Operators will have to look at their own viability. If you are a BB you still have to meet your costs, so they#ll be askingit#s financially viable to reopen or not.Nicola Neill, the owner of the luxury Blackrock BB in Portrush, said she was anxious about the potential costs of implementing social distancing and potentially having to procure personal protective equipment for cleaning staff.However, she said customers had been supportive, with one guest who had paid in advance to take the entire house during an event this year moving the booking to next year, instead of requesting a refund.Ms Neill is taking other short-term measures to preserve the business.My booking calendar is now open for  and I#m considering opening this winter over December and January as self-catering, so that I could let the house to a family for a week, she said.I#m also extending gt voucher validity.She has also developed a recipe for a whiskey fruit cake with Old Bushmills Distillery and was hoping to develop it for sale in shops.John Mathers, who co-owns the five-star country guesthouse Newforge House near Craigavon with we Louise, said he did not think it likely it would reopen over the next few months.But he said the couple may work through their usual winter holiday to make up for the present forced closure.He said they had been able to furlough their staff - which he said was a phenomenal help - and had also qualied for a government grant. But he added: These are extraordinary times in many respects. A lot of people will struggle to stay afloat but I think the government has been pretty decent. But in some of the schemes, there are a lot of loopholes which mean some will be able to abuse it while others fall through the cracks.Guesthouse owners are also hopeful that they can benefit from a rise in staycations when restrictions are lted, in the hope that some people are too nervous to travel overseas.But there was concern about being priced out of the staycation market by bigger hotels and spas, which may be able to offer lower-priced deals.In some cases, where staff have been laid-off, they have also been able to secure better-paid work where in fields such as the medical devices sector, where demand has increased due to coronavirus.Mr Mathers said he feared that managing the virus in the long-term will be a cat and mouse game which could make operating dficult.If restrictions are eased, you might find numbers of infections start going up again, he said.Some hospitality businesses have also repurposed what they do, which Mr Mathers said was a possibility for Newforge House in the future.He added: If you#re running a restaurant or hotel in theory you can operate just in food, perhaps as a takeaway or delivery service, and just doing food is perhaps something we can look at.And perhapsit comes to reopening, we can look at a form of exclusive hire where a family might come to stay.It is a very tricky situation but there#s nothing we can do.Ms Stuart said the industry will need a recovery support package. And with many guesthouses failing to qualy for the government grant package, she was hopeful a way could be found to help.She added: That has been raised with the Economy Minister and when it was announced that there would be another £m in funding, we#d hope bed and breakfasts may benefit from some of that.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He said some  parcels were either distributed directly by the ad hoc partnership, or by others such as Homeplus, in recent weeks.Ms Hargey said , parcels a week are being delivered across Northern Ireland to people, many of whom suffer from health conditions that make them particularly vulnerable to the virus and therefore must remain isolated.The minister added that the IFA, GAA and Ulster Rugby are helping in the effort to deliver prescription medications to those who cannot leave their homes.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We are now entering the th day of lockdown with strict regulations in place to curb the spread of Covid-. The current situation is set to last until at least May  and as many seek comfort from the virus’ threat, they are turning their attention towards happier days. Re-runs of old TV programmes are filling the airwaves. The GAA has made  All-Ireland finals available to watch online. News archives are being pored over for hidden gems. Nostalgia is king at the moment, but Maghera psychologist Sarah Connell is not surprised by the phenomenon. googletag.cmd.push “It’s a really comforting emotion,” says the owner of Minding Me Psychologists. “It brings back times when we’ve been accepted and loved, and it provides some badly needed relief in these times of uncertainty. “People are generally frightened by change, because we don’t always feel like we’re in control of things. Having that sense of being in control is really important for our well-being. “We can retreat to the past and think of when times were good, and we felt like we were in more control of things. I think that really helps us to be more stabilised and feel better about things. googletag.cmd.push “I think sometimes we can use it as a wee bit of an escape as well. It can take us out of the situation we are in that, for some people, is really challenging.” Although nostalgia is widely regarded as a positive emotion, this was not always the case and early research into the area deemed it to be a psychological problem. The term was coined by Swiss doctor Johannes Hoffer in , who deemed it a ‘neurological disease of essentially demonic cause’ after studying Swiss mercenaries stationed abroad. It arose from the Greek terms nostos – meaning a yearning tohome – and algos – its associated pain. Hoffer also concluded that the condition may have been caused by incessant cowbells in the Alps causing damage to the soldiers’ ears and brain cells. Even throughout the th and th centuries, it carried the stigma of ‘immigrant psychosis’, a form of ‘melancholia’ and a ‘mentally regressive compulsive disorder’. Sarah describes the concept as ‘bittersweet’ and refers to it as a ‘double-edged sword’. “Because it triggered dissatisfaction and lots of negative emotions like stress, fear and loss, it was interpreted as something you don’t want to have,” she says. “It really is bittersweet. It’s sweet because we’re remembering the good times, all the things that were good in the past, but it’s bitter because we know we can never regain that experience. “It’s gone forever. Time is irreversible and there’s something really sad about that. “The song ‘Days of Our Lives’ by Queen has the lines: ‘Can’t turn back the clock, can’t turn back time, ain’t that a shame’ and I think that really summarises it well. “Although it’s a lovely thing to think back, we can’t turn back the time. It’s really positive in one way but there’s a downside to it as well.” Nostalgia is often triggered by activities that people enjoy, such as music or sport, and Sarah says this is especially the case during a time of psychological distancing. “It can really help counteract feelings of loneliness,” she said. “It’s a huge link because those [music and sport] are things we love. If we think back to times when you played a good match, or went to an enjoyable concert, those are happy memories. “Nostalgic thoughts unite us with people again in our minds. It increases the perception of social support and reminds us of a time when we were with people, doing things and enjoying them.” A rise in nostalgia can often be a result of coming face-to-face with your own mortality and as the death toll in Northern Ireland reaches , people are increasingly worried. “It’s giving them that sense that you actually can die,” says Sarah. “Some people are quite concerned about it, but others probably still feel an element of ‘that’s not going to happen to me’. “One thing many are most concerned about is the economic effect that it’s having. They’re concerned about job loss – a lot of people have been furloughed. “They’ll be wonderingtheir job will continue after this period and what will happen in terms of paying bills and mortgages. The fear that we are going to go into recession is causing worries. Through talking to clients, Sarah has heard many people talk about the unexpected positive aspects that have arisen from the effects of the lockdown. She says: “I am hearing a lot of people really focusing on the positives, which is great. They are loving having more precious time to spend with their families and their children. “Little things like the slower pace of le – you can hear the birds singing more in the mornings. It’s giving time for people to reflect and re-evaluate their lives. Although the psychological distancing that we are currently having to enforce increases feelings of isolation and loneliness, people are adapting. Sarah says: “People are finding ways of coping with it by trying to find a bit of regularity in their lives - doing things like exercise every day and keeping some kind of structure to their day. “We’ve gone from being able to do whatever we want to having massive restrictions on us. “None of us like being told what to do or being held back from living our lives how we want to live them. “We’re having to draw on our willpower to focus and do the things that are right for ourselves and for everyone.” If nostalgia can act as a buffer against the fear and frustration caused by Covid-, then open that GAA archive, put on the old TV re-runs and wallow in reminiscent therapy.

Fireside selectors picking teams is one of Ireland’s national past times. This selection is based on players who took part in county senior, intermediate and junior finals -. It is based on the grade they were playing at that time. Five from each is selected. Just like putting five litres into a one litre jar. Here goes...  - Antoacutein McMullan For years it was the ‘big boot’ in defence who would do the kicking out. Distance was important. Now it has developed into an art form with the qualities being, a cool head, the ability to kick the ball through basketball hoop at a distance of  metres, safe hands and cat like reflexesrequired. Antoacutein has all the credentials. googletag.cmd.push  - Oisin Duffy A good defender is one that the forward hates playing against and the energetic Duffy was one of those prize assets. Firm in the tackle, virtually impossible to stop on the run and full of scores from his defensive position. His display in the Ulster Intermediate championship against Magheracloone, where he scored - from play, was exceptional.  - Brendan Rogers No player can change gear as quickly as the tall Brendan when he motors out of defence. He would excel in any sport and could play anywhere on the football field. A brilliant hurler as well. Seeing a forward chasing him with tongue hanging out is something were are used to. A real pleasure to watch. googletag.cmd.push  - Karl McKaigueThere is a famous film called the Quiet Man. Karl could be titled the quiet marker in defence. He has snuffed out some of the best forwards in the game and still manages to slip forward and get a point or two. Tackles the ball and not the man, so he rarely gives away frees. His anticipation of where the ball is going to drop is exceptional.  - Niall KeenanA neat and tidy footballer. His build would suggest corner forward material but he is actually a quality defender. Came through the minor and U ranks showing class all the way. His display at Croke Park in the  minor semi-final for Derry marked him as a player with a great future and he has lived up to that billing.  - Joe Gray Play anywhere Joewas the heart beat of Faughanvale teams for the most of two decades. He led a young team from the junior ranks to a solid intermediate outfit. Played and managed at dferent times and had a few games with Derry in the s. Has all the skills and a read dead eye free taker.  - Jimmy O’Connor Jimmy was ‘spotted’ by an Derry U scout when he was closer to  than . Now, nearer  than , he keeps up an amazing standard of fitness. Normally listed as a corner forward he is let loose to conduce the orchestra. Not the biggest but he makes light of that with his wide range of skills.  - Enda Muldoon Could have played on any team, in any era. Great hands and a master of the ever accurate foot pass. Always made the game look easy since he broke into a Derry minor team in . Now a qualied coach, passing on his skills to the next generation the youngsters could not have had a better tutor. A gentleman on and off the field.  - Mark Lynch From enthralling Croke Park in the  All-Ireland minor final, at the age of , Mark has continued to show quality. Stepped down two years ago after a long inter county career. Still the heart and soul of Banagher teams. He was exceptional in their senior championship run last year and the intermediate title a year previous. In his all round skills is the mastery of free taking.  - Michael McNaughtGrandson of the great Mickey McNaught who was on the Derry  National League winning team. His accurate left foot is one of the reasons why the Waterside men have become a solid force in Derry football. Can play midfield or half forward and seldom is below par. A very accurate free taker.  - Richard KingRichard broke into the Wolfhound’s senior team at the age of  as a corner forward. Now a commanding figure in the half forward line and an excellent free taker. Was a key figure in the treble winning junior team of . His rather harsh sending off against Red Hugh’s almost certainly cost Limavady the Ulster title. At  there is a lot more to come from this excellent footballer  - Enda Lynn Good enough to captain his county for two seasons. This man is a virtual scoring machine. Such is his dedication that he has been known to train on Christmas Day. His pace and tireless running makes him nearly impossible to mark. Missed a lot of action last season with an injury. Greenlough and Derry will be glad to see him back againthe action ever resumes.  - Paudie O’Neill Probably the best club footballer in Derry never to get a county call. Time after time, he would win games on his own for the Henry Joys. His scoring tallies were mind boggling but like a lot of good footballer had ongoing injury problems. A loyal club player he often played through the pain barrier.  - Kevin O’ConnorEvery year he postpones his retirement is another good year for Foreglen. From being an excellent half forward he now brings his deadly accuracy to the role of target man. A quite superb free taker who is always calm and measured. Played a leading role in their intermediate championship win last season.  - Conleith Gilligan Has to be one of the highest ever scorers in Derry club football. From his teenage years to his mid-s his quality never dimmed. Be it from frees or open play, he seldom missed the target. His pace and ability to be in the right place at the right time marked him as one of the best. His retirement left a huge void in the Shamrock’s attack. He is now passing on his skills to others.

In addition, another  food parcels were delivered by last Friday.Local council officials have been working in partnership with their colleagues across local government, health trusts and the Department for Communities to set up the hubs.Down Leisure Centre has been transformed into a processing centre to organise deliveries, with other sites currently being identied should they be required, with staff working in split shts, while observing social distancing and other safety protocols.The new service covers the councilrsquos seven even district electoral areas with deliveries focusing on food supplies with the packages including items such as tinned and dried food, cereals and some essential toiletries.Requests for help from the council and its community and voluntary partners are arriving via Access NI which is processing calls from across Northern Ireland on a freephone helpline.Council chairman Charlie Casey says he is pleased to see just how many of the districtrsquos most vulnerable residents have been able to receive food parcel deliveries recently.ldquoOur sincere thanks go to all our partners who worked with us over the Easter break to achieve this and all the volunteers who have already kindly offered their help, he continued.ldquoIt is important that we provide a leline to those following medical advice to shield to protect their health, or who are self-isolating, and have no other means of assistance.The council chairman said that during the local authorityrsquos COVID- response, it will continue to work hard to deliver essential supplies to those who need them and ensure no-one feels alone or isolated at this dficult time.A COVID- community helpline is operational, with those in vulnerable groups seeking support asked to make contact between am and pm, seven days a week, with the helpline managed by Advice NI who are processing calls from across Northern Ireland.The Freephone number is   , while the email is covid@adviceni.net. Contact can also be made by texting ACTION to .All calls that are relevant to the councilrsquos community co-ordination hub will be passed on to the local authority for action, including referrals from the South Eastern and Southern health trusts.The Downpatrick-based County Down Rural Community Network, the Confederation of Community Groups in Newry and Community Advice Newry Mourne and Down are acting as lead organisations for the community groups involved in this response.Members of the public are reminded that the Down Leisure Centre remains closed and that anyone who requests a food parcel will have it delivered to them directly.The County Down Rural Community Network in Downpatrick is acting as one of the lead organisations for the community groups involved in the response to the new food parcel distribution service.Any other volunteers who wish to assist in the delivery of food and supplies or ensure residents on their own at this time receive phone calls to help ease their isolation, are encouraged to register with Volunteer Now via their website.Further information about volunteering is available at www.volunteernow while organisations can identy COVID- volunteering requirements at www.volunteernow organidations.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd April 2020 Castlewellan.jpg","title":"Castlewellan dressmaker makes scrubs for frontline workers in lockdown  ","story":"FROM wedding dresses to scrubs ndash thatrsquos the new order of work for Castlewellan bridal dressmaker Shirley Moorhead.Sewing a range of scrubs for nurses and nursing home workers has replaced Shirleyrsquos normal orders of stunning gowns, veils, bridesmaidsrsquo dresses and outfits for the mother of the bride and groom since the coronavirus lockdown.The  year-old was facing a full order book for spring and summer weddings until the lockdown resulted in many weddings being pushed back to the autumn and beyond.The woman behind Fairytale Designs, the mother of five was determined not to let her inactivity and seamstress skills go to waste during the lockdown over the last four weeks.She is now sewing scrubs for over  hours each day in her garden workshop, after  years of experience as a dressmaker.ldquoIrsquom sure that in any home where there is a sewing machine, local people are also doing their bit and working to sew to support the local effort with PPE, said Mrs Moorhead.ldquoAt the moment, while Irsquom being very productive, I canrsquot earn a living with what I do, like so many others. Therersquos plenty like me and we are all in the same boat.ldquoIt started when I received requests from nurses who I made their wedding or bridesmaid dresses in the past for. I ended up making scrubs for some entire hospital wards, male and female and in a iety of sizes.ldquoThat widened out to sewing for staff at local nursing homes. I just want to do something to help, particularly for nursing homes as my daughter, Abigail, works in one in Castlewellan.There is plenty of work to be done to complete her bridal orders, but Mrs Moorhead feels that her priority is for scrubs.ldquoMy weddings have been pushed back until October or November or even next year. There are things that would hamper me. I canrsquot see brides to fit them and I wouldnrsquot want to go too far ahead with orders in case some people gain weight or lose weight, she said.ldquoAlso,the wedding changes seasons, that can change the outfit ordered in style and colour. For instance, a mother of the bride might want a jacket as well or might want to lose or shorten sleeves so I feel I canrsquot go to far ahead with my orders. Brides have needed me to reassure them that everything will be alright for their big day, whenever it happens, and I can absolutely promise that.ldquoAbigail is getting married in November and her sister, Johanna, is getting married next May, so they will be the most special wedding dresses I will make in my letime. I feel that I have to keep going with the scrubs as itrsquos so important. However, I will make sure that I will provide all outfits that have been ordered from me. It has become a family affair as Mrs Moorheadrsquos husband, Joe, who also is unable to work as an engineer in the lockdown, helps with the pressing of the garments while Johanna helps with the sewing.Mrs Moorhead has been creating the scrubs from donated material, much of it brand new, and is very grateful for the donations..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd April 2020 Crossgar.jpg","title":"Crossgar man takes Chance with move to Hong Kong 26 years later opens superstore  ","story":"AT the age of  and without a word of Cantonese, Richard Bowsie left his family and friends behind in his home village of Crossgar for a le of adventure in Hong Kong.Twenty-six years later and now a married father of two, Richard has found love, happiness as well as a successful career as the owner of two second-hand furniture stores in the huge cosmopolitan city with over seven million inhabitants.He and his locally-born we, Mavis, run nd Chance Furniture that provides shoppers in the city and online across the world a virtual Aladdinrsquos Cave with thousands of unique and affordable items - ranging from lacquered tables to pool tables, Chinese vases to Balinese drums.While other young ambitious men were told to lsquogo westrsquo, Richard went east, finding Hong Kong to be every bit as much the land of opportunity as the United States.The father of eight year-old daughter Kailey and son George, whorsquos coming five, literally changed his le in three days when he made the decision to fly to Hong Kong.From working as a leguard at the Tropicana centre in Newcastle and at the former Down Leisure Centre, the former student of the High School, Ballynahinch, had been close to completing his BTec qualication in Leisure Management at the former Newcastle College of Further Education.He ped out of his course a few months shy of graduation due to bullying. While his parents, Margaret and Ken, a well-known architect, were shocked at their middle sonrsquos decision, they were not surprised.He recalled: ldquoI had a friend who had travelled to Hong Kong three months previously. During a phone call he told me that the new international airport was under construction and work was easy to find. Three days later I arrived.ldquoI decided to go by myself as I had been trying to find an exciting job at home for a while but kept being told I was too young for the roles or lacked experience. My parents knew I was ambitious and how frustrated I was becoming with my career ambitions being knocked back all the time.Richard admitted he hadnrsquot a clue what to do once he arrived and took a bar managerrsquos job as an interim position as many of the airport workers drank there.His first job at the airport turned out to be with the Northern Ireland company, Lagan Construction Group, before going to another Belfast-based company, Rotary International, with which he worked for two years.ldquoI felt excited and nervous all at the same time when I first moved to Hong Kong, said Richard.ldquoThe first thing that struck me was the heat, after leaving cold and damp of home. Arriving in  degrees and high humidity was certainly a shock to the system, despite having been on family holidays to France most years with my family and once to America with a cross community group. The heat in Asia was a massive shock.Having grown up in a rented manse on the Rademon estate, Richard swapped a quiet rural existence for the hustle and bustle of the global port and major commerce centre. It was still under British rule and would remain so for another three years before it was handed back to China.Richard said: ldquoLanguage was the biggest shock but I made it my mission to learn the language and enrolled in YMCA lessons but also managed to pick it up from also working alongside locals.It wasnrsquot long before Richard felt confident enough to start out his own business, an electrical supply company which employed  staff.He said: ldquoI knew after the first few months that Hong Kong was going to work for me,you worked hard, nothing could hold you back, age was not an issue here. Opening a business here was very straight forward, just need a bank account and register an address.He met his we Mavis during his first month in the city and the two have been together ever since.They opened their first store in  in the after seeing a large amount of good furniture being thrown away each week and were determined to do something that would reduce the waste and help the environment. Within months, they had outgrown this store and relocated to their current , sq ft premises in Tuen Mun.The couple has recently opened a second, , sq ft premises in Chai Wan which is closer to the busy capital.Fluent in Cantonese for many years, Richard has seen Hong Kong go through many challenges, not in the least with the recent coronavirus pandemic.ldquoHong Kong has handled the virus very well, having been through SARS and bird flu before, said Richard. ldquoAs soon as we heard there was an issue over the border in China, Hong Kong went straight into prevention measures before even being advised to. Now everyone wears masks and observes hygiene measures.The preventative measures must have been successful as the city recorded zero deaths on Monday for the first time since the outbreak before Christmas.While the move to Hong Kong was the right one for Richard, he still misses home and his brothers and sisters, Simon, Gillian, Laura and William.He said: ldquoI miss the food, the greenery and, of course, my family who are all still in Northern Ireland. I miss being close to home as I have lost family members and grandparents.ldquoBut we come home as often as we can. Mavis and the kids love Crossgar, especially AJs Diner. They love the Rademon estate where we lived beside, walks down the Church Road to Kilmore and the open green fields. We have very few here in Hong Kong and any we do have are full of mosquitos.Home is always on Richardrsquos mind, as is his business.He adds: ldquoNext for our business is hopefully more expansion as I would like to start exporting furniture to other countries such as Northern Ireland. I have discussed this with some Co Down firms in the past, so watch this space..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd April 2020 Downpatrick Jockey.jpg","title":"Downpatrick jockey Declan lands seven winners  ","story":"DESPITE the fact that the - season has been curtailed, it is good to record that Downpatrick amateur jockey Declan Lavery rode an excellent tally of seven winners, one ahead of Banbridge farrier Mark OrsquoHare during the season.It is notable that while Lavery is based with Paddy Turley at Downpatrick, he rode his winners for Southern-based trainers like John Ryan and Luke Conner. OrsquoHare has the advantage as he is stable amateur to Navan trainer Noel Meade.Noel McParlan also got on the scoreboard and he was the top local point-to-point rider.Last week proved to be a sad one for local racing on Easter Sunday as Dr Fitz Gillespie, MBE, passed away suddenly at the age of . He was the GP in Tynan, Co Armagh, for  years.Dr Gillespie was one of the nicest men that I have ever met and was a long serving member of the Turf Club and IHRB. Although I donrsquot remember him riding, I know he did so for many years, and was also a trainer and owned horses right up to .His son, Pat, also rode as an amateur and professional, spending a good bit of his riding days with Jeremy Maxwell at Ballee. I can recall him winning on Raise An Argument at Downpatrick. Like his father, he also trained and one of his locally based owners was Joe McGrath, from Annacloy.Dr Gillespie was a regular steward at local meetings and also at many Southern racecourses. He was also a good supporter of the former Downpatrick Racecourse Supporters Club. He acted as a steward at the Armagh PTSP on April .He is predeceased by his first we, Dr Barbara, and also Lady Jane Alexander. He is survived by sons Pat and Rollo, daughter Gael, son-in-law, daughters-in-law and grandchildren.A memorial service will be held for Dr Gillespie at a later date as the funeral was private due to Covid-.

He said those who leave their vehicles outside the parks do so to avoid paying entrance fees and walk in instead.ldquoBoth parks have been shut since the coronavirus outbreak and now the government department responsible for them has agreed that they can reopen, continued Mr McGrath.ldquoHowever, local people are concerned that the move to open the parks for pedestrians only will encourage people to travel from further away and park outside their entrance gates.Mr McGrath said agriculture minister Edwin Poots is encouraging police to patrol the areas outside the parks and to manage this accordingly.The MLA added: ldquoThis is something I would also endorse and urge people to remember that the parks are only open for pedestrians.

Mr James said bluntly yesterday:ldquoThere are people who had an opportunity to say things at an early stage but did not. Now they have really pulled the carpet out from under our feet at an advanced stage. Irsquom bitterly disappointed at this kind of timing.The problem arose when the Housing Executive was in the final stages of preparing a scheme, which has been on the drawing board for several years, when it was told of the Government objections to a number of potential sites, including the Burren River catchment area and another, the most important, at the Dundrum Road end of the town.The Executive had finally got an agreement to purchase from the landowner of the Dundrum Road site and had made a final routine check with the Government departments before clinching a deal. It was only then that the objections were revealed by Stormont, which had been kept informed of all moves over the years.DOWNPATRICK ndash A Downpatrick woman has been named as one of the top ten lsquoWomen of the Yearrsquo by the readers of a daily newspaper.Mrs Terry Dunbar was selected by readers of the Belfastand is to be honoured at the Woman of the Year Luncheon in the City Hall, Belfast, next month.Mrs Dunbar works by day in the occupational therapy department of the Downshire Hospital, Downpatrick, and most of her spare time is spent in voluntary work for the mentally ill and mentally handicapped.She is secretary of the Newcastle Society for Mentally Handicapped Children and is leader of the Down Peter Pan Club for children under .One of the most successful activities of the club is riding. ldquoI take members to the Newcastle Riding Centre every other Saturday and the people there are very good.Mrs Dunbar also runs the Gateway Club at the Downshire Hospital where the members ages range from early s to elderly.KINAHALLA ndash The decision to scrap the Kinahalla Dam project in the Mournes has been welcomed this week as lsquoa decision of sanityrsquo.The comment was made by Dr Arthur Mitchell, chairman of Komrade , the main opposition group to the scheme.Dr Mitchell said: ldquoBasically Komrade is delighted with the decision of the Water Appeals Commission. They have agreed with us that the water which they required was not there and this scheme would have caused serious ecological damage.Confirmation that the objectors had won the fight over the Kinahalla scheme came on Friday, when the Environment Minister, Mr Philip Goodhart, said his department had accepted the findings of the Commission which came out against the pound. million project.News that the Commission had recommended the scheme should be ped was leaked last month. However, there was considerable doubt over whether the Department of Environment would agree to stand by the Commissionrsquos finding.Now that the Kinahalla scheme has been axed, the Government is to look to Lough Neagh to meet the growing water supply needs of Belfast and County Down.BALLYNAHINCH ndash Ballynahinch Chamber of Commerce has been asked to help get something done about the condition of the Fair Green in the town.A petition drawn up by local residents was handed in to the Chamber, asking them to bring the problem to the notice of the owners.The Green, at the junction of the Crossgar Road and Belfast Road, has been a bugbear with locals for a long time, and itrsquos hoped that pressure from the Chamber can bring about an agreement between the owners and Down Council, whereby the area may be given a much needed clean-up.The Chamber considered the petition at their full meeting last Tuesday evening, and are to seek help from the owners and the council, with a view to getting something done quickly.ARDGLASS ndash Ardglass Festival Committeersquos bar quiz came to a very successful conclusion on Wednesday night when last yearrsquos Festival quiz champions from the Dock Inn defeated the fancied challengers from Anchor Bar.Despite the lack of a really close contest, the large crowd were entertained and amused by some spirited and at times inspired answering.After coasting to a -point lead in the first round the Dock Innrsquos lsquoleague of gentlemenrsquo, John Howland, Billy Ross, Danny McGreevy and Peter Rodgers, were never really in trouble and held off the final round rally from the Anchor Inn to win comfortably.The trophies and cash prizes were presented by Mr Pat Irvine, Ardglass Festival chairman, who, in his remarks paid tribute to the organisers and to all who had played a part in making it such a tremendous success.KILLYLEAGH ndash Killyleagh Girlsrsquo Brigade celebrated their th anniversary at the weekend.The company presented their th annual display on Thursday and Friday evenings in front of capacity audiences in the Cooke Hall, and on Sunday, held a special anniversary service in st Killyleagh Presbyterian Church.The Rev J D Mark was chairman for the two nights of the display, with Mrs J McKnight, captain of Killinchy company and secretary of Strangford and Mourne District, the guest of honour on Thursday night.

It is also my understanding that Newry, Mourne and Down Council and Northern Irelandrsquos other  councils are working closely alongside the government department at this time.Cllr Walker said he would like to see the recycling centres open again, suggesting that strict controls could be introduced to only allow two vehicles access them at any one time.ldquoI would also appeal to people at this time to keep their waste until the recycling centres are open again. I appreciate that many people who are not at work at the moment are making the most of the time they have to clean out their homes, sheds and garages and I commend them for being active.ldquoHowever, it simply isnrsquot on to load up you car with waste, drive to a secluded area and dump it. I just donrsquot understand the mentality of people who engage in this kind of behaviour.Cllr Walker also said the cost of clearing up illegal waste is borne by the districtrsquos ratepayers.ldquoWe have the ironic situation that those who dump their waste illegally end up paying for its removal viatheir rates. This beggars belief, he declared. ldquoThe stupidity of those who dump waste in secluded areas is beyond me.Cllr Walker added: ldquoThe time has come for common sense and people really need to catch a grip of themselves. One of the most worrying aspectsof illegal dumping is that waste which ends up in fields is sometimes eatenby livestock which often results in deadly consequences. To those who dump their waste illegal my appeal is stop now.The local council has confirmed that it is receiving increasing reports about fly-tipping across the district since the start of the COVID- crisis. But the organisation insists that it is currently able to manage the issue within existing resources.A council spokesman said that the organisation continues to work closely with the Environment Agency which also performs a key role in addressing incidents of larger illicit dumping.On the issue of reopening the districtrsquos household recycling centres, the spokesman explained that the decision is continually being reviewed in line with government social distancing measures.He continued: ldquoFly-tipping is illegal and the council will strictly enforce this where evidence can be gathered. Responding to fly-tipping incidents also erts important council resources away from providing other essential services.The spokesman confirmed that the council is unable to remove illicitly-dumped waste from privately-owned land, explaining that where this occurs, both it and the Environment Agency has the legal powers to request its removal.He said the council will enforce this where required.The spokesman added: ldquoThe council would urge the public to avoid producing any unnecessary waste, including undertaking DIY and house and garden clearances at this time due to the considerable pressure being placed on public services.ldquoAny additional waste that is produced should be stored for future disposal at the household recycling centres once they re-open.

In a glittering playing career, the Ballykinlar man went on to win two more All-Ireland medals and established himself as one of the legends of the Gaelic football. Here, he selects his greatest Down team of all timeHIS name alone is enough to rekindle treasured memories of a time when Down football reigned supreme.Paddy lsquoMorsquo Doherty had the deadliest left foot in Ireland and he used it to maximum effect as Down swept all before them.Incredibly, itrsquos  years ago that Down took the sporting world by storm when they defeated Kerry to win the All-Ireland senior football title for the first time. It was also the first time that a team north of the border had won the Sam Maguire Cup.To reinforce their emergence as a new power in Gaelic football, Down retained their title the following year with Paddy as captain of the side which defeated Offaly and he was also a member of the Down team which won a third All-Ireland for the county in , Kerry again falling victim to the Red and Black machine in the final.As well as his three All-Ireland medals, Paddy won seven Ulster Championship, seven Railway Cup and three National League medals. He was the leading scorer in Ulster for eight seasons and in Ireland for three years.Now in his s, hersquos followed Downrsquos fluctuating fortunes ever since, relishing in theof the glory days in the early s, sharing in the disappointment of the barren times and casting a critical eye from the sidelines, though always with the optimistic outlook of the true fan.So what does he believe is the greatest Down team of all time Not surprisingly, given their accomplishments, hersquos largely selected his choice from his team-mates from the Sixties mdash though with typical modesty, he has not picked himself for the starting .ldquoYou have to remember that the Down team of s was the first to bring the Sam Maguire over the border, he says.ldquoThat was a really big achievement and we had beaten Kerry in the final. We had shown we were the best team in Ireland and we proved that again the following year in the final against Offaly after beating Kerry in the semi-final. We also beat Kerry in the  final, which meant that we had beaten them three times.ldquoKerry have always been the benchmark. If we had not beaten them, they would have won another three All-Irelands.Asked how his Down team would fare against present day sides ldquoItrsquos a dferent game now, what with the blanket defence and other things, but the Down teams of the s would have won in any era. Well, thatrsquos what I think, though Irsquom sure there are many people who would disagree. Eddie McKay Eddie won two All-Ireland medals with me in  and . He was a very good goalkeeper believe me, always safe, dependable and brave. He was an excellent shot stopper and made many excellent saves. I also played against him many times when Ballykinlar took on Dundrum. These were local parish derbies and everyone was trying to kill each other, but somehow Dundrum never managed to beat us. George Lavery George also won two All-Irelands in  and . He was the quiet man on the team, but there were few better man markers in the game and he would have been a star in any era. He had played a match of two for Antrim, but Maurice Hayes, who was secretary of the Down county board, persuaded him to sign for Down. He played as sweeper and was a good, tight marker. Leo Murphy Leo was a terric full back, tough and reliable. Not too many players could get past him and he could kick the ball a long distance. He also won two All-Irelands in  and . Pat Rice There was no one better than Pat Rice at catching a ball. His high fielding was magnicent and he was quick at clearing the ball. He gave away few chances and often kicked the ball out for Eddie McKay. He missed little and he wasnrsquot a dirty player at all. Dan McCartan One of only three Down players to win three All-Ireland senior medals along with Sean OrsquoNeill, Joe Lennon and myself, Dan is one of the all-time greats of Down football. He had outstanding ability, tackled hard and always looked for the quick clearance up to the front men. He could play anywhere as he showed when he moved to full back in the  final. Joe Lennon He was our captain in , though he did not play in the second after getting injured. He was a great captain and a terric leader. Joe placed a great emphasis on fitness and pioneered new coaching practices. He thought greatly about the game and was possibly ahead of his time. He was a very talented player. Tom OrsquoHare Tom played in the  team, but was good enough to get his place on any team. He was probably one of our best players that year. He was always steady and was great at delivering a ground ball. Jarlath Carey Jarlath won two All-Irelands in  and . He was a tireless worker, who was at home either in midfield or in attack. He was always forcing his way into the forward line and would wag his finger at me to go back into midfield to cover for him. I didnrsquot mind one bit, because he was good enough and I was fit enough to do what he asked. Colm McAlarney They called Colm lsquoThe Mighty Arklersquo after the famous racehorse because of his long strides up the field. Colm and Tom OrsquoHare were our two outstanding players in  and Colm was definitely one of the best midfielders in Ireland at that time, or any other time. Tony Hadden Tony won two All-Irelands in  and . He could fist the ball further than many players could kick it and he could also move into midfieldthings were going bad. He was tall and well built and could score a point as well as anyone. James McCartan A very strong player. Down would not have won anything without him because he took a lot of the abuse which would otherwise have been directed at me or Sean OrsquoNeill. He played a critical role in the  final against Offaly. We were two goals down in the first half and getting beaten. I crossed the ball to James who turned in mid air and put into the back of the net. Two more goals from Sean OrsquoNeill and Breen Morgan had us a goal up at half time, but it was his goal that turned things around. Sean OrsquoNeill You would have to say that Sean was the greatest Down footballer of them all. He was named in the GAA Team of the Century which says it all. We played well together, wherever I kicked the ball, Sean was there to get it. He had a wonderful sidestep and took a lot of abuse, but he never retaliated. He went on to become a successful manager and won the Sigerson Cup with Queenrsquos University. Mickey Linden Mickey was a flying machine and one of Downrsquos best ever forwards. He could blow defences away with his pace and score with either foot. He was also very versatile. You could play him anywhere and he would still be a threat. Perhaps his only failing was that he was too nice a player. He rarely made a foul. Won two All-Irelands in  and . Patsy OrsquoHagan Full forward and winner of two All-Irelands in  and . He could have played full forward, full back, or just about anywhere . He was that good. One of his best performances was Wembley Stadium during one of the Wembley Cup tournaments when he scored four goals against Galway. Breen Morgan They made them tough in Annaclone and for his size Breen was one of the hardest men on the field. He had broken his jaw before the  All-Ireland final, but went to the field without the protector which was made specially for him. He just threw it on to a chair. He was marked by Offalyrsquos Paddy McCormick, who was made of iron, but Breen was afraid of no one.Paddyrsquos substitutesDanny Kelly , Greg Blaney , Barry Breen , James Milligan , Ross Carr , Paddy OrsquoRourke , DJ Kane , Dan Gordon , Benny Coulter , Paddy Doherty ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/15th April 2020 Queen.jpg","title":"Queen Karen Europe’s best  ","story":"A KILLYLEAGH grandmother is a European powerlting champion at the age of .Karen Burns won the European title in France in March and set a new world record in the process.Powerlting involves three disciplines mdash squat, bench press and deadlt mdash and Karen capped a brilliant performance with a world record breaking lt of  kilos in the deadlt.Itrsquos a fantastic achievement for Karen, who only took up powerlting four years ago.The legal secretary, who has two daughters and four grandchildren, started gym classes at the age of , but within a few months made the switch to powerlting.Coached by Aaron Kelly, from Affinity Fit at the CG Fitness gym in Annacloy, she trained four times a week and was soon competing and winning medals at a national, international and world levels.She was the British champion two years running in  and .

This would be known as Serious Condition Criteria.While widely welcomed, what was not made clear was Departmental staff have discretion around who meets criteria and can overrule a claimantrsquos medical evidence.A number of enquiries were submitted to the Department under a Freedom of Information request.The responses are concerning.The Department stated legislation does not refer to serious conditions but rather whether there is a relevant change of circumstances. The decision not to reassess those with severe, lelong disabilities or health conditions who are unlikely to ever move into work: ldquoTook effect from  September , but did not result in legislative change.The Department was asked about the right of appealing a decision rejecting a claimant for Serious Conditions Criteria, who responded: ldquoThere is no automatic right of appeal against a determination which is embodied in or necessary to a decision. , a claimant has a right of appeal against an outcome decision rather than a determination, which is merely a component of the outcome decision.This was complicated for non-legally trained or represented claimants, so questions were put around full compliance with the Disability Discrimination and Human Rights.The Department responded stating it: ldquoDoes not hold any information relating to this hellip.may have been undertaken by DWP.A copy of the risk-assessment template used by the Department in instances of considering Serious Condition Criteria, was requested, but: ldquoNo template existsInstead, the response referred to assessment procedures where Departmental Healthcare Professionals advise on the re-referral period, and consider whether a claimantrsquos condition meets: ldquoThe new severe conditions criteria andno further assessments are required.However, the claimantrsquos own medical professionalrsquos opinion around Serious Condition Criteria could be over-ruled, with this decided by: ldquoAn Administrative Officer appointed by the Department.In respect of providing the legislation or guidance which permits the Department to overrule clinical opinion provided by a claimant seeking consideration under the Serious Condition Criteria, the response referred to ESA Regulations , which: ldquoProvides for the redetermination of whether someone has limited capability for work. The time period in relation to this is not set down in the legislation but is largely at the Department Decision Makers discretion ndash usually based on available medical evidence including medical reports from ATOS hellip The decision not to reassess those with severe, lelong disabilities or health conditions who would be unlikely to ever move into work, took effect from  September  but did not result in legislative change.As the Freedom of Information request was answerd prior to the restoration of devolution, the Department was asked with a Minister now in post, to comment on current processes around Serious Condition Criteria decision-making and in particular, how it can by discretion supersede a medical diagnosis by a claimantrsquos clinician. It was also askedprocedures are under review andthere is intention to bring forward legislation to allow for scrutiny or challenge.A spokesperson said: ldquo Anyone claiming ESA will be automatically assessed for the Severe Conditions criteria at their Work Capability Assessment by a Healthcare Professional. If the personrsquos condition or its al effects meet the criteria, the Department will be advised that no further assessments are required.In response to the overruling of clinical decisions, the spokesperson said: ldquoThe Work Capability Assessment looks at the al effects of a personrsquos condition, rather than the diagnosis itself. It is not a supersession of the opinion of their clinician.This dfered to the response provided prior to the Minister taking office, which appeared to show the Department was permitted to over-rule the evidence of claimantrsquos clinician.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The reality is we will look at the medical evidence. The Northern Ireland Executive will have its own flexibility and we may see across the country some iations we saw some iations going into lockdown as well. Itrsquoll be a decision that all four nations take together based on the evidence, he said.Mr. Lewis said he was aware of the complexities of Northern Irelandrsquos Border with the Republic of Ireland amid the pandemic, explaining that he has been meeting with First Minister Arlene Foster, Deputy First Minister Michelle OrsquoNeill and Taacutenaiste Simon Coveney.ldquoEven where there are dferences in the approach between the Republic and the North,there are,we know that we can make sure we are clear with residents why those dferences are there.ldquoThe challenge of having iations within Northern Ireland is how we manage that.An investigation in The Sunday Times at the weekend featured a Whitehall source claiming the government ldquomissed the boat on testing and PPEand ldquojust watched as the death toll mounted in Wuhan, China.The report also claimed that Prime Minister Boris Johnson missed five crucial COBRA meetings in the Cabinet Office in London.When asked to respond to these serious allegations, Mr. Lewis said: ldquoI didnrsquot recognise some of what I saw in the Times.ldquoI was in the Cobra meetings in January and February COBRA meetings are chaired by the Secretary of State in the Cabinet Office Briefing Rooms. Itrsquos a place, not a thing.ldquoWe were making decisions the scientists and medical experts were making decisions at that time and planning was going on. This is the point to judge it now when we have two months more evidence is dangerous and a misleading thing to do.Turning to PPE which has been an issue in Fermanagh, Mr. Lewis used his own constituency of Great Yarmouth as an example of where there has been ldquono problems with accessing equipment.He added: ldquoWersquove had gowns sent over to the UK, OrsquoNeills [sportswear] converted to gowns, there is gin distillery in your part of the world producing sanitisers.ldquoWersquore shting five and a half million pieces of PPE across to Northern Ireland. Wersquove been able to supply that itrsquos in good order. I am talking to the first minster every day that.Mr. Lewis said the priority of the United Kingdom government is to make sure ldquowe donrsquot hit the second peak of the virus.ldquoOne of the most damaging things economically would be, as well as health wise, to start coming out of lockdown ndash restaurants, pubs, whatever start opening again ndash and suddenly you have to close down again and thatrsquos not viable.ldquoI think itrsquos right to be cautious about this wersquoll make that decision in a few weeks.ldquoThe science is shting on this the experience is changing. I am cautious about predicting what will be in a few weeksrsquo time.He believes the government could ldquoflatten the curve of Covid-people continue to stay at home, adding: ldquoWe want to see past the peak, you donrsquot want to see a downward trend and ease up as all you do is let it shoot back up again.ldquoIf you think back to the beginning there were some quite scary numbers being put about by some experts about what the deaths might be. Now any death is too many and we have sadly lost people, friends and family who have gone through tragic experiences recently, and the figures are nowhere near those numbers we saw at the beginning.ldquoThatrsquos because the public across Northern Ireland and the UK have done a good job generally of following the guidelines which means we can flatten that curve, he said.Mr. Lewis explained that he had personal experience of people close to him who had been diagnosed with Covid-, including his parliamentary private secretary.ldquoSomeone I know lost a member of their family this week, I have a few people in family who had the disease.

I’ve done half marathons but never a full marathon.“The London Marathon is still going ahead in October, but I thought it would be nice to have something on that day to mark the day I would have done it.“The new date is two days after my wedding, hopefully it all still goes ahead.

Attempting to run  laps of the driveway outside his home in Islington, north London, Ryan is undertaking this challenge in response to local charities’ appeals for help during the pandemic: “I was sitting at home thinking, ‘what can I do ’ It’s devastating to think that all those local charities that do incredible work, day-in, day-out, are now finding themselves without the necessary funding unable to provide the vital services that they do. “Marie Curie, in particular, is a cause close to my heart, so I couldn’t bear to see them struggling. I walked outside and measured the distance between the top and bottom of our road which is .km. After some quick maths I realised  laps would equal the distance of a marathon.” The official London Marathon was due to take place this Sunday, however Ryan was not set to run the race himself: “I haven’t been training for the . miles distance – in fact, I’ve done zero training for this – which perhaps doesn’t leave me best prepared, but the thought of those in the care of the amazing Marie Curie nurses will spur me on, as will the memory of my mum and aunt Eileen.”\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusCountry and FarmingFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

You should soon be able to leave the room and close the door or gate. Progress to spending more time in a dferent room. Build this into the daily routine.It’s important that your dog remains relaxed. If they show signs of distress, leave them for a shorter period, or don’t move as far away, next time.Rachel Casey, Director of Canine Behaviour and Research at Dogs Trust, said: “For many of us it has been great to spend so much time with our dogs during lockdown andmostly our dogs love us being around too. But all this extra attention could potentially create a ticking time bomb of separation anxiety for our dogs. If they expect us to be about all the time, it will be more dficult for them to cope once we go back to our normal lives and aren’t in the house  .“Now is the time to act to avoid future problems – and it’s easy to do. Just make sure that you factor in time apart from your dog each day to help them be able to cope when alone – this could be separated from you by a door or child gate for an hour or two whilst you’re working or home schooling the kids. By organizing your dog’s day, with time apart, play times, exercise, other activity sessionsand quiet times, you can make sure that your dog maintains their ability to cope with the dferent aspects of ‘normal’ le when we get back to it.”For more ideas on how to keep your dog occupied visit www.dogstrust.org.uk--A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Irsquove grown up on the beach.ldquoI normally take landscape pictures because I love the water and some of the sunsets here are incredible, especially in the winter.Rochelle wrote her Instagram handle on the parcels, so that people who found them could send her a message.ldquoIt was just to make someone smile, and Irsquove had some lovely comments from people who got back to me on Instagram, she said.ldquoThey said they were going to put it up in their room and frame it.ldquoSome people were feeling a bit down and didnrsquot expect to find anything, so it cheered them up.ldquoMy job was done ndash the main purpose was to make people smile and it did - it made me smile too.ldquoI think itrsquos very important to say hello, especiallypeople are living by themselves orthey havenrsquot got their family around.ldquoWhen Irsquom normally walking the dog I say hello and have a chat, but itrsquos quite hard to do that now because everyone is quite wary.ldquoI donrsquot have to have that physical contact with someone to brighten up their day.ldquoArt is just a dferent  to communicate with. You knowsomeonersquos a bit shy and they donrsquot want to speak using words, they may want to draw a picture and open up that way instead.ldquoI think art can show feelings that words canrsquot quite express, so itrsquos a great idea to share that with the community.At a time of uncertainty and doubt, Rochelle ended with a message of hope and solidarity:ldquoI think as a community we could do so much more at this time, she saidldquoEveryone is concerned about how long it is going to last, but I am hopeful we can get past it, andwe all work together and remain positive we may come out of this in an even better situation than we was before.Rochelle would like to make clear that all parcels were fully sanitised.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

If your dog stays where they are, wait a moment, then go back and reward them with an extra treat.Increase the distance you move away and the time you wait before ing with the extra treat. You should soon be able to leave the room and close the door or gate. Progress to spending more time in a dferent room. Build this into the daily routine.It’s important that your dog remains relaxed. If they show signs of distress, leave them for a shorter period, or don’t move as far away, next time.Rachel Casey, Director of Canine Behaviour and Research at Dogs Trust, said: “For many of us it has been great to spend so much time with our dogs during lockdown andmostly our dogs love us being around too. But all this extra attention could potentially create a ticking time bomb of separation anxiety for our dogs. If they expect us to be about all the time, it will be more dficult for them to cope once we go back to our normal lives and aren’t in the house  .“Now is the time to act to avoid future problems – and it’s easy to do. Just make sure that you factor in time apart from your dog each day to help them be able to cope when alone – this could be separated from you by a door or child gate for an hour or two whilst you’re working or home schooling the kids. By organizing your dog’s day, with time apart, play times, exercise, other activity sessionsand quiet times, you can make sure that your dog maintains their ability to cope with the dferent aspects of ‘normal’ le when we get back to it.”For more ideas on how to keep your dog occupied visit www.dogstrust.org.uk--A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.
