To borrow from the balding man in a grey jacket, who makes a brief appearance commenting on the music of a fictional Belfast rocker in the penultimate story, each of these acutely observed portraits “penetrates to the heart of what it means to be lonely, or in love or to feel a failure”. An exceptional ear for dialogue, an impeccable semantic rhythm and an uncanny ability to tease laughter out of the darkest moments mean Erskine is perfectly poised to stare, unflinching, into our neoliberal abyss. The result is a gripping, wonderfully understated book that oozes humanity, emotion and humour.The first story, “To All Their Dues”, opens in a beauty parlour. When Kyle walks in, it’s clear he’s not seeking the back, sack and crack treatment. He’s after money: he calls it “community”, we’d call it a protection racket. Kyle is terrifying. On a visit to his brother’s grave, he forces flowers into the mouth of a man who has inadvertently upset him: “He was making a choking sound and the flowers were falling apart but he still kept pushing.” The story unfolds in three parts. First we hear from Mo, who did time “on the fortune telling” at a call centre while studying for the beauty qualifications to get the parlour started then Kyle, who helped his brother kill their alcoholic and violent father then the only person Kyle trusts, his girlfriend, Grace, who has learned to expect little more from life than “holidays and meals and trips to the multiplex and city breaks”. Early on, you feel this is heading towards an unpleasant climax, with Kyle’s violent temper at its core, but as Erskine pulls us in deeper, comfortably leaping back and forth across time, she unearths the contradictions that shape a life – leaving us to work out why our sympathy just took another U-turn.In “Inakeen”, a widow called Jean observes, with increasing affection, her new Somali neighbours. Occasionally, her obnoxious son drops in to watch television and complain about his ex, “that bitch”, who has returned to Canada with their son. The day Jean learned her grandson was leaving, “it had started to rain and everything around was ugly”. Now, she misses the little boy and his mother more than her late husband, “someone she once overheard being described as a fellow who would put a bob on himself both ways”. The tedium of Jean’s life is excruciating, her feeling of abandonment searing. While Erskine shows no interest in triumphant endings, by layering one “little chip of humanity” on another she creates a tenderness that resounds.“Observation” offers hilarious insights into the relationship between a pair of teenagers, Cath and Lauren, and Lauren’s mum, Kim Cassells – “never just plain Kim”. Cath’s commentary is irresistible: Kim Cassells’s two-tone hair reminds her of “a broken Kinder egg” being close to Kim Cassells makes Cath “feel lumpen” Kim Cassells’s tattoo, Only God Can Judge Me, proves “mortal opinion was of no interest to her”. Cath is strangely fascinated by her friend’s mum and her string of boyfriends, the latest a creep called Stuart. As the observations stack up, though, Kim Cassells’s insecurities are revealed. Erskine captures beautifully the painful neglect of her daughter, and the endearing way in which Cath tries to protect her best mate.All 10 stories are set in Belfast, where Erskine was born in 1968. Readers expecting tales of the Troubles will find glimpses and shadows, but her literary microscope is mostly focused elsewhere, on women and men contending with everyday boredom and disappointment. Like the couple in the title story, whose marriage has been crumbling since the death of their six-year-old. Gavin puts up with “those dreary and micro-managed handjobs”, but he can’t forgive Susan for the “unspeakably quiet and modest” funeral she had insisted on. Susan, meanwhile, has longed to have a breakdown – “it would have been a relief” – but she’s so brittle, it just won’t come.Others die as they lived, “in front of the TV”. Those left behind seem resigned to the idea that there’s “a time for this, a time for that, a time for whatever”. They are looking for a bit of love and a bit of safety, a bit of hope for a bit of a future. It’s not easy, though, when the place where you live is as tired as you are, “like it can’t be bothered with the afternoon either and longs for the shutters down”. People stare out of their windows, or go for pointless walks looking into shop windows. They collect online vouchers for cheap meals at restaurants with inconvenient time constraints. They are trying either to destroy their past or forget some violence it served up – but the remembered sight of a murder, “the obscenity of an exploded head”, can surface in the most uneventful of lives. Still, Erskine’s subjects do their best to cope. They are trying to keep up they are trying to reach out. They are doing their best to free themselves from the undertow of their lives.• Lara Pawson’s This Is the Place to Be is published by CB Editions. Sweet Home is published by Picador (RRP £12.99).

The country is the United States, the time the second decade of the new century. It is an era of new language and technology in American sexuality, but this is not a book that tries to map higher order narratives. Instead it is a minute journalistic account of the defining sexual relationships in three people’s lives. Taddeo chose her subjects for their honesty and openness, and perhaps for what she perceives as their ordinariness.Their names are Maggie, Lina and Sloane. Maggie is in her early 20s and suffering from the after-effects of a relationship with a married teacher when she was in high school. Lina is in her 30s and lives in Indiana and has rekindled a school romance after the end of her first marriage. Sloane and her husband are middle-aged swingers who have threesomes. If the three women represent a synecdoche of some overarching truth, it’s a somewhat grim one, about the female struggle to achieve sexual choice and bodily autonomy, and to find physical and emotional connection. Sloane has a history of bulimia, Lina was sexually assaulted in high school, Maggie earns the hatred of her neighbours for telling her story. The women’s accounts seem to combine into a narrative of trying to please, to attract, to be believed, to not get hurt, to not get scolded. Taddeo is pessimistic about the promise of sexual equality. Despite their best efforts to learn what makes them happy, all three seem to experience punishment anyway.“Throughout history, men have broken women’s hearts in a particular way,” Taddeo writes in her prologue. “They love and then grow weary and spend weeks and months extricating themselves soundlessly, pulling their tails back into the doorways, drying themselves off, and never calling again.”The most compelling of the narratives is that of Maggie. When the reader meets her, Maggie is 23 and going to court to confront the teacher named Aaron Knodel with whom she had a relationship as his 17-year-old student in Fargo, North Dakota.“Men come to insert themselves, they turn a girl into a city,” Taddeo writes of Knodel’s act of seduction. “When they leave, their residue remains, the discoloration on the wood where the sun came through every day for many days, until one day it didn’t.” Taddeo has a habit of mixing metaphors and using similes that don’t always work. At one point Knodel is described as an “avuncular oyster” in another scene, women sit “pitched forward, like soup tureens in an earthquake”. “The train is moving out of view, its tail slipping like a sword into the trees,” she writes, referring not to a literal train but to the passage of time. She haphazardly switches between tenses – Maggie’s story is told mostly in the present tense Sloane’s mostly in the past – and the third and second person. There are long lists of evocative details, and full stops where there would traditionally be question marks or commas. In Maggie’s case, at least, the unfairness at the heart of the story is potent despite these attempts at lyricism.Taddeo documents how Maggie first confided in her teacher about a brief relationship with another older man. (This is later used against her as evidence in court.) At first Knodel plays the role of a concerned adult. He asks Maggie why her family decided not to press charges. She confides in him about her parents’ alcohol use. Over the winter holidays, Knodel starts texting her more frequently, texts that soon turn more sexual in nature, and then into meetings. He invites Maggie over when his wife is out of town, his children asleep upstairs. When his wife finds evidence of his texting after several months, he abruptly cuts Maggie off, leaving her deeply depressed. It’s only later that she realises that what happened was a kind of exploitation.Maggie had once given Knodel a paperback of the novel Twilight, comparing their relationship to the impossible romance of a vampire and a human. He gives the book back to her, full of notes encouraging the fantasy. “Imagine a child, who has idealised a fairytale love story, reading notes from a teacher, who is saying, Yes, yes, I am your vampire lover and you are my forbidden fruit,” writes Taddeo. “We are your favourite love story. For the rest your life, nothing will taste like this. Can you imagine.”Taddeo reveals how, when a man is popular and well liked, married with children and good at his job, an accusation by a woman against him is perceived as slander, and all of the mistrust directed at the accuser. The relationship and its aftermath have left Maggie stalled in her life. After school, she drops out of college and works as a waitress. She presses charges after Knodel is named North Dakota Teacher of the Year. In court, the jury chooses not to believe her. He prevails, not only getting a not-guilty verdict but also keeping his job. The integrity of the charismatic male must be preserved the hurting woman in his wake is taken as a given. Taddeo is certain of the injustice. “There are men and there are women,” she writes. “And one still rules the other in the pockets of the country that are not televised.”Lina’s story is a more hopeful one. After years in an all but sexless marriage, she leaves her husband and pursues Aidan, her high school sweetheart, now married with children of his own. In hotel rooms and the backs of cars they carry on an entirely physical affair. Lina knows that for her it means sexual liberation and for Aidan it’s a noncommittal distraction. She laments how hard she tries for him. Despite this imbalance, the physical pleasure she finds in their encounters is heartening. One senses that, having found sexual connection, Lina will not settle for a lesser affection again.Taddeo spent many hours with her subjects to better recount their family histories, sexual histories, motivations and insecurities. The result is three detailed stories, without a clear sense of why she chose these women, and why right now. This book does not reveal a secret history, or even describe a contemporary sexual dynamic with such specificity that one cringes in pained recognition (as happened with Kristen Roupenian’s short story “Cat Person”). Three Women simply confirms, once again, the hypocrisies of the heterosexual marriage, the psychological scars that sexual coercion and violence can leave on a person, and the persistence of gender inequality.• Three Women is published by Bloomsbury (RRP £16.99).

The Aarhus convention, which was agreed in 1998, enshrines the right for everyone to receive environmental information held by public authorities.The parties to the convention are required to make the necessary provisions so that public authorities contribute to these rights to make them effective.The coalition of NGOs will raise its complaints on Thursday at a meeting of the working group of members of the convention in Geneva.The UK, EU and European governments are all members of the International Civil Aviation Organization, a UN body incharge of reducing the carbon footprint of international aviation. But the ICAO has been criticised for its secrecy. Its agenda and discussion documents are not released to the public or the media, and the meetings are held behind closed doors.Documents do emerge through leaks, but the ICAO rules warn participants that they face “unlimited liability for confidentiality breaches”.Andrew Murphy of the NGO Transport and Environment said the UK and others were using these rules to avoid releasing their policies, and were therefore in breach of the Aarhus convention.He said governments had failed to release their submissions to the ICAO environment committee, which meets every three and has drawn up the first scheme for international airlines to declare their emissions, known as Corsia.Murphy said: “Governments have been using this UN agency’s arcane rules to dodge their obligations under international law. They are required to be transparent in how they regulate aviation emissions. Their secrecy is one of the reasons why the airline sector remains such a climate laggard.”Under Corsia, international aircraft will this year have to start monitoring their emissions as part of ICAO measures. Central to these measures is a market-based system of purchasing emissions offsets rather than a requirement to directly reduce aircraft emissions.Air transport companies can reduce the amount of carbon emissions they have to offset by using biofuels. A final decision on the rules around what kinds of biofuels can be used was made last week at an ICAO meeting, but the policy has not been published. asked the ICAO to release details of the policy, but the agency did not respond.Corsia was agreed in 2016 by the 36 ICAO member countries and has taken until this year to implement. But some believe it will not have the required impact on reducing emissions produced by an aviation industry which predicts passenger numbers doubling to 8.2 billion by 2037.A spokesperson for the Department for Transport – which sends officials to ICAO meetings – said the UK did not publish official correspondence with the UN body because it is was “not an environmental organisation” and that its work involved confidential information which was commercially sensitive.“We strive for maximum transparency and recognise the importance of public access to information, which is why we are seeking to improve ICAO practices in this area,” the DfT said. “We are engaging with the ICAO and all its other member states, and will continue working to ensure our international environmental responsibilities are upheld.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5198c1b602d14c8c1a88ae69842f2f7a207719a2/0_101_5700_3420/master/5700.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1a550322eacc241138fdc6031bad2a3f","title":"how to handle the impossible stress of cooking for other people wine helps","story":"Calmness is contagious, portion size is everything – and a boozy sorbet can perk up the most boring of guestsLast week I ordered a whole salmon but did not specify the size I required, because to have done so in a small family-run fishmonger would have been a jerk move.

I first heard about it in the early 90s, on the radio, where I misheard it as “Cooking for Krauts” and thought “That’s a bit racist, but I’ll give it a whirl.” It teaches you a whole heap of 20th-century presentation faux pas, such as situating an olive slightly too centrally on top of everything, but it offers important lessons on quantity. Because there is also such a thing as too much.I was poaching this gigantic fish, per rule two: nobody comes to your house to watch you running about. There is no good way to do last-minute cooking in front of people. If you get very stressed, that is contagious, and if you don’t get stressed at all, they lose confidence in eating anything. In summer, poach fish, make vitello tonnato for meat eaters and bake savoury tarts for vegetarians. Rick Stein’s is the only hand you need to hold for the poaching of a whole fish, although he tends to mandate a huge amount of wine in the broth, which I always think is a bit Versailles. Vitello tonnato, an Italian dish of cold veal with tuna mayonnaise, sounds mad but is exquisite. I make it with pork and call it porkato tonnato. The best savoury tart book in the world is Tamasin Day-Lewis’s The Art of the Tart, though Yotam Ottolenghi has a roast garlic tart with the superpower of being able to deliver 17 different taste experiences in one go. It is a bit psychedelic, actually. In winter, go full stew, but always do one of those Gordon Ramsay scone or dumpling topping numbers, otherwise it will feel a bit like a school dinner.Opinion is ided about how fancy you need to be. My Mr believes that dinner-party food has to be as good as restaurant fare, otherwise why aren’t you in a restaurant? I believe that it has to be edible and look cute, and beyond that, nobody really cares. He will make a terrine so complicated (Simon Hopkinson) that you have to dismember a chicken and put it back together again in a completely different formation, a mixture of culinary and butchery skills roughly on a par with Hannibal Lecter. It will take four days and that will seem, to him, totally normal. I will make a chicken with 40 cloves of garlic (Richard Olney), which takes seven minutes to prepare, and still be quietly applauding myself the entire night.Back to the fish: my plan was to garland it with cucumber to look like scales, in an ironic nod to the ancient suburban housewife art form. It turns out this is incredibly hard, and you probably have to do an evening class to get it right. In fact, never assume you can do something just because you’ve seen it on TV a few times. Yet this brings me neatly to rule three, which is the critical audience: it doesn’t exist. There is a gratitude that is almost primal when you feed any person who isn’t one of your children: if it collapses, they laugh if it’s a ham en croute that looks like an unexploded parcel bomb, they rejoice. Only once in my life – when I made a potted shrimp (Sainsbury’s magazine, circa 2004) that was too stiff and incredibly packed with butter, and I asked my late uncle whether he’d like some bread, and he replied mournfully: “I suppose that might help” – did I have the trace of a feeling that it wasn’t quite right.If your friends are boring, serve a red wine sorbet at 11pm something about the sugar and the unexpected Dolby-surround-sound effect of red wine from two sources makes everyone perk up. Of course if you’ve got Tories round, you could just give them cocaine for the same effect, but I have no idea about cooking for Conservatives."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9cb676d4dface4f2f32699a5bd643ed7908dfe2b/2_0_7107_4267/master/7107.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=087522b3ade19bff44abecca6ecf88b7","title":"sixteen of the worlds greatest kitchen gadgets chosen by chefs","story":"From rice hacks to a 100-year-old rolling pin, cooks and food writers reveal the gizmos they could never do withoutGiven an unlimited budget, a keen cook could drop tens of thousands of pounds on the kitchen of their dreams. Yet often, even in the most smoothly finished set-up, it is tried-and-trusted, bashed-up equipment that we rely on the most. We asked some of our leading chefs and cookery writers to share which old gizmos and gadgets they cherish.Diana Henry, food writer and author of How to Eat a Peach“I’m not into gadgets. Equipment has to earn its space. My brothers gave me an ice-cream machine 26 years ago, when I got married. The marriage is long gone, but the Gaggia Gelatiera is as good as ever. Its white body is yellowed with age and, annoyingly, chunks of caramel and nuts get lodged around the dials, but it’s a workhorse. No parts have ever been replaced. It’s solidly reliable and it allows you to be wholly creative. That is a lot to offer a cook. It’s a bit bulky to hug, but occasionally I pat it and talk to it, willing it on when an ice-cream looks as if it may not freeze (pink grapefruit and basil, and tahini and lime, lately). It cost £240, a fortune then, but it was worth every penny. I will be heartbroken if it gives up the ghost.”Vivek Singh, founder and head chef, Cinnamon Collection, London“My lucky charm is a small, battered, beautiful brass mortar and pestle I’ve used since before we opened the Cinnamon Club in 2001. I use it to grind all spices during service. You don’t need tonnes of shop-bought ground spices. Grind what you need from whole and the flavours are much better. Brass is great: inert and easy to clean.”Sat Bains, chef-owner, Restaurant Sat Bains, Nottingham“About 30 years ago, I nicked a Sabatier roasting fork from Hotel Ristorante La Gondola in Derby, where I was working. It was a phenomenal place, which later became notorious after it featured on Ramsay’s Kitchen Nightmares. I loved that fork – I felt like Marco Pierre White holding it. It was quite a magical tool, but I was skint so I appropriated it. At home, I use it to cook steaks on the barbecue and for carving roast joints. It has a dirty wooden handle now and a kink from dropping it, but it’s history. I’ve also got a Dennis the Menace mug the team at La Gondola gave me when I left. Things don’t last 30 years any more.”James Cross, chef-owner, Lake Road Kitchen, Cumbria“When I was at Simpson’s in Birmingham my good friend Paul Insley gave me an old sterling silver butter knife he used for opening scallops. It’s long, flat, incredibly strong and, unlike a scallop knife, its rounded end never tears the scallop. Between us, it’s opened about 110,000.”Ravinder Bhogal, chef-founder, Jikoni, London“Growing up in Nairobi, visitors regularly dropped in and the kitchen was always full of women preparing chai and snacks. “Our guests are our gods,” was my grandmother’s mantra. These snacks included sev: spiced chickpea-flour noodles piped out of a brass sev sancha into scorching oil and fried to an off-the-Richter crunch. The batter sits in a main cylinder, to which you fit discs with various shapes punched into them, then squeeze the dough out using a manual lever. As a child, I coveted it like a toy and as an adult I first pilfered, then inherited it. I rarely use it, but I treasure it. In its patina is my grandmother’s coconut oil scent, her wit, her stories with a million digressions and her lesson in generosity: if you can share your snacks, you can share anything.”Stosie Madi, chef, Parkers Arms, Lancashire“We have a wooden rolling pin that is more than 100 years old. It belonged to Grandma Nolan, my business partner Kathy Smith’s gran. It’s totally smooth and, because we are constantly using it and polish rather than wash it, has an almost natural nonstick surface. No new rolling pin would create such even layers for a cheese and onion pie. We fight as to who gets to use it, but if Kathy is around she gets first dibs. It is irreplaceable.”Sai Deethwa, chef-owner, Buddha Belly, Birmingham“My mum runs a stall at Stroud and Gloucester farmers’ markets and I used to love her noodle wok, which was warped like the top of a heart from being lifted so often full of stir-fried noodles. The handle snapped recently and it’s funny how sad we were. I started out six years ago and my parents bought me a wok – a simple one from a Chinese supermarket I would recommend the chain Wing Yip. Now, after feeding thousands of people, it’s warped like Mum’s. It’s basic, but I cherish mine.”Josh Overington, chef-owner, Le Cochon Aveugle, York“During our research into traditional French cooking, we came across flamboir à lard, where you use a flambadou – a cast iron cone with a long handle heated to a glowing red – to quickly ignite and melt fat. Historically, it was used to sear joints of meat, but they are extremely rare now. We had one made and use it to render lamb fat as we cook oysters and langoustines. The flaming fat gives shellfish a distinct flavour most people haven’t tasted before.”Tom Kitchin, chef-owner, The Kitchin, Edinburgh“I first came across Microplanes when I was working for Alain Ducasse in Monte Carlo in 2003 and I’ve used them ever since. They grate impossibly finely and not only are they precise (they zest lemons much more efficiently than standard graters) but they are also much smaller than the old-fashioned box grater – and space is premium in any kitchen.”Nieves Barragán Mohacho, chef, Sabor, London“Jumaco \u0026amp Maestro is a Spanish family business that has hand-built ovens since 1890. I’ve loved them since I saw one in Segovia years ago, but it wasn’t until Sabor that I could treat myself. Ours is a tall, stone, wood-fired cylinder in which food slowly rotates. For our suckling pigs, there is no other oven that treats meat so gently whilst achieving that crispiness you want on the skin. It’s the jewel of our kitchen.”Saiphin Moore, co-owner and head of food at Rosa’s Thai Cafe, nationwide, and Hoh Sek and Lao Cafe, London“In Thailand, parents hand down handmade bamboo pots and steamers to their daughters and my dad made loads of different sizes, which I brought to England. I’ve got some at home and the bigger ones at Lao Café. As a little girl, I remember eating sticky rice cooked in similar pots my mum had, but I also use the steamer to cook vegetables, chicken and fish. It’s a little taste of home. I love the subtle bamboo flavour and smell you get from steamers. They make everything more fragrant.” This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

Sure, he had been offered a glimpse of what is to come while drawing the focus with that stoppage‑time own goal which condemned England’s under-21s to a damaging defeat by France at the European Championship. Aidy Boothroyd put an uncharacteristically frazzled display that night down to the unsettling nature of the tortuous negotiations over his transfer to Manchester United. In effect, the full-back had been distracted in Cesena.Yet, now that a compromise over a fee has been thrashed out and the youngster from New Addington is about to be confirmed as a United signing in a £45m deal that could rise to £50m, the real scrutiny kicks in. A player with only 46 senior appearances, and a solitary full season with Crystal Palace, will be expected to hit the ground running at United.After all, his purchase has demanded a significant chunk of the money allocated for the revamp of Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s backline. The tackles and interceptions which drew warm appreciation at Selhurst Park will suddenly be the bare minimum expected at Old Trafford. Heaven forbid anyone actually succeeds in dribbling past him.Not that anything, to date, has really fazed Wan-Bissaka. He is quiet and unassuming, mature beyond his years and far from flash off the pitch, and those he has left behind are convinced he will have what it takes to thrive in the spotlight. On the field, the 21-year-old is raw. He has established a reputation as a fine tackler, a player who has thrived in one-on-one situations from the moment he was thrust in against Christian Eriksen, Alexis Sánchez and Eden Hazard on his first three senior outings in the spring of 2018. No defender in Europe’s elite leagues came close to matching his 129 tackles last term, earning him the award for player of the year at a club apparently utterly reliant upon Wilfried Zaha.Some of those lunges were born of slight issues in positioning, but a player nicknamed “Spider” boasts telescopic legs and a burst of pace to help extricate himself from trouble of his own making, with those wonderfully quick feet adding to his armoury.“You think you’re past him, but he’s got enough strength to get a last-ditch tackle in from nowhere,” said Zaha, who had been surprised at being relatively nullified by the former winger plucked from the academy building across Copers Cope Road to make up the numbers in training. A standard was set in those early sessions. In 3,135 minutes of Premier League football last season, opponents wriggled past the right-back 10 times.The fact that, among defenders, his tally of 84 interceptions was bettered only by Dijon’s Wesley Lautoa, Armando Izzo of Torino and William of Wolfsburg suggests he is also developing a fine sense of anticipation. That said, a player only recently converted from life more advanced up the flank in Palace’s youth setup has benefited hugely from James Tomkins – so often his closest ally as the right-sided centre‑half – guiding him through testing occasions, whether with reminders of marking duties or retaining team shape. The younger man is not infallible. United and their support must be aware they are buying potential. They will need to be patient at times.Solskjær will have been attracted to his energy. Wan-Bissaka boasts a presence, strong physique and that pace which is such an asset. He will be a threat down the flank, where he will always be an outlet whether those lung-bursting sprints are in possession or in anticipation of a pass.The boyhood Arsenal supporter, who was so prolific in junior football to attract Palace’s scouts when he was 11, has acknowledged he should add goals to his game. “They’re coming, don’t worry,” he offered through a smile when interviewed by the  in February. Back then his priorities were still to build on a promising start to life in the Premier League, though his standards never dipped.A youngster who was never taught how to tackle and was first offered his opportunity with Palace having seen 12 teammates ruled out through injury has become a £45m-plus full-back inside 16 months. His rise has been meteoric. There is no reason to think it will stop now."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b2327d5e9109a5e7ab98368ce4a860a45ba5ae68/0_41_2876_1726/master/2876.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bc378377e793cdffd9b78e8ce2fcf163","title":"pierluigi collina fifa referees rules womens world cup","story":"Chair of Fifa’s refereeing committee gives energetic presentation in Paris following controversial incidentsIn the midst of a refereeing and VAR storm Pierluigi Collina was calm. A media briefing on refereeing mid-tournament is not a new occurrence. At the 2018 World Cup a similar conference was called. Except then it was easier. It was about success. The much-maligned VAR was, overall, working.This time the attention is on the game’s rules and the implementation of those rules in a way few would have expected before a ball was kicked at the Women’s World Cup. But Collina, the chairman of Fifa’s refereeing committee, was on a mission. In a Marcelo Bielsa-esque session at the Parc des Princes, Collina talked through controversial rule by controversial rule with the aids of PowerPoint and video. Leaping up to test a member of the press on whether a photo on his phone showed a ball on the line – “No,” the bemused reporter replied – Collina swept across to bring a different angle into view and had his “ta‑da” magician moment.Later, he interrupted a question, keen to show frame-by-frame an incident in Sweden’s defeat of Canada to show exactly why there was a lengthy stoppage and whether prioritising accuracy over time was correct.Responding to the most common complaint, that the Women’s World Cup is being used as a guinea pig to test these new rules, he said these rules have already been used in the Under-20 World Cup in Poland and are being used in the current Africa Cup of Nations and Copa América. Last December all 24 nations competing at this World Cup were invited to a meeting on the rules, while teams were able to test and begin playing under the rules to practise during the two international windows of 2019. “On none of these occasions did we receive any complaints or questions,” Collina said. “They were accepted.”The decision to suspend the booking of goalkeepers that breached the new rule of keeping a single foot, rather than both, on the line, was taken following experiences of the new system at the under-20s in Poland, Collina said. “We realised in Poland that all the incidents were not deliberate. It was because of a lack of control of the body. An honest encroachment. We thought it was harsh … It’s a temporary dispensation so will be discussed further.”The response to the new one-foot rule surprised Collina. Because it was designed to help shot-stoppers. “Keeping two feet on the line is impossible”, he said.“If the law that existed is not effective, or enforced by the referee, we have to change it. First we thought we have to change it to make the goalkeepers’ job easier. So we decided to allow them to step one foot off. This is the only change we made.”Yet rather than the rule itself being the problem, it is the stringent implementation of it, to the millimetre, that is drawing ire. Not just for goalkeepers on the line but for offsides, too. VAR leaves no room for manoeuvre or subjectivity and Collina, the head of Fifa’s refereeing department, Massimo Busacca, and Fifa’s senior manager of refereeing, Kari Seitz, are convincing in their sympathetic picking apart of whether it needs to be so hair-splitting.“Today, in matches with VAR, if the technology makes us able to view something we cannot ignore it,” Collina said. “It doesn’t matter if it is 2cm or 20cm, there isn’t a small offside and a big offside. If a ball is over the line by 0.5cm its a goal. There are not small goals or big goals. It’s not a matter of small encroachment or big encroachment, it’s just encroachment.”He was dismissive of Cameroon’s complaints over perceived England offside incidents during their hotly contested game in Valenciennes on this score: “They all have the right to complain as long as the complaints are based on facts. If they are not based on facts I have no time for them.”However, “not all decisions are black or white,” the former referee said. “There is room for interpretation. I know there is this mood. And we ask ourselves what could have been done differently and it is hard to find the answer, especially when the referee took the correct decision, or when VAR made the correct decision. If my common sense damages someone else, I cannot use common sense.”The Scotland goalkeeper Lee Alexander stepped off her line to save Florencia Bonsegundo’s penalty in the 93rd minute against Argentina forcing a retake. The resulting goal sent Scotland out of the tournament. Collina believes the state of the match meant the decision was more controversial, rather than being incorrect, and that had the incident taken place in different circumstances people would have given it less attention.On handball incidents, though, he was more evasive, brushing over the decisions in the same “correct” or “incorrect” manner, ignoring the bigger questioning of the rule itself: that the arm must be in a “natural” position.When reviewing the late penalty that handed the Netherlands a quarter-final spot against Japan he ran through the VAR process but did not take up the question of whether, given Saki Kumagai’s contorted straining body, her arm placement is “natural” in the context of her movement and whether, to be frank, having limbs is being penalised."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9cf1b92bfec2bb3908dd648a24150246111ab13/160_268_1593_956/master/1593.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=960afdf3174bb867c65a3dc9b51e5ac7","title":"wayne rooney dc united goal halfway line mls","story":"Wayne Rooney continues to add to his highlight reel in Major League Soccer.

Laura Evelyn, an actor looking for a new place to stay, didn’t like the decor particularly – the fake leather sofa and glass dining table weren’t to her taste – but her would-be landlord was friendly enough. But as she was leaving the viewing, the owner handed her a sheet of paper. When Evelyn read it, she was flabbergasted.It contained a list of 31 rules that Evelyn, aged 35, would be expected to abide by if she moved in. Showers couldn’t last longer than 15 minutes. She was allowed two visitors a month, who must be approved two weeks in advance. After eating, she must wash up, and immediately return to her room. And if she left dishes in the sink, she’d be charged £15 a pop.Most people are used to abiding by rules – and good manners – when cohabiting with others. Have sex quietly, don’t hog the bathroom and never microwave mackerel, unless you are a monster. But, in effect, what Evelyn’s would-be landlord wanted wasn’t a flatmate he just wanted her to pay his mortgage and disappear.This is an egregious example of the worst inequalities of the housing crisis, but also not as unusual as you may think. Browse Spareroom or Gumtree, and you will see similarly extreme housemate adverts. There was the £650-a-month London flatshare where tenants were forbidden from Skyping their family in the evening. There are the rogue landlords who offer to waive rent, in exchange for sex. Then there are the lighthearted ones. Are you a postgraduate student looking for a double room to let in Brixton? Come this way – provided you aren’t an anthropologist. (Sociologists and social psychologists are welcome.)What these adverts reflect is that Britain is going back to being a nation of renters. Home ownership levels have plunged, with a quarter of UK households expected to rent privately by the end of 2021. In 2017, British tenants paid a record £50bn in rent. Young adults form “Generation Rent”, with homeownership a distant dream for those professionals on average incomes but without the large deposits needed to get on to the housing ladder.The night before I speak to a 28-year-old PR worker who lives in north-east London, she ate sweets for dinner in her bedroom. Why? Because she finds her live-in landlord’s rules so restrictive that she avoids communal areas such as the kitchen. She is expected to abide by a checklist taped to the back of the front door, which insists that hair straighteners are turned off, and lists the various doors, windows and skylights that must be locked prior to leaving. In the bathroom, her other housemate stuck a note to the mirror, requiring all spittle to be wiped away immediately. “The level of micromanaging … it’s madness,” she says. Her landlord even installed a smart plug on her hair straighteners, which she remotely controls via her phone. She wants to leave, but moving house is expensive and her £600-a-month budget is low, meaning that she is stuck for now. Her mental health has deteriorated. “You’re always stressed,” she says. “You think: ‘If I see her, is she going to complain about something?’”Expecting prospective tenants to live under a quasi-feudal regime reflects the power wielded by landlords in our property-centric society. “These restrictive ads amply underline the extent to which power, like wealth, is concentrated in the hands of landlords,” says Portia Msimang of the pressure group Renters Rights London. “Some people get overexcited by that power.” Some of these restrictions may even be illegal, she points out. “The renter would have a very strong defence against any attempt at eviction on the basis of breach of unfair terms.” But without root-and-branch reform of the UK’s housing provision, such behaviour seems likely to continue. And it’s not just landlords who have the power. Existing tenants of desirable houseshares can afford to be choosy about who they live with, screening candidates on everything from their dietary preferences to their political beliefs or their star signs. (Unlike gender or sexual orientation, these are not protected characteristics under the law, and so these stipulations aren’t illegal.)Which is bad news for Capricorns. In April, a New York City housing advert went viral after a prospective applicant was rejected for belonging to that star sign. Megan, a 24-year-old from Brighton, thinks that the no-Capricorn advert is ridiculous because, in her experience, Capricorns make perfectly good housemates. It’s Cancers you need to watch out for. “I had a housemate who was a Cancer, and it wasn’t good for either of us.” A Gemini, Megan’s preference would be to live with Leos, Taureans or Capricorns. She would ban Cancers from moving into her house should a room become available – and probably also Scorpios, if she’s being honest. “It’s like, how many more emotional Cancers or Scorpios will I live with, before I acknowledge it’s not meant to be?”There can be darker factors at work: a 2018  investigation found that people from ethnic minorities face discrimination when looking for houseshares. For every 10 positive replies to an inquiry about a room for rent sent by a prospective renter called “David”, inquiries from a “Muhammad” received only eight. Sometimes, racism is coded more overtly: the writer and director Yero Timi-Biu recently made headlines after she posted a text exchange with a landlord asking where her parents were from and it went viral. “Where demand for accommodation outstrips supply, landlords, agents and other renters can pick and choose,” says Msimang. “If they’re bigoted people, they pick and choose in line with their bigotry.”But houseshare ads can exclude certain groups of people for more understandable reasons. Clare is 33 and advertising a spare bedroom in her house in east London. Prospective housemates must not eat meat in the house, as Clare and her flatmates are vegetarians or vegans. “I find meat really unsettling,” she says. “Where people see food, I see something dead.” If someone moved in and then started eating meat, she’d probably ask them to leave, she says.LGBT-only houseshare adverts are also common. For many queer people, they are necessary to create a home in which they feel safe. Jender Anomie, a 27-year-old artist from Bexhill in East Sussex, would prefer to live with fellow queer people. “I’m sure this is the same of many marginalised groups,” Anomie says. “Living with heterosexual people can be really trying, and it seems unnecessary suffering if you have access to another, more welcoming type of living space.”At their heart, many housemate adverts are about looking for like-minded people. But you can overegg it. In 2014, Henry Blanchard, a young entrepreneur, posted an advert looking for flatmates to “come and join us in ‘Reinventing Living’”, and thereby inadvertently spoofed the toe-curling excesses of the Silicon Valley tech-bro culture. (“Do you believe in passion, integrity, positivity and working smarter, not harder? … Picture the scene – waking up at 6 every morning for a group run or yoga with the house.”)Looking back on the ad now, the 33-year-old cringes. “I was in this startup bubble … I think the house ad was a reflection of that. I wanted to bring my work into every part of my life.” Blanchard did manage to find “like-minded creators” willing to move into his #disruptive houseshare, but they never secured a suitable property. It’s probably for the best. “I had this idealised version of what I thought my life should look like.” What would he think if he saw that advert now? Blanchard laughs. “I would think: ‘I hope it works out for you.’”The best houseshare adverts use humour to make serious points. Travis Nemmer’s 2017 advert for a flatmate in Washington DC went viral after the 27-year-old attorney laid his political cards on the table. “I am a Republican, who will occasionally say nice things about our president. If that’s a dealbreaker, I assure you that you will have no trouble finding some kinda commune.” Nemmer says he didn’t want anyone to be “blindsided” by his political views, given that DC is a fiercely liberal city. The person who moved in was leftwing, so the advert worked. “I wouldn’t say people didn’t want to live with me because I’m a conservative. I don’t have any problems getting along with people regardless of politics. They probably don’t want to live with me because I’m messy.”Williams is, perhaps, also a victim of the housing crisis. He is disabled and struggles to find accessible rental properties – which meant that when he found the property, he agreed to be the lead tenant, responsible for its entire monthly rent. Luckily, he found someone to take the room “She got the humour,” he says. But he probably wouldn’t go down the same route again. “This one didn’t quite hit the nail on the head.”At the housing crisis continues to escalate, more of us will be forced to live with strangers well into adulthood. “I’m too old to be flatsharing,” says the PR worker. “I shouldn’t have to do it. I’m tired of doing it.” These adverts tell stories of exploitation and abuse: greedy landlords infringing their tenant’s fundamental rights in ways that are possibly illegal.But it’s not always bad. The authors are often just searching for common ground with the people who will share their homes – whether it’s with a fellow astrology-lover, a vegan or someone who also gets what it’s like to be marginalised. For Anomie, living in queer spaces gives her access to “unconditional love and understanding”. These adverts are about more than whether you are a Capricorn or vegan, a conservative or a growth hacker. They’re about people, just trying to get along."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7cffed6506b66baf16d7742acb2c8c863b2e767e/0_0_4500_2885/master/4500.jpg?width=1010\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=b4f90b79d0a39bf0630f61ee6b818f98 2020w","title":"welcome to glastonbury 2019 in pictures","story":"Wednesday saw the early arrivals, a dazzling fireworks display – and the first night of after-dark debauchery "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac0b7cd86e3e7bda5ed22c75821e7ef99c498270/0_207_5895_3537/master/5895.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a14cd8904226a1e646f99813b958d695","title":"ebola is back can it be contained podcast","story":"The current outbreak of the deadly virus in the DRC has been called the most complex public health emergency in history.

It is the first time such a massive bird has been found in the northern hemisphere.Analysis of the 40cm-long bone and others found with it date the remains to between 1.5m and 1.8m years old, suggesting the birds may have been part of the local wildlife when Homo erectus, an ancient ancestor of modern humans, reached Europe 1.2m years ago.The enormous birds may well have been a valuable source of meat, bones, feathers and eggshells for the early human settlers, the scientists say.Nikita Zelenkov, a palaeontologist at the Russian Academy of Sciences, said that when he first received the thigh bone for study he thought it must be from a long-extinct elephant bird from Madagascar. “No birds of this size have ever been reported from Europe,” he said.But close inspection revealed that the bird probably belonged to an ancient species called Pachystruthio dmanisensis, a stocky, flightless creature that stood about 3.5 metres tall. Based on measurements of the thigh bone, the scientists calculate the bird weighed about 450kg, which is twice the weight of the largest extinct moas from New Zealand, three times heavier than the largest living bird, the common ostrich, and nearly as heavy as an adult polar bear. The fossils are described in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology.“We don’t know when it became extinct exactly, but most likely it did not survive later than 1.2m years ago,” Zelenkov said. “They would have been seen by various Homo erectus people.”Despite the bird’s bulk, the long, slim thigh bone shows it was fast on its feet. Other remains recovered from the cave offer some explanation as to why that may have helped: the giant bird lived alongside some of the most formidable predators of the Ice Age, from sabre-toothed cats to other over-sized carnivores, including giant cheetahs and giant hyenas. All could take on prey as large as mammoths.Evolution has decorated the tree of life with a bizarre collection of bulky birds. The apparently herbivorous Gastornithidae, a family of prehistoric flightless birds with powerful legs and enormous beaks, stalked Europe, Asia and North America, from 66m to 35m years ago. When fully grown, some species reached three metres tall.A similar-sized feathery beast brought terror to the rainforests of Australia’s Northern Territory 15m years ago. Technically known as Bullockornis planei but named the “demon duck of doom” by a researcher with an eye for publicity, the bird sported a scythe-like beak on a head the size of a horse’s. Also known as thunderbirds, the beasts are thought to have survived until at least 50,000 years ago.Scientists have argued over the identity of the world’s largest bird for decades, but last year researchers at the Zoological Society of London attempted to settle the matter. They set out with a tape measure and a pair of callipers to measure hundreds of bird bones in museums around the world and came across one creature from Madagascar that stood three metres tall and weighed up to 800kg. Its name, Vorombe titan, means “big bird” in a mixture of Malagasy and Greek.The Taurida cave where the latest bones were found was discovered only last year during the construction of a motorway that will link Simferopol, a city in the heart of the Crimean peninsula, to the city of Kerch in the east. How common the big birds were across Europe is unknown and a question that future expeditions will now seek to answer. “Although there is no evidence yet, this bird might have been spread across more western territories,” Zelenkov said.Excavations at the site have also uncovered the remains of a bison and a mammoth, and field studies at the site are expected to continue for some time yet. “There may be much more that the site will teach us about Europe’s distant past,” Zelenkov said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d92a73be140f99ba20a89c1124721957443ad46/0_0_5585_3351/master/5585.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=29cea8e7e80c90fac7ef512c522167b2","title":"can my choices really make a difference to the environment","story":"Do our actions have a real impact on the future of the planet, or are our environmental efforts just a drop in the ocean?  Anna Turns considers how our lifestyle choices contribute to the bigger picture This summer, my family and I will take the ferry to France instead of flying off to warmer climes. We eat much less meat nowadays and we’re saving to buy an electric car. But in the midst of a worldwide climate crisis, can my choices really make a difference?The short answer is: of course. The view that the choices we make as consumers don’t affect our planet’s health is increasingly considered both untrue and irresponsible take the plastic bag charge or the rollout of smart meters, for example. Both rely on seemingly small adjustments to everyday life that, when enacted en masse, lead to something greater: the plastic bag charge has greatly reduced plastic waste, whereas smart meters help to make the energy grid more responsive. Both signal a seachange in how we’re engaging with the climate crisis.This is crucial, says Armistead, because “our actions make the most impact when recognised by those in power as a demand for further action – when our small actions help open up the political space for greater action.”Alice Bell, co-director of charity 10:10 Climate Action, agrees that we have to act socially to cut carbon emissions. “We all have a part to play in changing our culture,” she says. Take cutting down flying: we can amplify our efforts by talking about our decision, sharing images on social media of the train journey we have taken instead doing what we can to create a cultural shift. Consider Greta Thunberg. Last August, the Swedish schoolgirl began a school strike to demand action on climate change – in March this year, 1.6 million young people around the globe followed suit. “It was a social act,” says Bell. “She sat in a public place, she wrote a sign so people would engage and she spoke about what she was doing.”So while we can all be catalysts for change, we don’t exist in a vacuum we are part of a complex ecosystem – and so advocacy is key. “If we want to make the changes we need, at the speed we need to do it,” says Bell, “we have to be clever about how change happens.” For Bell, that means a simultaneous bottom-up, top-down approach: making inidual efforts while pressuring governments to make large-scale legislative change.Cardiff University’s Prof Lorraine Whitmarsh, who has spent the past five years working on the Low Carbon Lifestyles and Behavioural Spillover programme, agrees: “Policymakers don’t feel they have the mandate to take ambitious action unless there’s grassroots demand for it. Equally, a top-down approach makes it easier for everybody to do things substantially differently.”Studying 7,000 people across seven countries, Whitmarsh explored the idea that taking up one eco-behaviour, such as recycling, may lead to another, such as eating less meat. The report concluded that any spillover depends on motivation: if a person wants to make that first shift, they’re more likely to make further positive changes than if told to do so. Crucially, spillover only occurs when the similarities between behaviours are recognised as all contributing to a low-carbon lifestyle. Hence the importance of both advocacy and reinforcing positive social norms.While the report acknowledges that no lifestyle is identical, and not all changes are possible, it highlights five key “behaviours” that can be adopted when working towards a low-carbon lifestyle. Civic action and political engagement is key, but four other everyday areas are also emphasised: transport, at best living car-free and avoiding air travel diet, cutting down meat and dairy “investment decisions”, such as opting for energy-efficient appliances and household energy choices, including installing intelligent thermostats and smart meters.It takes, therefore, a myriad approach for change to reach a tipping point. Just as attitudes towards smoking changed, there’s been a shift in opinion towards electric vehicles (EVs). In the Norwegian capital, Oslo, a combination of government policy – from VAT exemption to fast-charging stations – and municipal initiatives such as free parking and access to bus lanes – means that every third new car sold is battery powered.We all want to make big changes to help our planet, but sometimes to make big changes, we have to start small.

Can the UK’s energy system be decarbonised by 2050? Here’s what we knowThis June, the UK government committed to reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2050 – making it the first major economy and G7 member to do so. But what does that mean? And how are they planning on getting there? The integration of renewable energy sources is key, for starters, and a lot needs to happen to the way we produce, supply and store energy. From the stats on our increasing reliance on the “right” energy sources, and a look at how we’re changing our lifestyles for the better, to what might stand in our way, these are our energy facts and figures as they stand.Electricity Transmission owns and runs the network of cables and transformers within the National Grid. It transmits electricity from power stations to homes, schools, hospitals, factories and other places. The network consists of 4,474 miles of overhead line, 969 miles of underground cable and 346 substations.Eleven further connections linking the UK to other European countries are also planned or under construction (including the 450-mile long North Sea Link to tap into Norway’s hydropower, and the 470-mile long Viking Link to harness energy from Denmark’s wind farms), which could meet a fifth of the UK’s electricity needs by 2025.Source: Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS)Coal consumption has fallen from 157m tonnes in 1970 to 11.8m tonnes in 2018, and the UK’s seven remaining coal power stations are set to close by 2025. In May this year the UK also went 18 days without burning coal to generate energy – the longest streak the country has managed since 1882.A third of the UK’s electricity generation came from renewables in the third quarter of 2018 – a new record. That percentage is likely to go even higher: the government hopes that offshore windfarms alone will provide a third of our electricity by 2030 – with the number of jobs in offshore wind potentially tripling to 27,000 in that period.What will be the world’s biggest offshore wind farm, Hornsea One – 75 miles off the Yorkshire coast – is also due to be completed in 2020. It will cover an area five times the size of the nearby city of Hull, and the 174 turbines – each taller than London’s Gherkin building – will be capable of powering 1m homes. In times of peak demand, the smarter energy network will also help to better integrate energy from offshore wind.Source: Committee on Climate Change  Energy Saving TrustAccording to independent government advisory body the Committee on Climate Change, which campaigned for the government’s net-zero commitment, the foundations are already in place to achieve that goal, including initiatives such as increased tree planting and reducing emissions on farms.Source: Committee on Climate ChangePart of Britain’s commitment to creating a more sustainable, low-carbon future includes making our energy network “smarter” – implementing digital tech to make our energy grid more responsive to increased demand and variable wind speed. By collecting data on our energy use through smart meters, our network can better understand, plan for and balance out peaks and troughs in demand, making it easier to integrate renewable energy sources. Of course, smart meters can’t help Britain meet its carbon emissions targets on their own but, with the smarter, more energy efficient grid they help to create, they are a start.

They cannot afford many more mishaps. In fact they may not have room for any if they are to ensure that the goal of World Cup glory on home soil, which has been targeted for so long, does not become another pipe dream.Here comes the ultimate test of Eoin Morgan and there is every reason for him to be disgruntled just at the moment. In the wake of two defeats in the past week, the first of which against Sri Lanka being the most exasperating and unexpected, there is now the piercing observations of former colleagues. Kevin Pietersen, an old supporter of England’s one-day international captain, tweeted: “Eoin Morgan looked scared. That is a horror sign,” after watching him bat against Mitchell Starc. To note that a batsman is “out of form” or “technically deficient” is fine but to suggest that he is “scared” truly stings. Morgan had to be at his iciest to shrug that off after the game at Lord’s.Of greater concern for Morgan is the urgency for his side to win both their remaining games, against India on Sunday at Edgbaston and New Zealand the following Wednesday in Chester-le-Street. They may as well acknowledge that the situation is tricky. Self-denial does not work but nor does self-flagellation. So far his players have reacted badly in tight situations yet they still have the capacity to win even against the best sides.Morgan has begun that process by referring to a loss of confidence in the camp. The protestations that these matches are no different to ordinary ODIs are disappearing so too are the assertions of how much they love to chase – it certainly seems that they do not relish chasing targets of less than 300. World Cup matches are different and over the past four years it has been tough to replicate the extra tension as England zipped up the rankings.There has been some sloppy thinking out on the field in this World Cup. The pursuit of 233 runs to beat Sri Lanka was slapdash and ill-constructed at Headingley at Lord’s they seemed surprised by the introduction of Jason Behrendorff in what proved an inspired move by Australia. When Morgan says: “We have struggled with the basics of what we call our batting mantra,” he is starting to sound like Miranda’s mum. Yes, England must bat “in partnerships” but that is as obvious as craving an end to world poverty climate changeThe Hundred.They would never cite this as an excuse, which is the wise course, but some of the surfaces have not helped England greatly. Half a dozen years ago in the bad old days England’s ODI team were still quite serviceable when playing at home on bowler-friendly pitches. They had craggy batsmen and wily bowlers which meant that 260 could often be a satisfactory total.The current side has proved to be dominant on very flat batting pitches.England have batsmen who can scorch the turf with their drives or pepper the spectators in the stands and a batch of resilient bowlers when the conditions deter the ball from moving. As a consequence they have prospered in high-scoring matches. But when there is some spice in the pitch and batting becomes a more technical, cerebral exercise there are disturbing signs of vulnerability. There was some assistance for the bowlers at Headingley and Lord’s and on both occasions England’s top-order faltered.Consequently Jason Roy has suddenly become a totemic figure. Life was so much simpler when he was in the team. England were thrashing Bangladesh, thanks to his majestic 153, and West Indies in the match that he picked up his hamstring injury. Since then they have defeated only Afghanistan and Roy’s replacement, James Vince, has scored 40 runs in three innings.The hierarchy has been adamant that they will not bring Roy back until he’s properly fit, which is the correct stance to take. But they are now aching for his return. As a batsman he is not necessarily a reassuring figure given his aggressive approach he can easily fail, but they all know now that when he comes off he can change the course of the game. No such confidence emanates from the presence of Vince at the top of the order even if he always times the ball so sweetly prior to departure. Hence they may be tempted to turn a blind eye to Roy’s restricted movement in the field come Sunday.If Roy is unfit for the match against India there may still be an inclination to drop Vince. But there is a snag here. There are no other specialist batsmen in the squad. So unless Joe Root opens the batting and everyone moves up a notch Vince will surely retain his place in the absence of Roy.By this stage of the tournament England were hoping to have the freedom to juggle their pace attack but given their predicament they were not inclined to do so against Australia. So Jofra Archer played at Lord’s despite experiencing some stiffness in his left side before the game and he was not quite at his best. He is due a rest but is now deemed such an integral part of the attack that they may not dare to leave him out. That was not part of the plan four weeks ago.So Morgan faces tough opponents and tough choices throughout a momentous week, which will decide whether his side reaches the semi-finals and may well dictate his reputation as an England captain. We remember World Cup winners rather than being No 1 in the rankings."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b665acb3266c7af1b2137de377b8d3686fed326/0_245_3796_2278/master/3796.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8b5b0c6a6c80dbd588eb85075c58f3dc","title":"new zealand pakistan cricket world cup match report","story":"Pakistan are making a late surge in the direction of the World Cup’s semi‑final spots, with the winds of their victorious 1992 campaign possibly behind them once more if the form book is anything to go by.In defeating New Zealand by six wickets at Edgbaston – where the atmosphere evoked a match in Lahore or Karachi – they have continued a run of results that has so far matched Imran Khan’s Cornered Tigers game for game (including a washout).Now with seven points in the bag, and games against Afghanistan and Bangladesh to come, Sarfaraz Ahmed’s current generation look as poised as any to pounce should fourth-placed England, sitting on eight, fail to chalk up wins from their remaining two games.Here, as a sea of green supporters roared them on and local seismologists probably stared quizzically at their instruments, it came down to a masterful unbeaten 101 from Babar Azam who, along with a 76-ball 68 from Haris Sohail, chased down the target of 238 with five balls to spare.Jimmy Neesham’s unbeaten 97 had earlier helped New Zealand to post 237 for six – a total that was not undefendable given a slow, capricious surface that had resulted from Birmingham’s recent spell of wet weather.But Babar transcended these conditions, overcoming the pace of Lockie Ferguson, the swing of Trent Boult and some considerable turn for Mitchell Santner’s left-armers with a frictionless innings of 127 balls and 11 fours via some delightful cover drives.With Haris, who took the aerial route a couple of times before being run out in the final throes, a stand of 126 was compiled that ultimately broke the back of the chase before Sarfaraz crashed the winning runs through point.“I think this is my best innings because it was a must-win game,” said Babar, who brought up his 10th ODI century and passed 3,000 runs en route – the second fastest batsmen there, in 68 innings, after Hashim Amla (57).When Neesham pulled the final ball of the first innings into the Hollies Stand for six, it had actually capped a decent fightback from New Zealand, who were 83 for five in the 27th over after winning the toss. Neesham’s highest ODI score, allied with a 71-ball 64 from Colin de Grandhomme in stand of 132, also overcame a huge numerical disadvantage by way of support Edgbaston had been rocking from the moment Mohammad Amir’s first ball cannoned into Martin Guptill’s stumps.Another left-armer produced the standout spell, though, as Shaheen Shah Afridi tore through the New Zealand top order. From his 6ft 6in frame, this slick 19-year-old located the ideal length to tease nicks behind from Colin Munro (12), Ross Taylor (3) and Tom Latham (1) in a seven-over burst that cost a mere 11 runs.Among these strikes came an athletic one‑handed catch from Sarfaraz behind the stumps to remove Taylor. While one in the eye for the ‘supporter’ who was filmed calling Sarfaraz a ‘fat pig’ during a recent shopping trip with his family, the captain’s most significant pouch came mid-innings when Kane Williamson edged a flighted leg-break from Shadab Khan behind on 41.Boult struck early in the chase – Fakhar Zaman caught attempting a typically ambitious swipe – before Ferguson, the rubbery right-armer who has a claim to being the World Cup’s fastest bowler, bounced out Imam-ul-Haq thanks to a superb ing catch by Guptill at point.But while Ferguson repeatedly beat the outside edge in his initial spell, in Babar Pakistan had a batsman up to the task. A stand of 66 with Mohammad Hafeez was ended when the man they call The Professor holed out to Williamson’s part-time offies. But, if anything, this breakthrough –Santner getting the ball to rag at the other end – underlined New Zealand’s error in not selecting a second spinner.Their captain, Williamson, said: “We were outplayed on a tough surface by a great Pakistan side. We were right in it after taking early wickets but the partnership between Babar and Haris was fantastic.”With 11 points to their name, Williamson’s men know a win or a washout against either Australia or England will be enough to make the final four. And Pakistan? When they are in this mood, you wouldn’t bet against them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a5efc8557ee4dc3bdea20de9dd833060d93c16e7/545_1728_2898_1739/master/2898.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c3274e09c214f81ff03ba903dab8cc7e","title":"whats the best cheap tablet or e reader for pdf files","story":"Thomas needs a device to read A4 PDFs of technical papers that is cheaper than a good laptopI am looking for an e-reader for technical papers.

As a result, they will be relatively expensive.If you are buying something for business purposes, reconsider your approach to pricing. I calculate the number of hours of use per week, and the number of years of use, to get a cost-per-hour. I compare this against the cost of labour (salary plus overheads), and calculate benefits such as time savings and the ability to work when it would otherwise be impossible.When people are earning £25,000 to £250,000 a year, it’s generally easy to demonstrate the economic value of expensive devices. Even if you’re a student and not earning anything, you can still value your time.Mass market e-readers such as Amazon Kindles are designed to replace printed books, so they tend to be around the size of a novel, only thinner. They have E-Ink screens that – unlike laptop screens – are readable outside. They don’t require much battery power, so they can run for many hours between charges. They are exactly what you want, except for their screen sizes.For your purposes, the best screen size would be 210 x 297mm, which is the same as A4 paper. This has a diagonal of 14.3in, so a 14in screen would be closest to life size. However, a 12.3in to 13.3in screen should be perfectly acceptable.The other key point is the aspect ratio of 1:1.414. Since you can’t get A4, the best match would be a device with a 3:2 screen, such as a Microsoft Surface Book or a Google Pixelbook. These screens have an aspect ratio of 1:1.5.The next best would be either 4:3 (1:1.333), which was used by traditional TV sets, or 16:10 (1:1.6), as used by, for example, Apple’s MacBook Pro. The 4:3 format lives on in screen resolutions from 640 x 480 (VGA) to 1440 x 1080 and 1920 x 1440, while 16:10 resolutions include 1440 x 900, 1920 x 1200 and 2560 x 1600.However, E-Ink screens are much easier on the eyes.The reMarkable PDF reader is really targeted at the digital writing market, rather than the digital reading market, though most serious e-readers support pens for annotations and signatures. Instead, consider the Onyx Boox range, which includes seven e-readers with larger screens. The top models – the Max 2 ($749) and Max 2 Pro ($849) – would be best for your purposes, because they have 13.3in screens. The 10.3in Note Pro ($599), Gulliver Note ($449) and 9.7in Euclid ($319) are cheaper but smaller options. As you know, reducing the size of PDF images makes them harder to read.According to the the-ebook-reader website, Boyue is about to launch a Likebook Alita which “looks strikingly similar to the Onyx Boox Note Pro. Their shameless copying of Onyx is starting to get kind of creepy. Half their software features were taken from Onyx’s software and now their hardware is a near replica too.” Judging by comments, Boyue has some software problems, too…The Onyx Boox and Likebook ranges are based on Android 6.0.1, and therefore might be able to run alternative PDF readers from the Google Play store. Check first if you intend to try this. However, most Android apps are not designed to run on high-resolution e-ink screens.As mentioned, you could buy a more versatile device such as an Apple, Android or Windows tablet. These have more features than e-readers, but they don’t havee-ink screens or such good battery life. Worse, if you buy one with decent screen resolution, you may not save any money over an e-reader.Android tablets are cheaper, and worse, but you could buy a 10.6in Huawei MediaPad M5 for £299. Its 2560 x 1600-pixel Quad HD screen – which has a 16:10 aspect ratio – might make this the best, cheap PDF reader without an e-ink screen.Obviously there are much cheaper Android tablets with 10.1in screens, such as the Lenovo Smart Tab P10 (£199) and the Acer Iconia One (£129). However, you pay the price in terms of lower screen resolution. Lenovo’s P10 has a 1920 x 1200 screen, while Acer’s Iconia is down to 1280 x 800 pixels. Both of these are 16:10 ratio screens.Google’s 12.3in Pixel Slate offers 3000 x 2000 pixels, which is nice, for £749, which is not. No wonder Google is getting out of the tablet business.Have you got a question?

Last year, she narrowly missed out on winning I’m a Celebrity … in which the Inbetweeners actor “found some new love and respect for myself”, presumably not while Holly Willoughby was panic-flicking giant cockroaches off her body with a cue card. Since then, her Instagram followers have grown in number from 70,000 to 1.4 million, she has done standup about her roaring 20s, has released a clothing range and is writing a book, which I can only assume is about how Atack found new love and respect for herself in the jungle, the standup tour, the clothing range and the book. You might ask what is left. A preposterously overpaid column in a rightwing newspaper? Leader of the country?No, the inevitable consequence of all this is Emily Atack: Adulting (W), a reality TV series in which Atack, with the help of family, friends, and that most trusty of agony aunts, social media, sets herself a bunch of “adulting challenges”. These are less about putting on the Fill Your Face helmet in the Bushtucker trials and more like taking her cousin’s stepdaughter to soft play – which many find more terrifying than a kilogram of mealworms heading up their nose holes.At this point, it is worth issuing a warning that, if you find the concept of “adulting” – which essentially means the completion of such quotidian tasks as working, laundry and taking care of oneself what the rest of us call living – as infantilising and sexist as I do, you might want to bugger off and do some quiet, unscripted adulting of your own right now.If, on the other hand, you embrace the toddlerisation of everything from politics to smoothies, this is all “very relatable”, to use the appropriate reality-TV terminology. Off Atack bounces to show us the house that she has somehow managed to find since leaving the jungle, which most adulting adults will never be able to afford. Here is the bed that she chose on account of it having a massive television hidden in the frame, which sounds both cosy and like a Trumpian nightmare. The problem is that it is way too big for the space and didn’t actually come with a telly.“It’s a disaster!” Atack wails. At which point, I started fantasising about the mirror image of this series, in which a naughty woman over the age of 60, such as Miriam Margolyes, gads about kidulting: playing Twister and throwing enormous tantrums about putting on her shoes. I know, it is never going to happen. But we said that about so many things.Mostly, instead of considering the issues millennials face – being unable to afford further education, or fending off constant carping about being snowflakes – Atack ponders how she would look with a baby bump and makes a feeble gag about her “hungoveries”. She asks Instagram – that well known moral influence on young women – whether she is ready. (The answer is … cruel.) She goes to visit her mother, the actor Kate Robbins, most famous for doing the female voices on Spitting Image, who recalls Atack’s brother being more than 10lb when he was born. “Was that uncomfortable?” Atack wonders. “Why do you think I haven’t got any boyfriends,” her mother bats back. And they laugh.Finally, because it is not truly revealing unless you invite the camera behind the curtain to film a scan of your uterus, Atack goes to see a fertility doctor. The good news is that she has average fertility for a 29-year-old, can have children and isn’t going to worry about it any more. The bad news? Adulting proves that, along with the Spice Girls, Tony Blair and a whole host of other pretend-good 90s ephemera, the ladette is back."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ab30db838882ead1f4706f9296331efa194d25a/241_3_1496_897/master/1496.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e3e011fa0533605c3d8ee75ba0d6b82b","title":"whats with all the sooky disappointing men on tv right now","story":"From Fleabag to Always Be My Maybe, the new wave of great female characters are getting such terrible love interests. Why?There’s a scene in the Netflix romcom Always Be My Maybe in which Sasha, Ali Wong’s straight-talking, successful celebrity chef, watches her high school crush Marcus (Randall Park), a dope-smoking slacker who still lives with his dad in his mid-30s and plays in the same band he always did, bang out a song about tennis balls. She’s cheering wildly.A decade ago, this type of romantic setup would have contained all the chemistry of a bloated ShamWow. But this is 2019, and here the disappointing, underachieving male is not simply in a supporting role on TV, he’s a proper romantic lead. Sure, Marcus reminds Sasha of home and the things she left behind, but it’s hard not to watch the film and think – really? The high-achieving go-getter prefers this guy to Keanu Reeves?It’s no secret that male characters have been going through something of a shift recently. We’ve already witnessed the Hot But Horrible trend come back into force via the priest in Fleabag, a show utterly bereft of decent male characters. Earlier this year Vulture examined what it called the “soft boys of Netflix”, while The Hollywood Reporter ran a story last March on “The Triumph of the Beta Male”, featuring the openly nerdy stars of TV’s Silicon Valley on the magazine’s widely panned cover.Without bemoaning the disintegration of a terribly two-dimensional idea of strong masculinity, the new wave of tough, independent female characters does seem to be increasingly paired off with love interests who simply don’t measure up.Consider Sandra Oh’s moustachioed husband in Killing Eve, who dresses almost exclusively in lounge wear and has passive-aggressive tantrums about his wife leaving home to hunt assassins.Or Jeremy, Audrey’s husband in The Letdown, who, when he saw his own baby crying, had the temerity to ask, “Do I pick her up?”Then there’s Aidy Bryant’s love interest in Shrill, Ryan, who asks her to please exit from the back of the house so his friends don’t see who he just slept with. The gesture is more likely to save her reputation than his, considering he’s basically a bed-dwelling Hobbit with the refined charm of a leaf blower.The disappointing male partner is also in full bloom on Netflix. In Dead To Me, Judy’s husband, Steve (James Marsden), is so used to gliding through life using only the power of his cheekbones, he seems blind to the needs of everyone around him. And then there’s Dean (Matthew Lillard), Christina Hendricks’ husband in Good Girls, whose greatest betrayal is not his adultery (though that’s also obviously not great) but his incompetence: as a businessman, an investor and, most crushing of all, as a dad.Perhaps the trend is in part a backlash to the dark and brooding antihero who dominated our TV screens in the early 2000s – Tony Soprano, Don Draper, Walter White, Omar Little. Flawed men who emoted dangerous, sometimes sexualised power with a squint, and a flare of the nostrils. If they sneezed, their female counterparts caught pneumonia.But somewhere along the line, perhaps as more women took up space in writer’s rooms, the alpha male lead began to fade from view. As a consequence, it’s becoming clear just how dissatisfying the unbalanced power dynamic actually is.Part of it is a function of the writing – drama comes from conflict, and a story about a woman wielding power doesn’t work as well with a supportive husband where’s the conflict then?Still. Why can’t we have stories in which two equals battle it out and find meaningful compromise? What about a world in which neither partner has to sacrifice themselves or the things that are important to them? Especially when we’re talking about romcoms, which are essentially wish-fulfilment fantasies – wouldn’t that be a more progressive kind of wish-fulfilment than settling for the lazy and uninspiring?But perhaps in 2019, women’s wish-fulfilment is only partly focused on romance. The romcom has, for a while now, been as much about the ideal job, outfit and home as it is the ideal partner. Sex and the City, The Devil Wears Prada and Something’s Gotta Give are about aspirational lifestyles. Perhaps it is that right now, a woman’s greatest wish is her own success, and the man figures less in that equation, because he’s no longer seen as the central measure of it.Or perhaps, just for this moment, female wish-fulfilment is centred on dominance. It’s not progressive, it’s not ideal, but as women get in touch with their general disappointment over men, perhaps it is – for this short time in history – an accurate reflection of what women want."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2ab32d3c5260e7e1c471764420e294c543511cf/0_203_3072_1844/master/3072.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=333e4c101af03118fb73977c951d818c","title":"europe heatwave cities prepare to limit effects of record temperatures","story":"Germany imposes speed limits on highways while schools in France remain closedEuropean cities are taking exceptional steps to limit the impact of a historic early summer heatwave as temperatures across the continent approached monthly and, in some places, all-time records.Authorities have warned that temperatures could pass 40C and reach 45C in parts of the continent by Saturday as a plume of hot air moves north from the Sahara, sucked northwards by a stalled storm over the Atlantic and high pressure in central Europe.In Germany, where the 38.6C recorded on Wednesday in Coschen, near the Polish border, exceeded the country’s previous June high, officials imposed a 120kmh speed limit on stretches of the Saxony-Anhalt autobahn as the road surface began to deteriorate, while rail tracks buckled near Rostock on the Baltic Sea.In Brandenburg, police said they were “speechless” as a man was stopped riding his moped naked, and after guards caused uproar in Munich by ordering a group of women to put their bikini tops back on, the city council was set to debate a by-law change to allow topless bathing.Schools in parts of France, meanwhile – where an all-time heat record of 44.1C could be beaten on Friday – were expected to remain closed until the end of the week, while authorities in Paris, Lyon, Strasbourg and Marseille banned older cars from entering their city centres to combat pollution.With temperatures in Milan forecast to hit 40C, charities were preparing to distribute 10,000 bottles of free water to the homeless and other people in need, while 33 of Spain’s 50 provinces will be facing record-breaking temperatures, which could reach 44C.Innsbruck’s famous “fiaker” carriage horses were taken off the streets as the city recorded 36.7C, breaking the 2012 record for Tyrol state of 36.6C.Three people, including two in their 70s, died in southern France after suffering heart attacks and other problems while swimming. French authorities have warned of the dangers of ing into cold water in very hot conditions, but there was no immediate confirmation the deaths were related to the heatwave.In Poland, the interior ministry said 90 people have drowned so far this month trying to cool off in lakes or rivers, and in Lithuania 27 people were reported to have died in similar circumstances as temperatures in the Baltic state soared above 35C.Strong winds and high temperatures helped fan a forest fire in Catalonia, in Spain, which destroyed some 2,500 hectares of land. Hundreds of firefighters and 14 water-dropping aircraft were battling the blaze on Wednesday night.Scientists have said Europe’s 2019 heatwave, like last year’s, was closely linked to the climate emergency and that such extreme weather events will be many times more likely over the coming decades."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b5bd2c7b703ceba0a990888b731b3763435e19b9/0_49_1076_646/master/1076.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=499f078fe75f70518237f5c3f40c171e","title":"credit line to be announced to ease eu and iran trading","story":"Europe aims to boost trade in effort to persuade Tehran not to escalate Gulf crisisEuropean states will announce a multimillion-euro credit line to ease trade between the EU and Iran in a last-minute and probably doomed effort to persuade Tehran not to take the first step to quit the 2015 nuclear deal.Iran’s withdrawal is almost certain to deepen the Gulf crisis, and prompt US demands for Europe states – primarily Britain, France and Germany – to quit the deal and join Washington in imposing sanctions on Tehran.The relatively modest credit line will be announced in Vienna at a meeting of the joint commission for the Iran deal – the grouping of all the remaining parties to the deal including Europe, Iran, Russia and China.In July 2015, Iran and a six-nation negotiating group reached a landmark agreement known as the\u0026nbspJoint Comprehensive Plan of Action\u0026nbspthat\u0026nbspended a 12-year deadlock\u0026nbspover Tehran’s nuclear programme. The deal, struck in Vienna after nearly two years of intensive talks, limited the Iranian programme, to reassure the rest of the world that it cannot develop nuclear weapons, in return for sanctions relief.The six major powers involved in the nuclear talks with\u0026nbspIran\u0026nbspwere in a group known as the P5+1: the UN security council’s five permanent members – China, France, Russia, the UK and the US – and Germany. The nuclear deal is also enshrined in a UN security council resolution that incorporated it into international law. The 15 members of the council at the time unanimously endorsed the agreement.On 8 May 2018, US president Donald Trump pulled his country out of the deal. Iran announced its partial withdrawal from the nuclear deal a year later.The US pulled out of the deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), a year ago. It imposed harsh economic sanctions on Iran that have plunged the country’s currency into a nosee and created mass unemployment.The credit line is expected to be announced as early as Thursday – the same day Iran will break part of the nuclear deal by surpassing the 300kg limit on its low-enriched uranium stockpile. Iran will argue that its long-signalled moves to breach the limit do not breach the JCPOA, claiming it is entitled to take reversible steps to suspend parts of the deal if another signatory to the deal has failed to keep a commitment, notably the undertaking to boost trade between the EU and Iran.The EU is likely to counter that Europe is using its best endeavours to boost trade, but has no obligation under the deal to take steps to compensate for the effect of threatened US sanctions on any firm that trades with Iran. The US sanctions regime – including the removal of all Iranian oil export waivers – has been much more draconian than Europe or Iran foresaw.The EU will argue that the credit line should be seen by Tehran as a signal of intent to launch a trading mechanism focused initially on humanitarian goods that will allow companies to trade with minimum access to the banking system.The EU is still not in a position to announce any specific transactions under the mechanism, but officials have repeatedly said that some deals will be announced in the next few days. The EU may not give specific transactions publicity for fear that it will alert the US Treasury to impose sanctions.Iran has said that announcement of a credit line – briefed to the Iranians in lengthy technical talks in Tehran last week – hardly represents the seriousness of intent it requires to stay inside the JCPOA.The idea of a trading mechanism was first announced in January, but it has proved a huge technical and legal task of international co-ordination for Europe to construct a scheme in which even mid-level European banks are willing to participate.European officials recognise that the crisis could spiral out of control in the coming weeks, with the International Atomic Energy Agency declaring Iran is in breach of the deal in a matter of days. At the same time France, Germany and Italy are raising concerns about Iran’s ballistic missile programme, saying it is designed to be capable of delivering a nuclear payload.European leaders will use the G20 summit of world leaders in Japan starting on Friday to press the US to de-escalate the crisis, and to clarify the precise demands it is making of Tehran. Russia and China are also likely to urge the US to back off. Japan as summit host has put itself forward as a mediator.But Hassan Rouhani, the Iranian president, says he is not willing to negotiate while his country is under sanctions."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7db23a836d47e48bbe130540be0321fed53d11ad/0_144_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=90094cebfcb19ec6ecc664014cd83a1c","title":"venezuela government says foiled plot to assassinate president maduro","story":"Venezuelan officials said that they have foiled a plot to overthrow the government that included assassinating President Nicolás Maduro and his closest political allies.Maduro spokesman Jorge Rodríguez said on state television that a network of mostly retired police officers and soldiers planned to bomb a key government building, seize a Caracas air base and loot Venezuela’s central bank.He also said the plotters wanted to edge opposition leader Juan Guaidó from Venezuela’s political landscape. Guaidó, leader of the opposition-dominated National Assembly, is seeking to oust Maduro from power with backing from more than 50 nations.The opposition leader Juan Guaidó was almost unknown both inside and outside\u0026nbspVenezuela\u0026nbspuntil the start of this year.Guaidó was made chairman of the national assembly in January because it was the turn of his party, Voluntad Popular (People’s Will). At 35, he was a junior member of his party but its leaders were either under house arrest, in hiding or in exile.He declared himself interim president that month, resting his claim on a clause in the constitution that allows the legislature to take power temporarily and call new elections if it deems the president to be failing to fulfil basic duties or to have vacated the post.\u0026nbspGuaidó\u0027s relative obscurity initially proved an advantage in a country where the opposition has\u0026nbspgenerally failed to distinguish itself,\u0026nbsplosing its nerve\u0026nbspat critical moments, succumbing to infighting, and getting involved in a failed coup against Hugo Chávez in 2002.He inspired a huge wave of protests inside Venezuela with a message of peaceful change, and won widespread international support.

His main international backer is Donald Trump.\u0026nbspRodríguez said the purported network wanted to steal a helicopter to liberate Raúl Baduel, a former defense minister now in jail and install him as president.The government has claimed various plots over the years, generally offering little or no evidence to back its charges. The opposition contends Maduro uses such claims to justify his crackdown on dissent.Guaidó dismissed the latest claim as yet another attempt by the government to distract from Venezuela’s real problems.Maduro came under attack last August by two drones loaded with explosives, which detonated near the president while he spoke at an outdoor military celebration. He was not harmed in the attack, which officials called an assassination attempt.Rodríguez charged that Colombian President Iván Duque and Chilean President Sebastián Piñera backed the purportedly thwarted coup plot, but he didn’t provide evidence.Rodríguez showed what he said were scenes from 56 hours of intercepted video conference calls with the alleged plotters hashing out strategy for the attack planned for June 23.The spokesman said first lady Cilia Flores and Diosdado Cabello, leader of Venezuela’s governing socialist party, were among those also targeted for assassination."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fda5bf4f330b5a6de414a84e4b838b70405a5db6/0_0_3069_1840/master/3069.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8e1510720f8fe8d51e8c1c74c5a6989","title":"angela merkel seen shaking second time just over week germany","story":"German chancellor will travel to G20 despite visibly shaking at public event in BerlinAngela Merkel will travel to the G20 summit in Japan despite experiencing a second bout of shaking in just over a week at a public event, her spokesperson has said.“Everything is going ahead as planned,” Steffen Seibert told German media. “The chancellor is doing fine.”The German chancellor was visibly shaking as she met the president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, at Bellevue Palace in Berlin on Thursday morning.

Photograph: iStock More than 200 jobs are to be lost with the closure of the An Post Mail Centre in Little Island, Co Cork. A decision was made last year to close one of the four mail sorting in Ireland with staff at the Cork centre on Wednesday night being told that centres in Athlone, Dublin and Portlaoise will remain open with their site being wound down. An Post says it is consolidating and reducing its letter processing capacity in line with global industry trends, and switching investment into its e-commerceparcels network in Cork city and county. The consolidation of letters operations will see the closure of the Cork Mails Centre (CMC) in Little Island with the loss of 240 jobs. Currently the Cork plant is operating at below 25 per cent capacity as mail volumes decline at about 7 per cent per annum due to customers moving from the letters to parcels and e-commerce. The closure will be phased between September of this year and March 2020 and staff will be offered exit packages of six weeks per year of service up to a maximum of two years’ pay, redeployment opportunities within An Post’s networks in the Cork area and further educationre-skilling grants of up to €3,000 per person.An Post stress that they are engaged with the Communications Workers’ Union (CWU) to ensure the best possible outcome for all CMC staff. The closure of a mail centre was considered by the Labour Court in its recommendation of September 2017. InformedCMC employees were informed of the news directly by An Post management late on Wednesday night, when the majority of staff were present in the building. At total of 240 people are employed at Cork Mails Centre, two thirds of whom are employed on a part-time basis (about 20 hours a week) covering 216 jobs. A number of these part-time workers have job-share arrangements or are employed to cover holiday or sick absence by full-time staff. Seventy-eight local delivery staff, whose depot is based within the Little Island building, will move to an alternative city location early next year. An Post say that the €11 million annual savings from the plant closure will enable them to invest more rapidly in its parcels infrastructure nationally, locally, and in the automation of parcel sorting. Parcel volumes have grown by 60 per cent since An Post actively re-entered the parcels market in 2017. An Post plans to invest over €15 million in parcels infrastructure across Cork city and the wider region over the next three years.“The closure is simply due to the global trend of mail volume decline which has led to significant over-capacity in the mails system. Our priority is to look after our employees who have given great service to An Post by providing alternative employment options, good redundancy terms, further education grants and active access to other employers ,” managing director of An Post mails and parcel Garrett Bridgeman said. An Post chief executive officer David McRedmond said the company’s task now is to develop long-term sustainability. “We’re talking about building a sustainable future for An Post, but we’re nothing if we don’t look after our staff. We are trying our best for a positive outcome,” he told RTE radio’s Morning Ireland. “This (closure) is on a phased basis. We are working for a better outcome for staff.” He said An Post is investing in its parcel service infrastructure as parcel figures are up while letters are down. As they develop the parcels service there will be more jobs. “We’ve got to look after the long term sustainability of An Post.” An Post has been in talks with the IDA and the Land Development Agency about the Little Island site and its future."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3939170.1561624371!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"temperature set to reach 28 degrees in the west of ireland","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                             Children play under water jets in a fountain as they cool off during a heatwave in Nice in the south of France.

File photograph: Eric LukeLunchtime on Wednesday in Leinster House.The corridors are quiet. Leo Varadkar is still in the chamber answering routine questions about his department. About half a dozen deputies listlessly listen.Suddenly, a strangulated wailing erupts from the vicinity of the Dáil bar. Like somebody has put Mattie McGrath’s dancing medals in a vice and is tightening the screw. It is followed by sounds of people roaring.The bar doors open to a wall of noise – singing, laughter, clinking glasses and the melodious sound of a traditional squeezebox.Midday is not long gone but the Jackie Healy-Rae retrospective is in full swing.Summoned by those opening blasts on the bagpipes, staff rush through the linking passage from the canteen area to witness the scenes.Danny Healy-Rae is playing the squeezebox with a jaunty precision to jubilant cries of “Up the Kingdom!” The place is packed.There is a hush. Among the settling pints, a man launches into a song. The crowd joins in the chorus, swaying.“She was hah-lov-val-ee and fair, hah-like the Roh-o-ose of the Summer.“Yet tah-was not her beauteee hah-lone that won me.“Ho no, tah-was the truuute in her eyes ever dawning“That ma-hade me love Maer-ree, dah Rose of Trah-leeeeee!”Amid more cheering, the music continues. Someone whips out a tin whistle. Others cut a few steps on the carpet near the private entrance to the Members’ Bar.High Summer and people are sweating. Over a hundred members of the Healy-Rae family and “organisation” have travelled from Kerry to Kildare Street to hear formal “expressions of sympathy” expressed in the Dáil on the passing of the Healy-Rae patriarch, Jackie, who died in 2014 at the age of 83.It’s a bit after-the-event, given that the original cap wearer and larger than life TD died nearly 5 years ago.His son Michael – one of two Healy-Rae brothers in the Dáil – explained to the House that they thought of the tributes back in 2015, but things like general elections and council elections came up and they never got around to it.But they realised if they didn’t do something soon, they mightn’t be around themselves. “Even this length of time afterwards, I think it is nicer. It is very special and something that we will remember forever” he told the Dáil, as his brother nodded beside him.The Distinguished Visitor’s Gallery was filled with family members – including Jackie’s three grandchildren who are now members of Kerry County Council. Upstairs, following negotiations over numbers with the ushers, members of the Healy-Rae “organisation”, the political support team in the Kingdom, watched from the visitors’ gallery.And because this was a Kerry event, TDs from all sides of the political ide were in the chamber to say their piece, while senators from the Kingdom sat along the rails at the top of the steps to make their presence known.There was a notable absence. Minister of State Brendan Griffin from Castlemaine (Fine Gael) was nowhere to be seen. As the tributes flowed to Jackie - they went on for nearly an hour, some on the Fine Gael benches looked around to see where their man was.Constituency colleague John Brassil from Fianna Fáil spoke, as did Sinn Féin’s Martin Ferris, who was almost misty-eyed as he recalled his days with Jackie. He talked of the time Jackie’s beloved pony Peg went missing. “It was international news, not national news.” He was broken hearted at the time, but she turned up in the end, safe and sound.He said Michael and Danny Healy-Rae are not only fellow TDs representing Kerry, but they are his friends.“The one thing they all have is the common touch. They represent the common ordinary people of the country. They are not in a bubble. Ireland is a lot more than what is inside the Red Cow roundabout. Jackie Healy-Rae was a testament to their politics, the politics of the common man and woman. They are fantastic people.”At one point, the Ceann Comhairle intervened between speeches to tell the House that Brendan Griffin had been in contact. He was detained on departmental business and wouldn’t make it back to the Dáil on time. Seán Ó Fearghaíl passed on his words in absence.There was a relieved round of applause from the Fine Gael benches.When the Ceann Comhairle called for expressions of sympathy, he noted the passage of time since the late TD’s death. “The reality of political life is that long after many of us will be forgotten, the legend that was Jackie Healy-Rae will be remembered with fondness and respect.” He remarked on the size of the crowd in the visitors’ gallery. “I can only assume that the population of the Kingdom is somewhat depleted today.”There was a brief smattering of applause and a buzz of excitement rose in the gallery followed by a booming roar. “G’wan Kilgarvan!”During the reminiscing, the Taoiseach reminded everyone of the time Jackie said he represented “the plain people of Ireland” and was asked to explain who they might be.“The people who eat their dinner in the middle of the day.”His sons are carrying on that policy. Loudly and staunchly representing the plain people of Ireland and still eating dinner in the middle of the day.The little commemorative booklet they had done up for the meal afterwards was headed “Lunch hosted by his sons Deputy Michael Healy-Rae and Deputy Danny Healy-Rae.”That was a mistake. Clearly typed up by someone from that place known as “Above in Dublin”.It was, of course, dinner.The menu: Cream of Vegetable Soup. Turkey and Ham with pototoes and vegetables. White chocolate cheesecake with passion fruit coulis. There was also steak.The Healy-Rae boys picked up the bill, treating the troops while honouring their father at the same time. They also ran a tab at the bar for the before and after libations.Back in the chamber, the two sons spoke lovingly of the father they loved and from whom they learned so much.Danny, the elder, was more emotional in his words. Michael, the more experienced TD, the more political. Both spoke intertwined the word “family” with the word “organisation”.Micheal half joking, half in earnest, wanted rivals to look at the gallery “and realise that for every head and every pair of legs they see, there are 50 more at home”.A text arrived from a rural TD. “It’s like a convention speech.”The Healy-Raes are like an independent republic. They’ll be printing their own money next, with Jackie’s head on the notes.And back in the bar, the hooley continued before and after the dinner until they crowd left for the last train to Kerry.As they sang, the bar staff looked on as smart phones were held aloft recording the scenes – in flagrant contravention of the Leinster House rules. But the rules didn’t apply.At the back near the door, the Captain of the Guard materialised. Singing is verboten too.Back up at the top, a man burst into “Living Next Door to Alice”, Micheal Healy-Rae slamming his fist into his palm as he kept time.“Alice, Alice!” they roared. “Who the f**k is Alice!”The captain blanched, smiled and glided back out the door.A former army man, he knows when to retreat.Meanwhile, as the crowd enjoyed their final hours in the bar, Michael was on his feet in the chamber, talking about rural post offices. The visitors gallery was empty, and his voice was so hoarse he could hardly speak.But it’s what Jackie would have done too."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3939132.1561618000!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"canadian ivf doctor who used his own sperm loses licence","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBernard Norman Barwin was previously suspended by the college in 2013 after admitting to inseminating four women using the wrong sperm.Canadian fertility specialist Bernard Norman Barwin (80) has been stripped of his medical licence for repeatedly using the wrong sperm - including his own - to impregnate his patientsBarwin was deemed incompetent by the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario, which described the former doctor’s behaviour as “beyond reprehensible” and said the damage he caused will  generations.Barwin did not notify his patients of the errors, leaving them to discover years later the truth about their children’s paternity.“It is the most egregious violation of a patient’s trust. These patients came to Dr Barwin and trusted him to help them start a family,” said Carolyn Silver, the College’s senior counsel.Barwin pleaded no contest and did not attend the disciplinary hearing in Toronto. The disgraced former doctor also faces a class action which alleges he is the biological father of at least 11 children conceived in his clinic. He is accused of using the wrong sperm on 50 to 100 women, with the earliest complaints reaching as far back as 1978. Frances Shapiro Munn, a lawyer on the case, welcomed the medical community’s acknowledgment of the victims’ ordeal. She noted that the impact of his actions would “ripple through their lives for a long time”.The college said it started its own investigation of Barwin because of the media coverage surrounding the civil case. It has since found evidence that Barwin fathered at least seven children and wrongly inseminated 13 women.Barwin was previously suspended by the college in 2013 after admitting to inseminating four women using the wrong sperm. He resigned his medical licence in 2014 after other cases came to light. On Tuesday, the college revoked his licence completely and ordered him to pay costs totalling C$10,370 (US$8,000).In the college’s summary of its judgment, it described a dozen cases in which women were impregnated with the wrong sperm. In one case, one of the resulting children found out through an online DNA registry and then further medical DNA testing that Barwin is her biological father.Another of the adult children read a victim impact statement at the hearing.In 2015, Rebecca Dixon, then 25, underwent blood testing for coeliac disease, a typically hereditary illness neither of her parents suffered. Through that testing she and her parents found out she had no genetic link to the man she believed to be her father.In her victim impact statement, Ms Dixon said “in that moment, my life changed forever.”Dr Edward Hughes, who was retained as an expert witness by the college, suggested that Barwin’s defence - that improper cleaning of a sperm counter he tested with his own semen must have led to mistaken insemination - was “implausible”.“This is a tragic situation, in which a sea of avoidable harm was done,” said Dr Hughes. -  News and Media 2019"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3939129.1561624241!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"immigration top issue in democrats first presidential debate","story":"A technical glitch delayed the second hour of the first US Democratic party presidential debate, forcing moderators Chuck Todd and Rachel Maddow to pause and go to an ad break.

Photograph: Doug MillsThe New York TimesThe race to become the Democratic candidate to take on Donald Trump in next year’s presidential election began in earnest on Wednesday night, with 10 candidates taking part in the first primary debate.In a low-key event which included few references to Mr Trump and little conflict, the most dramatic moment was a technical hitch which forced NBC to cut to a commercial break after problems with back-stage microphones. The glitch prompted Mr Trump to tweet: “NBC News and MSNBC should be ashamed of themselves for having such a horrible technical breakdown in the middle of the debate. Truly unprofessional and only worthy of a FAKE NEWS Organization, which they are!”Mr Trump, who watched the debate on Air Force One as he travelled to Japan for the G20 summit, earlier tweeted “Boring!”Several of the candidates highlighted their own personal story. Julian Castro, the only Hiic candidate running for the nomination, described how he and his twin brother were brought up by a single mother. Tulsi Gabbard used her time to highlight her stint in the US military, including in Iraq, while Maryland congressman John Delaney outlined his experience as a businessman. In a nod to his El Paso roots, Beto O’Rourke began his first intervention by switching between English and Spanish.HealthcareCandidates were probed on where they stood on “Medicare for all” – essentially a government-funded healthcare programme.Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar said she favoured allowing Americans the choice to keep their private insurance. “I am simply concerned about kicking half of America off of their insurance in four years,” she said, pledging to tackle the issue of high pharmaceutical prices. Elizabeth Warren outlined her support for a fully government-funded healthcare plan which would do away with private insurance. “I’m with Bernie on Medicare for all,” she said, referring to Vermont senator Bernie Sanders who is widely seen as a rival to Ms Warren on the left.Mr O’Rourke said he would continue to give people the choice of private insurance, highlighting the importance of a woman’s right to choose in terms of abortion provision.Immigration Immigration was a prominent topic, with the MSNBC moderator raising the photograph of migrants Óscar Alberto Martínez and his 23-month-old daughter Valeria lying face down on the banks of the Rio Grande, which has prompted a new debate in the United States about the Trump administration’s immigration policy. “We saw that image today that broke our hearts,” Mr Castro said, pledging that if he becomes president it will no longer be a crime to illegally cross the border. Washington state governor Jay Inslee spoke about his state’s role in opposing Mr Trump’s Muslim ban in the early days of his presidency.With Ms Warren the top-polling candidate among the 10 debating on Wednesday, she dominated the first hour and many of the questions touched on her signature policy issues. Mr Castro, a former housing secretary under former USpresident Barack Obama, outperformed compared to predictions. Among his most memorable lines was “Adios to Donald Trump” as he delivered his closing statement. Tim Ryan of Ohio was one of the few candidates to state that Democrats need to reconnect with the views of working people, while New York mayor Bill DeBlasio spoke about his father’s struggle with depression after his experience in the second World War.Rare tensionThere were relatively few moments of conflict in the two-hour debate, which was broadcast live across the country. In a rare moment of tension, Mr de Blasio and Mr Delaney jumped in when Mr O’Rourke was discussing healthcare. At another point, Mr Castro asked fellow Texan Mr O’Rourke if he had done his homework on immigration issues.Wednesday night’s debate was the first real opportunity for those seeking the Democratic nomination for the 2020 election to set out their stall to the American public. The selection convention for the nominee is still more than a year away, while the first Democratic caucus will take place in Iowa in February.Ten more candidates are due to take to the stage on Thursday, including frontrunner Joe Biden, and senators Bernie Sanders and Kamala Harris. Polling analysis shows that four of the five top-polling candidates have been allotted the Thursday night slot, making the second night arguably the more important debate."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3938420.1561568811!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"joe biden s nostalgia for a bipartisan era is misplaced","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tJoe Biden: To his mind, Republicans and Democrats feud more out of muscle memory than principle. Photograph: Randall HillReutersAt no point in Romeo and Juliet does Shakespeare explain the “ancient grudge” between the Montagues and the Capulets. The great seer into the soul leaves us to infer that hatred is self-renewing. Humans do not need specifiable reasons to fight each other.Joe Biden’s English can be unShakespearean (“jobs”, he once said, is a “three-letter word”) but the former US vice-president sees something of fair Verona in Washington. To his mind, Republicans and Democrats feud more out of muscle memory than principle. He pines for the businesslike comity of yesteryear and aims to restore it if he becomes president in 2020. Barack Obama rose to national fame with a similar commitment 15 years ago. No conscientious leader could wish for anything less.But then no conscientious leader could pretend it is even remotely viable. It has become customary in the US to urge “bipartisanship” as though it were just a question of tone and goodwill. The implication is that Americans have much in common on matters of substance, only to be funnelled into rival sects by a rotten political process. It is certainly easier than admitting that some citizens are relaxed about, say, the demographic trend away from European descendants, while others feel raw pangs of dispossession about it.All democracies have their schisms but not all have recognisably “liberal” and “conservative” judges on their highest court, or the politicisation of something as dry as the census. As for star-cross’d lovers, a 2018 survey for the Atlantic found that 45 per cent of Democrats would be somewhat or very unhappy if their child married a Republican.Differences of this kind cannot be overcome by giving it the old college try. Yet that hope continues to bewitch people as smart as South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg, an emollient sort who identifies “language” as what separates Americans, who otherwise share “values”.Wishful thinkingAnother version of the same naivety blames the cleaving of the US on Fox News (average primetime audience: 2.4 million) or Facebook (as if Republicans and Democrats were high-fiving each other before 2004) or the uncompetitive congressional districts thrown up by gerrymandering. The pattern here is wishful thinking. The American house is not ided against itself, according to this analysis, but the plumbing and mechanics cause needless tiffs. We need some technical maintenance, is all. How comforting and implausible.No doubt, politicians make any ideological rifts worse than they need to be with foul rhetoric and legislative intransigence. But they are not magicking them out of nothing. Theirs is the narcissism of big differences.Nor was there ever much of an Eden to restore. Biden glows with nostalgia for the mid-20th century Washington of liberal Republicans and southern Democrats, of alliances to Get Things Done. He makes less of the urban riots and war protests that were costing lives at the same time. In other words, the fraternal give-and-take of Capitol Hill was never proof of underlying national unity. It was something of a veneer, and it was going to peel off in time.The animus of recent decades is not all that exceptional. Whether the locus of ision is Washington or the street, there has been lots of it since at least the early 19th century. Even if we leave aside a civil war that killed roughly 2 per cent of the population, there was intense resistance to the New Deal. There was inter-ethnic strife at the turn of the last century. The togetherness of the republic did not first come into question circa 1994. If anything, the disunity that has metastasised since then seems benign to anyone taking a longer view.Ducking or deferringAnd even the bipartisanship that did exist in the past was often achieved by not doing things, by ducking or deferring questions as fraught as the housing and voting rights of some citizens. Who would now argue that the US was better for such prevarication? Who would put the civility of the process over the outcome? Was the Gulf of Tonkin resolution, which enabled the Vietnam war, any wiser for being near-unanimous in its congressional support?Anyone who has fallen out with friends over politics in recent years, having once associated such behaviour with bores and fanatics, has learnt something. Some beliefs, it turns out, really are irreconcilable. The job of politics is to contain them, lest they spill into civil disorder. It cannot aspire to do much more. It cannot always even finesse them into constructive legislation that splits the difference. The promise of bipartisanship is always and everywhere rousing to hear. That does not make it any less of a fool’s errand. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2019"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/06/11/TELEMMGLPICT000197062411_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqWZZ9520Qrn8RyVs0byqFfxdYxsWUQUCtgJX18DpO5X4.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"making final call publish mps expenses","story":"Former editor of The Daily , William LewisIts publication led to the biggest parliamentary scandal in a generation, but two national newspapers had already turned the story down.The decision to pay for the full expense claims of every MP in Westminster was laced with risk: the leaked information could have been deemed stolen, or worse - it could have been a hoax.

A report by the London School of Economics (LSE) into children’s attitudes towards the internet found they overwhelmingly wanted a ‘grand erasure’ of their online footprint to stop childhood mistakes affecting their future.The research, which was funded by the Information Commissioner\u0027s Office, also found that children were generally trusting of tech companies in the same way they are of their schools.LSE researchers reviewed more than a decade’s worth of studies into children’s understanding of their online data and also conducted focus groups with more than 160 secondary school-age children.Professor Sonia Livingstone, who led the research, said children were generally “outraged” when they learned how much of their personal information is being hoarded online and wanted “a fresh start” when they turned 18.She said: “They say ‘whatever I do before I am 18 should be wiped off’ as it shouldn’t have any effect on them as an adult. They want a kind of grand erasure because they talk about the importance of making mistakes and just being kids trying things out.”The Government is currently looking at a range of new measures to better protect children online including imposing a legal duty of care on tech giants and introducing an Age Appropriate Design Code, which will mean social media giants will have to assume users are children if they can\u0027t age verify them.Duty of Care white paperMost social media companies have a minimum age of 13, but due to the lack of proper age checks the study found children as young as nine said they had profiles.The study found that children generally took instructions they received online on “face value” and often didn’t understand how tech companies were commercially benefiting from the information they handed over. As a result, they found it “puzzling” that internet companies often asked them to give out details they did not see as relevant to the service.The children interviewed were also shocked to learn that material they thought they had deleted could still exist online and wanted “delete to mean delete” when it came to social media.Other features children wanted from tech companies were a way to see which other companies their details had been shared with and “child-friendly mechanisms” to edit their information.Prof Livingstone said the children were generally mystified as to why tech companies were interested in personal information they saw as quickly going out of date as they grew up.She added: “Creepy is a really common word that they use. It’s creepy and sinister that all that data is being kept.”Duty of Care CampaignTrump says Japan could watch the US being attacked \u0026#39on a Sony TV\u0026#39 amid row over security pactTory leadership race: Boris Johnson\u0026#39s Australian-style points system would attract \u0026#39right people\u0026#39 but might not keep numbers down Concern over Angela Merkel\u0026#39s health as German chancellor seen shaking for second time this monthTeenager stabbed to death in west London in latest knife murderJeremy Hunt puts Northern Ireland veterans on par with IRA terroristsUS election Democrat candidates: Runners and riders for the 2020 presidencyComment: From Plato to The Godfather: how we\u0026#39re winning the battle against a disease which has shaped historyDemocrat White House hopefuls clash on immigration and healthcare in feisty first campaign debate Glastonbury revellers told not to urinate on grass amid fears heatwave could spell water contaminationAgonising eye disease may soon be consigned to history booksAustralian student reportedly detained in North KoreaCompensation for anti-EDL activists detained by police reaches £729,000Widow weeps as CCTV shows \u0026#39relentless\u0026#39 knife attack on trainEnd of the naughty step as nurseries say they no longer use the term due to \u0026#39negative connotations\u0026#39Rape victims only believed by police and courts if they have behaved like saints, victims’ commissioner warnsWoman asphyxiated in online sex game was unlawfully killed, inquest hearsYou just can\u0026#39t get enough, when it comes to exercise: Cambridge studyCervical cancer could be eliminated within decades, scientists say We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/04/28/TELEMMGLPICT000194102761_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq900leoZVuq6ru6F43OqP_nrDFz5WxMWkdtNYw7K1ZWo.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"women want get pregnant should move countryside improve fertility","story":"Women who want to have children should consider moving to the countryside to improve their fertility, scientists have suggested following a new study.Research in Italy found women living in polluted areas are likely to have a shorter window in which to conceive due to the damage done by toxic particles to their ovarian reserve.The results showed a “reproductive disadvantage” even in areas significantly less polluted than the official European limit, which some parts of the UK regularly breach.They corroborate recent research from the US which indicates that smoking can hasten the menopause by as much as two years.Professor Antonio La Marca, who led the new study at the University of Modena,...Register for free to read this article, or log in to your  accountThe  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Only one candidate from a field of two dozen will be named the Democratic Party’s official nominee. The hopefuls have starkly different backgrounds, ideologies, strengths and weaknesses. Who the party picks could determine the country\u0027s future. Voting starts in February 2020 with an eventual winner confirmed in July – ready to take on Mr Trump at the election on November 3. Joe Biden has framed himself as the person best placed to defeat Donald Trump and is the overwhelming favourite in the Democrat field. The 76-year-old, who served as Barack Obama’s vice president for eight years, believes his centrist platform can win back Obama-Trump voters in key swing states.Elizabeth Warren, a senator for Massachusetts, is vying with Bernie Sanders to represent the progressive left of the Democratic Party. She has condemned the corrupting influence of money on politics and lamented lost economic opportunities for working families. However she has faced criticism over her claims of Native American heritage.Bernie Sanders, an independent senator for Vermont, blindsided Hillary Clinton with an insurgent campaign from the Left in 2016 which energised young voters in a surge that drew comparisons with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. He has a loyal and established network of activists who could be remobilised for his second shot at the Democratic nomination. However his age is a concern - he would be 79 on inauguration day.Julian Castro, a former San Antonio mayor, has been widely tipped as a rising star in the Democratic Party for years and served in Barack Obama\u0027s Cabinet. The grandson of a Mexican immigrant, Mr Castro has sought to use his family’s personal story to challenge Mr Trump’s border policies.John Delaney, a congressman from Maryland, was the first to throw his hat into the ring when he made his announcement in September, 2017. The 55-year-old’s pitch is unashamedly moderate. This could prove a weakness given his lack of name recognition and no eye-catching policies to set him apart in a crowded field.Tulsi Gabbard, an Iraq War veteran who is the first Hindu elected to Congress and the first member born in the US territory of American Samoa, said “the issue of war and peace” would be the main focus of her campaign. The 37-year-old has drawn criticism for meeting with President Bashar Assad and questioning his role in a chemical attack on civilians.Kirsten Gillibrand, a senator for New York, is an outspoken Trump critic and champion of women’s issues including the #MeToo movement. The 52-year-old has presented herself as a young mother fighting for better healthcare, combating “institutional racism” and taking on entrenched systems of power in Washington.Kamala Harris, a senator for California, is striking a balance between progressive policies such as medicare for all and more moderate approaches to gun rights and foreign policy. The 54-year-old\u0027s supporters believe she has a broad enough appeal to gain traction with a Democratic Party that is increasingly non-white and fuelled by women.Pete Buttigieg, started out a little known 37-year-old mayor, but has quickly become a top-tier candidate. Mr Buttigieg has held no national political office but has an impressive CV.

Mr O\u0027Rourke\u0027s message of inclusion and optimism got America’s liberal elite swooning, and many believe he could be the candidate to achieve the near impossible and turn Texas blue in 2020.Cory Booker, a senator for New Jersey who has styled himself a street fighter, is a major contender. The 48-year-old is one of only three black US senators and has an impeccable academic CV - political science at Stanford, a Rhodes scholarship to Oxford, going on to study law at Yale.Bill de Blasio, the mayor of New York city, has plenty of name recognition but this may not count in his favour. Polls suggest most New York voters are against the idea of the 6ft 5in mayor, known as Big Bird, entering the 2020 race.Jay Inslee, the governor for Washington state, is running almost exclusively on a climate change platform - the only candidate in the race to do so. The 68-year-old is a vocal critic of Mr Trump and attempted to sue the president after he attempted to implement his Muslim ban.John Hickenlooper, is a former governor of Colorado, former Denver mayor and pub owner. The 67-year-old\u0027s sales pitch is that he is an extreme moderate – a pro-business Democrat who is also socially progressive. But his lack of name recognition will hold him back in a crowded field.Marianne Williamson is a best-selling author and spiritual teacher, but perhaps best known for being presenter Oprah Winfrey\u0027s spiritual counsellor. The 66-year-old ran an unsuccessful campaign for the House of Representatives as an independent candidate in 2014. Her presidential campaign calls for a moral and spiritual awakening in the country.Andrew Yang, an entrepreneur and businessman, says he wants to introduce a universal basic income of $1,000 per month for all Americans to address economic inequality. The 44-year-old has focused his campaign on human-centred capitalism.

The 54-year-old announced his bid for the presidency in early May - joining his former boss, John Hickenlooper, in the crowded field.Seth Moulton, 40, is a congressman from Massachusetts. A Harvard graduate and former US marine, he has defined himself as a progressive, supporting legalisation of cannabis, the green new deal and further gun control. However he has failed to secure a spot in the first round of debates, which is crucial for national recognition.Eric Swalwell a congressman from California, has taken a particularly tough line on guns in his campaign, calling for a ban on assault weapons. Firmly tilting to the left of the party, the 38-year-old has endorsed the Green New Deal and backs Medicare for All, which would eliminate most private health insurance.Tim Ryan was elected to Congress at just 29 years old to represent Ohio.

The 53-year-old has focused on reforming campaign finances, but his late entry to the race poses a challenge and he has failed to qualify for the first round of debates.Wayne Messam, the mayor of Miramar, is the only candidate from Florida, the country\u0027s largest swing state. The 45-year-old\u0027s advisers say one of his main policy proposals will be forgiving the $1.5 trillion in student debt currently owed by 44 million Americans. Mr Messam says he\u0027s not willing to concede defeat, despite not making the cut for the first debates.Joe Sestak, a retired three-star Navy admiral, waited until late June to throw his name into the field. The 67-year-old is running on his lengthy naval career, which has ned from the Vietnam and Cold War eras, to Afghanistan and Iraq and the emergence of China.

We need another show with a big house and a strong, silent, topless gardener who gallops around searching for love, fulfilment and all that toss.”So we’ve now got this six-part series fronted by Tom Bateman, who actually made a promising start to playing soldier-turned-trader John Beecham.He got shot.I’d have run the closing titles right there and then and promised viewers: “ITV willin about , when it’s got some new ideas.”According to the caption, however, “three years later” John Beecham was back and he’d brought his extended family with him to fill the big house.They include: His dear old racist mum, played by Mrs Patmore off Downton, a motherless baby, wayward brother Daniel, some pot-stirring French git called General Castillion and two underwhelming bits of female love interest, who won’t get any bloke switching over from Love Island in a hurry. Also present is Citizen Khan himself, Adil Ray, who’s moved in next door wearing a glued-on beard that last saw serious action in Carry On Up The Khyber.So I hope no one was expecting a laugh, or a plot. Because Beecham House hasn’t really got one, apart from the baby issue and Beecham’s grovelling desire to be granted a trading licence, which both generate lots of sarky backchat from the locals, but not much .It all stands or falls then, almost entirely, on the leading character.And, oh boy, does this one ever fall.As absolutely everyone’s noticed, for the want of charisma they’ve had to dress the poor bloke up as Indiana Jones, which can’t be a lot of fun in that climate.Even with the overcoat, cowboy hat and women throwing themselves at him, John’s brother still thinks he’s “the dullest man in Delhi”.The thing that really weighs him down, though, is Empire guilt. The righteous berk can hardly look at an Indian without apologising.“Your Imperial Highness, I implore you judge me by my actions not my flag.”“I am not like my countrymen.” “Their hypocrisy sickens me.” “The East India company’s policy of expansion is shameful.” “I love your country and believe India should be ruled by Indians.”  He’s so woke he could be reading last night’s Channel  News.An approach that’s unlikely to win the show many friends, I’d have thought, or stop the more right-on viewers accusing him of having “big white saviour syndrome”.Ultimately, though, I have absolutely no real idea whether John Beecham will strike a chord with the viewers, because, like most shows broadcast in the Sunday night pm to pm slot, I am not part of the target female audience.All I’m meant to do is sit dumbly and join in the apologetic Empire chorus.I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m not sorry at all.TIPPING Point, Ben Shephard: “In Only Fools And Horses, who plays the character known as Del Boy ”Ben: “David Frost.”Fteen To One, Sandi Toksvig: “What is the two-word term for a flashing orange globe mounted on a striped pole, used at pedestrian crossings, named after a s minister of transport ”Kresha: “Traffic light.”And Love Island, Molly-Mae: “What is the capital of France ”PSYCHOPATH With Piers Morganrequires expectations to be managed, because it’s barely a minute old when Porky-Talkie reveals: “The prison considers Paris Bennett so dangerous they insist I interview him behind toughened glass.”Andthat’s not health-and-safety gone mad, I dunno what is, frankly.RE: Love Island. If Joe and Lucie were “Jucie” and Jordan and Anna “Jordanna”, did that make Elma and Scottish Anton “Elma Fud” NEVER a good sign when you can tell a show’s going to be a disaster just from the furniture.But that was the case with last Tuesday’s big political bun fight, on BBC, which looked more like a dating show or fire sale at Louis Walsh’s gaff than a debate to decide Our Next Prime Minister.It sounded like it as well, from the way host Emily Maitlis kicked off, barking: “Five men. One job.” A phrase I don’t think I’ve heard any presenter utter since Kerry Katona was fronting ElimiDate, back in .Long before it got to air, Maitlis and the BBC had also clearly decided Boris was the “Islamo- phobic” booby prize, because not one of the researchers saw any warning signs being given off by Abdullah, from Bristol, who’d deactivated his Twitter before appearing on the show. The prize guy, naturally, was meant to be Rory Stewart, who liberal political commentators all think would make a great Conservative Party leader, in the same way they probably think Iggy Pop would make a great lead singer of One Direction.Turned out, though, he’s a fidgeting little oddball who was political toast long before he sighed at Boris: “I’m sure, like me, you’ve been in Enniskillen sitting with sheep farmers.”So, by the end of the night, an attempted BBC stitch-up had accounted for: Rory Stewart, one anti-semite, from Bristol, some other bug-eyed Corbyn cultist demanding an early election and probably Emily Maitlis’ credibility as well.Boris, meanwhile, just ploughed on regardless.Well done, everyone.Celebrity Crystal Maze, Gemma Collins: “Just being honest, it’s an honour for you to have me.”And The Last Leg, Alex Brooker: “The problem with me swimming The Channel is I can’t swim.”Problem how ON Thursday’s Shopping With Keith Lemon, former market trader Rob Beckett claimed: “I used to sell compost and you can’t up-sell a bag of s***, can you ”Yet it never stopped him trying on All Together Now.IT’S nearly six months since that great foghorning orca, Gemma Collins, last made an exhibition of herself on television.So I suppose we were overdue Friday’s appearance on Celebrity Crystal Maze, where she rumbled round the course, like Indiana Jones’ concrete ball, alongside Carol Vorderman, Ellie Taylor, Rick Edwards and her on off boyfriend Arg.And how that pair avoided wedging themselves inside one of the show’s duct shafts will remain for ever one of the Channel  show’s great mysteries.Gemma bellowed over everyone, insulted her co-stars, threw a hissy fit inside one virtual reality game – “Nah, sorry. Stop the game” – and told host Richard Ayoade: “You must be clever ’cos I’ve got the mind of a genius and you’ve made me laugh.” She also attempted to create some sort of mystique around “The GC” tag, claiming it was nothing to do with her initials and inviting alternative suggestions from Carol, who remained diplomatically silent, evenI’d swear you could see in the thought bubble above her head  . . . “Gigantic consonant vowel consonant consonant.”THE Real Chernobyl proving the perfect accompaniment to Sky Atlantic’s show of the year.Susanna Reid’s digestive tract going into deep spasm when Geoffrey Boycott asked her out for lunch, on another unmissable Good Morning Britain.Top Gear’s Chris Harris attempting to drink a glass of water while being electric-shocked by Freddie Flintoff and Paddy McGuinness.And Alien Fun Capsule host Harry Hill responding to Stephanie Beacham name-dropping former Dynasty husband Charlton Heston: “Yeah, Charlton Heston. He was slumming it a bit after Ben Hur, wasn’t he ”ITV has just one brilliant comedy show. Harry Hill’s Alien Fun Capsule, co-written by Paul Hawksbee and Dan Maier.Slightly to my surprise, I’ve learned it also has a Head of Comedy called Saskia Schuster, who’s just told something called the Diverse Festival – and what a laugh riot that sounds – she will no longer commission shows written only by men.In the great sweep of ITV history, the possibility exists, of course, that someone has made a more stupid, pointless, self-defeating, virtue-clogged, brain-fart of a commitment than this one.It’s just that I can’t think of it at the moment.LAURA Bassett: “She had her arms by her side behind her body.”Casey Stoney: “Cameroon have got that no-lose attitude, eventhey lose.”Jordan Nobbs: “If England keep believing, the second half will come.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Resign!” were directed at the homelessness minister Heather Wheeler.In an email written before she took up the role, Wheeler described rough sleepers in her constituency as “the traditional type, old tinkers”.The words were leaked and, lo, the outrage flowed hot and predictable. The Big Issue Foundation’s chief executive raged that such language, “has no place in this day and age” and so Wheeler should stand down.A travellers’ charity called her words “racist”, adding that “Irish traveller children should not have to grow up in a society where government ministers show such contempt for their culture”.Yes, Wheeler’s language was wince-worthy, but the leap to “racism” highlights the way race is used as a shield to protect the lestyles of some gypsy, Roma and traveller people from legitimate criticism.Recognised in the Equality Act of  as ethnic minorities, a force field of cultural sensitivity surrounds them. Any discussion of their culture can be labelled racist.Recent reports have found that travellers have it worse than the rest of us: Higher infant and maternal mortality rates higher prevalence of depression higher rates of chronic illness.They are likely to die more than a decade earlier than non-travellers.The educational outcomes for their children are terrible: The lowest attainment of all ethnic groups throughout their school years.They are far more likely to be excluded, and while  per cent of white British children stay in education past , only  per cent of Irish traveller children do.Officialdom’s response to these findings has been to blame officialdom or racial discrimination.The chairwoman of the Commons Women and Equalities Committee, Maria Miller, thinks travellers have been “comprehensively failed by policymakers and public services for far too long”.Always, the blame is directed at “the system”.Always, there is the retreat into the safe language of “vulnerable” people and “marginalised communities”, because politicians are terried of asking dficult questions about why travellers are over-represented in prison, or why many of their children are failing at school.Such questions would only spark accusations of racism and discrimination.This is not to suggest that gypsies, Roma and travellers live free from prejudice.There is discrimination which is real and cruel: Allegations of holiday camp operators having traveller blacklists pubs refusing to serve traveller families children bullied in school.Yet whose interests do we servewe pretend that all of this is down to straightforward racism The usually sensible Trevor Phillips, former chairman of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, has said that for gypsies and travellers: “Great Britain is still like the Deep South for black people in the Fties.”His analogy fails because it suggests the prejudice suffered is all about ethnic heritage, unconnected to the lestyle pursued by many travellers. This is nonsense.Though politicians will not dare say it, many in this country have negative perceptions of these groups because of their experience of illegal encampments on their local playing field: The littering, disruption and what might politely be termed “antisocial behaviour”.They see a group of people refusing to live by the laws the rest of us abide by: Trespassing on land with the police seemingly powerless to stop them breaking locks with no one prepared to arrest them parking on private property and not being towed away.It’s not racism driving this anti-traveller sentiment.It is fury that one community seems to live apart from the rules that govern the rest of us.The authorities seem pitully weak when it comes to evicting these camps. Councils must assess the welfare needs of those on the site before they can get an eviction order.Public money is sprayed on legal fees before the caravans move to a dferent illegal site, where the whole thing starts again.The authorities’ methods might be motivated by a desire not to “marginalise” travellers further, but it isn’t working.We need an approach which, while reconciling travellers’ desire to live on the move, recognises the desire of the rest of us to see the rules of the land enforced fairly.Part of this approach must be to make the process of evicting illegal camps surer and swter.But it’s no use simply wielding this stick without a carrot.The complementary action must be a building programme to create more authorised traveller pitches.Critically, each could have contact points with the local authority, with education and health systems, to catch these families in the net of public services .With more information on who lives where, the authorities could keep better tabs on who is educating their children, who is paying council tax, and so on.This issue may not make the hustings in the Tory leadership campaign, but it matters to the kind of country we are.Sensitivity to dferent cultures is right, butobjectionable or illegal behaviour cannot be dealt with for fear it will look racist, we are in a very strange place indeed.Giving one group a politically correct free pass denied to others is not fair, it is discrimination.Conservatives always talk about the importance of everyone “playing by the same rules”.Here’s a chance for the next leader to show he means it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Joseph, , from South London, repeatedly muttered Jesus and other phrases under her breath, despite being told to stop.After she said Jesus kill her, district Judge Andrew Sweet ordered her to leave.He said: Mrs Joseph, I gave you two warnings, I said you must not interrupt the witness evidence.I will not tolerate you sitting and making comments that are inappropriate.Shaking her head as she walked out, Mrs Joseph told the judge: God be your judge.The court heard the mum and son chanted death by fire, death to Samantha and harassed her by turning up their TV.Prosecutor Robin Simpson said: In essence she [Ms Ginsberg] has a child who suffers from autism and the Josephs believe that child is possessed by witches.There has been a course of behaviour which involves shouting what can only be described as incantations from the bible against her.Giving evidence, Ms Ginsberg said the pair, who lived in the flat below hers, would break into threatening chants or at all hours of the day and

Great Britain, not Little England.”Tory and Labour MPs leapt on the comments to question his desire to deliver Brexit at all.Boris supporter Ben Bradley called him “Theresa in Trousers”.He said: “There is no such thing as a Brexit that works for people who do not want Brexit.”And in an astonishing attack, Labour Leaver Kate Hoey slammed Mr Hunt for making such a “snide” comment.As the row spiralled, Jeremy Hunt insisted the accusations were wrong and it was “literally the opposite of what I said”.He explained: “Brexit is not and never will turn us into Little England and I’d never suggest that’s what Brexiteers want.“But it must be right to address the fears of some remain voters on this, which I will do in order to heal Brexit isions.”Hunt, who became foreign secretary in July last year, is currently facing former mayor of London Boris Johnson in a race to replace Theresa May as prime minister.Both say they hope to reopen Brexit negotiations with the European Union and secure an alternative to her withdrawal agreement.The two have engaged in a war of words in recent days, with Hunt having suggested Johnson was not trustworthy, and Johnsons campaign responding by accusing Hunt of ludicrously tilting at windmills in his bid for the leadership.Johnson faced questions this week after cops were called to the apartment he shares with girlfriend Carrie Symonds by neighbours who heard Symonds yelling get off me and get out of my flat.Hunt has been accused by arch Eurosceptics of ‘converting’ to Brexit after voting Remain in  to embolden his chances of reaching No..But Mr Hunt insisted he can be trusted on Brexit and that he would vote to leave in the event of a second referendum.He puts his change of heart down to the “arrogance of the European Commission” during Brexit negotiations.But there are two problems with a Tory leadership finalist wanting to “deliver a Brexit that works for the  per cent, not just the  per cent . . .

But we suspect it may also reveal a lurking prejudice about Leavers which the Foreign Secretary and too many ­fellow Remainers still harbour.When you’re trying to win over Eurosceptic Tory members, and then Brexit Party voters, that’s fatal.Insiders said yesterday’s row could hurt his chances of the top job given most Tory members who have a say on who wins the leadership contest are Brexiteers.Mr Hunt is backed by anti-No Deal Tories such as Amber Rudd but also Liam Fox, the Brexiteer International Trade Secretary."},{"url":null,"title":"theresa may meet vladimir putin g20","story":"The Russian President will discuss “sensitive questions” at the G summit on Friday in an effort to thaw relations, the Kremlin said.The pair last met informally at the G in Argentina last year just months after the Novichok nerve agent incident.Ex-Russian spy Sergei Skripal and daughter Yulia both spent around two months in hospital - but Moscow denies any involvement.Mrs May said the country’s military intelligence service, the GRU, carried it out with approval at a senior level in the country.Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov yesterday said: “The leaders will talk over sensitive questions - as you know there are many of them ...“If any kind of opportunity can be found in our relations with Britain to establish new cooperation, then we will only welcome that.”But Number  last night said the meeting doesn’t mean relations between the countries are back to normal.The PM’s spokesman said: “We remain open to a dferent relationship but that can only happenRussia desists from actions which undermine international treaties and collective security.”Putin has said that the two countries should move on from the Salisbury attack and hopes to improve ties with the next PM.He said: “When all’s said and done we need to turn this page connected with spies and assassination attempts.”Two Russian military intelligence officers, known by the aliases Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, have been charged with attempted murder over the attack.They claimed they were visiting the tourist city and had no part in any poisoning or crime.Mrs May is making her last appearance at a major summit which takes place in Osaka, Japan.The UK remains open to a dferent relationship but that can only happenRussia desists from activity that undermines international treaties and our collective security like the attack in Salisbury, Number  said.Relations have been strained between Russia and the West since the annexation of Crimea in .More than twenty countries expelled more than  diplomats following the Salisbury attack.The meeting in Japan doesnt represent a normalisation of relations with Moscow in the wake of the Novichok incident and other malign actions from the state.A spokesman added: This meeting is an important opportunity to deliver this message leader to leader to ensure that the UKs position is fully understood.Of course there are matters of international security where we continue to engage with Russia when it is in our national interest to do so.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We have one objective in all our political work, and that is supporting Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership of Labour and winning the Labour government.“So we are not the union for smart-alec strategies, flip-flopping on points of principle or Baldrick-style cunning plans on Brexit.”Labour ex Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett, who backs another referendum, accused Mr Corbyn’s closest advisers of blocking a change of policy.She told BBC Radio  Today Programme: “They don’t give a toss about what the British people now want or what Labour members think is in the country’s interests.“They just are determined to make sure we don’t do anything to impede Britain leaving,necessary with no deal.”A Labour spokesman admitted there is “a spectrum of views across the Labour party” on Brexit.But he said they will finally settle their policy “in a few weeks”.Hitting back at claims Mr Corbyn takes his Brexit orders from Mr McCluskey, he added: “Jeremy is quite capable of taking his own decisions and the idea that he’s under the control of anyone  is laughable.”He said a “credible Leave option” will need to be on the ballot paperanother referendum is held.And he did not rule out no-deal being on the ballot paper for a second referendum.Most of Corbyn’s party are screaming at him to back a second referendum and campaign to Remain.

Theresa May yesterday claimed Saturday’s annual Armed Forces Day was “an opportunity for us all to pay tribute to our servicemen and women here and around the world for their dedication and service, and to those who have served in previous generations”.But Labour released figures showing how after almost a decade of real terms pay cuts, a private’s starting salary is £, lower in real terms today than in . Shadow Defence Secretary Nia Grfith said: “As a country, we are rightly proud of our highly-skilled servicemen and women, ready at a moment’s notice to do whatever is necessary to defend our country.    “But under the Conservatives, our Armed Forces have had a raw deal. The Government has delivered short-sighted defence cuts and failed privatisations that have let down personnel and taxpayers alike. “The next Labour government will guarantee a better deal for servicemen and women.”It comes as Jeremy Corbyn attempts to avoid criticism of snubbing Armed Forces Day for the third year in a row by attending a small local event in his constituency.He was accused of disrespecting the army, navy and airforce two years ago when he went to Glastonbury instead, and last year for going on an NHS march. Last July ministers announced they were ending the public sector pay freeze, with the Armed Forces seeing % rises. But even that was below the level of inflation. As well as scrapping the public sector pay cap, Labour are laying out a set of pledges for soldiers and their families.  This includes a review of outsourcing with the aim of reducing outsourcing. They will commit to providing decent housing for forces and their families and better access to schools with a dedicated local authorities admissions strategy for the particular challenge of frequent school moves. The party also wants to create a body to give service men and women more of a voice which would be similar to the Police Federation. Meanwhile, the Federation of Small Businesses demanded better backing for veterans to become entrepreneurs. About , - % - of small businesses are run by ex-military personnel. A report out today, ‘A Force For Business’, recommends better help for those leaving the Armed Forces, including a greater focus on the option of self-employment and the key skills needed to succeed in enterprise”. FSB chairman Mike Cherry said: “Setting up and running your own business requires courage, determination and a strong work ethic. These are attributes which service leavers have in spades, and why self-employment is a route well worth considering by those coming towards the end of their time in the Armed Forces. “For those seeking employment, small businesses can often be better than bigger ones at spotting and nurturing talent, rather than discard a service leaver’s job application because some of their skills and qualications aren’t necessarily from a traditional academic route. “But there is room for greater support and advice to service leavers on the options of self-employment or finding work within an existing smaller business, and there should be more of a focus on the key skills needed to succeed in enterprise. Lt Col Ren Kapur, chief executive of X-Forces Enterprise, said: “Many skills developed within the Armed Forces community are in high demand in the commercial world of employed work cyber security, drone technology, telecommunications, logistics, prosthetics, and articial intelligence, to name just a few. “These extremely valuable skills must not be lost to the commercial world, either employed or self-employed – it is likely that these iniduals can experience and flourish in both after serving their country so well.” "},{"url":null,"title":"jeremy hunt loses s jeremy","story":"NewsJeremy Hunt loses his s*** with Jeremy Vine for pointing out how rich he isThe Tory leadership candidate really didnt enjoy when how wealthy he was came up on the BBCShareCommentsByOliver MilnePolitical Correspondent:,  JUN Updated:,  JUN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news politics video jeremy-hunt-goes-crazy-told-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:,],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true\"\"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMultimillionaire Tory leadership hopeful Jeremy Hunt lost his rag on the radio today after someone mentioned his enormous personal wealth.

Audibly furious Mr Hunt added: Thank you Jeremy for instead of saying I was successful and set up a business and created  jobs that you said I was the richest man in Cabinet.

The interview continued with Mr Hunt revealing his passion for the Brazilian dance the Lambada - and over sharing massively.    Mr Hunt - who reportedly has a sprung dancefloor in his home - said that when he was election in  his great passion was lambada dancing. Over sharing, Mr Hunt added: I have to say that this is a dance for single people - it is an intimate dance - so perhaps not one for married listeners. Earlier Mr Hunt spent £ on two milkshakes for the cameras. Sipping the drink from a jar, he said this is some mean milkshake, adding: A big improvement on Nigel Farageaposs milkshake moment. He also bought some white orchids for his we, joking with a market florist: I keep on calling her Japanese when sheaposs actually Chinese - I tell you, I bought a lot of flowers when I did that. An earlier version of this story said Mr Hunt spent £ on a single milkshake. We have since been informed it was £. each on two milkshakes. The Daily Mirror is happy to correct the record.

Though Clark is a fine scholar, I was unconvinced by his title, which suggested the great powers stumbled mindlessly to disaster. On the contrary, the maddest aspect of  was that each belligerent government convinced itself that it was acting rationally. It would be fancul to liken the ascent of Boris Johnson to the outbreak of global war, but similar forces are in play. There is room for debate about whether he is a scoundrel or mere rogue, but not much about his moral bankruptcy, rooted in a contempt for truth. Nonetheless, even before the Conservative national membership cheers him in as our prime minister – denied the option of Nigel Farage, whom some polls suggest they would prefer – Tory MPs have thronged to do just that. I have known Johnson since the s, when I edited the Dailyand he was our flamboyant Brussels correspondent.  I have argued for a decade that, while he is a brilliant entertainer who made a popular maître d’ for London as its mayor, he is unfit for national office, because it seems he cares for no interest save his own fame and gratication. Tory MPs have launched this country upon an experiment in celebrity government, matching that taking place in Ukraine and the US, and it is unlikely to be derailed by the latest headlines. The Washington Post columnist George Will observes that Donald Trump does what his base wants “by breaking all the china”. We can’t predict what a Johnson government will do, because its prospective leader has not got around to thinking about this. But his premiership will ­almost certainly reveal a contempt for rules, precedent, order and stability. A few admirers assert that, in office, Johnson will reveal an accession of wisdom and responsibility that have hitherto eluded him, not least as Foreign Secretary. This seems unlikely, as the weekend’s stories emphasised. Dignity still matters in public office, and Johnson will never have it. Yet his graver vice is cowardice, reflected in a willingness to tell any audience whatever he thinks most likely to please, heedless of the inevitability of its contradiction an hour later. Like many showy personalities, he is of weak character.  I recently suggested to a radio audience that he supposes himself to be Winston Churchill, while in reality being closer to Alan Partridge. Churchill, for all his wit, was a profoundly serious human being. Far from perceiving anything glorious about standing alone in , he knew that all dficult issues must be addressed with allies and partners. Churchill’s self-obsession was tempered by a huge compassion for humanity, or at least white humanity, which Johnson confines to himself. He has long been considered a bully, prone to making cheap threats. My old friend Christopher Bland, when chairman of the BBC, once described to me how he received an angry phone call from Johnson, denouncing the corporation’s “gross intrusion upon my personal le” for its coverage of one of his love affairs. “We know plenty about your personal le that you would not like to read in the Spectator,” the then editor of the magazine told the BBC’s chairman, while demanding he order the broadcaster to lay off his own dalliances. Bland told me he replied: “Boris, think about what you have just said. There is a word for it, and it is not a pretty one.” He said Johnson blustered into retreat, but in my own files I have handwritten notes from our poss-ible next Prime Minister, threatening dire consequences in printI continued to criticise him. Johnson would not recognise truth, whether about his private or political le,confronted by it in an identity parade. The other day I came across an observation made in  by Bishop Berkeley: “It is impossible that a man who is  to his friends and neighbours should be true to the public.” Almost the only people who think Johnson a nice guy are those who do not know him. There is, of course, a symmetry between himself and Jeremy Corbyn. Corbyn is far more honest, but harbours his own delusions. He may yet prove to be the only possible Labour leader whom Johnson can defeat in a general election. If the opposition was led by anybody , the Tories would be deservedly doomed. As it is, the Johnson premiership could survive three or four years, shambling from one embarrassment and debacle to another, of which Brexit may prove the least. For many of us, his elevation will signal Britain’s abandonment of any claim to be a serious country. It can be claimed that few people realised what a poor Prime Minister Theresa May would prove until they saw her in Downing Street. With Boris, however, what you see now is almost assuredly what we shall get from him as ruler. We can scarcely strip the emperor’s clothes from a man who has built a career, or at least a lurid love le, out of strutting without them. The weekend stories of his domestic affairs are only an aperit for his future as Britain’s leader. I have a hunch that Johnson will come to regret securing the prize for which he has struggled so long, because the experience of the premiership will lay bare his ­absolute unfitness for it. If the Johnson family had stuck to showbusiness like the Osmonds, Marx Brothers or von Trapp family, the world would be a better place. Yet the Tories have elevated a cavorting charlatan to the steps of Downing Street, and they should expect to pay a full forfeit when voters get the message. If the price of Johnson proves to be Corbyn, blame will rest with the Conservative party, which is about to foist a tasteless joke upon the British people - who will not find it funny for long.

We are looking into this with our ground handling partners at Palma Airport. Once onboard the cabin crew arranged seating together for the family. We do our best to look after young families, including providing regular and specic information encouraging them to check in online as early as possible so they can be seated together before arriving at the airport. We also send this information to third party bookers, including Thomas Cook and ask them to share this with customers.” As a scheduled airline, easyJet can sell more tickets than available seats on the plane but they must ask for volunteers before offloading people.

The harrowing attack was captured on their doorbell camera showing the moment the two out-of-control dogs bit onto the defenseless pet. The dogsapos owner can be seen trying to stop the hounds as they struck on Ash Avenue, in Brickfields, Worcester last Thursday.  Another clip of the video shows the owner getting down on his knees and saying aposIaposm sorryapos to Shakira and Sharon. He said: I was in the park and my dogs were following a black cat and they killed him. I was going to take him to the vet. The teenage girl saw them dragging Cleo into a nearby park but says she didnapost realise it was her pet. She said: I was in the front room as it was happening. I didn’t realise it was Cleo until a neighbour knocked on the door and askedour cat was black and white.  I collapsed on the floor screaming. I wish I’d helped her. I’d have rather been injured by the dogs than to lose my cat. “My mind keeps going back to seeing her dead on the ground. I haven’t slept in days and I can’t eat. She didn’t deserve to die the way she did. I just want my cat back. Mother Sharon blamed the dog owner and said the dogs should have been on a lead.  She said: The footage clearly shows the dogs were out of control and going wild. These were big dogs. They should be muzzled.” She claimed the man said he would take Cleo to a vet but they have not heard anything since. She has also contacted local vets in the area but none reported having Cleo brought in, meaning the family do not know here Cleoaposs body has been left. Shakira’s step-dad, Ian, , watched the footage following the attack and said the dogs were off their lead and jumped onto Cleo unprovoked.    He said: She didn’t have a chance. She was torn into pieces. “The owner came around the corner and booted one dog and picked up the one with the cat in its mouth. He took it around the corner into the park. It was dead by then. My we was too distraught. She didn’t get any details from this man. “It’s devastating for our daughter. The cat used to sleep in her room. It’ll take her a while to get over this. “I am so angry. I’d like to see him prosecuted. Any dog that is capable of doing that should be muzzled.

Mr Reed added: “If the Government get away with remov­­ing this benefit, next in line is going to be the winter fuel allowance, free bus passes, then free prescriptions.” He said means-testing will have a “huge impact on the two million pensioners struggling just above the Pension Credit eligibility level”.

The controversial new rules at The Hen and Chicken Pub in Bristol appeared on a laminated poster on the pubaposs notice board behind the bar. They apply to all children and teenagers under the age of . The new restrictions state that children must be sat at a table with an adult at all times, whether dining or not, and prohibits free roaming, running, scootering, or climbing. The notice adds that children under the age of  are not allowed on the premises after pm, while children aged - can only stay on the premises after pm when having a meal. It furthers asks parents to be mindful to prevent children shouting or screaming. The Bedminister pub has mixed responses, with some parents championing the pub for being upfront, while others brand it ridiculous.     Pub director James Townend has said he implemented this policy has been in place for more than five years, but that it is going to be more strictly enforced in future. The poster in full reads: Please be aware that as part of out licensing commitment to the safeguarding of children and minors: Children under the age of  are not permitted on the presmises after pm. Children between the ages of    years are only permitted on the premises after pm when having a meal, accompanied by an adult and must depart by pm. - year olds are not permitted on the premises after pm unless attending a performance upstairs and accompanied by an adult. In consideration of all our customers, we do insist that: All children must be sat at a table with an adult at all times, whether dining or not  inside or outside. No free roaming, running, scootering or climbing. Please be mindful to prevent children shouting or screaming. Thank you for your understanding and consideration to our staff and all our customers.    Mr Townend who has been the pub director for a decade said: This is not simply a knee-jerk reaction. As a dad to three sons, I completely understand it can be hard work keeping your children sat down at the pub. Sadly there are a minority of parents who think itaposs okay to relinquish control of their parental responsibilities as soon as they enter the pub, and think itaposs okay for their children to run around screaming and shouting. There are places where children are free to do this such as parks and playgrounds. But when you enter a pub, which has always been seen as an adult domain, there is a responsibility to conform a little bit. We have customers who want to enjoy a nice pint or meal after work without people running around shouting. He also said the new rules can prevent dangers.    Mr Townend said: Letaposs not forget it can also be hazardous. I once picked up a baby who was stood very close to the kitchenaposs swinging door. If I hadnapost have done that, the door could easily swung open and knocked her over. We donapost take steps like this lightly but the issue has been getting worse recently so we felt like something needed to be done. Thereaposs a reasonable level of behaviour we expect from all of our customers regardless of their age. He added that staff have been told to let parents know about the newly enforced rules when they enter, so they can make an informed decision as to whether they would like to stay or go where. He stressed children are still very much welcome in the pub, providing they abide by the rules, adding that the Hen and Chicken is still an important part of the local community. Mum-of-one Jojo Carpenter supports the pubaposs decision. The -year-old said: I think this is absolutely fair enough. Theyaposre basically saying that itaposs really a pub for adults and thataposs fine, I just wouldnapost take my child there. I actually prefer it when establishments are clear and this sign is very clear. Thereaposs nothing worse than walking into a pub with kids and feeling unwelcome, despite the fact there are kidsapos menus on the tables. I would much rather places are upfront like this.    But there are also parents who believe the pub is acting unreasonably. Mum-of-two Emma Grimshaw said: I think the thing about the hours is fair enough but the rest is just totally unrealistic. Thereaposs no way you can get a child to sit down for the whole time, putting that pressure on parents is unfair. How many adults sit down the whole time theyaposre there  And also, did the owners sit still when they were kids  I bet they didnapost. Either ban kids entirely or let kids be kids, they canapost make up ridiculous rules like this. Also letaposs not forget kids arenapost the only ones who are noisy in pubs - students, stag dos and birthday parties all give them a good run for their money. Local pubs cafes and restaurants are meant to be for the whole community, but these new rules goes against that.On Facebook , Natasha Shaddick also shared her disapproval writing: Glad Iaposm not the only one pretty shocked by this!!

Bimbo, one of Blackheathaposs beloved donkeys in South East London, was found bleeding on his side on Friday by one of his minders. The wound has since become infected and the old donkey has taken a ‘turn for the worse’ in past few days, his owner Lorayne Ahmet said. The oldest in the herd, Bimbo is in a state of shock and has contracted laminitis - inflammation of the soft tissue structures in the foot. Lorayne Ahmet visited Bimbo after one of his minders raised the alarm. She said: “I cut back the hair surrounding the wound and found a straight cut. It could have only been from a kne. “I felt sick when I saw the wound. Who could do this to a donkey ”    “I called the vet and she confirmed Bimbo had been stabbed.” Lorayne looks after the group of donkeys in memory of her father Len Thorne who died in . Len had run rides on Blackheath, near Greenwich park in London for  years as part of a family tradition dating back to the s. Lorayne, who is awaiting Bimbo’s blood test results, said: “I call him the Victor Meldrew of the donkey world. He is always on his own and looks grumpy, but never is. “Dad would have been devastatedhe knew what had happened to Bimbo. He was his favourite and led him at his funeral. “He was doing really well until yesterday. He is now very subdued and in a lot of pain. He spends all day in the corner with a ‘lay off’ look on his face. “He won’t eat his antibiotics so we are having to manually syringe them into his system.”    The herd had lived for nearly  years in a field surrounded by six foot fences.But in  they were moved on after then Mayor of London Boris Johnson decided to build the Greenwich Equestrian Centre on the spot as an Olympic legacy.The donkeys are now in a field in Eltham, south east London, with shorter fences which leave the herd open to outsiders. Lorayne said: “The shorter fences was dad’s main worry when we were moved on from Shooters Hill. “Most of the donkeys are quite shy, but Bimbo is domesticated so I think that’s why they went for him. “There have been a few stabbings in Eltham of late and I have seen youths messing around with the donkeys. I think one of them could have stabbed Bimbo as a gang initiation task. “I’d like to get my hands on them, put them in a field and let the general public do what they want with them.    “Anyone who harms an animal, child or elderly person needs to be locked away and the key thrown away.” Lucy Morris, the donkey minder who found bimbo, has set up a go fund me campaign to cover the vet bills and install taller fences around the field. It has raised more than £. Loyrane added: “I am overwhelmed by people’s comments and donations and I thank them from the bottom of the heart. “My dad would have been delighted that people remembered him and his donkeys.” Loyrane reported the incident to the police and is waiting for them to get back to her.

But they could be indicators of a food intolerance - and simply by cutting something out of your diet could improve your health and well-being. Experts have now come up with the six most common symptoms that show your body is reacting to a particular food you eat. Often confused with allergies, food intolerances are completely dferent. Symptoms can take up to  hours to present themselves and can y in severity from person to person.    Dr Gill Hart, Biochemist and Scientic Director at YorkTest Laboratories, said: “A food intolerance can occur when your body has trouble digesting certain foods. “When this happens over time, large protein particles from food can enter the blood stream. The immune system sometimes sees these particles as a threat and produces antibodies to ‘attack’ them. “Your body’s immune system responds by creating inflammation. It’s this inflammation which can trigger symptoms which,left untreated, can develop over time and may cause symptoms.” Here are six signs you may have a food intolerance.    . Tiredness or fatigue The most common cause of tiredness is lack of sleep but science has shown food and drink can have a big impact on your energy levels.Dr Hart said: “Many people associate food intolerances with digestive issues such as bloating and irritable bowel syndrome .“However, fatigue and low energy are also symptoms of a food intolerance. “In fact, one in five people who came to YorkTest for testing last year did so because they were experiencing tiredness.” . Itchy skin or eczemaFood intolerances can also contribute to skin related complaints, Dr Hart says. She added: “If you are experiencing prolonged bouts of itchy skin without an obvious cause, it could be a good idea to look at your diet. “People who tend to develop eczema are categorised as being ‘atopic’, which means they have an overactive immune system, causing their skin to easily become inflamed. “If there is something you are eating which is causing inflammation in the body, there is a possibility that this can impact your skin, meaning maintaining an eczema-friendly diet could be key in managing flare-ups.”  . IBS symptoms Symptoms of irritable bowel syndromeinclude abdominal pains, excess wind, bloating and constipation. IBS can be triggered by certain foods which irritate the digestive system and can also be a symptom of food intolerance. Dr Hart said: “Studies have found that irritable bowel is linked to a hypersensitive gut and many people find relief through eliminating certain foods from their diet.”  . Joint pain Do you have general aches and pains that can’t be explained by an underlying condition It might be wise to look at what you are eating. Dr Hart said: “If you experience general joint pain it might be worth considering what part your diet has to play because a food intolerance could be contributing to these problems.”According to the Arthritis Association, what you eat can cause inflammation in the body and joints, which can lead to pain.They say foods that can cause inflammation include sugar, saturated fats and trans fats, which is found in foods such as pizza and cheese.  . Anxiety If you constantly feel anxious it could be worth taking a look at what youaposre putting in your body. Dr Hart said: “Research has shown that gastrointestinal inflammation, one of the most frequent symptoms of food intolerance, is frequently found in those showing signs of depression and anxiety. “The relationship between the gut and mental health is often bi-directional.This means thatyou’re feeling depressed the health of your digestive system is likely to suffer, andyou’re having gastro troubles the chance of experiencing depression and anxiety increases. “Reactions to foods y a great deal from person to person and an ingredient which may cause problems for one person might be fine for another. “We call this our personal ‘food fingerprint’, and this is why food intolerances can be so dficult to pinpoint without help.”  . MigrainesMigraines are throbbing, intense headaches which can also be accompanied by nausea, vomiting and sensitivity to light, noise or smell.The University of York conducted a survey to understand the benefits of elimination diets based on the results of a food intolerance test. Out of  people who reported experiencing migraines,  per cent reported an improvement having removed their ‘trigger’ foods.

The former Army major describes the ,-mile journey as his “crowning glory”, beginning in Kurdistan before moving through Iraq, Yemen, Syria, Jordan, Palestine, Israel and Lebanon. IS was in control of large parts of Iraq and Syria during his six months in the region. He witnessed the shocking scenes of cities in ruins, broken families and then sailed on waters targeted by pirates.  Wood, , famed for documentaries on walks in the Himalayas, the Americas and from Russia to Iran, said: “Going through Iraq, we were embedded with the militia groups who were fighting against IS. “It was the last few weeks of the war. At that point, we didn’t know it but the Iraqi forces were winning.” The ex-Para added: “I had fought in Afghanistan and travelled to lots of war zones but this felt like all the wars packed into two days because it was so intense. t felt like I was on some strange Hollywood set.  We were driving through bombed-out towns and villages, and it didn’t feel quite real – especially with the black flags of IS flying. “I did feel fairly safe but there was always a chance I might die.” His scary exploits were filmed for a Discovery Channel documentary, Arabia With Levison Wood, and he believes there are signs of hope for the future. He said: “To see these villages being liberated, with women and children running out and thanking Iraqi troops for saving them, was amazing.” Wood met Iraqi sniper Abu Tahsin al-Salhi, who shot more than  IS soldiers, but then Wood found out he had been killed, aged , on the last day of the war.  “That brought it home how dangerous it was out there,” he said.Another character he came across was a Bedouin nomad, who lives in a cave and is illiterate. Wood said: “But we’re still friends on Facebook – as we communicate using only emojis.Isn’t that fantastic ” What struck him was how some people try to get on with their lives, “not caring about politics or religion”. He had to leave Yemen becausehe went further West there was a likelihood of a drone strike by the Saudis.  Wood explained: “We got on a fishing boat over the Arabian Sea – the most heavily pirated waters in the world. It was basically a floating matchbox for five days, which was terrying. “You don’t know who the bad guys are. The police chief might be organising piracy, the local governor might be the leader of al-Qaeda, or the head of the army might fund terrorists.” He realised many of the IS soldiers that the Iraqis were fighting were from other countries, including Britain.

Laura Hood claimed innocent cabbie Haroon Yousaf launched a sex attack as he drove her home from a night out in Manchester with her friends. Hood, who got in the car alone, claimed the then -year-old married father took a detour during the journey, pulled into a side street and raped her. But the jury saw through her  allegation and today the -year-old was found guilty of perverting the course of justice.  She had maintained for more than two-and-a-half years that she had been attacked by a taxi driver before she finally accepted at her trial last week that it could not have happened. But she continued to deny the allegation against her and said she was innocent because she had not knowingly lied, and instead had a  belief of something so clear in my head. However, a consultant forensic psychiatrist saw Hood, of Stockport, as part of the case, and concluded there was no medical or psychiatric explanation for her belief. A jury at Manchester Minshull Street Crown found Hood guilty by a - majority verdict after deliberating for more than six hours. Shortly after being dropped off home following a night out, Hood hysterically told her mother she had been sexually assaulted and then informed police she was attacked in the back of a black cab in a side-street.  Her version of events fell apart when a tracker device fitted to the cab showed the vehicle made no detours apart from when Hood jumped out briefly to use a cash machine. Prosecutor Geoff Whelan said Mr Yousaf, could have found himself on trial for rape without the tracker data from the early hours of January , . Mr Yousaf was kept in custody for  hours after he was arrested at a taxi rank that evening. A second man was also arrested as he drove a taxi with a similar registration number. He spent some  hours in custody. Both suspects provided intimate samples as part of the investigation before they were later told no further action would be taken, jurors were told. In a witness statement read to the court, Mr Yousaf said: It still affects me in my day-to-day le. I donapost knowI will ever come back fully from this.  Before this incident I was a strong person. However Iaposm now negative and worry that things can go wrong. This is the most disgusting thing that anyone can be accused of. When I pick up single female passengers I always worry that something could happen again. The married father said he had tears in my eyes when he had to take his clothes off in front of a stranger and provide a sample in custody. He added: I donapost think this female really understands what she has done and how it has affected my le. The court heard how Hood maintained she had been raped despite being confronted with the vehicle tracker data. She also kept to her story when it was revealed Mr Yousaf was aged  at the time - and not in his s as she had described - and he had a full beard when she said her attacker had no facial hair. No forensic evidence gathered showed any physical contact between Mr Yousaf and the defendant.  Giving evidence, Hood said le was absolutely fine before she made the complaint, having started a new relationship and a new job in human resources for a legal company. She described how she got into a real state after losing her phone on a night out with friends in Manchester city centre and decided to get a taxi home alone. She tearfully recalled how she went on to be examined by a doctor at a sexual assault referral centre, which she described as awful. Hood said she had absolutely no idea how male DNA found on her underwear was not conclusively connected to any named person in the court case. Accepting there was no explanation for her belief, she said: I wish I knew. I wish I could explain why something so clear in my head ... obviously it canapost be true. The Crown said Hood had stuck with her lies for so long and events had snowballed. Hood leaned forward in the dock and held her head in her hands following the verdict. Thanking the jury, Judge Julie Warburton said: It is quite apparent to me that it has not been easy for any of you.Hood, of Onslow Road, was bailed until August  for a pre-sentence report and cried as she exited the courtroom. Before she left, the judge told her: Adjourning the case for a report should not be taken as any indication that there will be not be a custodial sentence in this case. It is a very serious matter. Detective Constable Laura Hughes of GMP’s Police Protection Investigation Unit said: “Hood put a completely innocent man through a dreadful ordeal. “She showed a complete lack of regard for how her  accusation would affect him and remained emotionless when police confronted her with irrefutable evidence that she was making the whole thing up. “She has wasted the time of specialist police officers and detectives who could have been dedicating their efforts to solving real crimes and supporting real victims. “Rape and sexual offences are among the most intrusive and le-changing crimes to become a victim of. Clearly, Hood thought that they could be treated as something trivial, and made a  report on whim. “The real victim here was the taxi driver and I hope he finds some closure with today’s verdict.” "},{"url":null,"title":"bride 34 bridesmaids side dream","story":"NewsBride had  bridesmaids by her side at dream beach weddingCasme Carter said she was blown away by how well the women bonded as she married Gary Carter - who had  groomsmenShareCommentsByDanya BazaraaNews Reporter:,  JUN Updated:,  JUN NewsThey had  guests at their wedding \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email A bride who had  bridesmaids by her side on her wedding day says aposevery lady was handpickedapos.It may seem like a large bridal party to most, but Casme Carter said she would have had sheaposd had more time to plan.

Most of the time we just end up scrunching the thing into a ball and shoving it into a cupboard or drawer until next time the bed needs changing. However, weaposll now be able to put the sheet away properly and itaposs all thanks to an Australian woman named Kris.   Kris, who works at Adairs in the Pacic Fair Shopping Centre in Queensland, was recently the star of a video on the storeaposs Facebook page.In the clip, which has been viewed more than , times, she shows viewers a quick and easy way to neatly fold a fitted sheet. And she does it in several easy to follow steps. Kris starts by telling people watching at home that sheaposs going to take them back to basics before getting into the technique.  Hereaposs a look at how she does it: . The first step sees you put a hand inside two corners of the shorter side of the sheet and place the whole thing down on a flat surface. . Then, take your hands out and place your fingers on the outside corners at the other end of the sheet and push them inside out. . Next, with your fingers still on the inside of those corners, match the ends up by tucking them inside each other. . The fourth step involves gathering the ends of the elastic, corner to corner before picking the sheet up through the middle and shaking it out.    . After this, place your right hand into the right corner of the sheets and tuck your left hand over the other corner. Lay it down on a flat surface again - by now it should be forming a nice rectangle shape. . Take one side of the sheet and foldways into the middle, repeat with the other side, before folding over the other way two or three times to make a neat square of sheets. Written down it sounds much more complicated than it actually is, so make sure to watch Kris demonstrating the technique before you give it a go!Have you got a household hack to share  Email yourmirror@mirror"},{"url":null,"title":"moment corpse found bear den","story":"NewsMoment corpse found in bear den where animal dragged him to eat speaks to rescuersWARNING - GRAPHIC IMAGES: Alexander is said to be suffering from a broken spine and had to drink his own urine to survive in the bear pitShareCommentsByWill Stewart:,  JUN Updated:,  JUN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video man-dragged-bear-den-miraculously-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, subsets :[,,,,,],bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, subsets :[,,,,,],bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA severely wounded man described as a “speaking mummy” has been rescued from a bear den where an animal had dragged him to eat, according to reports. The man, named only as Alexander, was found by hunting dogs roughly one month after he was overpowered by the predator in Russia’s remote Tuva region, it has been claimed. The emaciated man was rushed to hospital where he was diagnosed with a broken spine from his fight with the brown bear, say reports. He told doctors a large predator had overpowered him.    “The bear preserved me as food for later,” he is reported to have said. The footage has not been independently veried by the Mirror. He drank his own urine to survive, he said. Medics say it is a “miracle” that he is alive. A group of Russian hunters claim to have found Alexander after their dogs barked and refused to move on from a bear den they passed in the forest in mountainous Tuva. The region is favoured by Vladimir Putin for vacations.    The hunters checked inside the lair and saw what they believed was a human mummy - until they released he was alive. “The man remembers his first name but not his age and was reportedly in the den for around one month - drinking urine to survive,” reported The Siberian Times. A hospital video shows the bearded man opening his blue eyes and confirming his first name. He was described as having “severe injuries and rotting tissue” from lying motionless for so long in the den. “Local medics say they cannot explain how the man survived such injuries,” said the report.  The exact location where he was found has not been revealed, nor the name of the hospital where he was treated. A spokesman at the health ministry in Tuva Republic, a region in southern Siberia, said: “We cannot confirm the case happened in Tuva. “It was not registered by the Ministry of Health, the Emergencies Ministry or any other official body . “Most probably, it happened somewhere outside Tuva.” The man was spoken to by medical staff in Russian rather than the local Tuvan language. Brown bears are known to hide their prey andto feast on it later.

Especially here, where they have an extensive menu dedicated to them categorised by flavour and even offer “cocktail experiences” for those looking to learn from their mixologists. Our waiter recommended a real fruit mocktail with lots of real crushed fruit and berries and juices to provide a thirst quenching mix without the alcohol .We relaxed into the quiet and sipped our drinks in the sun as we pondered over the vast menu options.The venue’s interior is a mix of classic wooden floors with soft leathers and muted tartans in greys and brown, combining traditional charm with modern comfort. vw, px\"  The menus are bound in heavy leather books, and there was plenty of choice.My other half ordered bruschetta to startwhich, of course, we ended up sharing. Well, I am eating for two!Who knew that three simple slices of toasted bread with oils and tomato could be so delicious  Also, both of us were pretty in awe of the little yellow tomatoes – spot the uncultured pair.I toyed with the idea of my usual steak pie-pick and even deliberated a fish dish, but in the end we both went for the same main course of chicken tikka curryand it was presented beautully.The plate held rice and naan with a small dish of mango chutney and a large dish of gorgeously bright-coloured chicken tikka.The chicken was wonderfully soft and the tikka sauce was full of flavour, not too salty with just a bit of zing. vw, px\"  I’m notoriously soft when it comes to anything spicy, but this was just enough for me and I only needed water for my tingly lips towards the end of finishing the plateful.We were both equally surprised at the portion size from the Caird. Although it felt upmarket, there was no scrimping on the food.I chose the brownie for dessert and my partner the sticky toffee pudding . Again, both platefuls looked almost too good to eat.My dark chocolate brownie was topped with drizzled caramel sauce next to a scoop of vanilla ice cream with sprinkles of crushed chocolate and chocolate sauce. Strawberries and homemade fudge was presented to the side in a design with shards of wafer and small dollops of salted caramel and strawberry mousse. It sounds like a lot of flavours and it was, but in a good way.My partner’s slab of sticky toffee pudding was also teamed with a large scoop of ice cream, crushed chocolate, a large wafer and a couple of raspberries, sprinkled with icing sugar.We both finished the lot.The whole evening was lovely and relaxing. We could hear the live musicians in the bar from where we were seating which provided great listening.

I want to be successful.“Last year was a struggle for me on a personal level but I am excited to be producing at the right end of the league with Aberdeen and winning games.”The full-back is McInnes’ sixth signing of the summer following the capture of Ryan Hedges, Curtis Main, Ash Taylor, Craig Bryson and Jon Gallagher .McInnes had been keen to secure a third loan deal for Derby’s Max Lowe but that the left-back looks like remaining at Pride Park.Celtic have made an approach to talk to Derby about capturing Lowe and Rangers are also interested in the -year-old.The managerial position at Derby also complicated matters with Rams boss Frank Lampard set to be named new Cha manager.Leigh is set to make his Dons’ debut in Saturday’s friendly against Connah’s Quay Nomads of Wales at the Fota Island resort in Cork.It is the first friendly of the pre-season as the build up to the Euro clash with RoPS steps up.Leigh admits playing in Europe was a major draw in joining the Dons.He said: “Every player wants to play at the highest level and Europe is an attraction for me.“I am excited to get going.”Leigh will have a year left on his NAC Brada contract when his loan deal expires at the end of the season.There is an option at the end of the loan to make the deal permanent and he is open to that.On a potential permanent move he said: “It is definitely a possibility to look at in the future.”Leigh spent more than ten years with English Champions Manchester City and made his debut for the senior side during a pre-season tour in the UAE against Al Ain in .That summer he also featured for City in friendly games against Dundee, Hearts and Sporting Kansas City.Manager McInnes said: “We’ve been aware of Greg for a while.“When it looked as though Maxwas staying at Derby, he was someone we were quite far down the road with.“He’s versatile, gives us a bit of athleticism, has decent experience for someone with his best years ahead of him and he sees Aberdeen as the right move at this stage.“There were a number of clubs in England keen to take Greg but I felt he bought into what we’re trying to do early on in our

while playing for the Reds, on loan from Watford, against St Mirren on February .The -year-old is undergoing his rehab privately with a physio following surgery and his release by the English Premier League Hornets.But the Evening Express reported yesterday that Aberdeen boss Derek McInnes has offered Hoban the chance to complete his recovery at Pittodrie.The Dons gaffer has previously said he would be interested in signing Hobanhe was a free agent and fully fit.Devlin believes it would be beneficial for the Republic of Ireland under- international to step up his battle back to fitness in the Granite City – and that’s because he has done the same.Aberdeen signed Devlin from Hamilton Accies in January  when he was still recovering from an ACL injury sustained in May .The -year-old completed his rehab with the Dons before making his debut last July in Europa League against English Premier League Burnley.Devlin remains grateful to McInnes and the Reds for signing him during his recovery and allowing him to get back to fitness at Pittodrie.He said: “I think it was huge for me to do my rehab here.“When I spoke to the gaffer he stressed the importance of that.“I bought into that and was able to come and work under the medical staff, the gaffer and the boys.“It meant I could see what they were all about and when I came back for pre-season I felt ready to go.“It meant I wasn’t trying to settle in during pre-season and that was really important for me.“It was a big step and that’s something I’ll always owe the gaffer for.“He took me in and gave me that opportunity and I’ll always owe him for taking that gamble on me.“Every day I’m at the club I’ll try to repay that faith he showed in me.”Devlin was on the pitch when Hoban, who also ruptured an ACL in training with Watford in , was injured against the Buddies and tried to support him in the immediate aftermath.He saysHoban needs any advice during his recovery he will be happy to help.And Devlin would recommend doing his rehab with the medical staff at Pittodrie after they helped get him back to fitness a year ago.The man who was called into the Scotland squad for Euro qualiers against Cyprus and Belgium earlier this month added: “I tried to support Tommie when he went down with that injury on the pitch.“When it happened I had a feeling I knew what it was.“I’ve been there twice before and I wouldn’t

An implementation plan was produced in December  to cover the years -. Who in Argyll and Bute is responsible for this plan  How many of the outcomes have been achieved As someone who has been involved with autism personally and professionally for many years, I find it extremely disappointing there seems to be an inability by those in authority to get organised enough to address the issues and provide services for autistic people and their families.There is no need for further drafts and consultations.Someone in the authority needs to take responsibility for the existing strategy and implementation plan and get on with it.Maureen Mackintosh, Ardrishaig.Sir,Scotland’s small building firms had a strong start to , in contrast to the UK construction small and medium sized enterprisesector, according to the Federation of Master BuildersScotland.The FMB State of Trade Survey for the first quarter of , the only quarterly assessment of the UK-wide SME construction sector, showed SME workloads declined for the first time in six years.In Scotland, however, there was a jump of  per cent compared with the previous quarter. Thirty per cent of weighted responses were positive, up from  per cent from the fourth quarter of .It is encouraging the Scottish construction industry is bucking the wider Brexit trend with workloads and enquires in rude health. The UK-wide picture is very dferent, with the construction SME sector overall contracting for the first time in six years.Scotland’s good fortune could be due to fewer EU workers being based north of the border compared with other parts of the country, like in London where one in three construction workers are from the EU.Relying less heavily on migrant workers has meant the Scottish construction industry hasn’t fallen foul of thousands of EU workers ing home during the long march to Brexit due to no longer feeling welcome in the UK or sure of their future here.Scotland’s builders, however, must not be complacent. Looking ahead, the First Minister has indicated thatthe UK does leave the EU later this year, she wants a second independence referendum before the next Scottish Parliament election in . This additional political uncertainty, on top of the continued uncertainty stemming from Brexit, could impact on the construction sector in Scotland.The fear is a looming second referendum could test consumer confidence this year and next. For construction SMEs, this is particularly concerning as their prospects are vulnerable to dips in consumer confidence as so much work comes from the private domestic sector.Gordon Nelson, Director of FMB Scotland.Sir,I was joined by my fellow Conservative councillors in Kilmory recently as we discussed atthe numerous challenges facing Argyll and Bute.Ferry sailings, roads, education and the SNP#s late single farm payments were all mentioned.With the SNP hammering local authority spending and cutting our budgets, challenges in delivering services will become more prevalent.Despite this climate of cuts from the separatists, Conservative councillors are delivering for Argyll.

There will also be opportunities for farming and we must ensure that we make the most of these opportunities to build a forward-looking, progressive and resilient sector that benefits farmers and consumers throughout the UK.We would like to invite all UK MEPs on to farms in their local areas to discuss a range of priority issues and to answer any questions that they might have.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"monsters and magic come to lochgilphead booksigning","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead#s Argyll Book Centre is holding a book signing with Lari Don.The Secret of the Kelpie author will be in the indie book shop on Saturday June  to read her new book to eager ears and talk to readers about their favourite folk tales and inventing monsters.After a quick break, Lari willto read excerpts from her spellbinding Spellchasers trilogy to inspire you to imagine magical adventures of your own and tell one of your favourite myths.Born in Chile, Lari Don was brought up in Scotland where she has worked in politics and for the BBC.

beating some of the countryrsquos leading amateur golfers, and was twice a winner of the Thorburn Cup.He was the le and soul of the party and was a stalwart of the old clubhouse bar, enjoying more than a few beers, debates and the celebratory filling of his many trophies.Many members will have their own fantastic memories and stories of their times with Kenny, in battles on the course and nights out in the bar and he will be very fondly remembered by the crop of juniors and kids growing up at the club in the early s.He was a very welcome guest to the club on his trips home with his we

regions first Premier Inn.And now that developers have dropped controversial proposals to include a new supermarket, the plans are being given the thumbs up from David Parker.Mr Parker, who represents Leaderdale and Melrose at the local authority, told us: \"I am pleased that Newland Assets have listened carefully to the representations they have received concerning the Borders Gateway proposals.\"A Class  food retail store was very much against local and national planning policy for the site in Tweedbank as it introduced out of town shopping but the developer has listened carefully to ious concerns on this issue and removed it.ldquoThe new proposals have taken on board many observations made so far during the planning process and the revised plans are better in terms of design, road layout and visual impact.\"I am very excited about the economic impact this development could have on the wider Borders economy.ldquoSecuring a Premier Inn for the Scottish Borders will help put our region firmly on the tourism map and the economic impact of Premier Inn and the potential for other investors to follow them, is something which must be grasped.ldquoThe revised Borders Gateway proposals will complement the work taking place to develop the Tweedbank Innovation Park and will sit comfortably alongside the public and private sector projects which are underway at Tweedbank at present.\"The pound million Borders Gateway development also includes a BP filling station, a Costa drive-thru coffee shop, and a MS kiosk.And it is expected that the new outlets will create up to  jobs.Although the wider vision of the development had been welcomed, the supermarket part of the plans had come in for criticism.And Newland Assets revised their plans to omit the supermarket earlier this year.Councillor Parker added: ldquoBorders Gateway has the overwhelming support of the public and many businesses in the area and now that the food retail plans have been dropped there is no reason why these proposals should not be fully endorsed by the planners and backed by Scottish Borders Council.\"The economic advantages of this proposal signicantly outweigh the very small number of policy considerations which are left.ldquoAlthough it was right for the planners to raise concerns about the previous proposal, now that the developer has listened carefully to all the objections and amended the plans accordingly to deal with them, the Borders public simply wonrsquot understand why the council isnrsquot backing this ambitious inward investment opportunity.\"It will help bring new jobs and secure existing jobs and undoubtedly lead to a tourism boost in the Scottish Borders.ldquoI look forward to this development receiving approval and work commencing on

including  around the Eildon area.Among the identied playparks to be decommissioned are  in Galashiels - Balnakiel Terrace, Broom Drive, Croft Street, Kingsknowe, Lee Brae, Netherbank, Roger Quin Gardens, Rosebank Place, Sykes Acre, Waverley Place and Woodlea - four in Earlston - Acorn Drive, Everest Road, Gun Road and Summerfield - four in Selkirk - Bannerfield small park, Fairfield Crescent, Heatherlie Park and Rosebank Quarry - and three in Melrose at Eildon View, Fairways and Priors Walk.Playparks in Darnick, Fountainhall, Gattonside, Lauder, Newstead and Newtown St Boswells are also facing the chop.Opposition councillor Stuart Bell, who represents Tweeddale East, said: ldquoParents tell us that ndash particularly for small children ndash they value small local facilities where the kids donrsquot have to cross busy roads, and parents can keep an eye on them.ldquoThese parents have a right to be consulted on any changes.Council leader Shona Haslam has been driving the plans forward.And she believes that the sacrice of smaller playparks will be worth it.Councillor Haslam said: ldquoOur investment means we will have better and bigger facilities but some smaller sites will have to close.ldquoWe have lots of old equipment in unsuitable locations, for example on concrete standings or in areas that flood easily, are often vandalised, or in a poor state of repair ndash and we are discussing with communities what should happen to these.\"We want our playparks to be the best, but that may mean that some of the single swings or roundabouts may have to go."},{"url":null,"title":"selkirk-bids-for-online-stampede-following-website-launch","story":"SELKIRK is hoping to attract a few surfers to explore the Royal Burgh with the launch of a new tourism website.The online site went live recently -

The day after the crash, Superintendent Jim Guy of Strathclyde Police said there had been no evidence from the crew of any problems before the tragedy.He said the evidence available suggested an accident rather than terrorist attack. The scene of the crash was sealed off almost immediately and an air exclusion zone was imposed.Although most of the wreckage was left for accident investigators to examine, it is understood Royal Ulster Constabulary Special Branch officers removed boxes and cases containing secret papers on Friday morning.On Saturday,  personnel from RAF Machrihanish were drafted in to help find and catalogue debris from the crash.FIFTY YEARS AGOKintyre could be surfers# MeccaKintyre could become the major centre in Britain for surfingthe enthusiasm of two young men gets the encouragement it deserves.One of them, George Raynes, of Bishopbriggs in Lanarkshire, is secretary of the Scottish Surf Club, and with his treasurer, James Short of Glasgow, has just completed a preliminary survey of several of the Kintyre beaches with a view to exploiting them for the sport of surfing.George has surfed on beaches all over Britain and also in the Channel Isles and in Europe and he thinks that the beaches at Machrihanish and Southend could become the Mecca for British surfers and the venue for the British Championships.He was particularly impressed with the waves at Machrihanish but thinks Southend has great potential as well.He told the Courier: #The possibilities here are tremendous. These beaches are essentially accessible from the central belt of Scotland, in fact from all over Britain when one considers the air service, and the weather records show that there is plenty of sunshine and the water is warm compared to the waters off the east coast of England, for example.#In fact, I#ve been told that Kintyre topped the sunshine league in Britain last year.#The water is so warm, comparatively speaking, that the sport could become an all-year-round activity in this area. In the winter one would have to wear a wetsuit, of course, but the conditions are ideal and the wave forms have great potential # after all, they are coming straight in from the Atlantic over the north of Ireland.#What I#d like to see is a surf club established in Campbeltown. It could become a great asset from a tourist and amenity point of view.#And any Kintyre people who really took up the sport would have a great advantage over other surfers when it comes to competition because they have the benefit of readily available beaches all year round.#If this club gets going, the chances are that the British surf champions in the years to come will be Kintyre people.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOOrr Ewing CupFootballers were favoured with beautul weather last Saturday and the games played on Kinloch Park in the Orr Ewing Cup competition brought together very large gatherings of spectators.The match in the afternoon was brought to a sudden termination by an unfortunate dispute over the award of a goal. The opposing teams were Kintyre and HMS Thames.Kintyre opened strongly and after  minutes# play had scored twice. The dispute arose over the award of the second goal, which Thames claimed to be offside.The referee, Mr Duncan McCallum, an old Hearts player, was of a dferent opinion, and on his allowing Kintyre the goal, the naval team without more do walked off the field.It is understood that the Thames team intimated to the league at the weekly meeting on Monday night their withdrawal from the competition.The teams were: Kintyre # Jas McKinlay: James Black and Archd Sharp: M Muir, A McCrank and T Cameron: R McGeachy and D Brown: Dan McNaughton: N Scally and J Donaldson.HMS Thames # Meese: Jesseman and Love: McCloud, Hirst and Fernie: Dunnell and Weekes: McGeachy: Slynn and Segrott.Referee # Mr D McCallum.In the evening, the opposing teams were Campbeltown and Kilbrannan. A week previously Kilbrannan had inflicted a - win over a naval team: against Campbeltown on Saturday they found the tables turned on themselves, and with the same score repeated they had to suffer the chagrin of a five-goal margin.It was hard game, but high scoring seldom adds to the vim or interest of any match and so it was here.Campbeltown from the kick-off may be fairly said to have had the measure of their opponents, but while they were the better , on play there was nothing like a - goal margin between the teams.Campbeltown owed their comfortable lead mainly to the masterly play of their centre forward, Archd O#May. This young footballer was home on furlough from the Rhine Army, and his display was undoubtedly the feature of the game. He is a fearless player with a rare turn of speed and a most deadly shot.At least three of six goals came from his foot, and were beautully taken, while he was the means of a fourth which he gave the right wing the honour of finishing.Kilbrannan#s solitary goal was well taken by Brown after a clever break through and an inidual run.Kilbrannan has material for the making of a team that should get much better results than they have so far achieved.The players are keen and inidually have a lot of football in them, but an almost entire absence of method both in attack and defence spoils their chances.The teams were: Campbeltown # A McCallum: G Quigley and Chas McKinven: D Kelly, J McDonald and John Martin: Chas Black and Arch Black: Arch O#May: W McKillop and James Martin.Kilbrannan # John McIntyre: D Bannatyne and Wm Gilchrist: J Short, N McKenzie and James Boyce: D Gilchrist and M Brodie: C Kelly: D Mathieson and J Brown.Referee # Mr W Mustarde."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week june 7 2019","story":"As I retreat into the comfort of a warm house and an even warmer coffee, I wonder what it must have been like for Columba and his fellow monks as they made their way from the shores of Ireland to the wilds of Argyll.The fragile shell of a coracle was not the most effective shelter against the wildness of our coastline.Yet they came.

There are several factors influencing this, but the major factor which has tipped the balance is the extended funding hours and the negative impact this is having both financially on small businesses, like Mary Poppins, and to the quality of early learning and childcare.New Scottish Government policy instructs councils to increase their funded childcare hours from  to , by . This move also includes longer opening hours and a move from term time to year-round opening hours to attempt to make childcare more nationally accessible.Ms Dewar said: ldquoThe money received for funded places does not cover the costs of providing the quality of early learning and childcare which we want and are required to provide, especially with regards to staff costs.ldquoThe timescales and measures that the Scottish Government has put in place to educate a workforce to meet the increased requirements are insufficient, and there is a serious shortfall to meet the requirements of the extended funding.ldquoEast Lothian Council indicated it estimated it would require approximately  staff to facilitate the increase in funded hours in East Lothian. The majority of these posts are early learning and childcare practitioners.ldquoThe local authority advertises early learning practitioner posts at between pound. and pound. per hour. Private nurseries are unable to compete with these rates of pay due to the funding rates we are allocated.A group of parents and staff, including Ms Dewar, are visiting county MSP Iain Gray to discuss the problems, but Ms Dewar added that unless he can ldquowork a miracle and change the policy, then it is unlikely the decision to close the nursery will be reversed.When asked about the nursery, Mr Gray said: ldquoThe loss of any nursery provision is disappointing, particularly with the Governmentrsquos , funded hours policy set to be implemented next year.ldquoIn the case of the Mary Poppins Nursery, the owner has highlighted a number of factors that have contributed to their decision to close.ldquoI have written to East Lothian Council about some of these issues.ldquoHowever, there are also wider issues at play here. The nursery sector has been warning the Scottish Government that private nurseries are struggling in the run-up to the roll-out of its flagship , policy from August .ldquoMinisters must act quickly to address the sectorrsquos concerns and ensure that the capacity exists to deliver the funded hours next year.A Scottish Government spokesperson said: ldquoIt is, of course, concerning to hear of any nursery considering closure, and the obvious effects this might have on staff, parents and children.ldquoEast Lothian Council has provided assurance that they will support families to find alternative early learning and childcare places for children who had been expecting to use the Mary Poppins Nursery from this August.Ms Dewar added: ldquoI am distraught that circumstances have forced me to this decision and that such a wonderful place for children to experience their early years is to close.The decision was met with an outpouring of grief on social media.The nurseryrsquos recent th birthday was marked with a garden party.The nursery was founded by Sue Armstrong, affectionately still called lsquoMiss Suersquo, after she had written to Mary Poppins author P L Travers to askshe could use the name.Miss Sue said: ldquoI received many letters from P L Travers about the nursery.ldquoAt the beginning, she wanted to know what the nursery was going to be like. She had no objection to me using the name, she just wanted to find out more. I ended up meeting her as well.ldquoWe were hoping to get her to come and open the nursery  years ago, but her arthritis was bad. We stayed in touch, however. I would send her letters about how the nursery was getting on along with photos, and she would write back saying how she liked it, and ideas of what to do.ldquoShe said that the children should be encouraged to make up their own stories. lsquoChildren like doing that,rsquo she said.Miss Sue sold the nursery to Ms Dewar in  as she was ldquosick of all the paperwork.She said. ldquoWhen I heard it was to close down, well, itrsquos just all so sad really. Itrsquos such a terrible shame.ldquoIt is such a nice and happy place for the children, homely and warm. Itrsquos just awful that it canrsquot stay open.Miss Sue still attends events at the nursery, dressed as the iconic nanny Mary Poppins.She added: ldquoIn the film, Mary Poppins says that shersquoll stay until the winds change. Well, maybe this is the wind changing for Mary Poppins Nursery.Ward councillor Craig Hoy said: ldquoThe closure of the Mary Poppins Nursery is deeply regrettable but reflects the real pressures the independent sector is experiencing as a result of the SNPrsquos , hours policy.\"The Government faces huge problems to provide the free childcare it has promised.

Five minutes in a car can cover a distance which would represent a fairly long walk.Itrsquos kind of a simple principle, I know, but one I sometimes forget, as I did a couple of weekends ago. We set off from an event at Amisfield Walled Garden for a walk. My idea was to walk along the River Tyne to Hailes Castle and thenndash by car a -minute round trip.We had some supplies in the form of fruit in my bag and a little water. It was a sunny and warm day and so we set off on our adventure.We began the walk at the old Abbey Bridge which spans the Tyne close to Amisfield. As you walk under its ancient ribbed arches of this late medieval bridge, you get a real sense of its age and the beauty of its construction.The path beyond follows the river and it is almost impossible now to imagine that a great abbey once stood here, with connections to the infant Mary Queen of Scots. A ruined old mill of later centuries still stands here. I reflected on the stories of this location: a courageous nun who defied a flood in the th century and a gruesome murder in the th century and just visible in the near distance the old graveyard, now ringed with trees and almost unrecognisable as a resting place for the dead.A labourer once thought he saw a ghost at the graveyard, but it proved to be something , and I had a wry smile at that tale of a drunken evening over  years ago. These are all tales I have already told here, but they entered my head as we wandered to the gate that led along the northern bank of the river.Hailes Castle is on the southern bank of the river and I knew that there was a bridge that would takes us over. So we set off to find the bridge.But it took us over four hours.It was a stunning walk, with wild flowers and trees decorating the riverbank almost all the way. A grey heron seemed to follow us perhaps he was warning us that the walk was longer than Irsquod anticipated.It is a walk decorated with history too, of course. A stone in the corner of the field by the first gate caught my eye. Deeply ingrained groove marks on it intrigued me. I was later told that it could be the marks of a plough, as the tips of the plough have scraped over the stone a ploughman unwittingly leaving evidence of his unrecorded toil.Halfway along the walk we arrived at the small hamlet of Sandyrsquos Mill. The cottages and mill itself have been beautully restored. The th-century mill still has its waterwheel, although itrsquos now embedded in silt. The mill ceased working  years ago and was transformed into a residential property, but with much of the old machinery inside still intact. It appears to be a very sympathetic and sensitive restoration.It was beyond Sandyrsquos Mill that the distance began to take its toll. The young kids were tired and desperately looking for the bridge. I spotted Traprain Law some distance away and realised that I had badly misjudged the distance and time it would take with wee ones. We had to sit and have a rest and story, with that grey heron listening, to gather the energy to continue.The kids didnrsquot complain much as we wandered along the still-beautul path, now desperately looking for the bridge. As we had rested wersquod phoned for friends to come and lsquorescuersquo us at Hailes Castle with chocolate and water, and we knew they were there waiting for us.Irsquove never been quite so pleased to see Hailes Castle. It loomed suddenly from across the river. I had never approached it from this direction and it certainly did its best to impress. The bridge was just a wee way further and we finally crossed it with a sense of relief.When we arrived at the castle, the kids devoured the chocolate and water, in a way that reminded me of a scene in the movie Ice Cold in Alex. Thank goodness for good friends.Wersquod made it and what a sense of adventure ndash and an achievement!I sat with the kids and told stories as my we went with the friends to retrieve our car. Hailes Castle drips with history but they wanted tales about giants.The day was a lesson for me: to think more carefully about distance when setting on a walk! I thoroughly recommend the path, especially on a lovely summerrsquos day. But itrsquos going to take half a dayyou have kids. So prepare for that!Unbelievably, the kids later wanted to go to a playpark. ldquoWhere do they get the energy  my we asked.ldquoFrom us! I replied!"},{"url":null,"title":"hopes-of-seeing-railway-station-return-to-haddington","story":"RAGESmet with Peter Brett Associates ndash a leading consultancy of engineers and planners ndash to outline the case for improved transports links to and from East Lothian.One of the more ambitious plans was to see theof a railway station to Haddington.Residents of the town have not been served by a railway station since , with the station closing to freight nearly  years later.However, RAGES feels there could still be a possibility of a station ing to the town ndash though the group acknowledged that work needed to be done.A spokesman for the group said: ldquoRAGES expressed its preference for re-opening of the Haddington branch, ideally to the previous terminus on Station Road.ldquoMinimal compulsory purchase relocation of existing industrial units would be required the biggest physical obstacle would be the reconstruction of the A overbridge which was unwisely built without preserving the railway alignment and loading gauge.ldquoA level crossing would be required at Gateside, failing which an alternative road access could be provided for the new houses on the north side of the line onto the A.There was also a suggestion of creating car parking and even a park and ride facility in the town to serve the new service, which would link the town with Edinburgh.The spokesman added: ldquoAs insufficient parking exists at Station Road , a park and ride station at Oak Tree would be essential, which could also serve the substantial Letham Mains and Gateside developments.ldquoJust east of where the A crosses the railway formation, there is a large rectangular piece of ground, occupied only by scrub, which would be suitable as a car park.ldquoAs only single track would suffice between Longniddry and Haddington, it would be possible to retain a footpath cycleway as the line was originally provided with double track throughout.ldquoAn electric train service from Haddington to Edinburgh would provide the speed and capacity which road transport ndash car or bus ndash cannot match. Frequency should be half-hourly.Councillor Tom Trotter, who represents Haddington, backed the station bid.He said: ldquoIt is a good idea, especially with the town expanding as it is.ldquoIt would be a tremendous asset to have.However, the councillor felt it was more likely the station would have to find a new site, such as Alderston, to the north of the town.He added: ldquoIn the short-term it is unrealistic, but hopefully in the longer term things can be put in place to make it a realistic possibility.ldquoIt is a great idea and Irsquom sure it would get support from all the local ward councillors, but where it would go and how much it would cost are questions."},{"url":null,"title":"preview-prestonpans-gala-2019","story":"This year is the th anniversary of Prestonpans Childrenrsquos Gala.On gala day itself, the festivities kick off with the crowning ceremony at am at Prestonpans Community Centre.There is then a fancy-dress competition at Middleshot Square at noon before the parade heads off through the town.From Middleshot Square, it heads along Hawthorn Road and down West Loan to the war memorial, then along High Street before turning up Redburn Road, then along North Grange Avenue, where it ends at Mary Murray Park, behind the community centre.The park hosts the gala dayrsquos family fun, which includes a funfair with a host of rides, as well as old favourites such as hook the duck.There is also a vintage fire engine on display, as well as an American police car, motorbike displays, ponies, birds of prey, beat the goalie, Zorbs, safe archery, NERF guns, crazy golf, a tombola and a gala raffle, not to mention ice cream vans, tea and coffee, Mr Donut Man, crepes, waffles, hot dogs, nachos, a burger van, La Favorita pizzas, stalls selling gts, sweets and cake.Gala day marks the beginning, not the end of Prestonpansrsquo week of fun and activities.Events are as follows:Saturday, June Monday, June Tuesday, June Wednesday, June Thursday, June Friday, June "},{"url":null,"title":"bid-to-turn-former-rbs-in-north-berwick-into-a-house","story":"The townrsquos Royal Bank of Scotlandclosed in June last year.

A station at Wallyford became a reality in an effort to reduce car commuting.ldquoWith a journey time of around - minutes to Edinburgh, the station quickly became well used and now has around , passenger movements annually ndash that is nearly , per week.ldquoIts situation became ideal for a park and ride operation attracting car drivers from towns not served by rail such as Tranent and where.Alister Hadden, chairman of Wallyford Community Council, recalled how his we Nancy, who was a local community councillor at the time, attended the opening of the station.He said: ldquoWallyford Railway Station is another great asset and addition to Wallyford, with the numbers using it growing each year.ldquoThey are now in the process of extending the railway  to accommodate the commuters using the service.ldquoThe station has also promoted the park and ride car park which has numerous buses going in and out.ldquoMusselburgh Area Partnership, in partnership with Sustrans, is improving the path network to the station for walkers and cyclists alike, making it very accessible from all directions.ldquoWith so many new houses being built around Wallyford, it is a great asset to have in the village."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.comource srcset=/resources/images/9803132.jpg?htype=78\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"the-rocket-man-elton-john-tribute-night-heading-to-kilmarnock","story":"ldquoThe Rocket Man - A Tribute To Sir Elton John will hit the townrsquos Palace Theatre in September as part of a UK-wide tour.Starring singer Jimmy Love as Sir Elton, the star of the upcoming show was spotted this morning at St Pancras International station in London performing a selection of Sir Eltonrsquos greatest hits and promoting the show to an unsuspecting public.Tribute artist Jimmy Love will be providing the Kilmarnock crowd with a fitting homage to the living legend and piano perfectionist.\"@context\": \"https:schema.org\",\"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\"name\": \"Jimmy Love as Elton John\",\"description\": \"Entertainers\",\"thumbnailUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer thumbs maVkhScY-.jpg\",\"uploadDate\": \"--T::+:\",\"duration\": \"PDTHMS\",\"contentUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer manests maVkhScY.mu\",\"embedUrl\": \"https:www.eveningtimes video  \",\"publisher\": \"@type\": \"Organization\",\"name\": \"Evening Times\",\"logo\": \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\"url\": \"https:www.eveningtimes sitelogo \",\"width\": ,\"height\": Jimmy and his band will be belting out classic hits, including ldquoYellow Brick Road, ldquoCrocodile Rock, ldquoPhiladelphia Freedom, ldquoSaturday Nights Alright for Fighting, ldquoYour Song and many more.The show will come off the back of what has been a big year for Sir Elton John, following the release of biopic ldquoRocketman which hit cinemas in May.Directed by Dexter Fletcher and starring Taron Egerton as the singer, the film sees Egertonrsquos take on John go from budding singer to bonafide rock star and culminates in his famous concert at Dodger Stadium in .ldquoThe Rocket Man - A Tribute To Sir Elton John will be at the Palace Theatre, Kilmarnock on September  and Greenockrsquos Beacon Arts Centre on September .

It is a moment for reflection. Heaven knows there is plenty to distract us where. Sofagate, photogate, everything-but-the- blooming-garden-gate: these are times of feast for those who like their politics served up as bread and circuses. But let us turn for five minutes from the clash of cymbals and egos at Westminster and consider where we are,  years on from that July day. To borrow a phrase from Monty Pythonrsquos Le of Brian, what has the Scottish Parliament ever done for us : Top official to stand downOne dference between Scotland then and now is that there is a new television channel on which such questions can be asked. On Tuesday BBC Scotland showed the first of a two part documentary, Children of the Devolution, in which reporter Allan Little toured the country posing the Brian question, albeit in his own elegant way. How strange it was to look back on footage of that day and hear Donald Dewarrsquos ldquoA moment anchored in history speech again, an address that Nicola Sturgeon said was one of the finest in modern Scottish politics. With its quiet sense of pride, its grasp of history and hope for the future, it is a speech that more than passes the test of time. ldquoThis is about more than our politics and our laws, Dewar said. ldquoThis is about who we are, how we carry ourselves. Still sounds great.Dewarrsquos speech was almost too good, for it set up expectations that were always going to be impossible to meet. After the soaring rhetoric came the crash to Earth. Remember the great medal stushie  The poisonous Section  debate  And all the while, minute by minute, the cost of the new Parliament building climbed and its completion was delayed. Initially expected to cost poundm-poundm, the final bill was poundm. Even now, that still has the power to shock.As Little looked at how policy had progressed in areas such as land reform and LGBT rights, there was a sense of jobs being half finished and plenty left untouched. Tackling the obscenity of child poverty, closing the attainment gap, ensuring waiting times for NHS treatment are met, improving transport: anyone looking for things to be fixed in Scotland today would be left with a list as long as the Royal Mile.: Diversity concerns over parliamentWe shall leave that there a moment to ponder something  that arose from Children of the Devolution, apart from the question of what the heck happened to half the male populationrsquos hair .More to the point, when and why did the standard of MSPs and debates fall  How did we get from a time of Dewar and Salmond and Wallace, of passionate debate on issues of real substance, to todayrsquos poorly attended parliament in which little of real import happens outwith Budget day  This week, for example, the news from Holyrood was that no Education Bill ushering in radical change would be introduced because, in the opinion of the Minister, John Swinney, it was no longer needed. Really  So the entire exercise turned out to be just a way of filling time  Distributing colouring-in books to MSPs would have been a lot cheaper. The parliament, moreover, goes into recess from next Monday, ing on September . A nine-week holiday. Now that is a very nice way of marking the th anniversary.: Tories out of touch says SturgeonIt is understandable for Scots today, just as it was  years ago, to look at the Scottish Parliament and wish for something more. As Dewar acknowledged, a Scottish Parliament was not an end but a means to greater ends. One of the most telling moments in Children of the Devolution came when Little went back to his old school in Stranraer to ask pupils for their views on the Scottish Parliament. First reaction seemed to be that they were underwhelmed. But then they thought some more, listing a few of the things that had changed their lives for the better, such as voting at  , and what  they wanted to see done, chief among which was closing the attainment gap.As for the future, most saw themselves leaving the local area. It was the same in Littlersquos day, which he seemed to find disheartening. After all,the Scottish Parliament was about anything it was making Scotland as a whole a better place to live and work. But young people will always want to move where it is part of growing up. What I saw when I looked at the pupils in Stranraer was a generation more comfortable in their skin than I ever was. There is a pride in young Scots that goes deeper than  minutes it is in the bones, and much of that feeling is due to the Scottish Parliament being there.Dewar looked forward to the time when July , , would be seen as a turning point, the day when democracy was renewed in Scotland, when we revitalised our place in this, ldquoour United Kingdom. Whether you agree with those sentiments or not, look at what is happening in Westminster and think how much more dispiriting events would be without the knowledge that Scotland has a parliament of its own, ready and waiting to do more. So yes, let us see that July day  years ago as an occasion worth toasting.As we now know, there are worse things than dreaming big."},{"url":null,"title":"snp-mp-marion-fellows-asks-theresa-may-to-crack-down-on-parents-who-dodge-child-maintenance","story":"SNP MP Marion Fellows raised the issue at Prime Ministerrsquos Questions, as figures showed arrears under the CMS scheme rose by pound. million in a  months.While the agency is meant to ensure parents take responsibility for their children, Ms Fellows said its bark was worse than its bite.Calling for a crackdown on the enforcement of payments, she said \"children are living in poverty because of a lack of maintenance payments.\"The latest DWP figures show CMS arrears rose from pound million to pound. million between December  and March  ndash an increase of pound. million.Between the same months, pound. million was owed under CMSrsquos Collect and Pay servicendash where CMS monitor and pursue collections ndash but only pound. million was paid.A third of all cases assessed under Collect and Pay have paid nothing while the remaining % can only be guaranteed to have ldquopaid some maintenance.While the UK Government introduced new measures to put pressure on deadbeat parents, such as confiscating passports, in December, the DWP predicts that only  passports will be confiscated in the first year.Meanwhile the UK Government wrote off pound. billion of historic CSA arrears last year, and is seeking to wipe out an additional pound. billion instead of moving thee arrears to the new CMS.Responding, Theresa May said the government wanted to ensure parents \"normally, it is fathers, but sometimes it is mothers\", take their responsibilities seriously. She said the system was working better, but that it was a dficult problem which previous government had also struggled to get right.Mrs Fellows added: ldquoThe UK Government has to crack down on enforcing payments to ensure children receive their maintenance rights. New powers are welcome [and] confiscating passports is a start, but it isnrsquot delivering maintenance payments.When charities like Gingerbread say maintenance can lt one in five children out poverty, there needs to be a will to act on the evidence.

crash medic as data shows junior doctors still battling fatigueThe European Court of Justice recently ruled that employers could not claim to be complying with the European Working Time Directive unless they were keeping a record of employees actual hours worked, following a case brought by a Spanish trade union.Mr Connelly has campaigned for tighter rules around sht patterns and working hours since the death in  of his -year-old daughter, Dr Lauren Connelly.Dr Connelly, from East Kilbride, was seven weeks into her training and had just completed the fourth of  consecutive night-shts at Inverclyde Royal Hospital in Greenock when her car crashed off the M motorway as she drove home.Investigators believe she fell asleep at the wheel.Had she completed her run of shts, she would have worked for more than  hours over days without a weekend off.Since then, junior doctors have been banned from working more than seven days in a row and rotas ofseven consecutive night-shts have been abolished.Read more: Official bullying complaints in NHS Scotland exceed However, a key pledge from the Scottish Government to cap junior doctors working week at  hours, without averaging, has yet to be achieved.Currently health boards can comply with the European Working Time Directive by averaging the time staff spend on sht over six months.In , then Health Secretary Shona Robison vowed to ban averaging but in  conceded this was \"unachievable given the need to maintain a good standard of training for doctors and a safe service for patients\".An Expert Working Group was set up to address the problem of achieving a strict -hour working week, but is not expected to report until December this year.Professor Derek Bell, president of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh, said safe rota design should be a priority for hospitals.Prof Bell said: \"Diary monitoring is potentially prone to problems in terms of recording and interpretation, and may be considered sub-optimal.ldquoNHS Scotland could implement a process of exception reporting ndash or alternative robust system - outside and unrelated to the contract of employment, to allow Scottish doctors to have parity of reporting with their colleagues in England.\"Exception reporting already allows doctors in England to quickly and easily flag uptheir actual workload has ied from their agreed work schedule.Dr Lewis Hughes, chair of the Scottish Junior Doctor Committee, said medics did not expect to \"clock in and out\", but that rotas had to be realistic withadequate rest facilities also available round-the-clock.Dr Hughes said: \"If junior doctors are regularly staying beyond their rostered hours because everyone knows there will be outstanding tasks that canrsquot be left ndash for example when they routinely need to stay longer on certain shts due to longer outpatient theatre sessions, or to ensure proper handovers ndash then that needs to be reflected in the rota.\"Currently, therersquos rarely anywhere to get proper rest during a nightsht, despite there being great evidence that this reduces errors and improves patient care.\"Itrsquos time for NHS Scotland to catch up, where NHS England has already taken steps to address this issue.\"A Scottish Government spokesmansaid: ldquoWe highly value the safety and wellbeing of our health workforce and we are committed to

The offence most often takes place in a hospital, where a medic has failed in their duties, or in the workplace where staff have been put at risk in places like oil rigs, construction sites and factories. The onus on prosecutors is to prove that the defendant owed a duty of care to the deceased and that their negligent act or omission was a cause of death.:Jeremy Kyle Show guest told son that TV host lsquoreally laid into mersquoThere is certainly scope for prosecutors to look at some of the worst excesses of reality TV though this legal lens. Perhaps, though, a first step on the road to the law making its voice heard should be a judicial inquiry into reality TV along the same lines as the Leveson inquiry into the press in the wake of the phone-hacking scandal.Reality TV is an untamed tiger. An inquiry would not be about censoring reality TV. Itrsquos not the content that needs controlled ndash although too often whatrsquos aired is degrading and lacking in merit ndash itrsquos the behaviour of TV execs and the treatment of vulnerable members of the public under their watch which needs scrutinised and curbed.There needs to be a three-step checklist for members of the public: firstly,they cannot consent, are vulnerable or have mental health problems, they should not be cast to appear secondly, the risks of appearance should be made abundantly clear thirdly, care should be given to those appearing throughout, and aftercare should continue for as long as is necessary ndash and only be given by recognised professionals not connected to the show, so there is no conflict of interest.Reality TV does not need to be something which degrades culture. At its best it can be a genre which sheds light on the lives we lead ndash think of the series Up which has been telling the stories of the lives of a group of British children since they were seven in  until today when they are now .

This year local Scottish Fire and Rescue team will once again have a fire engine at the clinic to help draw attention to the clinic.Councillor Drever added: #The safety checks are carried out by a specially trained Good Egg Safety expert, not police officers # so people should not feel they are at risk of getting into trouble.“Rather it#s an opportunity to get some reassurance that your car seat is compatible with your vehicle, and to get tips and advice on any adjustments that would improve the car seat’s performance. We#d urge anyone who drives children about # whether that#s childminders, grandparents and parents or wider friends – to drop into the clinic. It is five or ten minutes of your time well spent.”The Good Egg Safety Child Seat clinic will be held in the Tesco car park in Kirkwall on Wednesday July , running from am to pm. There#s no need to book — just look for the Good Egg rep in the Tesco foyer, or head for the red fire engine.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

They want to hear from the owners of all kinds of properties, from urban studio flats to historic country piles. From Shetland to Stranraer and Orkney to Oban, prime properties from all over Scotland will be in the frame.Jo Street, commissioner for BBC Scotland, said: “We’re delighted to announce a second series of Scotland’s Home of the Year. It isn’t just about showing off million-pound properties – it’s about truly celebrating what people have done to turn their house into a home, expressing their iniduality through their design, flair and imagination. We saw some cracking houses over the course of series one and there are far more gems to uncover for series two.”The first series of Scotland’s Home of the Year was broadcast on the new BBC Scotland channel in April and May this year.The series has since seen its audience continue to grow on iPlayer with requests to view so far hitting more than a quarter of a million – ,.The format saw three judges – architect Michael Angus, interior designer Anna Campbell-Jones and lestyle blogger Kate Spiers – travel theand breadth of Scotland to discover architectural gems and unearth some stunning interiors. Both traditional and contemporary properties were put under the microscope and judges considered everything from a one-bedroom apartment to a centuries-old country castle … and everything in between.Each home was scored on ality, distinctiveness and clever design and from seven finalists, one clear winner of series one was chosen – the White House in Kirkcudbright, Dumfries and Galloway, created by proud owner Lesley Smith and her late husband Mike.Series two will have a slightly longer run than series one with nine -minute heats, each featuring three properties from a specic part of the country. The  houses featured will then be whittled down to a final nine which will go under the spotlight in an hour-long final episode.Gerard Costello, executive producer, IWC Media said: “We are thrilled that Scotland’s Home of the Year is ing to the BBC Scotland channel. The first series was a joy to make and we have only scratched the surface of the beautul and distinctive homes Scotland has to offer.

However, this simply isn’t the case, so we thought the best way to demonstrate this is to show people.“These images showcase the signicant expansion in charging infrastructure highlighting the hidden gems that exist in the UK’s charging network.”Other picturesque locations include a charge point nestled in the Blackdown Hills in Devon overlooking the English countryside.And when taking a trip through Snowdonia National Park, an eco-friendly bed and breakfast, Byrn Elltyd Eco Guest House, has its own remote charging stop. On the east of the UK, in St Leonards-On-Sea, there is an EV charge point overlooking the English Channel, while those hiking the tors of Dartmoor National Park can plug in overnight at Bovey Castle.Bude, in Cornwall, is also home to a seaview spot to plug in.However, it’s not just the depths of countryside which provide the perfect spot to park up and charge up.Those cruising around the city of Glasgow can make a stop off at Blythswood Square to recharge their car batteries.Charging points are also appearing across London after the ultra low emissions zonehas come into force, deterring less economical cars from the heart of the city.John Whitehead, owner of Bryn Elltyd Eco Guest House in Wales said: “As very early adopters of electric charge points in , we’ve enjoyed seeing a steady growth in \u2028EV drivers using the connectors at Bryn Elltyd Eco Guest House.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"amber rudd universal credit is just one benefit of being part of uk","story":"Universal Credit is a flexible benefit that is enabling a pioneering trial of new ways to help former prison inmates find work, which will reduce the chance they will re-offend, says Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd.Leaving prison should be the start of a new le – one free of crime and as part of society.Yet too often this isn’t the case. No job, no housing and no money can create a sense of hopelessness that spirals into reoffending.In fact, the current rate of a prison leaver being reconvicted in Scotland after  months is more than one in four.That’s why the UK Government and I want to do something about it.Today I am visiting Scotland’s only all-female prison, HMP Cornton Vale, to explain some changes we’re trialling to the way we support offenders in Scotland as they prepare to leave prison.The women I will meet today are not just statistics, but people who have so much to give to society and to the economy. They’re a Mother, a sister, a partner, a friend, a worker and we need to make the most of their talents.So I want the transition from le in prison to le back in work to be as seamless as possible.: Prisons ‘bursting at seams’ as inmate numbers pass ,: Universal Credit has created ‘emotional distress’ for people with mental health conditionsFor starters, prisoners close to release at HMP Cornton Vale and HMP Perth are set to receive enhanced employment support while in prison in a bid to reduce re-offending rates in Scotland.This means DWP prison work coaches in Scotland will help prisoners get their CVs written, interview preparation done and job hunting underway so they are better able to get a job and hit the ground running when they are released.We know that those who engage with a work coach while in prison get a Universal Credit payment three times faster so the earlier we get people speaking to Jobcentre staff and getting themselves ready for work, the better.As part of the pilot, we’re going to make it possible for offenders to begin their benefit claim in advance, so once a prisoner is released they can be able to access a payment at the Jobcentre Plus on the day of their release.I’m aware that signing someone up to receive benefits won’t solve all their problems. But having some financial reassurance amongst an overwhelming amount of uncertainty will go a long way to landing people safely back into society so they can make a full contribution to everyday le.And it’s not just financial security. We know housing and employment are absolutely crucial to avoid repeat offending. That’s why our work coaches, alongside prison staff, will also be able to identy accommodation for offenders being released and talk about working options.This pilot builds on our existing support for people leaving prison, including encouraging employers to recognise the benefits of employing from this pool of talent. We often see that in their search for stability, people who have left prison tend to stay in a job for longer and have lower rates of absenteeism.As well as highlighting the benefits for business, we have developed advice for employers on recruiting those with criminal records and we champion those organisations offering work opportunities to people coming out the gates by sharing testimonials from businesses who have already hired ex-offenders.The trials we’re doing are all possible because of the flexible support offered by Universal Credit.Universal Credit was introduced to create welfare system that provides genuine safety net for those in need, but also a springboard to help people realise their potential.Over two million people are now successfully receiving the benefit, more than , of those in Scotland. People are moving into work faster and staying in work for longer than under the old system, and by the time it is fully rolled out we project that around , more people across the UK will be in work.Finding work is the best route towards prosperity and we want people to leave prison with a real opportunity to start again.Which is why I am so pleased we are making these changes to provide money and support for ex-offenders in Scotland – so that finishing a prison sentence can truly be the start of a new le.This is all part of the advantages that Scotland enjoys as a result of being in the Union. And the man I am backing to be the next Prime Minister, Jeremy Hunt, will ensure the precious Union will never be broken.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"scotland s citizens assembly should not be a stunt leader comment","story":"Scottish Government may need to do more to convince sceptical opposition parties to take part in the Citizens# Assembly of Scotland.It is a simple idea. Bring together  or so honest citizens – free from ambition for high political office and the sinister machinations of party politics – set them to work on the greatest issues of our time and then sit back to wait for a solution so simple, wise and beautul that everyone wishes they had thought of it.Citizens’ assemblies have attracted a host of fans across the political spectrum from former Conservative leadership contender Rory Stewart to French President Emmanuel Macron and a majority of people in Ireland who backed proposals on legalising abortion and gay marriage after one was held on those issues.: Pro-Union parties brand Citizens’ Assembly a ‘Nationalist stunt’: Scottish independence: SNP can bypass election watchdog on referendum questionSo it’s perhaps not a surprise the Scottish Government is setting up a Citizens’ Assembly of Scotland in which  members of the public will be asked “what kind of country” Scotland should be and how it should “overcome challenges” like Brexit. It’s also not so surprising that the Conservative and Liberal Democrats have decided not to take part with Tory constitution spokesman Adam Tomkins describing it as a “Nationalist stunt”, adding wearily that “we’ve heard it all before”. After the isive nature of the  independence referendum, having a citizens’ assembly on Scotland’s constitution future could be a means of healing wounds, helping both sides to see each other’s point of view and to recognise that they are both entitled to it.It could also help flesh out alternatives to independence like ‘home rule’ or ideas around creating a federal system of government in the UK, as recently suggested by Conservative MSP Murdo Fraser. It could also be a chance for unionists to lay out a positive vision of Scotland in the UK and for independence supporters to do the same about Scotland as a separate state.If it is to be an “SNP stunt”, its impact will be much reduced and questions will grow about the use of taxpayers’ money in this way. Indeed, it could turn out to be a political problem for the SNP. Certainly,they cannot be persuaded to take part, unionist parties are likely to try to make it one.Appointing former Labour MEP David Martin was clearly an attempt to give the assembly cross-party credentials but,that attempt is to succeed, the Scottish Government may need to go the extra mile to bring on board those who are understandably sceptical about the process.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"muirfield golf club admits women members for the first time in 275 years","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...The Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers, which has its home at Muirfield, in East Lothian, has invited women to join the club as members for the first time since voting to change the clubrsquos rules in .Twelve women, along with three men, have been invited to take up membership from July  after taking part in the clubrsquos traditional process.: Woman in critical condition after being found with signicant burns in Bathgate car fireThe club has hit the headlines many times for its controversial approach to female membership.In , the golfs ruling body, the RA, removed Muirfield as a host venue for the Open Championship as a result.

The cloned tree was then taken to the horticultural unit and further clones have also been successful.Paul Goddard leads the woodlands team. He said: “The final piece in the jigsaw was to pollinate the cloned trees. We used pollen that had been harvested from the Punds Water tree before it disappeared.#We didn’t knowit would work and it was a long wait to find out. We couldn’t believe it when we came in one day and spotted the hazelnut appearing from under the leaves.”Samples taken from peat show that, around , years ago there were high levels of tree pollen representing a erse range of species including rowan, birch, willow, hazel and alder.The tree has produced its first hazelnut.

It’s going to be a total of six performances and it’s a very mature role,” she said. “It’s definitely the most challenging role I’ve ever had to perform and it will be a great challenge to take on her maturity.”Methody College’s Louis Fitzpatrick will take on the role of American GI John Thomas, part of the battalion deployed in Saigon during the Vietnam War.“I heard about the auditions for Miss Saigon through a friend, I went for one audition and did well enough to get a call back. I was really ecstatic to learn I had got the part as I was performing Footloose at the time as part of the Belfast Youth and Drama Society, I joined in April  and the first production I did was Les Misérables.“I hadn’t watched the stage version before but was able to watch it on Amazon Prime.”The -year-old has just completed his A’levels in Moving Image, Politics and Drama and told the South Belfast News how he hopes to go on to study film at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland in Glasgow.Grand Opera House Chief Executive Ian Wilson added: “This is the ninth year that the Grand Opera House has staged its Summer Youth Production, and Miss Saigon® School Edition will be the biggest so far. It’s very rare for a theatre the size of the Grand Opera House to be granted the rights to the youth version, so it really is a brilliant opportunity to see the best up-and-coming musical theatre stars in one of the most popular musicals of all time.”For ticket information visit: www.goh"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"how divine mercy is local turning lives around","story":"FOUNDED in , the Divine Mercy group continues to go from strength to strength.Four years on, the group attracts weekly attendances of up to  people every Friday afternoon at Sacred Heart church in Glenview Street.The worship group helps those suffering with suicidalthoughts and addictions, using faith as a form of help.Thomas Stewart, who helped set up the group, explained more about the work the group does.“I set up the group with a friend, who  years ago lost his brother who took his own le through suicide,” he said.“It was a total shock to his family and he felt he needed to do something to help others with similar problems.“We started the Divine Mercy group up in  and it was just three of us. It is a time to reflect on le, listen to beautul songs, and a prayer session is also available afterwards for those who wish to get involved in that.“I think with the issues of addictions with drugs and alcohol becoming more of an issue in North Belfast, the Divine Mercy group offers something dferent to anyone who is seeking help.“Whatever is going on in your own le or your family’s le,your son or daughter is suicidal or has addiction problems, I would encourage you to come along to the Divine Mercy group.“There is help available, which is why people come back. It’s an outlet for people also and a comfort zone for them. The Divine Mercy gives these people hope.“There are young lads coming here who are broken in their lives. The reason we can draw them in is because we are all from dferent backgrounds and we are able to reach out to them.”One of the great successes of the Divine Mercy group has been the regular Cursillo residential weekends in Benburb.The Cursillo runs from a Thursday evening to a Sunday afternoon with participants able to meet people and explore their faith further in a serene and spiritual environment.Hugh Byrne, another key figure in the Divine Mercy group, said the Cursillo is a le-changing experience for those involved.“After three days, they are dferent people. It is truly a le-changing experience and I have seen that with people over the years.”Hugh is also responsible for talking to anyone who comes to the Divine Mercy group in order to offer help and advice.“I sit and have a chat with the lads every week,” he added.“If I get them to listen, that is the start. If we help turn one person’s le around, that is better than none.“I ask them how far they are in their addiction whether it would be alcohol or drugs.“Some people have fallen away but there have been a lot of successes. Relationships and marriages have been fixed and people have turned their lives around.“We also have good links with rehabilitation services and other helplines to point people towards further help.”At last Friday’s meeting, the group were joined by some American visitors who ed to Belfast a year on from experiencing the Divine Mercy group for the first time.Thomas says the success of the group has been extremely encouraging and a sign that they are on the right path.“It was great to see the visitors from the USA who were here last year and wanted to come back over again,” continued.“They are going back to spread the word about the work the group does.“The group can only get better. We started with just three people so we have come a long away in quite a short time.“People are coming back so we must be doing something right.“We have the prayers and so on and then we come out and sit and have tea, coffee and biscuits. It is great to see everyone bonding and talking to each other.“People don’t realise how powerful the Divine Mercy is. It doesn’t matter what is going on in your le. Ask for help and reach out to the Divine Mercy.”The Divine Mercy group meets every Friday at pm at Sacred Heart church in Glenview Street and all are welcome to come along."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"squeeze on school places gets worse","story":"ALLIANCE South Belfast MLA Paula Bradshaw says a fundamental reform in the allocation of school places is needed, after figures showed a soaring demand for places in South Belfast,with well over a quarter of applicants now not getting their first choice.Ms Bradshaw revealed statistics released to her by the Education Authority outlining the number over the past five years of school admissions.In ,  pupils living in South Belfast applied for a post-primary place –  pupils were offered a place at first preference whilst  were refused.In , out of a total of  applications,  pupils were offered a place at first preference, with  refused.“The number of pupils seeking places in South Belfast post-primary schools has risen from  to  in the past five years, yet Area Planning seems to have managed to miss this completely,” explained Ms Bradshaw.“This defeats the whole purpose of Area Planning. How can it not already have been known that approximately  more pupils would be requiring places over this period  If Area Planning was unable to monitor this correctly, it is entirely unsuited for purpose. It is a complete failure of the system. “The outcome of this failure is drastic. As a consequence, we now have, for the first time, seven pupils in South Belfast not receiving any offer at all for September . Additionally, the number not receiving their first choice rising dramatically from  per cent to  per cent and this will only rise further.“With more than a fth more pupils seeking places in South Belfast than was the case just three years ago, we should have been taking action to address the shortfall in provision we knew was pending.“The increased intake at Lagan and Aquinas, of  places each, can cover only a sixth of that increase and is nothing like sufficient. So, what we are seeing is a comprehensive failure of the whole transfer system in South Belfast.“With ever more new housing in and around South Belfast, this is only going to get worse in years to come. Where is the monitoring of this  What will the requirement be five years from now  What is being done to address it  “The Alliance Party has called, and will continue to call, for a fundamental, independently-led review of education provision with a view to far-reaching transformation recommend-ations being proposed.“A high priority within this process would be a focus on improving Area Planning, so that pupils and their families are not left in the appalling situation where they are left without a school, with the ultimate solution being more educational provision either within existing schools or a new build,” added Ms Bradshaw."},{"url":null,"title":"access to harmful social media must be restricted bma belfast meeting told","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It also called for members to support the regulation of social media content harmful to health. The motion was passed by conference delegates.Dr Hedderwick referenced the case of -year-old Molly Russell who took her own le in November . Mollys family later discovered she had searched for self-harm techniques via her Instagram account. The case led to widespread criticism of the social media .\"It is unbelievably easy to find in a few hashtags such as pro-ana, thinspo and find yourself amongst an encyclopaedic array of how to do anorexia,\" Dr Hedderwick added.\"Social media can be a force for good, but it has the ability to enable harm to occur to the most vulnerable in society. \"We need to support measures that make access to this sort of content much harder.\"Molly, from Harrow in north west London, was found to have viewed content on social media linked to anxiety, depression, self-harm and suicide before ending her le. Earlier this week, Sir Nick Clegg, Facebooks head of communications, argued that people are at risk of \"overreacting to the bad\" aspects of social media and damaging its positive potential as a result. Sir Nick, the former leader of the Liberal Democrats and Deputy Prime Minister during the coalition government, was hired by the tech giant last year. He was speaking after Mollys father Ian warned that Facebook would not have a long-term futureit does not tackle the harmful material which can be found online.Mr Russell said there is not a tech-lash, or a backlash against technology firms, and there is not an overreaction amid public concerns over content. Speaking to reporters at the NSPCCs How Safe Are Our Children  conference in central London on Tuesday, he said: \"I dont think this is a tech-lash. I think this is being quite supportive of social media companies. \"It is important to acknowledge that theydo a lot of good, but sadly their s are being used by people to do harm and they have not done enough to prevent that. \"Unless change happens, their s will become toxic.

However, the -page mapping exercise gives an insight into the extent we could be impacted.The scope of areas highlighted is broad and includes everything from health, travel, waterways, animal movement and organised crime and drugs to benefit fraud, schooling, library provision and teacher and doctor qualications.For each of the  sectors, the document species the extent to which it is underpinned by the Good Friday Agreement as well as by existing EU legal and policy frameworks.In the case of the North West Cancer Centre, the report points out that the initiative was based on an intergovernmental agreement between Health Ministers from both jurisdictions.It says the centre at Altnagelvin Area Hospital, which opened in November , \"offers radiotherapy services closer to home for many patients from the north west, reducing their travel time signicantly\".Similarly, the All-Island Congenital Heart Disease Network is identied as ensuring that \"vulnerable children\" receive treatment on the island of Ireland.

The charity has urged people to donate food to their local food bank.Dave Magill, operations manager for Northern Ireland at the Trussell Trust, said more than a third of all food distributed by food banks in its network here goes to children, with extra financial pressure during the holidays for families entitled to free school meals during term time.The figures come against a backdrop of rising food bank use here.

Mr Magill said: \"Food banks do all they can to help families in Northern Ireland over the summer and many run holiday clubs to support parents who find that their income simply wont stretch to meet the extra pressure of missing free school meals or paying for extra childcare. \"But no charity can replace the dignity of having enough money for the basics.\"Ultimately, we should all be protected from needing a food banks help, no matter the time of the year.\"He said one step would be to end the five-week wait for a first Universal Credit payment, which the charity said is a key driver of increased need at food banks.Mr Magill added: \"We know Northern Ireland is already on a clf-edge with less than a year to go before we see the extra protections currently available to people under our benefits system come to an end. \"We have real concerns that unless these protections are preserved, families will continue to struggle not just during the school holidays but all-year round.\"If we are to end hunger in Northern Ireland, we need to make sure everyone is anchored from being swept into poverty.\" The Department for Communities said people use food banks for many reasons and it would be misleading to link them to any single cause. It added: \"The Evason Report on welfare mitigations included a recommendation to tackle food poverty in Northern Ireland by improving access to affordable food through a network of community shops and social stores supermarkets.\" It said the department launched a social supermarket pilot programme in October . \"The scheme was originally funded until , and a rolling evaluation of the pilot is being undertaken with initial feedback showing a high demand for the service in all of the pilot areas and positive early impacts for those availing of the support. \"As of March ,  iniduals had been in receipt of support for themselves and their families and over  tonnes of surplus food which would have gone to waste have been redistributed through the Social Supermarkets. \"The five-week waiting period for Universal Credit is determined by legislation.\" The number of food parcels given to young people here during the  school summer holidays"},{"url":null,"title":"expara chiefs own solicitors tell ballymurphy inquest to discount his statement on medical grounds","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

No formal or transparent selection process was used in her selection for appointment nor was she given a written contract of employment, statement of main terms and conditions or job description.During , following several years of signicant growth, the firm decided to consider promotions from associate solicitor grade to salaried partner. Mrs Mercer and two other colleagues were promoted to salaried partner later that year.However, the following year, when she applied for promotion to the role of an equity partner, she was told she did not meet the eligibility criteria. Mrs Mercer did not find out about the promotions of her comparators at the time they took effect on June , , because they had not been announced internally. Instead she learned about them around  through what she described as the \"office rumour mill\". When she enquired about applying for promotion to the next stage, she was informed that there would be no more movement in the firm for the foreseeable future.Mrs Mercer flagged ious issues about her pay during  and  and the fact that promotions were taking place without any formal or transparent selection process.In June  she informed one of firms partners that she wanted to be paid the same salary as her male comparators and to have her bonus calculated on the same terms as theirs. Mrs Mercer was later told that the firm had decided to defer the issue of her salary and bonus until the end of the financial year as part of a wider review of business and salaries. Following this she lodged an internal grievance, seeking equal pay with her comparators on the ground that she was performing like work with them. Her grievance was rejected as the firm was of the view that her work as a salaried partner was \"not as demanding as that of a salaried partner benefiting from a profit share arrangement\". The legal practice accepted that Mrs Mercer was receiving less remuneration than her male colleagues but did not accept that she was undertaking like work with them. It contended that, although she and her male counterparts were all qualied solicitors, there were signicant dferences in the work they and Mrs Mercer were undertaking both in respect of legal work and other responsibilities.In addition, the respondent contended that,Mrs Mercer proved that she was undertaking like work with her comparators, there were genuine material factors which were not the dference of sex and which explained and justied any dferences in pay.The tribunal found that Mrs Mercer was employed on like work with all her comparators going back six years to June .The firm was ordered to pay her £, in respect of the dference between her gross annual salary of £, and the modied amount of £, going forward. She will also receive £, arrears of annual salary falling six years before the date of her claim in June  along with interest of £, on arrears."},{"url":null,"title":"inadequate budgets putting pressure on schools in northern ireland","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Sunshine streams down. Close your eyes and you could be in the Males..pushThe accents give the game away. This is Ballymena, Paisley country, a unionist heartland. North Antrim MP Ian Paisley isnt around today.Read MoreDUP has lost patience with Ian Paisley in wake of latest holiday claimsIan Paisley is pushing DUP loyalty to the limitSuzanne Breen: Ian Paisleys popularity with constituents is his greatest protection ... but will DUP take further action No, hes not in the Males hes occupied at the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee in Westminster. But hellhome to controversy.After riding out his previous indiscretion, a holiday in Sri Lanka not disclosed to the House of Commons, calmer waters seemed restored.Exposed again, hes back in the spotlight due to trips to the Males, and willto a political temperature as hot as the Indian Ocean paradise.Whats hurting people most is the lack of transparency.Siblings Ryan and Victoria Hutchinson shook their heads.\"Sadly, its what weve come to expect from politicians,\" said Ryan. \"They get their money, they get their freebies. He looks stupid.\"Victoria now wants to see Mr Paisley step forward and tell the whole story. \"While Im not sticking up for Ian, maybe we need to look into every politician,\" she said.\"I suspect theres a lot more going on that has been made public.\"I have to say, Ian did help us a few years ago, but he needs to come out and say something.\"There are apologies to make. Hes let us down.\"Theres a sht in the mood.Mr and Mrs Eagleson are Ballymena born and bred. \"The DUP should say enough is enough, stand up and do the right thing,\" said Mr Eagleson.\"If Ian prides himself on being a religious man, then he needs to tell the truth.\"There has to be some values. He will probably get back inhe has to, he has his fathers name.\"While not singling out Mr Paisley, Kay Donaghan said the way politicians have been behaving is \"disgraceful\".\"You suspect theyre all the same, butIan has been caught out he should pay for it,\" she said.\"People are trying their best to scrape by. Politicians doing this sort of thing should be kicked to the kerb.\"Whether its a knee-jerk reaction that will ease over time, only a test at the polls will tell.For now, the thought of lavish all-expenses paid holidays has rubbed the electorate up the wrong way.Karen Wrights son Bo is disabled and she said shes been waiting nearly four years to get a wheelchair for him.\"Im not getting any help,\" she said. \"Before that I had to wait  years before getting a bungalow with the proper access for him. \"Why cant something be done for people like me  We dont care about the Males or Sri Lanka.\" Her friend Natalie Smyth also has a disabled son. \"Im fighting a battle every day to get some respite care,\" she said.\"These are the things I want my MP to be fighting for, not disappearing around the world.\"At the end of the day, though, this is still Ballymena, and theres always signicant support for a Paisley.\"If you want anything done you go to Ian,\" said Harry and Anne McGall. \"We cant see him meaning to do anything underhand.\"Of course well support him. Who  is going to fight the corner for Ballymena and North Antrim \"Two elderly women shake their heads and say: \"Its very sad and we hope he has the intelligence to stand up and apologise. Theres a lot of people feeling let down.\"Ballymenaeditor Dessie Blackadder knows the lay of the land around the town better than most.\"Obviously this has put our MP right back in the spotlight,\" he said. \"Social media will have fun, but at the end of the day its up to the electorate to pronounce their verdict on Ian Paisley.\" Hes right, of course, and the Paisley name goes a long way. Its a rebuilding of trust that his supporters are now looking for.Support is there, but people in Ballymena are beginning to expect it to be better earned."},{"url":null,"title":"revealed five schools share the top spot in gcse league table results","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We have a very simple saying, Happy pupils, high expectation, high achievement and thats it in a nutshell.\"The school is well led by a supportive board of governors.\"Principal of Loreto Grammar, Omagh, Grainne OHanlon, said she was \"delighted\" at its joint top ranking, the first time it has topped the league table.\"It is the result of the professional relationship and trust which the teachers establish with the pupils,\" she said. \"Theres a strong, supportive pastoral Special Educational Needs and safe environment surrounding the pupils and thats fully endorsed by the parents.\"Its the overriding belief that our young girls are creative, talented and able, and with a lot of self belief and hard work they can achieve.\"Lumen Christi College principal Siobhan McCauley said her schools academic success is largely due to \"the excellent relationships that exist between students and staff\".She added: \"The strong support of parents coupled with the hard work and dedication of the staff enables our students, who are well-motivated and enthusiastic, to perform at the highest level and thus achieve outstanding exam results.\"Principal of Rainey Endowed Mark McCullough said the results were enabled by a \"three-way partnership between the school, parents and pupils\".\"Its a great accolade - we just work and do the best for them that we can,\" he said.\"Im absolutely delighted and would like to thank everybody for all their hard work.\"Principal of St Dominics in Belfast Carol McCann said that % of all GCSE grades achieved in her school were A* A.\"Our performance at GCSE is the highest it has ever been in the A* A grades,\" she said. \"We are very proud of the achievement, which is down to the hard work of the pupils, staff and parents, who have worked together.\"Our Lady and St Patricks College principal Deborah McLaughlin said her schools joint sixth position was \"testament to the positive attitude of our students, who are supported by our committed staff and our parent body\".\"Were very much a team,\" she said. \"It is a balance between academic and extracurricular activities for students.\"Principal of St Louis Grammar School in Ballymena Sean Rafferty paid tribute to the work of pupils, staff and teachers.\"I would like to congratulate the pupils, teachers and parents for their magnicent effort.

That kind of shortsighted approach should not be replicated here.“There are some households which have more than one person working in the Mail Centre.“I’m told that there was a lot of upset and anger at the meeting last night, this is coming as a real blow to many, many workers who have given long years of service.”Michael Mulcahey, CEO of Little Island Business Association, said the move came as a “devastating blow to workers in the area”.He said: “It’s important that every assistance is given to these workers to rebuild their careers as a result of this loss.”"},{"url":null,"title":"no evidence of russian interference in brexit via facebook says clegg","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It is for democratic politicians in the democratic world to do so,” he said.The chairman of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee Damian Collins said Sir Nick was wrong to say there was no evidence that Russia used Facebook to interfere in the referendum.“He is technically wrong on that point which he should know,” he told BBC Radio ’s Today programme.“We asked Facebook whether there was any evidence of Russians buying ads during the referendum. There was – which they shared with us – on a very small scale, but nevertheless it was there.”He added: “There has been no proper audit done during the referendum.

It prohibits him from trying to undermine the conservatorship by contacting members of the Spears family or writing disparaging posts on social media.A conservatorship, known in some states as a ship, is normally reserved for those who are severely debilitated. One was established for Spears  years ago during her very public meltdown, and has been kept in place ever since. The arrangement has increasingly come under attack from fans, who have grown especially loud about it in recent months.Spears has offered little public comment on the conservatorship. At her request, she addressed the judge who oversees it in court last month. The hearing was closed and it is not clear what Spears said, but the judge ordered a court review of her situation before another hearing in September.The suit focuses on a June  Absolute Britney Instagram post that alleges the conservatorship was seeking to manipulate Britney Spears’ Instagram account.“Britney’s team is deleting positive comments on her Instagram post and leaving negative ones to keep up the illusion that she needs help!” the post says. “This has to be a human rights violation!!!!”The post, which the suit calls “ and defamatory”, was discussed by bigger blogs and some media outlets. Elia shared some of those reports.The suit seeks unspecied damages and a court injunction permanently prohibiting Elia from spreading information on the subject.Spears has put her career on hold for most of the year.In January she postponed a planned Las Vegas residency indefinitely to be with her father, who was in hospital after a serious operation.And in April she announced in an Instagram post that she was taking time off to focus on self-care."},{"url":null,"title":"us democrats face off in first presidential debate","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, more than anyone , stood out — on her own at times — in calling for “fundamental change” across the US’s economy and government to address persistent issues of inequality.“I think of it this way. Who is this economy really working for  It’s doing great for a thinner and thinner slice at the top,” Ms Warren declared shortly before raising her hand as one of the only Democrats on stage willing to abolish her own private health insurance in favour of a government-run plan. “Health care is a basic human right and I will fight for basic human rights.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren gestures towards Cory Booker during the debate The debate marked a major step forward in the young  presidential campaign as Democrats seek to break out from the crowded field that has so far been dominated by former vice president Joe Biden, who will appear in a second debate featuring another  candidates on Thursday night. Mr Biden was not mentioned during Wednesday’s face-off, a civil debate with moments of modest policy clashes and few instances of Democrat-on-Democrat confrontation.Immigration was also on their minds as the candidates’ minds as they pointed to the searing photos of a drowned Salvadoran father and his toddler daughter at the Rio Grande and blamed Mr Trump and his policies on migrants crossing into America illegally.Former Obama administration housing chief Julian Castro said: “Watching that image of Oscar and his daughter Valeria was heartbreaking. It should also piss us all off.”Ms Warren spent the evening at centre stage, a top-tier candidate whose campaign has gained ground in recent weeks as she has released a near-constant stream of policy proposals. She was flanked by lower-tier candidates including Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, former Texas Representative Beto O’Rourke and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, who needed big moments to help spark momentum in the crowded field.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Democratic presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke Several candidates, including Mr Castro, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, Representative Tim Ryan of Ohio and former Representative John Delaney of Maryland were eager to jab their rivals on issues including health care and immigration.On one side: candidates such as Ms Warren are demanding dramatic change that includes embracing liberal policy priorities such as free universal health care, debt-free college, a forgiving immigration policy and higher taxes on the rich. On the other: pragmatic-minded Democrats such as Mr Biden — and little-known former Maryland Representative Mr Delaney — are calling for modest policy solutions that could ultimately attract bipartisan support.Mr De Blasio, who joined Ms Warren in raising his hand on health insurance, cast the debate as part of “the battle for the heart and soul of our party”.Mr Trump, the elephant not in the room, was in the air travelling to Japan for a round of trade talks as Democrats faced the nation for the first time in the  campaign.Earlier in the day, he confirmed that he would watch the debate from Air Force One. His first tweet of the night: “BORING!”BORING!— Donald J. TrumpJune , Mr Trump also tweeted that the NBC News network “should be ashamed” after the coverage was marred by a technical glitch.NBC’s technical problem came following a half-time switch from Lester Holt, Savannah Guthrie and Jose Diaz-Balart — who were the primary questioners in the first hour — to Chuck Todd and Rachel Maddow. Mr Todd was interrupted by voices as he tried to direct a gun control question to Ms Warren.It caused a brief, uncomfortable period of confusion before Mr Todd switched to a y, unplanned commercial break.Following the break, the issue was corrected. But it gave Mr Trump an opening to attack one of his favourite targets, the news media.NBC and MSNBC “should be ashamed of themselves for having such a horrible technical breakdown in the middle of the debate,” he said. He called it “truly unprofessional.”.@NBCNews and @MSNBC should be ashamed of themselves for having such a horrible technical breakdown in the middle of the debate. Truly unprofessional and only worthy of a FAKE NEWS Organization, which they are!— Donald J. TrumpJune , The Republican president helped unite the Democrats, but the candidates did not agree on everything.Mr Castro assailed fellow Texan Mr O’Rourke for not calling for fully decriminalising crossing the US-Mexico border illegally.“I just think it’s a mistake, Beto,” he said, adding that Mr O’Rourke would agree with him “ you did your homework on this issue”.Mr O’Rourke said he does not support fully decriminalising such border crossings because of fears about smugglers of drugs and people. New Jersey Senator Mr Booker also sided with Mr Castro, arguing for full decriminalisation."},{"url":null,"title":"closure derry hmrc office plan move workers belfast branded ludicrous tin eared decision","story":"A Derry MLA yesterday branded as \"ludicrous\" a decision to uproot HMRC staff from Derry and move them to Belfast.SDLP MLA Mark H. Durkan said that many of the  staff at Foyle House, on the Duncreggan Road, will be made redundant as it will be \"impossible\" for them to relocate to Belfast.In  HMRC announced that the Derry tax office would close in  .It came as part of a move to reconfgure its offices into thirteen regional centres serving every nation and region in the UK, with one of these centres being located in Belfast.In July  HMRC declared that its Belfast Regional Centre would be based at Erskine House, Chichester Street, Belfast, and expected to open in late . It is on schedule to open later this year.This week, Sir Jonathan Thompson, Chief Executive and Permanent Secretary of HMRC, sent a letter to Mark H. Durkan asserting that based on current plans Foyle House will close in September , with staff moving, where possible, to the Belfast Regional Centre.There are currently around  staff in Foyle House and Mr Thompson accepted that the majority live outside reasonable daily travel to Belfast.Mark H Durkan had asked that consideration be given to the integration of HMRC workers in Derry into the Northern Ireland Civil Service.Speaking to the Derry News yesterday, he said: “The intention of HMRC to close their offices here in September  is something I have been appealing against since it was announced in November .“I had written to Head of Civil Service, David Sterling to consider the integration of Derry staff to available DAERA positions in Ballykelly. Why this obvious solution has not been given due consideration is beyond me.“And while HMRC have acknowledged a duty of care to ex-employees, the current plan to relocate  staff members to their Belfast offices is a highly impractical approachnot virtually impossible for those with families and caring responsibilities. For many the only option they have been left with is redundancy.“It is a ludicrous and tin-eared approach to remove employment opportunities, chronically lacking in the North West, and in effect to move more of our skilled workers to Belfast.“These experienced and highly competent staff would be an asset to any organisation. The inability to provide these people some peace of mind as well as affording them opportunities to apply their skills in similar roles closer to home, has been completely overlooked.”However, in his letter Mr Thompson said, “regrettably, there are no priority arrangements for redeployment of our staff into Northern Ireland Civil Servicedepartments.“The NICS is entirely separate from the Home Civil Service and, as such, HMRC staff can only apply for roles in the NICS which may be advertised externally, including those at the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs in nearby Ballykelly.”Mr Thompson added that it has always been made clear that HMRC wants as many people as possible to transfer to their new location and continue their careers in Belfast.“That is why we have committed to hold one-to-one meetings between staff and managers around a year in advance of any move, to discuss inidual circumstances.“The meetings will establish who can and cannot move and what level of support will be needed to keep people working for HMRC. The one-to-ones for this office will commence in September ,” he concluded.The letter went on to say that those who decide to travel to Belfast will be given financial support in terms of travel costs and in some cases with home moves.The option of working in other government departments would also be explored.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"creggan men mixing mayweather dream las vegas boxing encounter","story":"A boxing coach and personal trainer from Creggan has spoken about an ‘amazing’ trip to Las Vegas spent in the company of many of the fight game’s legendary characters never mind his best friend who just happens to be international footballer James McClean.James McClean recently decided to celebrate turning  by inviting a few of his close friends and their partners to go on a trip to Las Vegas.

They have also branded claims the mercury bath poses a health and safety risk as a ldquored herring and fear that replacing the existing mechanism could potentially damage the Fresnel lens.Described as a ldquoworkshop, the January meeting lasted over one hour with the official council record of the debate that ensued only amounting to a paltry two and a half lines.The Lecale Lightkeepers vehemently argued that they had a case for briefing councillors on the impact the loss of the beam would have but, surprisingly, the request was initially rejected.Instead, council officials insisted that officers from the the Commissioners of Irish Lights would be invited to future meetings of the districtrsquos respective DEA Forums to discuss the future of the lighthouse.The local authority said this was to ensure that information could be shared and that local stakeholders and communities were fully consulted on any proposals for the lighthouse in the immediate future, before any plans are finalised.Council officials also insisted that wide ranging public consultation on the future of the lighthouse would take place.Campaigners mdash who were at a complete loss to understand why they were initially refused an opportunity to meet directly with councillors over five months ago mdash have now been told they will get a chance to brief them and outline their case for the retention of the beam.The Lecale Lightkeepers have described the plan to remove the beam as ldquototally inadequate and unacceptable and are looking forward to outlining their case for its retention.They are also pleased that having heard from the Commissioners, politicians can now have face-to-face dialogue with campaigners.Campaigners have held several discussions with the Commissioners and frequently engage with the organisation as part of the bid to retain what they have described as a key facet of Lecalersquos heritage.ldquoWe welcome the opportunity to meet with councillors to demonstrate just how passionate people are about the retention of the beam, the spokeswoman declared. It is a symbol of unity in Lecale and has brought together all sides of our erse community. It must be retained.ldquoMeeting with councillors is particularly important for us. We have put together a detailed presentation on the lighthouse issue and will outline our concerns about the future of the beam which we cannot afford to lose for a whole host of reasons.The spokeswoman said that in the interests of fairness and given the sensitive nature of the beam issue, it was important that they meet with local politicians.ldquoCouncillors have had the opportunity to hear from the Commissioners and it is important that they hear what we have to say as the group representing those opposed to this controversial proposal, she continued.ldquoThe beam must be retained for future generations given that it is an intrinsic part of the maritime history and heritage of the area and is a stunning feature of the Lecale landscape.The spokeswoman added: ldquoNewry, Mourne and Down Council is backing the campaign to retain the sweeping beam and it is it important that councillors hear directly from campaigners. The beam must be retained we simply cannot afford to lose it from this area and see it consigned to the pages of history..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Curran steps down from government association position  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK councillor Dermot Curran is stepping down from his role as president of the Northern Ireland Local Government Association this Friday.The group is the representative body for the provincersquos  councils and Cllr Curran will leave his position at the grouprsquos annual conference which is taking place at Newcastlersquos Burrendale Hotel.The Ardglass man is Northern Irelandrsquos longest serving district councillor, having been elected to the former Down Council in , following the reorganisation of local government.He has served as NILGA president twice describing the accolade as both a ldquoprivilege and a challenge.While stepping down as the organisationrsquos president, Cllr Curran will remain a key member of the NILGA Executive.Cllr Curran mdash who was last month re-elected to Newry, Mourne and Down Council mdash has been a councillor for  years and while already Northern Irelandrsquos longest serving politician, some of his council colleagues believe that he is the longest serving in the British Isles.Dedicated to public service, Cllr Curran said he has ldquothoroughly enjoyed his second term at NILGArsquos helm and looks forward to continuing his work with the organisation.He also believes that local councils will continue to play increasingly important roles in their respective areas and that an opportunity exists to unlock the potential of local government as the hub of public services.Cllr Curran said that over recent years councils had changed dramatically, as had the political, financial and legal environment in which councillors operate.He said while local authorities had more responsibilities and power than before, they were also increasingly stretched in terms of finances and resources, an issue which has been compounded since the suspension of the Assembly.ldquoThe  councils are a key element of investment and public service delivery, but they control just % of the public purse.

However, I doubt many think that it is the cradle of horse racing, but it is.We do of course have a famous racecourse, which has just hosted a festival of racing as part of the DownTime Summerfest.Some of you, dear readers, may even know that there is an earlier racecourse in Downpatrick mdash at Old Course Road. So racing has been going on for centuries in our beautul corner of the world. And we have also played a vital role in the foundation of the Sport of Kings.The breed of horse associated with modern horse racing is the thoroughbred. A mere glance is enough to tell even the casual observer that the thoroughbred does not look like other horses.When compared to a pony or carthorse, the thoroughbred is leaner, taller and sleeker. In fact, these horses are perfectly designed for racing. They have big lungs, a big heart and long, slender legs that can move swtly.They also need special care when compared with native breeds. They have thin hair coats and so need to wear rugs or live in stables in bad weather. They need special food to give them energy to race. So these features tell you that the ancestor of the modern thoroughbred came from somewhere hot mdash from the desert, in fact. The ancestor of our racehorses is from Arabia.Back in the th century, horses were bred for work and war, not pleasure. Officers prized horses that were fast to get them in and out of battle and keep them alive. By this time, the medieval charger of knights mdash the destrier mdash was out of fashion. They were too slow and cumbersome, and soldiers no longer wore heavy suits of armour.So the horse evolved through selective breeding to become fleet of foot. There were no horses faster than the Arabian, which was specially bred to become bigger and faster than its wild cousin. The armies of the Ottoman Sultan developed special studs to create this new war machine.In , one of these fine stallions, known as the Byerley Turk, found himself outside the gates of Vienna. The Ottoman Sultan wanted to capture the imperial capital of the Holy Roman Empire, an objective he failed to achieve when the Polish King John III Sobieski led the greatest cavalry charge in history to defeat the Ottoman forces.The Byerley Turk was captured and eventually brought to England, finding himself in the ownership of one Captain Byerley.His adventures were not over though. Recognising a fine animal, Captain Byerley adopted the Turk as his war horse. In  hewas called to Ireland to fight for King William and in  he fought at the Battle of the Boyne. Indeed, Captain Byerley later attributed his surviving that battle to the swtness of his favourite war horse.After the battle, the Turk was entered in a horse race mdash in Downpatrick. Of course, he went on to win that race and go on to be one of the most famous horses in history. The Flying Horse housing development to the east of Downpatrick is named after this famous race.The remarkable career of the Turk continued mdash and now we come to his ultimate destiny. He was put out to stud in Yorkshire. His pedigree was highly prize and he became the first of only three foundation sires of the modern thoroughbred breed.Genetic testing has revealed it is his DNA that is the most common in all modern racehorses. His progeny are successful right to this day including names such as Dr Devious, Ahonoora and Indian Ridge.And it all started with a fateful race in Downpatrick over  years ago. Needless to say,Downe Vets had been around then and caring for his veterinary needs, we feel he could have achieved more..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Hurlers seeking big upset at Croke Park  ","story":"DOWN senior hurlers go into Saturdayrsquos Christy Ring Cup final at Croke Park against Meath as rank outsiders.Few pundits outside the Down camp expect anything other than a comfortable win for Meath, but say that quietly in and around Ronan Sheehanrsquos new kids on the block.The Newry man, who has close connections to several Cork hurling legends, has engendered a new-found enthusiasm and confidence in his charges.His young hurlers are a real surprise packet this season and getting to the Christy Ring Cup final is a major achievement for his fledgeling side.Sheehan has invested heavily in youth and has two schoolboys in his starting .Downpatrickrsquos Tim Prenter, who plays his club hurling for Ballygalget and Ballycranrsquos Phelilm Savage are both in their final year at St Patrickrsquos Grammar School and De La Salle, Downpatrick, respectively.Both lads were in the Down Schoolsrsquo side that lted the Mageean Cup earlier in the season and both hail from famous sporting families.Prenter, who also won a MacLarnon Cup medal with the Red High a few months back, is the son of former Antrim senior football defender Kieran Prenter and his grandfather Seamus Burns was a well known member of the all-conquering Belfast Celtics basketball team that swept all before them in the s and s.Savage, whose brother Liam is also in the team, is the son of former Ballycran and Ulster midfielder Gary lsquoGazarsquo Savage, who was also a noted centre half with Ballycam Celtic in the Newcastle League.There are also several other young players in the  with Portaferryrsquos Matthew Conlon, Ronan Blair, Darragh Mallon, Tom Murray, Caolan Taggart and Eoghan and Daithi Sands all in their early s.Throw in Liatroimrsquos Oisin McManus, P J Davidson and Ruairi McCrickard and Ballycranrsquos Stephen Keith, Gerard Hughes, Huw Flynn and Liam and Phelim Savage and you have the nucleus of squad that could dominate Ulster hurling for years.In addition to Prenter, Ballygalget provide the squad with, John McManus, Danny Toner, Marc Fisher and Cathal Coulter with Newry Shamrocks providing Paul Sheehan and Jordan Murphy.Helping Ronan Sheehan from the sidelines is Cork legend Diarmuid OrsquoSullivan and the Down manager believes his support has been critical in moving the side forward.ldquoDiarmuid has been doing a bit of defensive coaching for us and he has been there for all of the Christy Ring Cup games, he said.ldquoHe would know a lot of the boys from the development squads because he wouldrsquove come and done coaching sessions down through the years. The first set of minors he was involved with were probably the likes of Conor Woods, so, itrsquos going back a bit.ldquoHaving him there with what people would probably say is a relatively inexperienced management team as well as a relatively inexperienced team on the field of play has become very important, he added.ldquoWe see this as a bit of a journey over the next two to three years and Diarmuid being there to help build along the way will make a massive dference. Sheehan also believes that OrsquoSullivan has made a big impact on the players and he canrsquot praise him highly enough.ldquoIn terms of his knowledge of the game and the wee bits of coaching he does around how to tackle, there have been huge strides, Sheehan said.ldquoTackling was definitely something we felt we needed to work on, we were giving away too many frees in the past. You can see the dference even in the way the likes of Tom Murray, only  and Darragh Mallon at , are playing like demons, he beamed.ldquoThe other thing be brings is a great calmness on match days.The lads respond well to that, when he has a quiet word with them beforehand.This will be Downrsquos fourth appearance in the Christy Ring final, but they have only lted the cup once and that was back in ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"New working group to run local mountain bike trails  ","story":"A NEW working group is to be established to assist with the management of the hugely popular mountain bike trails in Castlewellan Forest Park.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is keen to meet with those who use the trails and organise local events, alongside representatives from Cycling Ireland, to discuss what have been described as a number of challenges in managing the facility and sister trails in Rostrevorrsquos Kilbroney Forest Park.Over pound.m has been invested in developing trails in both parks and together they attract over one million users each year, with pound, invested annually in their management.The success of both authorised and unauthorised trails within both parks presents challenges for Newry, Mourne and Down Council, members of its Enterprise, Tourism and Regeneration Committee were told on Monday.The local authority manages the bike trails under licence from the Forest Service and is also responsible for their maintenance.Politicians were told that in addition to the authorised trail network, an unofficial or lsquonaturalrsquo network also exists and has been in place for many years.

As anticipation builds for next month’s Open at Royal Portrush, the veteran radio and TV presenter visited the host course as well as clubs like Royal Belfast, Royal County Down and the town of St Andrews in Scotland – recognised internationally as the home of golf. Gery Kelly and Bill MontgomeryGerry starts his journey at his home club in Ardglass tracing the beginnings of golf in Ireland and reveals a few surprises as he discovers the relatively unknown Ulster-Scots golfing pioneers who helped establish the sport here.He visits stately homes including Mount Stewart on the shores of Strangford Lough and Grey Abbey House – chatting with Lady Rose Lauritzen and William Montgomery – and travels to St Andrews to explore how the Scots claim to have invented the sport and what part they played in bringing the game across the Irish Sea. .ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p He also sets out to finally answer the age-old dispute about which club is actually the oldest in Ireland. Gerry, who has been playing golf for over five decades at Ardglass Golf Club, said: “Before I began filming for the programme, despite playing the game for most of my le, I actually knew very little about its history, and that’s a shame because there are few sports with as long and as rich a history. Gery Kelly at St Andrews“The thing that amazed me the most was the fact that golf was played in Scotland in the s and it took over  years before it came here. With all the movement of people between the two countries, that Ulster-Scots connection, why did it take so long for the game to be finally organised here ”Gerry, who has been playing golf since he was a teenager, said: “Golf is a sport you can get easily hooked on. It’s a game for le. I know people still playing in their nineties.“For me it’s not so much now about that standard of golf now. I used to play off single figures, now I’m a teenager , it’s about the craic with your fourball. “We would get out once or twice a weekend and play for a fiver. It’s the most important three or four hours of the week to win that fiver.”Links To The Past: Pioneers Of Ulster Golf is on BBC Two Northern Ireland tomorrow night at pm.The one-hour film has been produced by NPE Media for BBC Northern Ireland, with support from the Ulster-Scots Broadcast Fund.l Morning View, page JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Disclaimer  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":null,"title":"politics","story":"....... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast News Letter and agreeing to JPIMedia Ltd#s Standard Terms and ConditionsWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \" addCustomTextToCreateAccountTemplateNewslettersWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"  \". s .  \". s  \". s  \".after+text+ .+text+ .before+text+ .after+text+Bootstrapper.ensEvent.trigger]]]]]]]Bootstrapper.ensEvent.trigger]] initInArticleOnlySiteText, initArticleSiteText, isInArticleOnlyTemplateReady. s isArticleTemplateReady. s addCustomTextToSiteTemplate addSiteName.html  Politics   Jobs Cars Homes  Directory  Announcements  Advertise My Business Subscribe#jp #login-widget #login-flip.flip RegisterLoginEdit Account\"Sign Out\" --\"    --       News Politics Traffic and Travel Crime Weather Business Education Health Opinion People Read This News Traffic and Travel Crime Weather Business Education Health Opinion People Read This Sport Football Rugby Union Motorcycling More Sport Sport Opinion Whats On Arts  Entertainment Things To Do Nightle Lestyle Retro Cars Homes Must Read           Politics      Sinn Fein lsquohas been flouting MP rules on overseas travel for yearsrsquo: MLA claimSinn Fein has its own questions to answer over repeatedly not declaring overseas trips by its MPs, with an MLA saying it has been #flouting the rules for years#.

It is vital that trips such as this are declared so that the public can have confidence in elected representatives. Yet republicans have clearly been flouting the rules for years.”He added: “Now is the time not just to look at the undeclared trips but, with the renewal of the DUP’s confidence and supply arrangement with the Tories on the horizon, all unionists should unite in calling for the allowances for MPs who don’t turn up to do the job to be stopped.”Sinn Fein said: “Sinn Fein MPs often undertake international visits to promote the Irish peace process and to share the Irish experiences of conflict resolution and peace building ... “These visits are routinely publicised and never involve personal gain or advantage. We recently consulted with the Westminster Registrar and are happy to register all international travel.”try catch  TrendingWillie Frazer critically ill family lsquodevastatedrsquo by VSSTwo people found dead in N.I. house -

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them. This has been carried out in towns and cities across the UK to protect the local heritage.The petition can be found at www.change.org p vale-of-glamorgan-council-save-the-victorian-heritage-of-penarth u .I will continue to work with your local Labour councillors on these issues.

I had hoped to work constructively with them and take their concerns on board.ldquoThose who were elected as Conservatives but have chosen to betray the faith that was shown in them by their constituents should have the courage to resign and face by-elections. They should defend their decisions at the ballot box.ldquoAn establishment stitch up between these councillors and Labour is not in the interest of residents of the Vale of Glamorgan. They have explicitly argued that they know best and that the public should be ignored.ldquoI will be proposing a minority Conservative administration at the Vale Councilrsquos AGM with a plan that delivers on the priorities of local people. I will challenge other councillors to back it.Earlier on Wednesday, Cllr Gray made a statement to Vale of Glamorgan Councilrsquos Conservative group to say he was resigning.In his statement, he said he had ldquoabsolutely no issue with the manner in which Cllr Bailey was elected as the new leader of the Conservative Group,But he said he is ldquoat least partially at odds with Cllr Bailey on three issues ndash the proposed lsquoclosurersquo of Llancarfan Primary School, the Dinas Powys Bypass and the incinerator in Barry.On the Llancarfan School proposal, which would see the primary moved to a new building in Rhoose, he said: ldquoI seconded a motion to have the executive reopen the issue consultation and this was ignored by the then cabinet but now that this dficult decision has been made I fear that any attempt to articially prop up Llancarfan School will take funding away from the budgets of Penarth schools which is something I will not tolerate.Cllr Gray said heremained ldquounconvinced that the proposed bypass around Dinas Powys, linking Cardf to Barry, ldquois an issue with a large base of support in my ward, and the efforts to give it even more prominence and funding would I believe be to the detriment of the residents of my ward.Vale council has been waiting for more than a year for Welsh Government to decide whether the Barry incinerator needs to carry out an environmental impact assessment before it can operate.Cllr Gray said any efforts to ramp up the councilrsquos rhetoric on the incinerator ldquowould do a disservice to those residents who are passionate about the subject.ldquoRaising  hope for headlines is not the reason I stood for local government and I donrsquot want to mark my success by how many column inches we are able to achieve on a wedge issue, he said.       ,params: .pushHe added:ldquoThe structures around the group that Vince is proposing seemed to be geared up to act as an opposition party and not to focus on the work of delivering core services for the benefit of the most vulnerable members of our society.ldquoI donrsquot expect everyone to agree with my decision and I donrsquot take this decision lightly ndash I am sure that there will be a great number of people who have an opinion on whether I have done the right thing or not.ldquoI need to remain true to myself and my belief in acting as a positive advocate for the residents in my ward ndash the issues that get me out of bed every morning to work hard for the residents in my ward are not the way the press views me but how I can make a positive dference to peoplersquos lives. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

And under my leadership, a Conservative administration will proudly put the people of the Vale of Glamorgan first.ldquoNaturally, we are open to working with other councillors who share those ideals.ldquoOthers - including those who resigned from the Conservative party - will have to explain to voters where they stand on these issues - and I would urge them to back us, rather than propping up a Labour administration that was rejected by the Vale at the last election.Cllr Bailey said he had a six-point plan for the Vale.He pledged to deliver the Dinas Powys bypass stop inflation-busting council tax rises scrap proposed parking charges review the local development planto curb inappropriate development protect rural schools and oppose the Barry Biomass plant.Cllr Bailey said that he was also keen to improve engagement with the public, after a series of hugely unpopular decisions taken by the existing cabinet.He said: ldquoDuring the elections in , we promised to build a stronger relationship with local residents by consulting them on key decisions.ldquoUnfortunately, too many people feel that their views are simply being ignored and that Vale consultations are just tick box exercises. Take the proposals around car parking charges, or the closure of Llancarfan School. I donrsquot think anyone outside of the Civic Offices believes that those decisions werenrsquot already done deals, and thatrsquos simply unacceptable.ldquoAnother good example is the councilrsquos failure to listen to the public over Penarthrsquos original Victorian lamp posts.ldquoIrsquove been criticised for wanting to listen to the people who elected me, and I make no apologies for that.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John. He really made an impact on our wards and with our patients who listened to his shows.ldquoItrsquos such a lovely way to mark not only Johnrsquos birthday but also to mark the contribution he made as a volunteer during Volunteersrsquo Week. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people. If there are issues we will try to work through those issues.ldquoSometimes we will have to make decisions that not everyone is going to be happy with.ldquoWe have to be honest with people.

The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Abandoned - BlissThe first dog to arrive at the centre was -year-old Spaniel Grace, found by a member of the public at the side of the road. She was taken to the vet immediately, but after an owner didn’t come forward, she was brought to Dogs Trust.Two weeks ago, another Spaniel - aged eight and nicknamed Bliss by the team - was found tied to a fence not far from the rehoming centre. Like Grace, the Spaniel has not been microchipped, which has been a legal requirement for all dogs since  and the easiest way to identy a dog who has become separated from their owner. Shockingly just one week later, a Cairn Terrier - less than a year old, was found by a rehoming centre staff member at the very same spot where Bliss was left. Terrier Rizzo was lucky to be found as she is quite small and it would have been easy to miss her in the long grass.The most recent addition to the ranks of abandoned pooches is Sally, an eight-year-old Collie cross, who was found as a stray by a member of the public and brought to the rehoming centre.Abandoned - RizzoOonagh Philips, Rehoming Centre Manager said: “We want to remind anyone who no longer feels that they can care for their dog to contact their local rescue organisation for support. When a dog is abandoned on the road side, it not only puts them in danger, but also drivers. We are so thankful that all four of these dogs were found when they were.“Grace and Bliss were very shaken up by their ordeal when they came into our care and it took them a couple of days to build trust around people again. We could tell Rizzo hadn’t eaten in a while, which could have resulted in a deterioration of her physical health. Sally is incredibly sweet natured, and just like the others, will make a wonderful addition to the right home.“We are not sure why there has been a recent influx in dogs being abandoned. We always remind people that ‘A Dog is for Le®’ but we understand that le happens, and places like Dogs Trust are there to support any dog owner who experiences a bump in the road and needs our help. Sometimes the most responsible thing we can do as a dog owner is admit that we aren’t coping with our pets, but it is important to ensure they are kept safe and not left to fend for themselves.”If you

Video clips from The World at War TV series were screened to remind all of the intensity and magnitude of the period leading up to, during and after D-Day.Overall, the performance lasted almost three hours but for those gathered the time did not seem to matter.

Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast.

North Street Arcade was destroyed in a fire in , which caused severe damage to the floor and glass roof. It’s been sitting empty for  years, but once played host to a range of popular Belfast stores, including DJ and local punk pioneer Terri Hooley’s record shop, Good Vibrations. The plans to redevelop the arcade are included in a revised scheme called Tribeca Belfast – formerly Royal Exchange. UK developer Castlebrooke is planning to redevelop much of the north side of the city centre as part of a £m scheme. It’s made a number of amendments and changes to the development, most notably revising back from a formerly retail-led scheme to one with fewer shops. Tribeca Belfast includes development around Royal Avenue, Donegall Street, North Street, Garfield Street and High Street. Castlebrooke Investments says it is now committed to bringing North Street Arcade back into use in a new format, with space designed for independent retailers. It has also been announced that architectural design firm Squire  Partners has been appointed to work on the amended proposals. The team from Squire  Partners will work alongside conservation architects from Belfast-based Consarc Design Group. Neil Young, chief executive of Castlebrooke Investments, said: “We are very pleased to be able to reveal our proposed amendments to our outline planning application for Tribeca Belfast, changes which we feel demonstrate that we have listened to feedback from the city. “We will continue to listen and today we have launched a voluntary public consultation process into these planned changes ahead of the submission of our application. Our community exhibition will provide an opportunity for anyone interested to see the new plans and we will be revealing more information about this in the coming weeks.” Murray Levinson, partner at Squire  Partners, said: “The mix of uses across the site – designed to attract a iety of retail, restaurant, cultural and workplace tenants – and the creation of new public realm, will ensure this part of Belfast will be active throughout the day and into the evening. Providing a large number of residential apartments with shared gardens, as well as a hotel, will create a new opportunity for people to live in the city centre.” And Graeme Moore, specialist conservation architect at Consarc Design Group, said: “Consarc Design Group is delighted that we continue to be involved with the proposals for Tribeca Belfast to offer our expertise in building conservation. As with the previous proposals, all of the listed buildings within this phase are to be retained, restored and adapted for a sustainable ongoing use within the masterplan, rooting the new development in the unique historical character of this part of the city centre.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
