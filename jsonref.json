supermarket chains have confirmed a merger which would create a new supermarket giant (Picture: PA)Sainsbury’s and Asda have confirmed that they will merge to create a new supermarket giant in a billion pound deal.What does Asda stand for?The merger will create Britain’s biggest supermarket group by market share, holding a bigger percent of the grocery market than current leader Tesco.Sainsbury’s announced in a statement that it will buy Walmart’s British unit Asda for £7.3 billion pounds ($10.1 billion) in cash and stock.The new supermarket group will have combined revenues of £51 billion and will aim to generate £500 million in cost savings, it said.David Tyler, Sainsbury’s chairman, said: ‘We believe that the combination of Sainsbury’s and Asda will create substantial value for our shareholders and will be excellent news for our customers and our colleagues.‘As one of the largest employers in the country, the combined business will become an even greater contributor to the British economy.‘The proposal will bring together two of the most experienced and talented management teams in retail at a time when the industry is undergoing rapid change.’Sainsbury’s, Asda and Argos stores will combine – but keep their respective brands (Picture: Getty)Asda boss Roger Burnley said: ‘The combination of Asda and Sainsbury’s into a single retailing group will be great news for Asda customers, allowing us to deliver even lower prices in store and even greater choice.‘Asda will continue to be Asda, but by coming together with Sainsbury’s, supported by Walmart, we can further accelerate our existing strategy and make our offer even more compelling and competitive.’In its statement, Sainsbury’s said the combination would see both Sainsbury’s and Asda maintain their own inidual brands.More than 2,800 Sainsbury’s, Asda and Argos stores will be combined, it said, ‘to create greater choice for customers through more store formats and channels, with a combined 47 million customer transactions per week’.Yesterday there were calls for the proposed merger to be investigated by the competition watchdog over fears of the impact on consumer choice.The billion pound merger means the new supermarket giant will hold the biggest percentage of the grocery market, with shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey warning it risks ‘squeezing what little competition there is in the groceries market even further’.She said it would be ‘British shoppers that suffer from rising prices and British workers that may be fearing for their jobs’.Sajid Javid named as new Home Secretary after Amber Rudd quits"},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/sei_9762964.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"sajid javid appointed new home secretary","story":"(Picture: PA)Sajid Javid has been appointed as the new Home Secretary after Amber Rudd quit last night.  He will be replaced as Communities and Local Government Secretary by James Brokenshire.Ms Rudd became the fifth departure from the Cabinet since last year’s snap general election, after admitting she had ‘inadvertently’ misled MPs over the existence of targets for removing illegal immigrants.The Hastings and Rye MP stepped down the evening before she was due to make a statement in the House of Commons on the targets and illegal migration, as she faced increasing pressure over the handling of the Windrush scandal.Her resignation letter – in which she took ‘full responsibility’ for not being aware of the existence of targets – follows the resignations of former defence secretary Sir Michael Fallon, Priti Patel as international development secretary, Damian Green as first minister and James Brokenshire, who left his role as Northern Ireland secretary on health grounds.Mrs May said she was ‘very sorry’ to see her successor as home secretary leave the post, while Ms Rudd’s opposite number Diane Abbott said she had ‘done the right thing’.The pressure had been building on the former banker ever since the emergence of the ‘appalling’ treatment of Caribbean immigrants to the UK between the 1940s and 1970s – the so-called Windrush generation.Concerns had been raised about the immigration status of the Windrush generation and there had been stories of people being forced to prove their near-continuous presence in the country in order to prove they were here legally.Ms Rudd referred to the Windrush ‘scandal’ in her two-page resignation letter, admitting that people with a right to live in the UK had not always been treated ‘fairly and and humanely’.Opposition parties said she was paying the price for Mrs May’s ‘hostile environment’ policy towards illegal immigrants when she was Home Secretary which had led to people being wrongly stripped of their rights and threatened with deportation.Ms Abbott said: ‘This was inevitable, the only surprise is that it took so long.‘The architect of this crisis, Theresa May, must now step forward to give a full and honest account of how this inexcusable situation happened on her watch.’Ms Rudd’s decision to stand down will come as a major blow to Mrs May who publicly declared her ‘full confidence’ in her as recently as Friday.It will also upset the delicate balance within the Cabinet between Leavers and Remainers ahead of a crucial meeting of the Brexit ‘war cabinet’ on Wednesday to discuss Britain’s future customs relationship with the EU.Ms Rudd had appeared to be prepared to ride out the storm announcing her intention to come to the Commons on Monday to answer MPs’ ‘legitimate questions’ about the removals targets.She had previously apologised in the House for the ‘appalling’ treatment of the Windrush veterans, announcing a taskforce to resolve their immigration status as quickly as possible.However, she was criticised for saying the Home Office was ‘too concerned with policy and strategy and sometimes loses sight of the inidual’, prompting accusations that she was trying to put the blame on civil servants.Her latest difficulties began on Wednesday when she told the Commons Home Affairs Committee that the Home Office did not have targets for removals.The following day, however, she returned to the House to admit that Immigration Enforcement managers did use ‘local targets’ but she said they were ‘not published targets against which performance was assessed’.In a series of late night tweets, Ms Rudd said she had not seen the memo – even though it was copied to her office – but admitted that she should have been aware of the targets.Mark Serwotka, general secretary of the Public and Commercial Services Union, which represents Home Office workers, said: “The Windrush scandal has highlighted how inhumane immigration policies coupled with cuts to Home Office staff and increased workloads is a recipe for disaster.‘The resignation of Amber Rudd should be a wake-up call to the Government to end the hostile environment they have created for people wanting to come to this country and to put a stop to the blame culture where Home Office staff carry the can for the failings of ministers.’"},{"url":null,"title":"When Ramadan 2018 Muslims fast does date change year","story":"Who is Janelle Monae? \u0026#8216Pansexual\u0026#8217 singer and actor revealed after Rolling Stone

And they were wealthy enough to employ six servants, socialise with the great and good of Leeds, and involve themselves in the politics of the day.          The parents of Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, Carole and Michael Middleton, have a history of people being named Arthur and Charles in their family trees           Frank Lupton, pictured, is Michael Middleton\u0027s great-great grandfather and Kate’s great-great-great grandfather          Joyce Ransome, wife of Kate’s great-grandmother Olive Lupton’s cousin Hugo, with sons Arthur and Francis Lupton          A simplified take on Kate Middleton\u0027s Lupton ancestry shows where she may have drawn inspiration for her newborn\u0027s middle names           Francis Lupton was killed during the First World War and is an ancestor of the Duchess of Cambridge, who announced her baby\u0027s name today          Kate’s great-grandmother Olive Lupton’s cousin, Hugh, is here pictured during the First World War           Kate’s great-grandmother Olive Lupton’s cousin Hugo, top-right, on his wedding day to Joyce Ransome, sister of Arthur Ransome          Writer Arthur Ransome was also revealed to be related to the Duchess of Cambridge, whose son\u0027s middle name matches the author\u0027s Their son Charles was the first Lupton to go to public school, setting a tradition that would carry right through the family to Kate.All four brothers became prominent figures in Leeds public life: Francis and Arthur ran the family firm Charles headed legal firm Dibb Lupton and Hugh was chairman of Hathorn Davey \u0026amp Co, a hydraulic engineering company. Together, the tentacles of their influence reached across the city.But the family was also struck by tragedy.Arthur’s wife Harriot, who was a cousin of Beatrix Potter’s mother Helen, died in childbirth in 1888, at the age of 35, before her famous cousin published her first children’s book The Tale of Peter Rabbit, leaving her husband a widower with three children Arthur, two, Elinor, one, and baby Elizabeth.

Forensic artist...William¿s touching tribute to his father¿s tragic mentor:...Share this articleFour decades later, catastrophe struck again - and Arthur, who was pro-vice-chancellor of Leeds University, was again left bereft - when his oldest son Arthur, was involved in a horrific riding accident.On 14 December 1928, while riding with the Bramham Hunt, his horse failed to take a fence, throwing him to the ground, rolling on top of him and fracturing his pelvis. Within 11 months he was dead. A year later his father Arthur succumbed to grief.It was Hugo Lupton, son of Arthur’s younger brother Hugh and cousin of Kate’s great-grandmother Olive, who was responsible for linking the Luptons to Arthur Ransome.An old Wellingtonian and Trinity College alumnus, who won a Military Cross for his service in France, he married the author’s sister Joyce in 1920 and had four children Francis, in 1921, Arthur, in 1924, Cecily, in 1927, and Geoffrey, in 1930, ensuring the name Arthur went down through the generations.

Her paternal grandfather and uncle were both known as Charlie, although they were both christened Stephen Charles.The elder Charlie Goldsmith – Kate’s great-grandfather – was born at home in Acton, Middlesex, in 1886, and brought up in Southall. When he left home he lived in Uxbridge, where he worked as a mechanic and met his future wife Edith.A tiny woman, under 5 ft tall and weighing 7 stone, she was disfigured by a huge scar on her torso, which she had got during a narrow escape from death when she was a toddler.‘Grandad used to light his cigar in his big oil stove in the hall of the big house where they lived,’ his daughter Alice Tomlinson, the only one of his children still alive at 106 told me.‘He would roll a piece of paper up and put it in the stove and light his cigar. of course, when he went out, my mum copied. She had a go doing the same thing and nearly burned herself to death.’Charlie and Edith got married at Uxbridge Register office in 1909. She was four months pregnant with their eldest child, whom they named after his father.When Charlie Jnr was five years old, his father signed up, serving in France with the Royal Fusiliers, initially in the trenches and afterwards in the cookhouse. He was one of Kitchener’s ‘shilling men’.Luckily, he survived the war but returned home with emphysema. The father-of-six died in 1938, when his oldest son Charlie was 28 years old, and his youngest son, Kate’s grandfather Ronald was just six years old. His widow Edith was forced to move into a condemned flat and go to work at the local factory.Less than a century later, their great-granddaughter is living in Kensington Palace.  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/27/20/4B77441D00000578-0-image-m-21_1524856582755.jpg","title":"Is royal baby look like","story":"    How a forensic artist predicted Prince Louis of Cambridge will look in years to comeThe Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have finally revealed the name of their newborn son, and this is how he could look in years to come.A forensic artist, who is based in Washington D.C, studied recent photographs of Prince William, Kate and their two eldest children.Joe Mullins then put together an image of what he predicts Prince Louis will look like in the future.According to Mr Mullins\u0027 predictions the youngster will have blue eyes, dark blonde hair and full cheeks.He has previously released images of what he predicted Prince George and Princess Charlotte would look like as they grew up.At the time Mr Mullins\u0027 pictures suggested that the children would both have dark hair and blue eyes.  Royalists and bookmakers alike have waited patiently since Monday to find out the name of the new arrival and fifth in line to the throne.     Joe Mullins has previously released images of what he predicted Prince George and Princess Charlotte would look like as they grew upThe name serves as a poignant tribute to Prince Charles\u0027 beloved great-uncle, mentor and \u0027honorary grandfather\u0027, Lord Mountbatten, who was killed in 1979 when the IRA placed a bomb in his fishing boat.   More than 100,000 bets were placed across the UK betting industry on the baby name, with both Albert and Arthur leading the way as the bookmakers\u0027 favourite.Legoland to give free entry to anyone called Louis after...Share this articleBut William and Kate have plumped for a moniker used for centuries across the Channel by the French, who have had 18 kings called Louis.    Following the baby\u0027s arrival, Prince Harry shifts down the line of succession to sixth place. The Duke of York, who was born second in line, has moved to seventh and Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie to eighth and ninth.             According to Mr Mullins\u0027 predictions the youngster will have blue eyes, dark blonde hair and full cheeksAndrew falling out of the top six means he will no longer have to ask the Queen for permission to marry - unlike Charles, William, George, Charlotte and Harry.The first six people in the line of succession must have the Queen\u0027s consent before they can marry on May 19, as set out by the Succession to the Crown Act 2013.The act\u0027s introduction also saw sex removed as a determining factor in the line of succession.It has also been claimed that the royal baby has been born a commoner.Royal historian Marlene Koenig told Town and Country: \u0027It sounds complicated, but in the UK, the only people who are not commoners are the Sovereign and peers of the realm, Duke, Marquess, Earl, Viscount, and Baron.\u0027  It was always thought that William and Kate would go on to have three children.Kate is one of three and had a happy home life with her sister, Pippa Matthews, and brother, James Middleton, and is close to both of her siblings.But William may need to adjust to caring for a newborn once again.Kate joked in the months leading up to her due date that her husband was \u0027in denial\u0027 about having a third.By having more than two children, William and Kate are following in the footsteps of the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, who went on to have four children - although there was a gap of 10 years between their second child, Anne, and third, Andrew. Is this what royal baby could look like?

It requires new thinking and tough trade-offs – from how we deal with the fiscal pressures of an ageing society in a way that is generationally fair, to how we deliver the housing young people need while respecting the communities everyone values.\u0027We need our political leaders to rise to this challenge with an appeal to all generations. We can deliver the health and care older generations deserve without simply asking younger workers to bear all the costs. We can do more to promote education and skills, especially for those who are not on the university route.\u0027We can provide more security for young people, from the jobs they do to the homes they rent. And we can show younger generations that owning a home is a reality, not a distant prospect in 21st-century Britain.\u0027"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/29/08/4BAB44AD00000578-0-image-m-10_1524987218797.jpg","title":"Britains oldest parents using surrogate mother child taken away social services","story":"    A couple who have become Britain\u0027s oldest parents through use of a surrogate mother at the ages of 63 and 65 are left \u0027devastated\u0027 after their baby was taken away by social services (stock image)It was decided that the necessary measures to ensure the child\u0027s well-being had not been taken and so social services took the baby into care, reported The Sun.The adoptive parents spent more than £100,000 on the surrogate mother, who was in her 30s.Police \u0027free three slaves\u0027 when they stop more than 80...Eight teenagers aged between 11 and 18 arrested after stolen...Share this articleIt is believed that she was impregnated using the 65-year-old father\u0027s sperm and a donor egg.They use a clinic abroad to complete the procedure as most in the UK would not deal with a couple their age.

It’s very vibrant, very energetic, very different. He was probably covered in paint by the end. Is it a piece of performance art? I tried to see if I could see the scuff of the ball and the heel of his shoe in the paint.It could even be seen as a self-portrait in an abstract way because it represents him, the tennis player.I could almost see him with racquet in one hand and his tennis ball covered in paint in the other, whacking a ball against the canvas. But we’ve got to be a little bit tongue-in-cheek. I wouldn’t imagine that he’s saying, ‘I’m an artist’. But perhaps his wife Kim Sears, who is a fantastic dog portraitist, has had a great influence on him.If Pollock had picked up a tennis racquet we wouldn’t have said he’s going to win Wimbledon tomorrow.

Indeed, in what appeared to be an effort to crack a joke, self-deprecating Kim Jong-un told the South’s Mr Moon that he was sorry that the timing of the early morning missile test had led to him being woken up at an anti-social hour.This sudden change in mood music raises an intriguing question: could this young despot might be positioning himself as his region’s version of Mikhail Gorbachev, the Soviet Communist leader whose overtures to the West helped bring about the end of the Cold War?Of course, reading tea-leaves from Pyongyang is often a mug’s game, given that little is known regarding even very basic details of life inside the secretive far-Left dictatorship. The country is largely closed to foreign reporters and visitors, aside from those who visit on closely chaperoned tours, and foreign diplomats have little access to reliable intelligence.There is no free press, and the country’s version of the internet, the kwangmyong, which is largely used by academics and civil servants, reportedly permits access to a mere 28 websites.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tells Kim Jong Un that he...Dennis Rodman claims he\u0027s responsible for easing tension...Share this articleYet what little we do know about Kim Jong-un suggests that his life has given him far more of an understanding of Western values than either his immediate predecessor and father, Kim Jong-il, or his grandfather Kim Il-Sung, who ruled the country with an iron fist from 1948 until his death in 1994.Crucial in this context is the fact that, aged 15, Jong-un was sent to an exclusive international college near Berne in Switzerland, before moving to the nearby Liebefeld-Steinholzli state school.Living there under a pseudonym, Un Pak, he was described to classmates as the son of a diplomat.Though apparently displaying little academic prowess, he developed a lifelong passion for Disney films and basketball, becoming a supporter of the pre-eminent U.S. team of the era, the Chicago Bulls.The team’s former star player Dennis Rodman has in recent years conducted several high-profile visits to Pyongyang.Nowadays a reality TV personality, with multiple tattoos and piercings, Rodman was almost certainly paid for the privilege.          \u0027U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo last night said there was now real opportunity for a nuclear deal\u0027However there was also some truth in the suggestion that, as he put it, the visits helped to ‘break the ice’ between the nations. The Washington Post newspaper went so far last year as to speculate that Trump had given a 2017 visit his blessing, as a way to open a channel of communication between the countries.Aside from basketball, the young Kim Jong-un is said to have developed a passion for ‘rosti’ – the calorie-laden Swiss national potato dish in the style of a fritter, which contributed to his subsequent obesity — and spent plenty of time on his host nation’s ski slopes.Perhaps that explains why he has not only recently ordered the construction of Masik Pass — a new multi-million-pound ski resort — but was also anxious to send a large delegation to this year’s Winter Olympics, which were held in the South. A large orchestra, and squad of cheerleaders, turned out to support the North Korean team, while several diplomats met their counterparts from over the border, helping build momentum for last week’s summit.          \u0027Kim Jong-un’s wife Ri Sol-Ju is believed to have provided informal elocution lessons\u0027Time in the West also gave Kim Jong-un a far more cultured manner than his father, who was almost never heard speaking publicly (TV tended to voiceover images of his addresses), and whose absurdly-shrill real voice was only revealed when tape recordings were leaked of his calls to a kidnapped South Korean actress he was obsessed with.As a result, Kim Jong-un’s address on Friday, at which he described the two Koreas as ‘one nation’ who would in future ‘share in prosperity’ was confidently delivered.His wife Ri Sol-Ju is believed to have provided informal elocution lessons.Another key factor behind Kim Jong-Un’s sudden conversion to the pursuit of peace is likely to be straightforward pragmatism.Indeed, there are those who believe that, rather from being hot headed and impulsive, he is actually a calculating premier. To thisend, it’s worth noting that when he took office in 2011, at the tender age of 29, Kim Jong-un promised to bring his people prosperity and give their nation status as a nuclear power.Years of sanctions have since crippled North Korea’s economy, with its entire annual GDP of $40 billion coming in at under 2 per cent that of the South. Though it has been partly propped up by China, that support is thought to have evaporated after recent missile tests, with Beijing anxious to avoid economic refugees heading over its border.Abandoning nuclear ambitions will therefore give Kim Jong-un a sporting chance of keeping at least one of his promises.Indeed reports from Friday’s state dinner with the South suggest that — having put away a few glasses of champagne — he somewhat unexpectedly confessed that he was ‘embarrassed’ by his nation’s ‘poor infrastructure’ and determined to do something about it.That could just be the drink talking (there is some suggestion that he looked ‘bleary eyed’ during the meal) but it seems apparent even a mild thaw in relations will at this stage serve the interest of almost every player in the region, and also the U.S. (since Mr Trump can present it as a diplomatic triumph).In the longer term, of course, the big question is whether Kim Jong-un will actually keep his promises of nuclear disarmament.A decade ago, for example, foreign journalists were invited to watch his regime destroying a nuclear reactor cooling tower, in an effort to stave off sanctions. Yet it later turned out that, behind the scenes, they were already building a second facility.This time, cynics wonder if something similar is afoot. Indeed some analysts believe that the Punggye-ri underground test site, which he has so graciously pledged to publicly destroy, is in fact already useless because previous tests have caused structural damage.Mr Kim of course insists otherwise, using Friday’s State banquet to inform the South that the facility contains at least two tunnels which are currently in ‘good condition’. And so the ‘Rocket Man’ continues to rebrand himself as a man of peace — while the world prays he’s telling the truth. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/30/02/4BB17C5B00000578-5672605-The_homestead_s_eerie_history_which_involves_a_number_of_deaths_-a-29_1525053143896.jpg","title":"Haunted tourist attraction scary visitors Australia","story":"    Oakabella Homestead, in the Western Australian countryside, has been forced to reconsider its marketing strategy in order to make itself less scary to potential visitors\u0027There are some articles we have read online and it is quite interesting to read the feedback,\u0027 said Ms Turner.\u0027Not everyone is into ghosts and that was definitely portrayed in the Facebook comments.\u0027People will not come here if they think it is haunted so that is why we are bringing it back to the history.\u0027          The homestead\u0027s eerie history - which involves a number of deaths at the site, and was previously exploited in the form of ghost tours - was keeping a lot of tourists awayThe new business model will aim to portray Oakabella Homestead less as a haunt of unruly spirits and more a place of endless horizons and rich Australian history.Stargazing, campfires and traditional bush tucker are just a few of the things in the revamped purview.\u0027We ourselves are more passionate about the history side of things,\u0027 said Mr Snelson.\u0027The spiritual ghost side of things is something we are a bit less believing in.\u0027           The notion of ghosts and spirits was proving a particularly hard sell for Chinese tourists          New business owners Belinda Turner and Brian Snelson are trying to reinvent the homestead\u0027s image, focusing on the location\u0027s heritage history, great outdoors and starry skies The issue, of course, is that not everyone seemed to be taking these tales of terror so lightly.Haunted homesteads can prove a tough sell for anyone with even the slightest of superstitions - and Chinese tourists in particular were steering clear of Oakabella.\u0027I am Chinese and I have lived in Australia but if you tell me that this place is the most haunted estate then I would be scared,\u0027 said Hanjie Davis, economic development officer for the City of Greater Geraldton. \u0027If you have ghosts, my first impression is that I don\u0027t want to go there. Don\u0027t forget your Geiger counter!

Workshops will be run to give parents ‘simple, straightforward strategies’ which they can take home and use with pre-school children.Mr Hinds said last night: ‘We know there is a gap in child development that can be visible at age five. The easiest way to measure it is the “word gap”.‘Where you are, in development terms, at age five and at the start of school, obviously makes a significant difference to your ability to get the most out of infant school and then junior school education.’The OUP report found that when children arrive unable to understand basic phrases, they find it much harder to follow commands, make friends and learn how to read. In the long term, it can lead to low confidence, underachievement and poor behaviour.      Music lessons boosts a child’s brainpower as their memory...Is this Britain\u0027s most hipster school?

He added that he and wife Jacqui, a teacher, had enjoyed reading books with their three children. ‘Reading to children obviously makes a huge difference,’ he said. ‘Many, many parents spend an awful lot of time doing that.‘The important thing is to be reading, and to be giving feedback, and sitting together, and all of those things that parents dedicate so much time to.’Mr Hinds – who became Education Secretary in January, taking over from Justine Greening – said: ‘Schools do a great job on accelerating development. But it is still the case that with the differences that are discernible even at age five or sometimes even before, it is all too depressingly predictable what some of the later differences in attainment will be at 16 or 18.‘The earliest years are where there is the greatest leverage for improving social mobility and improving children’s opportunity to fulfil their potential.’          Experts say disadvantaged children are disproportionately affected by the growing problem (file photo)However, he said some parents – especially those juggling many different responsibilities or jobs – may be finding it hard to dedicate enough time to helping their children develop skills.He said: ‘It’s always hard for parents and, yes, there are extra pressures in the modern world. It is difficult. Parents know that, and that’s why it’s so important when you can find ways… for professionals to give hints and tips to make it easier – I think that’s something that parents can find very valuable.’Today Mr Hinds is launching a £5 million pilot scheme in the North of England to help parents teach their children vocabulary at home through reading and singing nursery rhymes. It will be run by the Education Endowment Foundation (EEF) and will provide workshops in nurseries, community centres and homes. The projects found to be most effective could later be rolled out across the country.In addition, £8.5 million has been made available to councils across the country for language and literacy development projects for disadvantaged children.EEF chief executive Sir Kevan Collins said: ‘By testing different ways of tackling issues like the early years “word gap”, this new fund will give us much-needed information about how we can give parents the tools they need to give their child the very best start in life.’"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/18/09/05D76DB9000003E8-0-image-a-27_1524038970727.jpg","title":"Murray swaps tennis strokes brush strokes","story":"    The two-time Wimbledon winner has picked up a brush while recovering from injuryThe father of two – whose wife Kim Sears paints pet portraits – is due to make a comeback soon after hip surgery in January.

There was quite a lot of bruising around and suffering.’Footage also showed calves in small hutches, each one surrounded by a metal fence. Farmers can take newborn calves from their mothers to these hutches for the first eight weeks of their lives. But Viva said ear-tag data suggested these calves were 16 weeks old and too big for the hutches, breaching welfare rules.A few miles away in south Devon is Halswell Farm, part of the Arla dairy organisation. It is the UK’s second largest dairy firm supplying milk to supermarkets and owns popular brands such as Cravendale and Anchor butter.At Halswell, Viva found an old, apparently emaciated cow with an injured back leg that was barely able to walk. Miss Gellatley added: ‘There were also countless examples of shockingly oversized and distorted udders.’ Viva has complained about both farms to the watchdog for farm animal welfare, the Animal \u0026amp Plant Health Agency. But the Carpenter family’s solicitors, Clarke Willmott, said a vet had examined its cows on April 19.It said ‘no animal welfare issues were identified’.

The Koreas had used the same time zone for decades before the North created its own Pyongyang Time in 2015 by setting the clock 30 minutes behind South Korea and Japan. While Pyongyang says it will close its nuclear test site next month, Kim and Moon did not outline concrete measures to be taken to achieve that goal of denuclearization. Trump\u0027s new national security adviser John Bolton said in an interview with CBS News, also aired Sunday, that Kim may have \u0027concrete and tangible\u0027 ideas about giving up his nuclear arms program \u0027and we should hear him out.\u0027But he and Pompeo cautioned that North Korea has a history of reneging on its commitments. Bolton said that a recent absence of weapons and missile tests by North Korea \u0027could be a very positive sign\u0027 or a sign that the programs have reached advanced stages and testing is no longer needed.

In June 2008, international broadcasters were allowed to air the demolition of a cooling tower at the Nyongbyon reactor site, a year after the North reached an agreement with the U.S. and four other nations to disable its nuclear facilities in return for an aid package worth about $400 million.But the deal eventually collapsed after North Korea refused to accept U.S.-proposed verification methods, and the country went on to conduct its second nuclear test detonation in May 2009. Pompeo also said that at Trump\u0027s direction, he spoke with Kim about the release of three U.S. citizens detained by North Korea.

Indeed, in what appeared to be an effort to crack a joke, self-deprecating Kim Jong-un told the South’s Mr Moon that he was sorry that the timing of the early morning missile test had led to him being woken up at an anti-social hour.This sudden change in mood music raises an intriguing question: could this young despot might be positioning himself as his region’s version of Mikhail Gorbachev, the Soviet Communist leader whose overtures to the West helped bring about the end of the Cold War?Of course, reading tea-leaves from Pyongyang is often a mug’s game, given that little is known regarding even very basic details of life inside the secretive far-Left dictatorship. The country is largely closed to foreign reporters and visitors, aside from those who visit on closely chaperoned tours, and foreign diplomats have little access to reliable intelligence.There is no free press, and the country’s version of the internet, the kwangmyong, which is largely used by academics and civil servants, reportedly permits access to a mere 28 websites.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tells Kim Jong Un that he...Dennis Rodman claims he\u0027s responsible for easing tension...Share this articleYet what little we do know about Kim Jong-un suggests that his life has given him far more of an understanding of Western values than either his immediate predecessor and father, Kim Jong-il, or his grandfather Kim Il-Sung, who ruled the country with an iron fist from 1948 until his death in 1994.Crucial in this context is the fact that, aged 15, Jong-un was sent to an exclusive international college near Berne in Switzerland, before moving to the nearby Liebefeld-Steinholzli state school.Living there under a pseudonym, Un Pak, he was described to classmates as the son of a diplomat.Though apparently displaying little academic prowess, he developed a lifelong passion for Disney films and basketball, becoming a supporter of the pre-eminent U.S. team of the era, the Chicago Bulls.The team’s former star player Dennis Rodman has in recent years conducted several high-profile visits to Pyongyang.Nowadays a reality TV personality, with multiple tattoos and piercings, Rodman was almost certainly paid for the privilege.          \u0027U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo last night said there was now real opportunity for a nuclear deal\u0027However there was also some truth in the suggestion that, as he put it, the visits helped to ‘break the ice’ between the nations. The Washington Post newspaper went so far last year as to speculate that Trump had given a 2017 visit his blessing, as a way to open a channel of communication between the countries.Aside from basketball, the young Kim Jong-un is said to have developed a passion for ‘rosti’ – the calorie-laden Swiss national potato dish in the style of a fritter, which contributed to his subsequent obesity — and spent plenty of time on his host nation’s ski slopes.Perhaps that explains why he has not only recently ordered the construction of Masik Pass — a new multi-million-pound ski resort — but was also anxious to send a large delegation to this year’s Winter Olympics, which were held in the South. A large orchestra, and squad of cheerleaders, turned out to support the North Korean team, while several diplomats met their counterparts from over the border, helping build momentum for last week’s summit.          \u0027Kim Jong-un’s wife Ri Sol-Ju is believed to have provided informal elocution lessons\u0027Time in the West also gave Kim Jong-un a far more cultured manner than his father, who was almost never heard speaking publicly (TV tended to voiceover images of his addresses), and whose absurdly-shrill real voice was only revealed when tape recordings were leaked of his calls to a kidnapped South Korean actress he was obsessed with.As a result, Kim Jong-un’s address on Friday, at which he described the two Koreas as ‘one nation’ who would in future ‘share in prosperity’ was confidently delivered.His wife Ri Sol-Ju is believed to have provided informal elocution lessons.Another key factor behind Kim Jong-Un’s sudden conversion to the pursuit of peace is likely to be straightforward pragmatism.Indeed, there are those who believe that, rather from being hot headed and impulsive, he is actually a calculating premier. To thisend, it’s worth noting that when he took office in 2011, at the tender age of 29, Kim Jong-un promised to bring his people prosperity and give their nation status as a nuclear power.Years of sanctions have since crippled North Korea’s economy, with its entire annual GDP of $40 billion coming in at under 2 per cent that of the South. Though it has been partly propped up by China, that support is thought to have evaporated after recent missile tests, with Beijing anxious to avoid economic refugees heading over its border.Abandoning nuclear ambitions will therefore give Kim Jong-un a sporting chance of keeping at least one of his promises.Indeed reports from Friday’s state dinner with the South suggest that — having put away a few glasses of champagne — he somewhat unexpectedly confessed that he was ‘embarrassed’ by his nation’s ‘poor infrastructure’ and determined to do something about it.That could just be the drink talking (there is some suggestion that he looked ‘bleary eyed’ during the meal) but it seems apparent even a mild thaw in relations will at this stage serve the interest of almost every player in the region, and also the U.S. (since Mr Trump can present it as a diplomatic triumph).In the longer term, of course, the big question is whether Kim Jong-un will actually keep his promises of nuclear disarmament.A decade ago, for example, foreign journalists were invited to watch his regime destroying a nuclear reactor cooling tower, in an effort to stave off sanctions. Yet it later turned out that, behind the scenes, they were already building a second facility.This time, cynics wonder if something similar is afoot. Indeed some analysts believe that the Punggye-ri underground test site, which he has so graciously pledged to publicly destroy, is in fact already useless because previous tests have caused structural damage.Mr Kim of course insists otherwise, using Friday’s State banquet to inform the South that the facility contains at least two tunnels which are currently in ‘good condition’. And so the ‘Rocket Man’ continues to rebrand himself as a man of peace — while the world prays he’s telling the truth. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/30/04/4BAEF1D600000578-5672651-The_New_Shepard_Rocket_launching_on_its_eighth_overall_test_flig-a-3_1525059567017.jpg","title":"Jeff Bezos Blue Origin launches Mission 8 New Shepherd rocket smooth test flight Texas","story":"    Blue Origin, a company owned by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, successfully launched its eighth rocket test flight from West Texas on Sunday Bezos is shown here at the unveiling of the Blue Origin New Shepard system during the Space Symposium in Colorado Springs, Colorado, on April 5, 2017\u0027Mannequin Skywalker is ready for his 2nd mission on board New Shepard.

One of them, Jonas Bendiksen, a Norwegian photographer, has won international awards for his pictures of people just about as far away from home as can be – from isolated communities in newly independent states of the former Soviet Union to a book of photographs of urban slums around the world.Turning his camera toward the intimate, Bendiksen used the opportunity to track the arrival of his new baby daughter, Billie, through his wife Anna’s pregnancy to the birth. In publishing the pictures in Magnum’s book Bendiksen, who has a photojournalist’s distrust of the familiar, is apologetic about them. “These are some of the most important pictures I’ll ever take,” he notes. “But not because they are necessarily very interesting for others to see.” You have the sense he needn’t have worried.The picture on this page was the last of the home photographs Bendiksen took, showing Billie adrift on a table top amid the familiar plastic detritus of a children’s party. The deep infant sleep carries with it not only an ever-present trace of parental anxiety – what if Billie should roll? – but also an edge of lovely private comedy: what kind of world, of half-drunk dregs and abandoned shades and empty chairs has this child fallen into? In this week when baby photographs have been front-page news, it also goes to prove what newspaper picture editors have long known – that no other subject moves so effortlessly from the particular to the universal.Home, a collaboration between Fujifilm and Magnum Photos, runs from 18-27 May 2018 at the Vinyl Factory, London W1.

In the space of one perfectly weighted novel, Cusk’s measured self-effacement served to make so much literary fiction appear almost pestering in its attention-seeking.Instead of brandishing an omniscient voice, her narrator – Faye, a middle-aged orced writer – was astutely passive, emerging only as a kind of enigmatic reflection in the characters she met and the stories they eagerly told her. It was as if more conventional styles of narration had been suddenly exposed as dubious varieties of mansplaining.She repeated the feat with the coolly amusing Transit, in which the elusive Faye (although she shares some biographical details with Cusk, there is precious little self-description even her name is mentioned only once in each book) moved into a grim house, was snogged by the chair of a literary panel, and remained a heroically attentive listener.The final book in the series, Kudos, is set abroad, somewhere in southern Europe (though neither the city nor country is ever named), where Faye attends another literary festival. Dislocation, both geographical and emotional, is at the centre of the trilogy. Almost everyone Faye encounters is seeking a place in the world that life has in one way or another unloosened from their needy grasp.The novel begins, like Outline, on an aeroplane, where once again the man sitting next to Faye unburdens himself of his life story. First time round, that set-up seemed to me a boldly captivating introduction to our quasi-absent narrator, (perhaps in part because the longest conversation a stranger has ever held with me on a plane is a request to get up so that she can go to the loo). This time, for all Cusk’s exquisite control, the exchange is more contrived, or at least less persuasively realised. Within no time, the man is recalling weeping helplessly as he listened to his daughter playing the oboe at a concert. When Faye asks him why he had cried, he says that he’d always been worried that there was something wrong with his daughter.“I said it seemed to me people often found it easier to entertain that idea about their children than about themselves,” Faye tells us, in one of her rare but penetrating observations. Even though her fellow passenger goes on to articulate a pronounced masculine anger, he is positively reserved, really quite taciturn, in comparison with the testimonies offered to Faye at the other end of her journey.While most of the characters in the trilogy have been blessed with an unnaturally eloquent talent for personal revelation, in Kudos the confessions attain a level of intellectual abstraction that makes them confusingly indistinguishable from one another. In the previous books there were small but important shifts in tone – for example, a hairdresser in Transit was thoughtfully perceptive, but his language and phrasing did not tower over his job. However, in Kudos everyone – a youthful city guide, a ski instructor, even Faye’s young son – speaks like George Steiner in therapy.The novel is peopled by free-floating founts of intellectualism, struggling with the social shackles that paradoxically continue to bind them. It’s as if Cusk has wearied of the business of constructing characters in which to place her ideas, as though characterisation were itself a kind of stifling confinement.Like her fellow novelist Deborah Levy, Cusk is aware that freedom is never free. In the discussions that Faye ignites as effortlessly as a chainsmoker lighting a cigarette, the cost that her interlocutors recount is a sense of identity.Among many other things, the trilogy is a bravura interrogation of the social habits and assumptions that, assembled together, start to look suspiciously like a man’s world in which women just so happen to live. Is Faye long-suffering? Curious? Harried? Detached? Inscrutable? In an obvious sense these questions are beside the point, because she acts as the largely silent conduit through which explorations of personal struggle and the grappling for self-knowledge are told.But her abnegation also carries a woman’s understanding of a certain kind of female invisibility. If we sense Faye’s critical appraisal of the men and women she meets, it’s conveyed through a kind of stoical impassivity in the face of a series of long, self-analytical monologues.This one-way traffic reaches a satirical density when Faye is interviewed by several journalists in turn, all but one of whom spend their allotted time talking about themselves. It reminded me of those dreaded Q\u0026ampA sessions at literary events in which members of the audience get up and deliver extended statements on their worldviews under the diaphanous guise of asking a question.Although Cusk is far from a didactic writer (one of Faye’s interviewers helpfully performs the role of a feminist critic), she is intimately concerned with the architecture of women’s lives, the institutions and expectations – marriage, motherhood, loyalty – that continue to shape everyday experiences.But Cusk is too sophisticated a writer to cast women as innocent victims. In Kudos they are more often collaborators and conspirators in their own subjection. No torch-carrier for female solidarity, Cusk once wrote a caustic, if entertaining, account of an all-female book group of which she was briefly a member. And one suspects there’s more than a hint of ventriloquism going on with the writer Faye meets, who notes: “It’s a saddening thought… that when a group of women get together, far from advancing the cause of femininity, they end up pathologising it.”The most conspicuous cause that Cusk has advanced in these three books is her already considerable reputation as a novelist. They stand as a landmark in 21st-century English literature, the culmination of an artist’s unshakable efforts to forge her own path.Success, of course, brings its own challenges. This trilogy has been compared a little unimaginatively to the auto-fiction of Karl Ove Knausgaard. The two do, however, share the problem of where to go, having broken such fertile new ground. There were times in Kudos when I felt an authorial impatience with the form Cusk has so profitably unearthed, as though something gloriously fruitful was in danger of hardening into a stubborn conceit. But such nagging apprehensions were in the end extinguished by an unsettling and comically primal final scene that, like so much else in these books, will live long in the memory.• Kudos by Rachel Cusk is published by Faber (£16.99).

The merger is not expected to complete until the second half of next year as regulators crunch the numbers on potential overlap between the two groups’ stores. Mike Coupe, the Sainsbury’s chief executive who plans to lead the merged business, said the deal was a “transformational opportunity to create a new force in UK retail, which will be more competitive and give customers more of what they want now and in the future”.While this could still mean that Sainsbury’s would have to offload outlets to other retailers, Coupe suggested disposals would not be necessary, partly because the two chains operate largely in different geographic areas. The retail landscape has also changed dramatically since 2003, with more competition from the likes of Amazon, Aldi and Lidl.“Online grocery shopping didn’t exist in 2003 and neither was there the presence of discounters or convenience stores more broadly,” Coupe said. The CMA confirmed on Monday that the deal would be subject to investigation and Sainsbury’s said it had asked the regulator to skip straight to the “phase two” detailed stage of investigation.Coupe said regulators would be mainly concerned by the benefits for customers, which would include lower prices and more choice about how they shopped as a result of investment in technology. He said the merger would deliver at least £500m in cost savings and other benefits, largely as a result of improved efficiency and better deals with suppliers. Putting Argos outlets into Asda stores is expected to bring about £75m of those benefits.Unions have expressed concerns about potential job cuts. But Coupe said jobs would be created and Asda would continue to be run from Leeds with its own chief executive, likely to be current boss Roger Burnley, who only recently joined Asda from Sainsbury’s.Sainsbury’s said the board of the combined group would be headed by its chairman. But the supermarket confirmed separately that it had begun a hunt to replace its current chairman, David Tyler, who has been in post for eight years.Coupe said the merger would “create a business that is more dynamic, more adaptable, more resilient and an even bigger contributor to the UK economy”. “Having worked at Asda before Sainsbury’s,” he added, “I understand the culture and the businesses well and believe they are the best possible fit. This creates a great deal for customers, colleagues, suppliers and shareholders and I am excited about the opportunities ahead and what we can achieve together.” He insisted that the Sainsbury’s brand, which has prided itself on better welfare and food quality standards, would not be damaged by association with Walmart, an international retail giant best known for its low prices.The deal will be seen as a way for Walmart, which bought Asda nearly 20 years ago, to take a step back from the UK market where it is struggling to compete with the rise of discounters Aldi and Lidl as well as Tesco, the UK’s biggest supermarket chain which controls almost a third of the grocery market.But in a statement issued on Monday morning, Sainsbury’s said Walmart would remain a long-term shareholder in the combined group with two representatives on its board. Judith McKenna, the chief executive of Walmart International, said: “We believe this combination will create a dynamic new retail player better positioned for even more success in a fast-changing and competitive UK market.”She said Walmart was interested expanding Sainsbury’s Argos chain internationally and could help the combined business by introducing new technology and better deals on non-food goods."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/33749d7cee84da42c5e514e4a78612c0d24a74de/0_32_4576_2746/master/4576.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=45d75bc0fe3cf1bcb723719b25523df1","title":"tsb online banking internet business it","story":"Users still facing problems with internet and business services after bungled IT upgradeTSB’s IT meltdown has entered its second week, with some customers still unable to access their accounts or make payments.One of the worst crises in British banking was caused by a botched migration of data from one IT system to another and has affected up to 1.9 million mobile and online banking customers at the Spanish-owned bank.

That bet seems to be unravelling, as Sainsbury’s shares hit their highest level in almost four years.As The Times explained this morning: A little over a tenth of Sainsbury’s shares were being shorted going into the weekend, with investors betting on a drop in the supermarket’s share price.Large London-based hedge funds such as Odey Asset Management, GLG and Marshall Wace have short positions in Sainsbury’s amid investor anxiety about the future facing traditional retailers.Andy Brian, head of retail at Gordons law firm, also believes store closure are inevitable if this deal isn’t blocked by the competition authorities:“One thing is clear despite what is being said officially, stores would have to close. That’s not necessarily a bad thing for the brands, although it would of course be a bad thing for those store employees.Moving forwards, one theory is that this deal could allow Sainsbury’s the freedom to compete hard against M\u0026ampS Food and Waitrose at the top end of the grocery market and leave Asda to compete further on price against the other mid-market players, as well as Aldi and Lidl.Research group Edison have estimated that around 70 Asda stores could be vulnerable to sale or closure, as they’re rather close to a Sainsbury’s outlet.The Federation of Small Businesses is concerned that small suppliers will be treated roughly if Sainsbury’s and Asda are allowed to form a new retail titan.FSB chairman Mike Cherry says regulators must demand firm commitments before green-lighting the deal, as Sainsbury is already talking about £500m of cost savings and a boost to earnings. “A merger of this size will concentrate a lot of power in the hands of one giant company, and it’s important that power isn’t misused to coerce small suppliers into accepting unfair contracts and poor payment terms.“Those at the top of Sainsbury’s and Asda should explain how they plan to merge these two supply chains fairly, and give reassurance that cost savings won’t be achieved simply by milking their small suppliers for all they’re worth.“When investigating this proposed merger, the Competition and Markets Authority should be looking for cast-iron commitments that a positive standard will be set for working with smaller suppliers.Data firm Allies has created an interactive map, showing exactly where Sainsbury’s and Asda’s stores are today.It also shows Argos outlets (Sainsbury’s acquired Argos in 2016), so it gives a good idea of where there might be competition issues.Here are the vital statistics about today’s merger - showing how a combined Sainsbury’s and Asda will leap-frog Tesco:Sainsbury’s chief executive, Mike Coupe, has been speaking to journalists.However, the regulators may insist that some stores are sold off. There are scores of places where Sainsbury and Asda stores are close by, giving the combined company a dominant position.Britain’s unions are demanding guarantees for workers at Asda.Tim Roache, general secretary of the GMB, fears that staff at the supermarket will pay the price as Sainsbury pursues the £500m of cost savings promised this morning:“Hundreds of thousands of workers stand to be affected, and all know such announcements tend to be followed by management speak like ‘rationalisation’ in the name of ‘efficiency’. What that usually means is job losses or cuts to pay, terms and conditions which would be wholly unacceptable. Not least because ASDA workers have already voluntarily agreed to change their contracts to be more flexible in order to play their part and help their employer be more profitable.”“It is quite right to be asking now in whose interests this proposed merger is being tabled. Is it workers and customers or the shareholders and speculators not happy with the hundreds of millions they already make in a year?”Roache is also unhappy that the deal leaked over the weekend, leaving staff worried about their future:“Imagine turning up to your Saturday afternoon shifts only to learn this news, with no word from your employer at all - just speculation in the media. Our members are concerned for their futures and angry they’ve been kept in the dark.”“ASDA is hugely profitable supermarket, posting hundreds of millions in profit and backed by hundreds of billions from their US parent company, Walmart. Asda’s success has been built on the back of its workers and it is they who now need and deserve answers and reassurances about their futures - that’s the least they deserve, and the very least their union will be demanding.” This deal will lead to job cuts and a painful squeeze on suppliers, warns John Colley, professor at Warwick Business School.Colley predicts that staff will be “rationalised” (ie, laid off) at Sainsbury and Asda’s headquarters, in their regional management, and in their distribution operations.“Ultimately there has to be job losses and the suppliers will have to pay through lower prices for the larger volumes they may see. Customers will see reduced choice and the current price war is likely to persist.Colley also expects some stores will be sold off to rivals, although the largest supermarkets may not be in demand, and could close instead.He also warns that the task of completing the deal could be a “significant distraction” for both companies.This will not entirely be bad news for the competitors who should make share gains as a consequence.”Richard Lim, chief executive, Retail Economics says this deal would create a powerful new competitor:The combined retail group would create significant scale. It would enable better buying terms, the integration of Argos within Asda and drive operating efficiencies expected to deliver cost-savings of at least £500 million.The potential tie-up could deliver price reductions across a range of products, putting it in a position to challenge Tesco and the discounters head-on.That’s why Sainsbury’s shares are going like a rocket this morning, while Tesco is under the cosh."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf3e831c060f6496af0e3ef5b5f74732111f8287/0_0_900_691/master/900.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a6505930f8bf4d3e98e96b7f9a4f4ef8 700w","title":"a comedian is being held to higher standards than the president","story":"Comparing Michelle Wolf’s speech to what Trump gets away with is satisfying but it is ultimately empty calories "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/969118367ed07fbacdea995e65bfe60e887a9c2e/168_89_1832_1099/master/1832.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5c13ae6c028fedd59211218337e29b64","title":"amber rudd theresa may lost job home secretary obsession removals home office investigated","story":"The next home secretary must end the obsession with removals and the Home Office’s unethical behaviour must be investigatedThe Home Office has long been the valley of the shadow of death. Even Amber Rudd’s ability and closeness to Theresa May could not protect her from a policy that her prime minister had insisted she enforce and defend. By Sunday night, the only victor was the English language. “We don’t have targets for removals” crashed head-on into “a target of achieving 12,800 enforced removals”. It was no contest.Rudd was a popular and able minister. Her supporters have been grasping at linguistic niceties. They protested that ambitions and aims were not targets, that local was not national, and that ministers could not read every email. But the Windrush scandal has made the entire removals policy toxic. Politics has a way of wiping slates clean. It shouts: “You are responsible – go.”May must have known from the start that Rudd’s statement to the home affairs committee last week was untrue. Immigration targets were her policy and removals were built into them. Targets of all sorts were her obsession. She campaigned on them at two general elections. She lived and breathed them. Their populist appeal enabled her to survive at the Home Office longer than anyone this century. Now they have come back to haunt her and she must, in some shape or form, answer for them, as she gazes at the wreck she has made of her friend’s career.The prime duty of a new home secretary – and it should be explicit – is to end the “hostile environment” specifically to encourage removals, which is a separate target from immigration. As anyone with experience of its hostility will attest, it employed bureaucratic persecution – in effect flagrant maladministration – as a way of getting rid of so-called “low-hanging fruit”. That such Kafkaesque devices should be used by British civil servants goes far beyond “policy”. Not just ministers but Home Office officials have also indulged in unprofessional and unethical behaviour. They should be investigated.May has now lost a key supporter as she approaches the most delicate year of her already delicate time in office. Home secretaries can be replaced, but Rudd was more important to May as a leading backer of “flexible” Brexit. Within the year, there has to be a showdown over some form of customs union. There is no alternative and no evidence that a rejection of open borders with the EU is what the public wants. Yet May appears trapped, almost mesmerised, by the Brexit wing of her cabinet and parliamentary party.Rudd’s resignation could yet be seen as a move from headquarters to rally May’s troops at the parliamentary front in the storms that lie ahead. British politics is almost impossible to read, but I sense we have not seen the last of Amber Rudd."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/497a9c817c3e3c6eec76bb37415eb68f0a6ad54c/0_104_2848_1709/master/2848.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0bd04112e6edca918cdc796c0c5da7e2","title":"ellis island britain migration museum windrush","story":"When news emerged that the landing cards filled in by thousands of British citizens who arrived in the UK from the Caribbean in the 1940s and 50s had been destroyed, politicians on all sides were quick to point the finger at their opponents.The mistreatment of the Windrush generation of migrants is particularly heartrending. These are British citizens who, at the British government’s invitation, came to this country after the second world war to work, live and help rebuild it. It is difficult to overstate the sense of outrage and rejection that their treatment must have engendered.Vital questions remain about who is to blame, what needs to be done to compensate the victims and ensure that no one is forced to endure similar injustices in the future. But the casual destruction of these landing cards is also powerfully symbolic of the failure to recognise the central role that migration has played in our national story.In the US, Ellis Island – the administrative processing centre for millions of new arrivals in New York – has been turned into a powerful national museum of immigration, visited by millions of people each year. Paris and Hamburg too have museums devoted to the histories of migration. In Britain, although local and regional museums such as the Museum of Liverpool explore aspects of our migration history, we lack a dedicated, national institution focused on the movement of people to and from these shores over thousands of years, and the ways in which this has shaped who we are today.Debates around migration in both politics and the media tend to be shrill and polarised. Immigration is regularly cited by pollsters as one of the most pressing issues, and many people find the subject confusing. Research by the thinktank British Future shows that while a minority of people hold relatively fixed pro- or anti-immigration opinions, more than half of us have subtle and conflicted views, acknowledging some of the benefits that migration can bring, but anxious too about the costs and impacts associated with it.There are no easy answers here – migration is, and always has been, a complicated topic. But a UK migration museum – which I and others have been working towards for five years – would give us a new way of thinking and talking about migration, and in a different kind of space. It would place the long and rich story of the movement of people, both to and from these shores over thousands of years, at the centre of our national life, where it belongs.For the past 12 months, our project has been based at a temporary venue in Lambeth, south London. Our current exhibition, No Turning Back, looks at seven migration “moments” in British history, and invites visitors to reflect on the present in the light of what has gone before not because there are easy parallels or simple lessons to be learned, but because these moments go to the heart of who we are. Our exhibitions have also served as a backdrop for education workshops for thousands of students.We believe a museum would contribute something significant to national conversations about migration, identity and inclusion. In the world of culture – away from politics and the media – we encourage calm reflection, and the empathy that naturally springs from sharing stories and seeing the world through each other’s eyes.If you haven’t yet been to our temporary museum, we invite you to visit, and let us know what you’d like to see in a permanent migration museum for Britain. And if the government and others are serious about changing the tone around discussions of migration, we urge them to get behind us and help us to make a permanent, national Migration Museum a reality.• Sophie Henderson is director of the Migration Museum project"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f51b3902d4bf5f048cf28974263bb6aa946a9339/0_0_3047_1829/master/3047.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e0daa0d642bb5f4bbe3d12fe798d7448","title":"reality automation terrifying","story":"Plenty of people may not have heard of the retail firm Shop Direct. Its roots go back to the distant heyday of catalogue shopping, and two giants of that era, Littlewoods and Great Universal Stores. Now it is the parent company behind the online fashion brand Very and the reinvented Littlewoods. All this may sound innocuous enough. But in two areas of Greater Manchester, Shop Direct is newly notorious.Until now, what the modern corporate vernacular calls “fulfilment” – in other words, packing up people’s orders and seeing to returns – has been dealt with at three Shop Direct sites, in Chadderton and Shaw, near Oldham, and in Little Hulton, three miles south of Bolton. But the company now has plans to transfer all such tasks to a “fully automated”, 500,000 sq ft “distribution and returns centre” located in a logistics park in the east Midlands. The compulsory consultation period begins tomorrow, and the shopworkers’ union Usdaw and local politicians are up in arms: if it happens in full, the move will entail the loss of 1,177 full-time posts, and 815 roles currently performed by agency workers on the new site there will only be jobs for about 500 people. At a time when apparently low unemployment figures blind people to the fragility and insecurity of so much work, the story is a compelling straw in the wind: probably the starkest example I have yet seen of this era of automation, and the disruption and pain it threatens.Every time a self-service checkout trills and beeps and issues the deathly cry “unexpected item in the bagging area”, it points to the future. So does the increasing hollowing-out of British high streets. But much of the looming wave of automation in retail and so-called logistics is hidden in the increasingly vast distribution centres, and the research and development departments of online giants. Inevitably, no one employed by these companies is comfortable talking about an imminent decline in human employment across the sectors in which they operate, and the accelerated growth of inidual firms – exemplified by Amazon, which now employs 500,000 people around the world, up from 20,000 a decade ago – gives them plenty of cover. But the evidence is plain: the buying, selling, and handling of goods is rapidly becoming less and less labour intensive.Technology once considered expensive and exotic is already here. Around the world, Amazon now uses about 100,000 “robot drives” to move goods around its distribution centres. The warehouse within the new John Lewis “campus” near Milton Keynes has been described as a “deserted hall of clacks and hums”. It employs 860 robots and keeps the human element of shifting stuff around to an absolute minimum. Last year Credit Suisse looked at the patents the online supermarket Ocado had recently filed and concluded that the company – which, among other things, is working on driverless delivery vehicles – was pushing into “an automated future” in which half of its staff could be gone within a decade (even now, it operates a much less labour-intensive service than its rivals).And so to the really terrifying part. Given that it will be disproportionately concentrated on low-wage, low-skill employment, this wave of automation inevitably threatens to worsen inequality. There are whole swathes of Britain where, as employment in heavy industry receded, up went retail parks and distribution centres. In such places as south Wales and South Yorkshire, the result has been an almost surreal, circular economy in which people work for big retail businesses to earn money to spend in other retail businesses. What, you can only wonder, will happen next?If we are to avoid the worst, radical plans will be necessary. The insecurity that automation brings will soon demand the comprehensive replacement of a benefits system that does almost nothing to encourage people to acquire new skills, and works on the expectation that it can shove anyone who’s jobless into exactly the kind of work that’s under threat. In many places, the disruption of the job market will make the issue of dependable and secure housing – if not questions of basic subsistence – even more urgent. In both schools and adult education, the system will somehow have to pull as many people as it can away from the most susceptible parts of the economy, and maximise the numbers skilled enough to work in its higher tiers – which, given the current awful state of technology and computing teaching, looks like a\u0026nbspvery\u0026nbspbig ask.On the political right, there is no serious interest in anything resembling this kind of agenda: one of the many tragedies of Tory austerity is that it blitzed the chances of any meaningful responses to automation just as its reality became clear and Conservatives still seem either asleep, or chained to the kind of laissez-faire Thatcherism that offers nothing beyond the usual insistence that the market is not to be bucked. Some of them should read an overlooked report by the independent Future of Work commission convened last year by the Labour deputy leader Tom Watson – spun with the Panglossian claim that “robots can set us free”, though a lot of its analysis was spot on. It contained bracing predictions about the future of such “low-skill, low-pay sectors” as transport, storage and retail, and warned that “Britain’s former industrial heartlands in the Midlands and north are more vulnerable … because of a concentration of jobs in risk sectors. So, without policy intervention, the technological revolution is set to exacerbate regional inequalities.”There are signs that such things are now on the radar of senior Labour politicians – as with Jeremy Corbyn’s acknowledgment last year that automation “could make so much of contemporary work redundant”. But beyond rather dreamy talk of “putting the ownership and control of the robots in the hands of those who work with them” and commendable plans for a national education service, not nearly enough flesh has been put on these bones – perhaps because the conversation about automation is often still stuck in the utopian wilds of a work-free, “post-capitalist” future.What does the left have to say to all those Shop Direct workers in Shaw, Chadderton and Little Hulton? How will it allay the fears of the thousands of other people likely to be faced with the same experience? Put another way, if the future is already here, what now?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac2ed94154023bccb301535fdcf47e6fb9b419c7/0_0_1200_800/master/1200.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dfbc0b656bc5fce96ba06ce5214f3fd7 700w","title":"time for a riot how the art of 1968 caught a world in turmoil","story":"It was the year hippy idealism gave way to riot and struggle – with protests in Paris, tanks in Prague and black power in the US.  writers pick the pivotal works from that tumultuous timeOn 19 August 1968, Josef Koudelka returned to Czechoslovakia from Romania, where he had been living among and photographing Romany Gypsies. The following day, Soviet tanks appeared on the streets of Prague. For seven days, the 30-year-old Moravian-born photographer roamed the city with his East German Exakta Varex camera loaded with movie film, the only stock he could find at short notice.The resulting images, some of which were smuggled out of the country, but many of which were not seen until decades later, captured the tumult of a traumatised city. They are recognised as one of the most powerful photojournalistic essays of the 20th century.Koudelka photographed teenagers blocking the paths of Soviet tanks, old people imploring the young Soviet soldiers to return home, flag-waving youths clambering over army vehicles. He returned to his apartment only to find more film or succumb to exhaustion. His images of defiance have, in the interim, become infused with a romantic, even elegiac quality. Their atmosphere is echoed in photographs of more recent upheavals, most notably the Arab Spring protests.This image, which he titled Hand and Wristwatch, is of a different order: a singular moment of calm and stillness. Here, there is no movement, no noise, only the almost empty street and that anonymous arm in the foreground, stretching out into the frame. It captures not just the moment the troops entered Prague but also the eerie atmosphere of an entire city and country helplessly losing its sense of itself.Look closely and you can see a small group of people who have left their work to gather on the pavement. In the background, those blurry vehicles may be tanks. Everything is uncertain here except the hand of a passerby, curled into a fist, and the hands of the watch that signal the moment when everything changed utterly for the citizens of the invaded city. This may be Koudelka’s only conceptual photograph, but it resonates as an iconic image of a tumultuous political moment in which there is no tumult – only an eerie silence in which time itself seems to have come to a halt. Sean O’Hagan The events of 1968 took some time to percolate through pop: it wasn’t until a year later that Thunderclap Newman would reach No 1 with a song urging the listener to “hand out the arms and ammo … because the revolution’s here”, and that a mood of increasing militancy would really start being reflected by black artists. Of the musicians who did react quickly to 1968’s tumult, the Rolling Stones were audibly re-energised and the Beatles baffled – “you can count me out … in,” sang John Lennon on Revolution. The most incendiary music made in immediate response to the year’s events, a recording of Nina Simone performing at the Westbury Music Fair three days after Martin Luther King’s assassination, was bowdlerised before being released, not least to remove the sound of Simone urging the audience to avenge King’s death by any means: “I ain’t about to be non-violent, honey.”Meanwhile, released in September 1968 – in the aftermath of the Miami riots and the Democratic National Convention protests in Chicago – Jefferson Airplane’s The House at Pooneil Corners offers the sound of hippy idealism curdling into something infinitely darker. It opens with scraping guitar noise, before an ominous, lumbering two-chord riff strikes up. The lyrics bemoan both “all the bullshit around us” and the counterculture’s desire to “get balled and high”: “You say it’s healing, but nobody’s feeling it … you say you don’t see and you don’t”. After two minutes, in lieu of the usual guitar solo, there’s a lengthy electronic wail that sounds like a siren, and the tone is increasingly apocalyptic: “There will be no survivors, my friend”.By the song’s conclusion, the lyrics are positing that a post-human world where “all the idiots have left” will be a kind of naive pastoral utopia replete with cows and turtle doves, but the music tells a different story: it just grinds relentlessly on and on, with more siren-like feedback, more keening guitars. It’s effective because it feels like an honest reaction to the events of 1968: not a strident call for revolution, nor a glib attempt to assure listeners that it’s going to be all right, but the sound of people clearly shaken and confused: peering, terrified, into the void. Alexis PetridisOn 22 November 1968, Star Trek boldly went where no primetime programme had gone before when it aired the first scripted interracial kiss on American TV, in an episode entitled Plato’s Stepchildren. It was not, it should be said, the most romantic of embraces Captain Kirk (William Shatner) and Lieutenant Uhura (Nichelle Nichols) are forced into it by evil aliens with telekinetic powers. Thanks to some artful camera angles you don’t actually see their lips touch and the moment is very brief.But while the kiss may only have lasted a second, it represented decades of progress in regard to race relations in the States. It aired towards the end of the civil rights movement, after several hard-won legal milestones made African Americans slightly more equal under the law. In 1954, segregation was made illegal in public schools. In 1965 the Voting Rights Act prohibited racial discrimination in voting. In 1967, Loving v Virginia made anti-miscegenation laws unconstitutional and rendered interracial marriage legal across the US. In April 1968, days after Martin Luther King was assassinated, the Fair Housing Act was passed, preventing housing discrimination based on race, sex, national origin and religion.It would be nice to say that Kirk and Uhura’s kiss represented a turning point in the US. That the revolution had, indeed, been televised and centuries of racial injustice were over, sealed with a kiss. However, 50 years later, depressingly little has changed. US public schools are more segregated now than they were during the civil rights movement, according to a 2013 report. And, that same year, a Cheerios ad featuring an interracial family generated so much racist abuse it made headlines.“Where I come from, size, shape, or colour makes no difference,” Kirk told one of the evil aliens in Plato’s Stepchildren. That’s certainly not true now. Let’s hope things change sometime before the 2360s. Arwa MahdawiLandmark shows don’t have to be masterpieces. Alfred Jarry’s Ubu Roi is a piece of anarchic juvenilia but its Paris premiere in 1896 is accepted as the starting point of the theatre of the absurd. Similarly there may be better musicals than Hair but its opening at Shaftesbury theatre in London on 27 September 1968 (having been seen earlier that year on Broadway) was a political event for two closely connected reasons. The show not only built a popular musical out of protest. It was also the first production to capitalise on the abolition of theatrical censorship which had constricted the British stage since 1737.In those far-off days, all works had to be licensed for performance by the Lord Chamberlain, one of whose readers, in proposing a ban, reported of Hair: “It extols dirt, anti-Establishment views, homosexuality, free love, drug-taking and it inveighs against patriotism.” Actually, that’s a pretty accurate description of a show in which Claude, the son of uptight American parents, rejects the world of work and military induction to join a hippie tribe. Ultimately unable to dodge the draft, he ends up uniformed, hair-shorn and dead. The critic and director Charles Marowitz got it right when he wrote of Hair: “It is the most powerful piece of anti-war propaganda yet to come out of America. Without Vietnam and the American repugnance to that war, the show would never have come into being.”In Britain, there was a good deal of prurient interest in the show’s brief flash of nudity. But that was much less important than its rejection of the death-dealing values of the military-industrial complex and its celebration of life. Hair may have been prompted by anti-war feeling but the book and lyrics by Gerome Ragni and James Rado and the music by Galt MacDermot are joyous rather than jaded. The opening and closing choruses of Aquarius and Let the Sunshine In ring with jubilation. The best moment comes when Hamlet’s “what a piece of work is a man” is turned into an affirmative song for three voices.From today’s perspective, the show’s faith in flower power and chemical experiments may seem naive but no piece of theatre better captures the political mood of the late 60s than this “tribal, love-rock musical”. Michael Billington In 1970 the American choreographer Yvonne Rainer staged an elegant anti-war version of her signature work, Trio A, during which her dancers performed naked with just the United States flag draped ironically around their necks. Rainer’s protest against US involvement in Vietnam would be followed, over the next decade, by a spate of politically conscious dance-making on both sides of the Atlantic. But at the start of 1968, militant acts of choreography tended to focus on the artform itself, re-evaluating the language and conventions of dance.Many of those militants were former students of Merce Cunningham, who was dedicated to the possibilities of pure movement. Cunningham was, in theory, the least political of choreographers. Yet he was always intensely alive to the world outside his studio, and RainForest, created in the spring of 1968, remains a prime example of how dance can become so porous to the zeitgeist that it becomes expressive, even prophetic of history.Much about the work is evocative of its title. David Tudor’s semi-improvised score is a dark forest of buzzing, squawking sound there’s a feral strangeness to many of the dancers’ movements as they crouch, stretch and stalk the stage and overhead the silver balloons of Andy Warhol’s set design cluster like a canopy of light reflecting leaves. It’s those balloons that take RainForest out of its exotic habitat into the unruly party spirit of the late 60s. Some of them are free-floating, so they bob around the stage whenever the performers happen to nudge or brush against them some even fly into the audience. In RainForest there’s a spirit of transformative anarchy at work that not only liberates its dancers from the ordinary rules of human engagement but from the normal constraints of performance. No showing of the work can ever be the same: the sheer chanciness of its construction makes it an embodiment of perpetual possibility and change. Judith Mackrell If any one movie is saturated with the political spirit of 1968, it has to be Jean-Luc Godard’s bizarre, wayward, instructive documentary about the Rolling Stones, entitled One Plus One and later recut and released in a more commercial version (which Godard angrily disowned) named Sympathy for the Devil, in honour of the famous track from the album Beggars Banquet that the Stones are shown recording. When the London film festival attempted to show this version, Godard denounced it from the stage and stalked out, punching the producer on the way.The film is a time capsule. Break it open and an overpowering and unwholesome fume of radical chic and 1968-ness rises from it: fascinating, infuriating. Godard himself became the charismatic face of radicalism that year in March 1968 he led – along with François Truffaut – the anti-Gaullist demonstrations in Paris against the sacking of the Cinémathèque Française director Henri Langlois which ended in scuffles with the police, Godard’s glasses being smashed, and a combustible situation that materially led to the greater disturbances of May.That summer, he went to London and made his One Plus One: long, unedited real-time sequences of the Stones rehearsing and recording in the studio. No rows or disruptions, though at one stage poor old Charlie Watts gets it in the neck from Mick for his drumming sounding “a bit dead”. But these shots are interspersed and juxtaposed with other sequences: a group of Black Panthers hang out in a junkyard, reading revolutionary texts, passing around weapons and stagily humiliating various submissive women. (The casual misogyny of the era is on display).Godard’s wife Anne Wiazemsky, named “Eve Democracy”, is shown drifting through woodland, laconically answering yes or no to questions from a camera crew. (“Do you think the lower classes have more sexual vitality than the upper classes?” Answer: yes.) A lone figure is shown spraying graffiti in her room at the Park Lane Hilton and then around the streets of London, shown in all their social-realist bleakness: slogans like CINEMARXISM and SOVIETCONG. A weird voice reads from political, pulp and pornographic novels. In a comic book store people give each other Nazi salutes.And what of the Stones? Before the last scene, Godard flashes up the famous graffiti slogan: “Beneath the stones, the beach” punningly hinting that the Stones have the real spirit of 68. But his invocation of the Black Panthers is also a coded denunciation of their appropriating black music. The poses that Godard strikes in this film, and the longueurs between them, are exasperating, though like so many Godard films, this one now shows – I believe – his affinity with conceptual art, as much as cinema. It also shows the strange, tense moodiness of the times: the simmering sense of disorder: jittery, euphoric, but with an edge of bleary cynicism, like the voice of Jagger’s Lucifer.

On the internet, Mean Girls battles only with Friends and The Simpsons to be the most referenced cultural product of all time. Yet those shows had hundreds of episodes Mean Girls squeezes so many perfect gags into its 97-minute running time that whenever a character speaks, it’s basically a catchphrase. “She doesn’t even go here” “Stop trying to make Fetch happen” “You smell like a baby prostitute” … I could go on.It is not merely Fey’s brilliant screenwriting that sets this film apart as a high-school classic. Unlike The Breakfast Club, Heathers, Thirteen or Clueless, it’s not enamoured with the internal politics of high school. At the beginning of the film, Cady – who was previously home-schooled in Africa – is presented with the cafeteria’s strict social hierarchy: varsity jocks, unfriendly black hotties, girls who eat their feelings, girls who don’t eat anything, and the Plastics – the coolest girls in school.It plays into that feeling everyone has at school: that they either are cool, or that they wish they could be. But soon after you leave school, you realise that everyone sucked: their clothes, their affectations, their terrible taste in music, the belief that you and your friends are the first people to do everything you’re doing. It doesn’t make any difference whether you were popular or not schoolkids are probably the lamest demographic ever.Mean Girls quietly goes about exposing this. The Plastics wear cheap makeup and pink track pants, yet tell everyone else what’s fashionable. The teachers, unable to control the student population, are revealed to have messy and miserable personal lives. Kevin G tries to offset his nerdy mathlete vibe by performing a gangsta rap at the school concert. Even the outsiders, Janis Ian and Damian, who consider themselves gatekeepers of the system, become obsessed with trying to overthrow it. The journey Cady goes on is not a transformation she doesn’t end up cooler than she was. Rather, it’s a realisation that everyone sucks the same. When the Plastics’ bitchy Burn Book is revealed to the school (“Amber D’Alessio: made out with a hotdog” “Kaitlyn Caussin is a fat whore who no one likes”), it shows that nobody is safe from the rampant bitching of insecure people trapped in a hell of their own making.Agree or disagree with our picks in this series?

By the end, Cady hasn’t just found her place she’s realised the entire regimented structure of high school doesn’t matter.

To mark the occasion, before kick-off Sir Alex Ferguson presented on United’s behalf a vase to the 68-year-old Frenchman. Asked about his ovation as he walked along the touchline, Wenger said: “When you’re not a danger any more, people love you.“I am thankful to Manchester United because they had a nice gesture. It is the first time I get a trophy before a game. It is very classy from them.”Wenger fielded an inexperienced XI that was Arsenal’s youngest in the fixture since August 2011 and, after losing to an added-time Marouane Fellaini header, believes whoever succeeds him will take over a squad of depth.“The players are destroyed because they gave everything and were caught in the final minute. There were many question marks if we would be strong enough to fight but the quality was good, the spirit was good, many players stood up. We tired a bit in the last 20 minutes and were a bit more under pressure. It was a negative result and a positive performance.”Paul Pogba opened the scoring on 16 minutes before Henrikh Mkhitaryan equalised on 51 minutes. Yet though victory puts United in pole position for a second-place finish with 77 points with three games remaining, Romelu Lukaku’s foot injury later in the second half is of concern with the FA Cup final on 19 May.“I hope it is not something that keeps him out of a game that is in three weeks’ time but I don’t know. When a player is injured I’m not immediately going for good or bad news.”Wenger has injury concerns leading up to the Europa League semi-final second leg at Atlético Madrid this week. “Mkhitaryan I took off because he had a little knock on his knee and Ospina has a problem and Iwobi a hamstring problem. Definitely out for Thursday? No.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/49728b4d9374425a5d54119c0ffd1d632b0c0eb6/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4ef79c1605f05bfb42b7d269feb0d637","title":"premier league 10 talking points weekend action","story":"The Gaëtan BongJay Rodriguez story takes another ugly turn, and Mark Hughes tries to summon the spirit of ‘99On they go, refusing even to the consider the possibility of lowering their untouchable standards. Manchester City were at their elegant best against West Ham and the way they have performed since being confirmed as champions a fortnight ago must bode well for next season’s title defence. Nobody has successfully defended the trophy since Manchester United won three in a row a decade ago, but City seem to be developing the killer mentality that allowed Sir Alex Ferguson’s teams to rule English football for so long. Good teams win one trophy. But the great sides leave lasting legacies and Pep Guardiola’s quest for perfection means there is unlikely to be a repeat of the slumps City experienced after their titles in 2012 and 2014. “We didn’t celebrate the moment we were champions,” City’s manager said. “We celebrated over 10 months. Just being happy when you lift a title makes no sense.” Jacob SteinbergJürgen Klopp’s first port of call after Stoke City held Liverpool at Anfield was the medical department, where he was informed it would be a case of “wait and see” on Jordan Henderson (ankle), Joe Gomez (ankle) and Trent Alexander-Arnold (dead leg) before the Champions League semi‑final in Rome on Wednesday. Coming moments after Erik Pieters had escaped with handling Georginio Wijnaldum’s cross inside his penalty area, it was therefore no surprise to find the Liverpool manager in irascible form on Saturday afternoon. Liverpool require three points from two league games to seal a top-four finish, by virtue of a vastly superior goal difference to Chelsea, who they face at Stamford Bridge on Sunday, but Klopp is not expecting any help with penalty decisions. “There have been 10 or 11 situations when people have said afterwards we might have had a penalty but there’s always a reason to explain why not.” Andy HunterChristian Benteke will meet the Crystal Palace chairman Steve Parish at the end of the season to discuss his future after a difficult campaign at Selhurst Park. The Belgium striker, a club record £27m signing, was ushered forward by his team-mates and coaching staff to convert a stoppage-time penalty in the 5-0 thrashing of Leicester City on Saturday, which should ensure top-flight survival, and register a first home goal in almost a year. “I’ve been through hard times this season – it’s the first time since coming to England where I haven’t scored like I wanted to – so I thought: ‘It won’t get worse, just go and take it,’” he said. “I’m under contract until 2020, I want to stay here, and I’m going to speak to the chairman and the club about what they want to do with me. Every end of the season you have to speak, to see the plan for the next season.” Dominic FifieldLast summer, as they prepared for Premier League life, Huddersfield spent over 10 times more than they had ever spent in a single transfer window, but their total outlay was still less than Chelsea spent on Tiémoué Bakayoko, Arsenal splurged on Alexandre Lacazette or Manchester City forked out for a substitute, Bernardo Silva. There is a chasm between Huddersfield and the elite clubs that cannot be bridged in a year, if at all. But Huddersfield will probably have to beat one of those clubs, or at least scrounge a draw, in a torrid final week of the season if they are to avoid falling into the relegation zone at exactly the wrong time. David Wagner’s men have excelled to stay above the bottom three so far and although they looked dejected after this home defeat by Everton, one last mighty performance against the odds is not beyond them. Paul DoyleMark Hughes still remembers that mad May in 1999 when Southampton won their final three games to stay, in the end, comfortably afloat in the Premier League. The club’s former striker, and now manager, knows his team may need to discover similar form and harness the same kind of spirit if they are to avoid dropping into the Championship for the first time since 2012. “My memory of that time was that everyone was together,” Hughes said. “Everyone knew we were in a difficult situation and everybody stuck together – players, staff and fans most importantly, and that is what got us over the line then and let’s hope we can do it the same this time.” Trips to Swansea City and Everton will likely define which ision they are playing in next season but their fate may yet go down to the final day of the season, at home against another former Hughes club, Manchester City. Ben FisherThere are many problems for Arsène Wenger’s successor to grapple with over the summer but the current manager has a shorter‑term matter with which to grapple: how to concoct a happy ending to his time in charge, starting with defeating Atlético Madrid on Thursday and reaching the Europa League final. Granit Xhaka, who is likely to start in the Spanish capital, once again demonstrated what a liability he can be in a vital position. The midfielder tracked back but then needlessly went to ground as Manchester United scored their first, was booked, and then could have been sent off, all before half‑time. That sort of performance has been typical of his time at the club, leading to doubt over his future at the Emirates Stadium. More of the same in Spain and Wenger can forget the dream send-off. Conrad LeachFootball is as good a vehicle as we have for the discharge of inclinations that are best kept out of real life. But sometimes football is real life, at which point the rules change. Though it was not proven that West Brom’s Jay Rodriguez had racially abused Brighton’s Gaëtan Bong, Bong did nothing wrong in reporting what he believed he heard on the contrary, he was brave to speak up. So for some Burnley supporters to jeer him during this 0-0 draw out of “loyalty” to Rodriguez, who was born in the town and started his career at the club, is not part of football’s charm and edge. Chris Hughton said: “I would have to say that I thought the reaction of the Burnley supporters towards Gaëtan every time he got the ball was shameful, I really do.” The Brighton manager added: “I certainly didn’t expect it here.” Daniel HarrisDarren Moore has taken eight points from four games since succeeding Alan Pardew. Although he almost certainly became caretaker too late to rescue West Brom from relegation, Ben Foster is impressed. “Darren’s brought unity back to the team,” the Albion goalkeeper said. “He’s got us working for each other, it’s about respecting your team-mates.” The Black Country consensus is that Moore will not get the job next season but Foster hopes he might. “I’d like him as manager. He’s dead honest.” As Newcastle’s Jonjo Shelvey watches his hopes of a late England World Cup call wane, Albion’s Jake Livermore’s own claims for inclusion in Gareth Southgate’s squad for Russia are waxing. Newcastle’s Islam Slimani, meanwhile, borrowed from Leicester City, could face a retrospective three‑game ban for a petulant kick on Craig Dawson. Louise Taylor“If we had a little bit more at the top end of the pitch, and I’m not just talking about strikers, I’m talking about wingers as well, we wouldn’t be in the position we are in,” said Paul Lambert after watching his Stoke side frustrate Liverpool with a gutsy display to take his own personal record to six on the bounce unbeaten at Anfield. He has a point. Stoke have the second-worst defensive record in the league but that they have ended up finishing the season with 37-year-old Peter Crouch up front indicates the neglect shown towards an attack that only three years ago was one of the most exciting in the league. The sale of the combustible Marko Arnautovic was perhaps understandable but a failure to land a suitable replacement will be a major factor if the club, as expected, goes down.Six league games without a win and Carlos Carvalhal’s Swansea’s revival has hit the buffers at the worst possible time. It is worth pointing out (as Carvalhal did after the Chelsea defeat) that Swansea are in a far better position now than they were when he took over in December. Carvalhal deserves credit for getting the club into a position where their fate is in their own hands with three fixtures remaining. Yet, judging from recent performances, the tactical system that helped start the turnaround – a three-man central defence – may not be the solution to get them over the line. Swansea, joint-lowest scorers in the Premier League, only threatened against Chelsea after Carvalhal released the handbrake in the final 20 minutes. Will the Portuguese be bold enough to do the same against Bournemouth, Southampton and Stoke from the start?

When Tottenham Hotspur move into their 61,559-seat stadium next season, the club will enter a new era of financial power. “It would be the time to say: ‘Now, we will win the title,’” the manager said in December. The theory has been that the stadium’s increased revenues will help the club to attract and keep the A-list players.The view has sat uncomfortably with the cost of construction. It seems a long time ago that £400m was the ballpark figure. Then, it became £750m and £850m, and now, nobody would be surprised if it reached a billion. Tottenham have taken out £400m in bank loans, which are repayable over a five-year period. This month they announced in their financial results for the year ended 30 June 2017 that the “cumulative spend” on the project had increased from £115.3m to £315.1m. The club’s profits were robust. They stood at £41.2m after interest and tax. But whichever way you dress it up, there is a lot of money to find. It is no wonder chairman Daniel Levy “struggles to sleep at night”, according to Pochettino.The penny – or great mountains of them – appears to have dropped with Pochettino and when he addressed the press, before Monday’s game against Watford at Wembley, there was a shift in his stance.“The move to the new stadium is not suddenly going to change everything and millions of pounds will rain from the sky,” Pochettino said. “You have to manage and know exactly the expectations. It will be important to review and set the principles again how it will be with the team once we move.”Pochettino’s comments felt significant, just like the ones he made after the FA Cup semi defeat against Manchester United. In four post-match interviews he used the same phrase. The club needed more time to achieve success, he said, and it would be “with me or another” manager.Pochettino was asked for clarification and explained Tottenham’s project was fixed so strongly for the long term it was inevitable another manager would one day take over the responsibility. His contract runs for a further three years. The project is designed for many more.It remains difficult to escape the impression that Pochettino is approaching a crossroads. He has urged Levy on more than one occasion to move quickly in this summer’s transfer market while he ignored a question about whether he would lead the club into the new stadium and, instead, answered one of his own – the classic politician’s trick. “If I stay here for three more years, the project will not change,” Pochettino said. “We cannot change because the club cannot change. Whether it is me or another, that is the right project to keep pushing.The supporters’ fear is that Pochettino will be prised away. The good news for them is that PSG are likely to replace Unai Emery with Thomas Tuchel while Real Madrid will surely not dispense with Zinedine Zidane if, as expected, he takes them to a third successive Champions League final.But Pochettino has seen the future at Tottenham with clarity. The new stadium will change little for him. His transfer dealings since his arrival in the summer of 2014 have shown a net spend on permanent fees of £40.25m – a remarkably low figure – and he will continue to have to sell in order to buy to keep the books balanced.Meanwhile the Manchester clubs, in particular, will carry on splurging. At what point does that get to Pochettino – a manager whose stated ambition is to win the Premier League title?Tottenham remain in a curiously hemmed-in position with regard to strengthening the squad. Last summer they sold Kyle Walker to Manchester City for an initial £50m to fund purchases that would make the collective stronger and this time they are expected to do something similar. Toby Alderweireld is for sale while they would listen to offers for Danny Rose and, surprisingly, Mousa Dembélé.However, the incoming signings would have to fit into Levy’s wage structure, which is capped at a basic £100,000 a week, although not for him. He earns an annual £6m or £115,000 a week.It will be difficult to find too many players who would improve Pochettino’s best XI and be happy to sign for, say, £60,000 to £70,000 a week, which is the threshold for many of his starters.One example is Wilfried Zaha, who earns more than £120,000 a week at Crystal Palace. A deal for the winger would be complicated on many levels, not least in terms of the impact it would have on existing squad harmony, which Pochettino has fostered expertly.Will Levy raise the wage ceiling? Yes, although not to market rates. In other words, the club’s stars could get more elsewhere, if they could get out – which is a big if under Levy.Are Tottenham stronger without Walker or, indeed, Alderweireld, who has been marginalised? One thing can be said for certain and it is that the club’s players have noted with interest how Walker has trebled his salary at City and won the title. Could they do one or both at Tottenham? For Pochettino, the balancing act does not get any easier."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/28a9e23eefe799ba703bbdc05ca97e4b9e38a228/0_1_1940_1164/master/1940.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2d9a154ec7b08423c64ef002260c4859","title":"world cup highest bidder","story":"Handing global sporting events to the highest bidder may seem indelicate but it would be a more honest arrangementYou can bet on anything these days. Crossfit. Portuguese futsal. Even ByuL versus Rogue in Starcraft II (Rogue is 8-13 favourite for Wednesday’s E-Sports clash). Yet, curiously, finding odds about who will host the 2026 World Cup is nigh-on impossible – even though the vote between the Nafta bloc of the US, Canada and Mexico, and new kid on the block Morocco is only six weeks away.One bookie told me he would be “asking to be picked off” if he offered prices, given the votes for mega-events such as the World Cups and Olympics. As he put it: “You only really get action from people who know something we don’t.”Yet this time it is supposed to be different. Fifa has ripped up its rulebook following the fallout from awarding the 2018 and 2022 World Cup finals to Russia and Qatar respectively. It has promised greater scrutiny of bids, more transparency, and, most dramatically, changed voting rules so its 211 member associations will decide who hosts rather than two dozen senior executives.The aim, according to a Fifa spokesman, is to “avoid a return to the secret and subjective decisions of the past”. Good luck with that. As the lack of bookies’ odds indicates, it’s hard to shake off the past. Look at the International Olympic Committee, which expanded its electorate after the Salt Lake City scandal – yet has been hit with investigations into vote-rigging when awarding the Rio and Tokyo Games.Here is a radical suggestion. Give the World Cup – and the Olympics, for that matter – to the highest bidder.Sure, it sounds crude. But it would at least be more honest. It recognises that people are corruptible, and those with large enough wallets will always try to corrupt them. And so it stops it at a stroke. Why engage in backroom deals or bribes, for instance, when there is no advantage in doing so?Think of the money that might be erted into grassroots football and poorer nations. The Football Association lost £15m on England’s failed 2018 bid, as well as much of its dignity in cosying up to the likes of Jack Warner. Australia spent $40m of public money on its attempt to host in 2022. For what?However, Trump is far from alone. Before the 2018 World Cup vote, Russia’s president Vladimir Putin spent hours talking to Fifa delegates – and it probably was not about the weather in Moscow in June.Of course rules would have to be put in place. Any bid would need to show it had the requisite stadia, security and infrastructure to host a World Cup. A country could not host the tournament more than once in a generation. And it would have to be seen as progressive on human rights and strong on anti-corruption. But once it passed those hurdles it would be all systems go.The worry, of course, is the World Cup would be tossed around the same four or five rich global powers. One idea to counter that would be to hold a lottery – rather than an auction – every fifth World Cup with the winner only having to pay a smaller fee, set in advance, to host the tournament.Certainly David Forrest, an economist at the University of Liverpool, believes the benefits of an auction would negate the downsides. As he explains, in a sense there is already an auction for the World Cup and Olympics. It’s just that countries are spending millions on wooing potential voters – money that would be much better spent going straight into the sport if they win (and not spurned if they didn’t).As he put it: “A transparent auction would see the money from the highest bid go to Fifa itself rather than to the pockets of Fifa’s voters, and it could be earmarked for supporting recreational football in poor countries. Some of it could be put into a reserve for subsidising a less-developed nation to host the competition every fifth tournament.”That is a battle for another day. For now, Fifa watchers are trying to decipher exactly what will happen when the vote finally takes place on 13 June.Some insist a shock Morocco win is now on the cards because Trump has alienated so many African nations by calling them “shithole countries”. Others whisper that some Fifa countries want to give the US a bloody nose in retaliation for the Department of Justice’s 2015 investigation into football-related corruption.Yet it is easy to be seduced by the counterpoints – that Fifa president Gianni Infantino wants the World Cup back in the US because it could generate $5bn (£3.58bn) in economic activity, far higher than its rival, along with suggestions that Morocco’s bid still has to convince Fifa’s scrutineers to get into the vote.Either way, vast sums have already been spent. Some of that, surely, could have been saved by simply holding an auction."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c620bfadb8b4d4ac7b4ef350d74ea0b79ba81cac/0_673_5278_3167/master/5278.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2ecb77d0e85a614308a4ef78d2fee927","title":"un suspends key witness miriam maluwa unaids","story":"Miriam Maluwa put on administrative leave after giving evidence to support claims against UNAids deputy directorA key witness in a sexual assault investigation involving a UN assistant secretary general has been suspended from her job, in a move campaigners say is a show of “pure intimidation tactics”.Miriam Maluwa, who has worked for the UN for more than 25 years, was placed on administrative leave from her post as country director for UNAids in Ethiopia on 27 March. In a letter from the agency she was told this action did not amount to disciplinary measures, but that UNAids would be conducting a management and operational review of the country’s office during her absence. The agency added that Maluwa, one of the most senior women within UNAids, was not allowed to enter the office or access the agency’s servers or documents without supervision. The following week, an email was sent to key partners, embassies and government ministries announcing that an interim country director had been appointed to her position.Maluwa was also copied into emails stating that her contract had been terminated, though she said the agency later told her these were sent in error. The campaign group Code Blue, which is supporting Maluwa, said the agency had not explained the reasons for its actions and was not following the correct processes. “The standard procedure if there’s going to be an administrative and management review is that you tell the staff member why, tell them what the claims are against them, and you give them the opportunity to respond to those claims,” said Paula Donovan, co-director of Code Blue. Last year, Maluwa was a key witness in an investigation into sexual assault and harassment allegations involving the UNAids deputy director, Luiz Loures, who was alleged to have assaulted a colleague in a hotel lift. Maluwa, who spoke to the complainant after the alleged assault took place, told investigators that the alleged victim was distressed and asked to borrow a phone – evidence that supported the woman’s claims. Loures, who denies the allegations, was not suspended during the investigation.Donovan said Maluwa was being targeted following her role as a witness, and her refusal to contribute towards internal efforts to defend the agency’s director, Michel Sidibé, who has faced widespread criticism over attempts to interfere with the inquiry.The investigation found the claims against Loures to be unsubstantiated, but its results have since been suspended. On Friday, it was announced the case would be reopened in light of additional allegations that had surfaced, and would be conducted by the UN’s investigations team, the office of internal oversight services. In February, the  reported concerns relating to how the investigation was handled, along with testimonies from a group of women alleging they had also been assaulted or harassed by Loures, or that they had warned the agency’s director, Michel Sidibé, about his deputy’s behaviour. The alleged victim in the Loures case, Martina Brostrom, claims Sidibé attempted to bribe her to drop her complaint by offering a promotion. Sidibé denies this, but admitted to WHO investigators that he had met Brostrom to suggest they “see how we can really find a way out without making it a big problem for all the organisation and for the credibility of the organisation, for yourself”.Brostrom said that she only heard the case was being reopened through the media. “A new internal investigation does not make any sense to me. Anything short of an investigation fully independent from the UN will not be enough,” she said.Sidibé faced further criticism after details of an all-staff meeting were leaked to the , during which he suggested women who have spoken out “don’t have ethics” and appeared to make veiled threats to whistleblowers. Several HIV activist groups have called for an independent investigation into the agency, with the Aids Healthcare Foundation calling for Sidibé’s resignation.In a letter sent to the UNAids staff this month, Sidibé appeared to backtrack from his earlier comments, writing: “I will do all in my power to ensure UNAids’s culture is one in which it is clear that no one should feel threatened – and in which no one is threatened … People who speak out and bring complaints forward help the organisation.”Code Blue said that, despite such promises, Sidibé had continued to retaliate against staff. It added that a new UN investigation would be marred by continued conflicts of interest. In a statement, the campaign group called for member states to establish a temporary independent oversight panel to monitor closely the UN’s response to inidual allegations of sexual offences, with the power to intervene immediately where actions could harm victims or witnesses. The panel would also make recommendations on UN policies and procedures. UNAids said in a statement that it could not comment on its actions relating to Maluwa. It said: “We cannot provide specific information about the review to protect the integrity and confidentiality of the process. However, we can confirm that it is not related to the recent case of sexual harassment.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad098396d20783c168a7242de07d2175f8f7da70/58_1074_2899_1739/master/2899.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=576e47d7496dfd6f32ffa641036a4cbc","title":"jamie oliver criticism affect me childhood obesity","story":"From school dinners to sugar, the chef’s campaigns provoke strong reactions – but he won’t give up. Why? ‘It just feels like the right thing to do’‘If you analyse what I’m saying,” says Jamie Oliver, “there’s nothing clever and there’s nothing really that controversial it’s fucking really basic common sense.”We meet on the morning that a letter he coordinated has been released, addressed to the prime minister and signed by Jeremy Corbyn, Nicola Sturgeon and other party leaders. It calls on the government to ban junk food advertising before 9pm and unhealthy buy-one-get-one-free offers, among other things. Oliver is proud of it. He looks relaxed, sitting on one of the sofas in his industrial, vintage-styled head office – although he knows the attacks will come. Later, he will be accused on Twitter of being the “fun police” a column in the Sun will call it a nanny-state initiative that penalises poor people.He talks in long, rambling sentences, bristling with energy. His transformation from cheeky-chappy Essex boy chef to single-issue crusader, facts and figures to hand, about to appear in front of a select committee, is complete. You would think he would have enough going on – he closed several of his restaurants recently and restructured his business – but Oliver remains laser-focused on the issue of childhood obesity.So far, Oliver seems to be coming at obesity principally as a diet problem, rather than a social one, although it may be too much to ask even someone as energetic and ambitious as him to fix society. Obesity disproportionately affects children in deprived areas. If there is one criticism of Oliver that seems to stand up, it is that he does not entirely understand what it is like to live in relentless, grinding poverty: to be unable to afford fresh vegetables (healthy food is three times more expensive, per calorie, than unhealthy food – Oliver has suggested that the government should subsidise healthy food) to be too tired to cook from scratch every night to take the financial risk on a lentil recipe that your kids may refuse to eat.At one point, when we are talking about whether people – working parents, people who have to work several jobs – can be persuaded to turn their backs on the ease of convenience food, he acknowledges that “humans crave convenience, that’s what we’re programmed to do. But convenience food doesn’t have to be shit. The freezer is the future.” But what if you live in a small flat, with a tiny fridge and just an ice box? “Of course, but you can buy it on the defrost – that will be two or three days in the fridge still. You don’t have to have it all racked up in the freezer. But costs are down, welfare is up, waste down. Convenience food doesn’t have to be shite.” But it probably will not be cheap.Maybe it does not help when he keeps talking about “them” and “us”, as if people on low incomes or benefits are a separate species. But he is not having it. “Yeah, because I don’t have to worry about feeding my kids today and they do. It’s not hard to get someone to say: ‘Jamie Oliver is a wanker.’ I think the concept of having an opinion and caring in Britain is a really funny one, you know: ‘How dare you.’” It is true that he is in an impossible position – as a chef reportedly worth £150m, he is regularly accused of hypocrisy (years on, those lucrative supermarket adverts are used as a stick with which to beat him) and for lecturing the rest of us, but the alternative would be to do nothing. “When I stand up there and start talking, you may or may not like what I say,” he says. “But if you’ve ever seen the people representing the advertising industry or the food industry, I know you would trust me with your kids more than them.”Why does he do it? There must be times when an easier life – with his wife, Jools, their five children and their lovely £9m home in Hampstead, north London, and his TV cookery shows – seem more appealing. “The important stuff I’ve done I’ve rarely enjoyed,” he says. “I get a beating quite regularly.” So, why carry on? “It just feels like the right thing to do,” he says slowly, enunciating every word.Oliver became political early on. It was only three years after his explosive 1999 debut as the Naked Chef that he was training unemployed young people to staff his restaurant Fifteen – filmed, of course, for a TV series (few can match Oliver’s media skills). His campaign to improve school dinners culminated in the series Jamie’s School Dinners in 2005, while his 2008 series Ministry of Food followed his initiative to teach cookery skills in Rotherham (that project closed last year after Rotherham council stopped funding it, but there are others around the country).In 2015, Oliver turned his attention to sugar with his documentary Jamie’s Sugar Rush. The month it aired, he says darkly, “stuff changed. Like burglaries, computer systems, break-ins at the office, home.” Before I can ask if he thinks Big Sugar was trying to intimidate him, he continues: “I don’t know, but there’s a string of events since the month that started.” Still, the sugar tax was introduced, under David Cameron’s government (Oliver has been scathing of Theresa May’s childhood obesity strategy).People have often tried to work out what drives Oliver, but I suspect it is as simple as the satisfaction of seeing results (just like the process of starting with raw ingredients and producing a Sunday roast). “As time has gone on and we’ve got some stuff done, you realise that getting stuff done isn’t that common,” he says. Someone called him a socialist recently and he had to look up the definition. He does not think he is one he prefers the idea of running a commercial business with a social ethos.That is not to say everyone agrees he is succeeding. A report in the Times last month portrayed his chief executive Paul Hunt, who is married to Oliver’s sister, as a bully, quoting a former employee who said “morale is at rock bottom”. “It’s complete bollocks,” Oliver says. “You can walk round the business. Like I said to the editor when they ran the story, come in and talk to everyone. If you’re talking about some bad leavers, of course you’re going to find some people who have something to whine about.”It has been a tough year for Oliver – tougher still for some of his staff. He describes the closure of one of his two Barbecoa steak restaurants and 12 of the 37 UK branches of his chain Jamie’s Italian as “awful. Worst time in my life.” It is the job losses, he says. “We’ve still got 2,000 people, but we’ve had to close 12 restaurants, which is about 800 people.”It can be easy to forget that, amid all the campaigning and the chain-restaurant managing, Oliver is still a wildly popular and successful chef. His most recent book, 5 Ingredients, was one of his biggest-selling and he has another out in the summer. He still writes two recipes every day (about a third are healthy, the rest less so this is often pointed out as though it is evidence of Oliver’s hypocrisy).Anyway, he has to go – Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, that other anti-obesity campaigner and chef, is on the phone. Oliver says his business is committed to the target of halving childhood obesity by 2030. “That is what you’re going to hear me say for the next 12 years,” he says. You have to admire his single-mindedness. “Don’t get me wrong,” he adds, “I’m fucking looking forward to retiring.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ea0f85cc3123b23ac4773b2fb9132ac9b8176b6/0_125_5220_3133/master/5220.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b04a1a904aca319f387ac97d28381d6f","title":"how to make new friends adult lonely leap of faith","story":"Striking up friendships can be tricky – and studies show millions of us are lonely. Here, four people who forged new connections explain how they did it. Plus: psychologist Linda Blair gives her tipsWhen you are a child in the playground it is pretty simple, but “Do you want to be my friend?” isn’t a line you hear from adults. Teenage years are filled with friendships easily made (and some easily forgotten), when you are feeling keen, sociable and energetic. Then there are engagements, marriage, relocation, career changes, families: life comes calling with its multiple demands, and friendships evolve as a result. I have been happy to see my friends move through these huge life moments, but as much as I value my friendships, I have found myself lonely at times. Some friends are physically far away, while others are time-poor and, with the best will in the world, it isn’t simple to see each other as often as we would like.According to a recent study by the Red Cross in partnership with Co-op, more than nine million adults in the UK are often or always lonely. We are facing a loneliness epidemic, with Theresa May taking the step earlier this year of appointing Tracey Crouch as what some have dubbed the “minister for loneliness” to try to tackle the issue.Loneliness is something we all feel at times and to varying degrees, but it can also be something that we feel uneasy about admitting to.Still, making friends as an adult can be hard, and takes time – last week a study from the University of Kansas found that two people need to spend 90 hours together to become friends, or 200 hours to qualify as close friends.Clinical psychologist Linda Blair agrees that this can be difficult to achieve: “Usually the basis of making a friend is a shared experience.” These are often in abundance in our earlier years, but once those easy opportunities are gone, you can forget that the initial basis for a friendship is to have a similar passion or interest. Joining a group or class based on something you really love, or volunteering for something you care about, can be a great first step for finding friendships, she advises.Although it can be tricky and nerve-racking, making new friends as an adult can also be rewarding: a message Jacqueline Thomas, 52, is keen to share. Moving to the Warwickshire village of Bulkington in 2015 with her partner David, who is soon to retire, she relished the opportunity to start anew.“We’ve had to start from scratch because we didn’t know anybody here. Our kids have grown up, so we were looking at a slightly quieter life, but it’s actually turned out to be busier than before,” she says.Jacqueline started by introducing herself to her neighbours. She credits signing up to a variety of classes and groups at the village hall as the catalyst for her new friendships. She joined the WI hesitantly, worried it would be “all jam and Jerusalem, and I’d be the youngest person there”. But she now says it was one of the best decisions of her life.Don’t be afraid to try something new, she stresses. A lifelong wheelchair user, Jacqueline was intrigued by a poster in the village hall advertising an adapted martial arts class. Having gone along with some doubts, she was surprised to find how much she enjoyed it. Encouraged by her teacher, Carl Hodgetts, who in 2006 became the first wheelchair-using kickboxing instructor in the UK, she now proudly holds a white belt in Shiying Do adapted martial art. “It just takes one leap of faith. Even if you’re absolutely terrified, do it,” she says, adding: “Even I’m a bit shocked about the martial arts, though.”Over the past couple of years, and nearing 30, I made a conscious effort to make friends. Not to replace old ones, but to make new connections. Friendships, says Blair, are “like an onion. There’s all these layers of friends and the inner layer are your best friends – you probably only have two or three in your whole life.” You might not gain a new best friend, but finding friends for different interests in your life, at different stages, can be a positive.A personal success story came from a friend’s wedding last summer. Rebecca and I bonded over our rumbling bellies as we awaited the bride’s entrance. It turned out we lived near each other in London and had gone to the same school in Dorset (albeit in different years, which when you’re a child makes a crucial difference). We discussed travel, food and summer plans, but I wasn’t sure our newfound friendship would exist outside the tipsy haze of a wedding celebration. But I had resolved not to let these moments slip away and took her number. Fast forward to a meetup in a bar in central London. I had fretted about what to wear, whether she would recognise me and if there would be awkward silences but we are now firm friends, exploring the capital and taking it in turns to suggest somewhere new.Joining local running and cycling groups has also been a positive step. It is an excellent way to meet people in the area. Pete McLeod, 25, a fellow athletics fan and member of my track and field club, Hercules Wimbledon, agrees. After finishing his master’s at Loughborough University, he moved to Wimbledon for his first job and joined the club to keep fit. Making new friends has been a bonus: “It’s really rewarding. You get to practise something you enjoy but also have the opportunity to meet new people.”Pete made a New Year resolution in 2015 to push himself out of his comfort zone and speak to people more: “The club was a good opportunity to put that into practice … when people aren’t out of breath.” He counts some members of the sprinting group as very good friends now, with the japes and conversations flowing over into tennis matches or walks and coffee at the weekend.It is important to be proactive, says Juliana Nabinger, 42, who moved from Brazil to Chile with her husband and two young children three years ago. “Don’t sit and wait – it won’t happen. You have to actively search for new friends.” Now fluent in Spanish, she says that when she first moved she would use the few words she knew to ask questions while waiting for her children to finish at school, even when she knew the answers: “At first it was difficult because I really started to miss my friends and adult conversation, but the kids kept me busy and, through them, I made friends.”Now, via a Facebook group of English-speaking mums and her Spanish conversations at the school gates, she has a solid group of local and expat friends. “The best thing is, you’re older and you don’t judge people,” she says. The worst? “Sometimes people don’t understand your feelings or choices because they don’t know everything. They only have parts of a puzzle.”Friendships can also come from the most unexpected places. Moving from Eday, a small island in Orkney, with a community of about 140 people, to mainland Orkney, Stephen Walters, 43, and his family went from knowing almost everyone to not knowing anyone socially. His wife, Ronie, started the UK’s most northerly roller derby league, the Orkney ViQueens. Initially, Stephen joined to train as a referee and was the only man there, but he went on to became a coach despite having little previous experience on skates. Within a year he had an abundance of friends of all ages, he says.Roller derby’s ethos of inclusion and equality has been a big attraction for him: “I have bipolar disorder and there are a couple of others with similar issues. You can tell when somebody is not quite their usual self and people generally look out for each other, which is really nice.”Not having been involved much in a sport before, he admits he was concerned it would be difficult at his age, but now urges others to give it a try: “Go out and try some activities you’re interested in and talk to people. If it doesn’t work, try another one.”Embarking on friendships as an adult can be terrifying, exciting, rewarding and challenging. Nothing can replace the special connections you have with those who have known you over the years, but taking that leap of faith Jacqueline mentioned can reinvigorate and get the ball rolling. Before rushing off to her afternoon martial arts class, she imparts some simple but effective advice: when it comes to making friends, “Don’t be afraid of being scared. Do it anyway.”Build your self-confidenceLiking yourself before going off in search of friends is an important step to building healthy relationships. “Think about what you like about yourself. When you’re comfortable with yourself, it shines out of you.”Find something you feel passionate about Join a language class if you love languages or volunteer outdoors if you love nature. “That’s where you’ll find friendships.”Put yourself out there Remember, nothing ventured, nothing gained. “It isn’t that you lose if you meet someone and it doesn’t fit for a friendship. That’s not losing, that’s having tried.” Meet in a neutral place Once you have taken the first step and are moving on to meeting outside the initial environment where you made a connection, chose a neutral public space. This can lessen the pressures that, say, hosting at home can bring, and give you time to focus on each other. “If you want to be popular, ask people about themselves and listen sincerely when they answer. A good listener is rare these days. It is the best passport you could possibly have to friendship.”A common mistake is expecting too much from one person. It is more realistic and healthier to have a variety of friends for different reasons."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/30f4b9ec8f473c1c82d0e3effd7711d2870bc995/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1272a646421a9427484e68e5199538ed","title":"seven ways to support your immune system","story":"Your body works hard to fight off infections, but there are things you can do to give it a boostMost people know about the benefits of exercise for our hearts, waistlines, muscles and bones. Fewer are aware of how it supports our immune defences, especially as we age. Production of naive T cells, which raise the alarm when they detect infections the immune system has not encountered before, declines as we get older. Research published by Professor Janet Lord’s group at the University of Birmingham last month found that cyclists aged 55 to 79 were generating as many of these cells as young adults and had more B regulatory cells, which help to prevent autoimmune disease. Other studies show moderate to vigorous exercise reduces the risk of upper respiratory tract infections, including the common cold.Sleep is important to the functioning of the immune system. Research suggests that white blood cells in those aged 65 and over who sleep six hours or fewer a night may be less effective in dealing with invading pathogens than cells from those who sleep more. Sleep deprivation also makes people more susceptible to colds and flu.Our guts contain trillions of microbes that play key roles in the immune system. For example, they promote the production of T cells, which help to trigger immune responses and prevent autoimmune diseases. Having a low-fat, high-fibre diet with plenty of vegetables promotes a broad range of gut bugs and boost levels of beneficial bacteria. “Having a varied diet is likely to be better for your bacteria, which is, in turn, likely to be better for your immune function,” says Professor Sheena Cruickshank of the University of Manchester.Probiotics – live bacteria or yeasts added to yoghurts or taken as supplements – can reduce the risk of infectious diarrhoea linked to antibiotic use and help those with ulcerative colitis or pouchitis, a complication of surgery for ulcerative colitis. However, most of the claims made for probiotics are not supported by good-quality research evidence, despite a global market estimated to be worth about $40bn (£29bn). Prebiotics – non-digestible food ingredients that help existing gut probiotics grow – are also available. There are studies that suggest benefits, but most are small-scale and industry-funded. “It’s a huge business, but at this stage it’s not clear which bacteria we might want to nurture to promote health-giving effects, and most people could probably get the same effects with a healthy, balanced diet,” says Cruickshank.Drinking to excess can leave you with more than a hangover. A 2014 study found that drinking four to five shots of vodka reduced levels of white blood cells, which combat infections and cancer, for up to five hours after peak intoxication. Heavy drinking has also been found to undermine the ability of immune cells called macrophages to engulf bacteria.Smokers are more prone to inflammatory diseases and infections such as pneumonia and flu than non-smokers. Research suggests this may be partly down to nicotine undermining the ability of white blood cells called neutrophils to ingest and kill harmful microbes. Smokers also have fewer friendly bacteria and more pathogens in the nasopharynx, the upper part of the throat behind the nose, and higher levels of bacteria that cause skin infections and oral diseases.Our bodies create vitamin D when our skin is exposed to sunlight outdoors. Vitamin D helps to keep our finely tuned immune systems in balance by, for example, stimulating the development of cells that prevent the autoimmune responses seen in conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease, multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis. It is also used by macrophages to help kill harmful bacteria, and supports our defences against colds and flu."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/96bc3f7459a4d5cf8a19b71798d09c24871176e2/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a11a215520d283abab47d392a508b760","title":"tooth decay chidren mih molar incisor hypomineralisation","story":"One in 10 children are affected by MIH, which can cause their molars to disintegrate. But scientists are baffled by what causes itWhen it strikes, MIH affects the first four adult molars, which break through at about six years of age. The condition varies in severity, often with just one tooth affected. But at the most extreme end of the spectrum, a\u0026nbsptooth will start crumbling soon after it has erupted. Mild cases will merely incur a\u0026nbspslight discoloration. The British Dental Association’s scientific adviser Damien Walmsley says: “The enamel is thinner and softer, and more prone to being dissolved away. The surface allows bacteria to hide in the defects, which means these teeth are more prone to decay.” Fluoride treatments, along with strict brushing and dietary regimes, are the only way to save them.However, as any veteran of the bedtime routine will testify, precision tooth-cleaning inside a\u0026nbspsix-year-old’s mouth is challenging – especially if they have this condition, which, like bad decay, renders affected teeth extremely sensitive. Dental examinations can be unbearable. “They’re only six or seven and have a\u0026nbsplimited ability to explain what they’re feeling,” says Fayle. “They just don’t like it, and that tends to make them more\u0026nbspphobic.”Even after much academic study, researchers are little the wiser about what causes MIH. Pollution has been suggested, and links have been drawn with, Fayle says, “problems around birth, breathing problems when children have been little, viral infections such as chickenpox. But none of these factors have come out as strongly or very strongly associated with a\u0026nbspchild having the condition.” However, it is believed that the primary cause is environmental rather than genetic. These molars are formed at birth and undergo a\u0026nbsphardening process over the next two or three years a process Fayle likens to “constructing a\u0026nbspsponge and then pumping concrete into it. Something goes wrong, we believe, in those first two years, when that concrete is being pumped\u0026nbspin.”Dietary deficiencies are unlikely to trigger MIH because you would expect to see a\u0026nbspsymmetrical effect, whereas this condition has seemingly random coverage. “You can have a tooth on one side that’s perfectly all right and the same tooth on the other side, which developed at exactly the same time, is crumbly.” Even in those with all four affected, one or two will be much worse than the\u0026nbspothers.There is an impression, says Fayle, that MIH is a\u0026nbspmodern disease, but evidence of it has been found in 200- to 300-year-old skeletons. Scandinavian and German researchers have tracked children born in consecutive years, and, rather than charting a\u0026nbspsteady rise, prevalence goes up and down. “It’s bizarre,” says Fayle. “The worst years had more than twice as many cases as the best years. Nobody can explain that, but it’s almost as if there’s something in the background changing that is making children more susceptible to getting this. It’s a\u0026nbspbaffling\u0026nbspmystery.”Occasionally, white or yellowish marks also appear on the front adult teeth, but except for rare cases, these only pose a\u0026nbspcosmetic problem which, if affecting the child’s wellbeing, can be masked. If a\u0026nbspcrumbly molar must be removed, all is not lost. “If you get the timing right,” says Fayle, “the second adult molar and wisdom teeth waiting in the gums will usually shunt forwards and take its\u0026nbspplace.”Similarly, letting toddlers carry bottles of juice around all day “is like throwing a\u0026nbspbit of petrol on the fire, keeping the decay process going”. Switching to cups instead of bottles and limiting juice to mealtimes helps avoid this. Snacking should be minimised, too, with sweet treats reserved for pudding rather than between meals. “Even things such as crisps that appear to be savoury,” warns Fayle, “stick around your teeth and an enzyme in saliva breaks the starch down to\u0026nbspsugar.”Checking toothpaste has the recommended fluoride levels is also encouraged. For under threes that’s 1000ppm (parts per million), rising to 1350-1500ppm after that. “And the advice now is to spit and not rinse,” says Fayle. By leaving fluoride in your mouth at bedtime, he says, “you’re protecting your teeth and helping them to repair all\u0026nbspnight”.Children under three always need an adult to brush for them, but depending on their development, they can start having a\u0026nbspgo themselves after that. However, it needs to be supervised by the adult up to about age\u0026nbspseven, says Fayle."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f73ca694f4bf7664145800a9430e16073d7bc284/0_184_5517_3310/master/5517.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b7f8f1a2266e5648d6ab8af6d3a404c6","title":"france transport strikes cancel rights","story":"My partner and I will be travelling from London to Montpellier, by both Eurostar and SNCF, on 16 June and returning on 25 June.

The former immigration minister Brandon Lewis suggested on Sunday this proposed increase was an ambition rather than a target.But Home Office sources have told the  that it is “shame-faced nonsense” to claim the department had not been set specific targets in this area, or that these have not been regularly discussed at the highest levels.The latest furore was sparked on Friday when the  published details from a separate confidential memo that was sent to Rudd in June last year.Prepared by Hugh Ind, the director general of Immigration Enforcement in the Home Office, it picked up on the new policy outlined by Rudd in her letter to Theresa May.While Rudd has denied seeing the six-page briefing note, the  can now reveal that it was also sent to at least eight of the Home Office’s most senior officials, including:• Marc Owen, senior director of national and international operations in Immigration Enforcement.• Mark Thomson, the director general of the Passport Office.• Tony Eastaugh, UK director of operations at Immigration Enforcement.• Gareth Hills, director of performance and risk at the Home Office.• Stephen Kershaw, a senior director in Immigration Enforcement.• Andrew Wren, director of performance, assurance and governance at the Home Office.The home secretary has issued five apologies in the last week – four of them over her department\u0027s handling of the Windrush crisis and immigration targets.Rudd delivered an unprecedented apology to parliament and acknowledged that her department had “lost sight of iniduals” and become “too concerned with policy”.Rudd apologised for failing to grasp the scale of the problem. She told the home affairs select committee: “I bitterly, deeply regret that I didn’t see it as more than inidual cases gone wrong that needed addressing. I didn’t see it as a systemic issue until very recently.”On Thursday morning, Rudd was forced to admit officials did have targets for removals, having previously denied their existence.“The immigration arm of the Home Office has been using local targets for internal performance management. These were not published targets against which performance was assessed, but if they were used inappropriately then I am clear that this will have to change.On Thursday afternoon, Rudd was forced to issue a hasty clarification after appearing to leave the door open to the UK staying in a customs union with the EU.“I should have been clearer – of course when we leave the EU we will be leaving the customs union.In a series of late-night tweets, Rudd apologised for not being aware of documents, leaked to the , which set out immigration removal targets.\u0026nbsp‘I wasn’t aware of specific removal targets. I accept I should have been and I’m sorry that I wasn’t. I didn’t see the leaked document, although it was copied to my office as many documents are.The disclosure will heap further pressure on Rudd, who has said she will address MPs on Monday to answer the “legitimate questions” that have been raised over the past week.On Friday night, nine hours after the  first told the Home Office about the leaked memo, Rudd tweeted: “I wasn’t aware of removal targets. I accept I should have been and I am sorry that I wasn’t.”The response appears at odds with the letter she sent to the prime minister in January last year.But it also suggests that none of the other senior officials and special advisers copied into the subsequent briefing note ever discussed with her the targets which the Immigration Enforcement agency was attempting to reach on her instruction.Home Office sources have told the  that Immigration Enforcement has been working all year to reach the target of 12,800 enforced returns in 2017-18.They have been bracing themselves to acknowledge to ministers that the agency has failed to do so. To meet the goal, it needed to deport 250 people a week, but it has only been able to remove about 225 a week.“At the Home Office we work in a target culture,” said a source. “The civil service is completely target based. That’s all we do. It is shame-faced nonsense for Amber Rudd to say otherwise.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5563f68e8bfcdc29bf74aba848979f00e684761c/21_0_615_369/master/615.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=79de17426590a332212e1c34319aa183","title":"davis under pressure to disown criticism of civil service chief on brexit","story":"Minister seeks to defuse row after backlash to claims he wanted Oliver Robbins sidelinedBrexit secretary David Davis has sought to defuse tensions with No 10 by playing down reports that he might resign unless Theresa May sidelines Whitehall’s top civil servant working on Britain’s exit from the EU.After unexpected interventions from the cabinet secretary Jeremy Heywood and May’s close aide Gavin Barwell defending Oliver Robbins, an aide to Davis said on Sunday evening that no such threats had been made. The aide added that Davis considered Robbins to be “a fantastic civil servant”.Davis’s intervention comes in a crucial week for May who faces a tense Brexit inner cabinet meeting on Wednesday when she is expected to discuss a plan, backed by Robbins, to create a customs partnership with the EU. Another option on the table is the so-called “max fac” – or maximum facilitation – solution, using technology to minimise the need for border checks.According to the Sunday Times, Davis told the prime minister to ignore Robbins in favour of her ministers.Robbins, tipped as a future cabinet secretary, was moved from Davis’s Brexit department into No 10 last year as May sought to take greater control over the process.A former minister claimed that Tory backbenchers could be willing to oust May if she does not stop listening to her adviser on the customs partnership plan.EU members (plus Turkey, Andorra, Monaco and San Marino) trade without customs duties, taxes or tariffs between themselves, and charge the same tariffs on imports from outside the EU. Customs union members cannot negotiate their own trade deals outside the EU, which is why leaving it – while hopefully negotiating a bespoke arrangement – has been one of the government’s Brexit goals.\u0026nbspSee our full Brexit phrasebook.“The prime minister would be extraordinarily unwise to take Robbins’s advice on this,” they told the newspaper. “There will be a very swift and very violent reaction. It will put the prime minister in personal peril.” Attacks on Robbins provoked an angry response from civil servants on Sunday morning. Dave Penman, the head of the FDA union, said: “Is there a more despicable form of political cowardice than to allow anonymous briefings in your name to effectively call for a civil servant to be sacked?“Civil servants advise, ministers decide. Politicians of all stripes know this. If David Davis leaves these comments from a ‘close ally’ out there unchallenged, it ultimately suggests that he supports them but isn’t brave enough to say so publicly.”Heywood also took the unusual step of tweeting about criticisms of Robbins. After May’s close aide Gavin Barwell retweeted a statement from the chief whip, Julian Smith, saying “Attacking ind civil servants is deeply unfair”, Heywood wrote:Under Robbins’ plan, the UK would collect import tariffs on behalf of Brussels, while being free to set its own duties for goods bound for the UK. Pro-Brexit Conservatives have described the plan as unworkable and say it will allow Brussels to dictate UK trade policy.An aide to Davis said the Sunday Times story was wrong, and added the Brexit secretary had praised Robbins in an interview with the newspaper on Monday but his words had not been published. According to the aide, Davis said in the interview: “Olly is a fantastic civil servant ... He’s the sherpa, he’s the PM’s sherpa and what do sherpas do? They get you to base camp so you can make the assault on the summit. It’s fine.”Senior Tory backbencher Bernard Jenkin said on Sunday that a customs partnership plan would mean the UK acting as a “tax collector” for the EU and would fail the prime minister’s key tests for a deal with Brussels. “It doesn’t pass any of the key tests that the prime minister has outlined in her statements,” he told BBC1’s Sunday Politics programme. “It doesn’t give us full regulatory autonomy so we wouldn’t be able to do free trade deals with other countries,” he added. The Brexiter business group Leave Means Leave has called for Robbins to be sacked and “replaced by someone from outside the civil service who will take a tough line with Brussels”.Richard Tice and John Longworth of the Brexit-backing business group wrote: “At each stage, Robbins has presided over a bungled negotiating position on behalf of the UK, giving leverage to the EU and acquiescing to their every whim in a way no business person would do.”In a further development, Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, has told the UK the time has come for it to “resolve the contradictions” in its Irish border policy.Writing in Ireland’s Sunday Independent newspaper ahead of a visit to the country on Monday, he said there will need to be “substantial progress” on the border issue by the next major meeting of EU leaders, who are due to assess progress on the border issue at a summit in June."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/78144587dd3cb9d61989c3bd8a22c967be117aab/0_75_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a302611ff189c9ffb6edacf8665eab19","title":"how theresa may benefits from letting amber rudd remain in firing line","story":"To the last, Rudd and her allies insisted she didn’t know about deportation targets – but even if she didn’t, she should have doneBeleaguered, embattled, hapless – as the Windrush scandal worsened over recent days, these doom-laden adjectives had begun attaching themselves irresistibly to Amber Rudd’s name.To the last, she and her allies continued to insist that she didn’t know about deportation targets – they maintain the government’s “ambition” for boosting the number of people sent home is not a “target”.But crucially in her resignation letter, Rudd admitted “information provided to my office”did “make mention of numerical targets”. She didn’t see that information, shesaid – but admitted she should have done.Michael Gove, who defended Rudd robustly on Saturday morning, had already said the memo leaked to the  on Friday had never appeared in the home secretary’s red box.But that simply raised more questions: why not? Why had officials and advisers assumed the existence of numerical targets for chucking people out of Britain was something the home secretary would be sufficiently comfortable about not to have to ensure the details were brought to her attention and formally approved?Even on Sunday afternoon, senior Tories were suggesting that if Rudd could endure another mauling at the hands of Diane Abbott, Yvette Cooper and David Lammy on Monday, she could put the scandal behind her.But the Windrush fiasco has left a trail of devastated lives – and whatever did or did not find its way into her ministerial inbox, making fine distinctions about the precise meaning of the word “target” had begun to look increasingly crass.Certainly, neither Gove – who claimed the leaks were aimed at distracting from Labour’s antisemitism crisis – nor Brandon Lewis, who had the task of defending Rudd on Sunday, made things any better.Indeed, Lewis barely sounded convinced himself by what he must have known was a weak defence of his former boss. While Rudd had known about, and indeed set, an “ambition” for removing more illegal immigrants, he insisted she had no idea that it had been cascaded down to inidual Home Office outposts as a series of targets.The home secretary only survived as long as she did in the face of this swirling crisis, the personal aspects of which she herself described as “heartbreaking”, for two reasons.One is that she is well-liked and more than that, many of her colleagues had a strong interest in her remaining in cabinet.Backbench remainers, including Nicky Morgan, Anna Soubry and Nicholas Soames, threw their support behind Rudd on Friday night after the long wait for a response from the Home Office to the leaked targets memo.The home secretary has issued five apologies in the last week – four of them over her department\u0027s handling of the Windrush crisis and immigration targets.Rudd delivered an unprecedented apology to parliament and acknowledged that her department had “lost sight of iniduals” and become “too concerned with policy”.Rudd apologised for failing to grasp the scale of the problem.

I accept I should have been and I’m sorry that I wasn’t. I didn’t see the leaked document, although it was copied to my office as many documents are.That was partly because they like Rudd – and believe the scandal ultimately reflects the illiberal policies championed by May. They fear any successor could be less likely to challenge the inclusion of students in the net migration target, for example.But it was also because she has been their doughtiest champion inside cabinet in the tug-of-war over how close Britain should remain to the European Union after Brexit.The latest example came this weekend in reports that Rudd would be open to an arrangement with the EU that would replicate key elements of freedom of movement.The second reason Rudd remained in post was that with fresh Windrush injustices still emerging almost daily, she was a lightning rod for public anger, more of which may now be directed at the prime minister.Rudd loyally made repeated public apologies without allowing the blame to fall on the prime minister and the tone and policies that May set in her six years at the Home Office.Rudd had been deemed a potential leadership rival. Allowing her to continue to take incoming fire, particularly as it undermined her reputation for brisk, well-briefed competence, must have been highly tempting.On Sunday night, May was left to turn her thoughts to who should replace her.She may feel obliged to appoint another remainer, to avoid upsetting the delicate balance at the top table. But in the key arguments inside Cabinet, a newbie may lack the power base to be influential for some time – and Britain’s Brexit negotiating position is being fought over right now."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c7d4118ace8f192102934222e2e6902e55205e73/566_15_2697_1619/master/2697.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9d3bcec3473d0e524ae851c00dfbd896","title":"the favourites to take over from amber rudd as home secretary","story":"Giving Michael Gove the job would cap a striking comeback but the timing favours Sajid JavidUPDATE: Sajid Javid is new home secretary after Rudd resigns – politics liveWho are the contenders to be the next home secretary? Downing Street has said a new appointment will not be announced until later on Monday but these are the ministers and MPs who are in contention to replace Amber Rudd.Javid is the favourite for the job and is already being tipped by Tory MPs. The timing could not be better from his perspective he was on the front of the Sunday  talking about his personal anger over the treatment of the Windrush migrants, saying: “I thought that could be my mum ... my dad ... my uncle ... it could be me.” Having backed remain, Javid would keep the balance in the top jobs, though he has made it clear since the referendum he is sceptical of softer Brexit options such as remaining in the customs union.Gove has courted the spotlight since his return to the cabinet table, with a series of eye-catching environmental policies, including a well-publicised war on plastics. However, the key test will be whether his personal relationship with May has mended, since the two clashed during the coalition government in a furious briefing war over her performance at the Home Office when she was home secretary. Were he to get the job, it is likely to re-ignite tensions over the anti-immigration messages of the Vote Leave campaign.Hunt made it clear at the last cabinet reshuffle that he did not want to leave the Department of Health. When May attempted to move him to Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, he convinced her to keep him in post. However, the Home Office is certainly a bigger draw and it could be the promotion to tempt him, perhaps even paving the way for an eventual run at the top job.Lidington is only just settling in at the Cabinet Office, replacing May’s old friend Damian Green who was sacked for making misleading statements about pornography found on his office computer. In Rudd, May has lost another ally that she trusted and confidants are now getting fewer by the day in the cabinet, so Lidington could get the role if May believes the priority should be a safe pair of hands. James Brokenshire, the former Home Office minister and Northern Ireland secretary who left the cabinet due to ill health, also fits that bill.Bradley worked under May at the Home Office, giving her direct experience of the complexities of the department. The former culture secretary was moved to Northern Ireland in the latest reshuffle, currently one of the most difficult jobs in government due to Brexit tensions over the Irish border and the collapse of devolved government in Belfast. Appointing Bradley would also mean keeping the 5050 balance of men and women in the four great offices of state.They are unlikely appointments, but both are capable and experienced former cabinet ministers. To appoint either of them would strip the pro-remain rebels in parliament of a key voice. Both, however, may find the compromise too much, and there is mutual animosity between May and Morgan after a fallout last year over a pair of leather trousers worn by May."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4c1c58e963a9f12b83ffcbbc4d81d1a9165c476/0_226_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8f7025b4cadaaa40b9e213236d1a5f43","title":"amber rudd resignation ministers rally round theresa may","story":"Prime minister under pressure to explain herself to MPs over Windrush scandalMinisters have moved swiftly to try to protect Theresa May after the resignation of Amber Rudd, insisting the home secretary only stood down because she inadvertently misled MPs, not because of the wider Windrush migration scandal.As the prime minister announced Sajid Javid would replace Rudd, the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, rejected the idea that May was facing pressure over her own position. “This is about sorting out a problem,” he told Sky News. “The prime minister has apologised to these people, and we’re going to get on with the job of fixing it.”The home secretary announced her resignation on Sunday after a series of revelations in the  about problems faced by Windrush-generation residents culminated in a leak on Friday that appeared to show she was aware of targets for removing people who were in the country illegally.Who are the Windrush generation?They are people who arrived in the UK after the second world war from Caribbean countries at the invitation of the British government. The first group arrived on the ship MV Empire Windrush in June 1948.What is happening to them?An estimated 50,000 people face the risk of deportation if they never formalised their residency status and do not have the required documentation to prove it.\u0026nbspWhy is this happening now?It stems from a policy, set out by Theresa May when she was home secretary,\u0026nbspto make the UK \u0027a really hostile environment for illegal immigrants\u0027. It requires employers, NHS staff, private landlords and other bodies to demand evidence of people’s citizenship or immigration status.Why do they not have the correct paperwork and status?Some children, often travelling on their parents’ passports, were never formally naturalised and many moved to the UK before the countries in which they were born became independent, so they assumed they were British. In some cases, they did not apply for passports. The Home Office did not keep a record of people entering the country and granted leave to remain, which was conferred on anyone living continuously in the country since before 1 January 1973.What is the government doing to resolve the problem?On Monday, the home secretary Amber Rudd\u0026nbspannounced the creation of a new Home Office team\u0026nbspdedicated to ensuring that Commonwealth-born long-term UK residents would no longer find themselves classified as being in the UK illegally.Rudd was facing a bruising appearance in the House of Commons on Monday, having to explain again why she told the home affairs select committee last week that she did not know of any deportation targets.Grayling denied that May would herself have known about the targets when she was home secretary for six years. “You’re talking about operational targets, on the ground, in inidual teams,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “Ministers don’t see what’s happening in every corner of their department all the time.”Grayling dismissed Labour’s demand that the prime minister should appear before MPs herself on Monday to explain events: “She’s going to be back in the House of Commons on Wednesday. The opposition will have the opportunity to question her then.”There are three layers of state-enforced or enforceable departures of immigrants from the UK: deportations, administrative removals and voluntary departures.Deportations apply to people and their children whose removal is deemed \u0027conducive to the public good\u0027 by the home secretary. They can also be recommended by a court.\u0026nbspAdministrative removals refer to cases involving the enforced removal of non-citizens who have either entered the country illegally, outstayed a visa, or violated the conditions of their leave to remain.Voluntary departures are people against whom enforced removal has been initiated the term \u0027voluntary\u0027 simply describes how they leave. There are three sub-categories:\u0026nbspa) Those who depart via assisted voluntary return schemes. b) Those who make their own travel arrangements and tell the authorities.c) Those who leave without notifying the government.Grayling said Rudd had spoken “in good faith” and had stepped down because “she had inadvertently misled parliament, that she should have known a bit more about the issue of targets”.He told Sky: “It doesn’t often happen in politics, and people criticise when it doesn’t happen. What we’ve got here is a former home secretary who acted on principle.”Grayling insisted Rudd’s departure had nothing to do with the wider issue of members of the Windrush generation of arrivals from the Caribbean being wrongly targeted by immigration authorities, or with the hostile environment immigration policy initiated by May when she was home secretary.“The Windrush issue is something we all regret,” he said. “It’s a mistake, the government’s apologised, the prime minister has apologised, the former home secretary apologised for it. That isn’t the issue that led to her resignation. The issue is about her inadvertently misleading the house in good faith.”Asked on Today who was to blame for Windrush, Grayling said it had been “a circumstance of people who didn’t have the requisite records, who had every right to be here, and the system was not simply geared up to deal with that rather unusual circumstance”.The shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, disputed this, and said May also should come to the Commons to explain herself to MPs.On May addressing MPs, Abbott said: “In the first instance we’d like to know if she herself knew about the targets and would therefore be in a position to say whether Amber Rudd misled the house.“More fundamentally, we want to talk to her about the aspects of the so-called hostile environment, which she was responsible for and led to the Windrush fiasco.”In her resignation letter to the prime minister, published hours after the latest leak, Rudd said she had “become aware of information provided to my office which makes mention of targets. I should have been aware of this, and I take full responsibility that I was not.”May replied that she believed Rudd had given her evidence “in good faith”, but she could “understand why, now you have had a chance to review the advice that you have received on this issue, you have made the decision you have made, and taken responsibility for inadvertently misleading the home affairs select committee”.May said Rudd had led her department with “great integrity, compassion and selflessness – notwithstanding the personal and political challenges you have faced during this period”.The process that led to Rudd’s departure began on Wednesday when the Labour MP Yvette Cooper challenged her repeatedly at the home affairs select committee about removals targets, prompting Rudd to insist “that’s not how we operate”.Former ministerial colleagues paid tribute to Rudd and expressed hope she would return.The health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, said Rudd would “be missed until she is back, which she will be”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab1db564261fa74b9ce3c05ea5dcb04508730ca3/0_102_1381_828/master/1381.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5484b5773bc20549ee95e159e063f424","title":"sajid javid replaces amber rudd as home secretary","story":"The communities secretary, Sajid Javid, has been appointed home secretary to replace Amber Rudd, the prime minister announced on Twitter.Ministers moved swiftly to rally round Theresa May on Monday, insisting Rudd only stood down because she inadvertently misled MPs, not because of the wider Windrush migration scandal.Rudd was forced to step down after a series of revelations in the  about problems faced by Windrush-generation residents, which culminated in a leak on Friday that appeared to show she was aware of targets for removing people who were in the country illegally.The home secretary has issued five apologies in the last week – four of them over her department\u0027s handling of the Windrush crisis and immigration targets.Rudd delivered an unprecedented apology to parliament and acknowledged that her department had “lost sight of iniduals” and become “too concerned with policy”.Rudd apologised for failing to grasp the scale of the problem. She told the home affairs select committee: “I bitterly, deeply regret that I didn’t see it as more than inidual cases gone wrong that needed addressing. I didn’t see it as a systemic issue until very recently.”On Thursday morning, Rudd was forced to admit officials did have targets for removals, having previously denied their existence.“The immigration arm of the Home Office has been using local targets for internal performance management. These were not published targets against which performance was assessed, but if they were used inappropriately then I am clear that this will have to change.On Thursday afternoon, Rudd was forced to issue a hasty clarification after appearing to leave the door open to the UK staying in a customs union with the EU.“I should have been clearer – of course when we leave the EU we will be leaving the customs union.In a series of late-night tweets, Rudd apologised for not being aware of documents, leaked to the , which set out immigration removal targets.\u0026nbsp‘I wasn’t aware of specific removal targets.

Compared with people who adopted none of them, men and women who adhered to all five saw their life expectancy at 50 rise from 26 to 38 years and 29 to 43 years respectively, or an extra 12 years for men and 14 for women.“When we embarked on this study, I thought, of course, that people who adopted these habits would live longer. But the surprising thing was how huge the effect was,” said Meir Stampfer, a co-author on the study and professor of epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health.The researchers performed the analysis in the hope of understanding why the US, which spends more on healthcare as a proportion of GDP than any other nation, ranks 31st in the world for life expectancy at birth. According to the World Health Organization, life expectancy at birth in 2015 was 76.9 and 81.6 years old for US men and women respectively. The equivalent figures for Britain are very similar at 79.4 and 83 years old.The five healthy habits were defined as not smoking having a body mass index between 18.5 and 25 taking at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise a day, having no more than one 150ml glass of wine a day for women, or two for men and having a diet rich in items such as fruit, vegetables and whole grains and low in red meat, saturated fats and sugar.Given that the habits of a healthy lifestyle are well known, the mystery is why we are so bad at adopting them, said Stampfer. Part of the problem is that many people struggle to give up smoking, and the continuous peddling of unhealthy food, as well as poor urban planning, which can make it hard for people to exercise, also feed in, he said.“I do think people need to step up and take some personal responsibility, but as a society we need to make it easier for people to do that,” he said. “People can get stuck in a rut and think it’s too late to change their ways, but what we find is that when people do change their ways, we see remarkable benefits.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8fc75899cbe64170d23a20947d81aecc3f955ccd/17_42_2521_1512/master/2521.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e330361f2033d6a28e48db8a0ce5249f","title":"lewis hamilton wins azerbaijan grand prix red bulls collide","story":"• Raikkonen second Pérez third Sebastian Vettel fourth• Red Bulls of Max Verstappen and Daniel Ricciardo collideFrom formulaic through to a denouement that simply could not have been scripted, the streets of Baku were once again the stage for a compelling, dramatic performance. Where cool heads were called for at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix there was not a little abandon and in its wake fortune too played its part to deliver an unlikely result in a season already notable for refusing to stick to a predictable plot.Lewis Hamilton took the win but it is unlikely to be a favoured memory. He inherited first place with two laps to go from his Mercedes team-mate Valtteri Bottas, who had looked nailed on for the victory until a puncture caused by debris ended his charge, leaving the Finn disconsolate.Behind Hamilton his championship rival, Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel, for some time in control of the race, saw his hopes disappear after a late safety car when he sacrificed calm consideration for an overambitious lunge that reduced him to fourth place.This most unlikely turnaround at the front was reflected in an equally unexpected reversal of the championship standings. Trailing Vettel by nine points before Baku, Hamilton leaves four points to the good, the first time he has topped the table this season.Hamilton, who had not been on the pace all weekend and never looked like threatening for the lead, was honest about his good fortune. “It was mixed emotions,” he said. “Grateful for the opportunity to win but on the other side I did not drive the way I feel like I normally drive, so that hurts a little bit in my heart.”A likely win at the first round in Melbourne was denied Hamilton after a late safety car and he may feel that some justice has been served. But perhaps there will be more satisfaction that his chance of a win here last year was ultimately denied after Vettel barged him. “I was coming out of the last corner in disbelief,” he said. “It was very emotional. In previous years here I have been in the lead and then something went against me. I said maybe third time lucky and it was that scenario today.”Bottas’s ill-fortune and Hamilton’s good favour was the final part of a thrilling last act. Behind them the Red Bulls had been offering a fine narrative of their own, with Daniel Ricciardo and Max Verstappen going wheel to wheel throughout. It was nail-biting stuff but the team had let them race, a decision they came to regret when the Australian went for a pass into the braking zone of turn one. Verstappen had already moved once and then shifted back to the inside where Ricciardo had committed. A terminal collision ensued. The stewards concluded that both were responsible, Verstappen for changing lines twice and Ricciardo for making his move too late. Both were given reprimands.Disappointment was writ large on the faces of the drivers, but that was as nothing to the condemnation from the team principal, Christian Horner. “We are not apportioning blame, they are both to blame,” he said. “They have been reminded that they are part of a team, they are highly paid iniduals and have to act with the team’s interests at heart, not just their own. That message was delivered very clearly.”The safety car the incident caused proved crucial. It allowed Mercedes to pit Bottas, who had stayed out long on his tyres and inherited the lead, to emerge still in front of Vettel.A further lack of focus saw Romain Grosjean put his Haas into the wall on lap 43 while weaving, and that kept the safety car out longer than expected. Five laps later at the restart Bottas had control, but Vettel did not. He charged up the inside into one, far too hot, locked up, went wide and lost places to Hamilton and Kimi Räikkönen, who was second, and then to Force India’s Sergio Pérez who took third, his team’s first podium of the year.It was not the percentage manoeuvre of a championship contender but the German insisted he had no regrets. “I am happy I tried the move. I am not happy it didn’t work. You have to try.” That’s a view he may come to consider again if the season goes to the wire.A lap later Bottas had to face his own slings and arrows, grinding to a halt amid disintegrating rubber. “It was just unfortunate. Unlucky. Ten pints of beer and maybe I will be fine,” said the visibly disappointed Finn. “I will get through it, you always have to get through, it is part of racing but at the moment it is painful.”Hamilton felt for Bottas but knows that he and his team have real work ahead. Their issue with bringing the tyres up to temperature looked no closer to being solved in Baku and he acknowledged that they had to address it.For the moment, however, he leaves with a lead, favoured by fortune but also more than aware that he kept his head and seized the reward. It was cause for the four-times world champion to remember the lesson he had learned in karting. “I never give up,” he said. “It has been a while since I have been reminded of that lesson my dad taught me years ago. I kept pushing and things turned out the way they did and that was a realisation of how true that mindset is.”Carlos Sainz in the Renault finished in fifth, while Charles Leclerc completed an exemplary afternoon and the rookie’s best drive thus far in F1 to take sixth for Sauber.

If a distinctly chilly Sunday afternoon in west London exuded little obvious glamour, the inaugural Tyrrells Premier\u0026nbsp15s final represented the latest major positive\u0026nbspstride for the domestic women’s game, a potentially significant staging post along the long, winding road to oval‑shaped equality.It may be a while yet before rugby’s sisterhood are contesting a sold-out Twickenham final but then again few envisaged professional men’s club rugby back in the 1980s when Saracens were playing on a public park in Southgate. In years to come those in charge of championing the women’s club game may just recall this as the moment which propelled their heroines out of the shadows and into the light of public consciousness.Ultimately it was Saracens’ day on the field at Ealing, by a breathlessly narrow 24-20 margin against Harlequins in front of 2,000, but it was arguably an even greater triumph for everyone who has believed in 15-a-side women’s rugby as more than entertaining enough to be judged on its own merits. For sheer edge-of-the-seat tension the final moments were as taut as any neutral could possibly wish to experience.To watch players as compellingly good as Marlie Packer, Shaunagh Brown and Jess Breach is also to wonder how long it will be before they are properly rewarded like their male counterparts, as opposed to juggling full-time jobs and training three times a week for the love of it. Nigel Melville, the Rugby Football Union’s director of professional rugby, says he is “absolutely sure” the best women club players will be paid in future, while the Wasps coach, Giselle Mather, argues that current levels of personal sacrifice will be “unsustainable” sooner rather than later.Mather said on Sunday: “How do you become the best athlete you can be and hold down a full-time job? In 10 years’ time I would suggest we’re looking at the top tier being professional or semi-professional. It is possible we might be at that stage in five years.”According to Mather “a tipping point has been reached in women’s sport” and only the seriously blinkered would disagree with her analysis. “People are realising that women’s sport is really good to watch. We’re not trying to be the men’s game. If I was a young lass going into sport now, I’d be so excited. There are now five quality female team sports – hockey, netball, football, cricket and rugby – which are all roaringly successful. Team sport for females is cool now and we’re bloody good at it.”Initially Saracens’ mauling and offloading game had threatened to\u0026nbspoverrun Harlequins, a lovely pass from Hannah Botterman creating the game’s first try for her fellow prop, Sam Martinez Gion, and the captain, Lottie Clapp, slicing through for the second. When the winger Garnet Mackinder added a third to make it 17-3, a horribly one-sided contest\u0026nbsploomed.Harlequins, though, displayed considerably more cohesion, resolve and stamina than their male counterparts have managed in recent weeks. Holly Myers gave them some hope just before half-time and second-half tries from Breach, on as a replacement, and the flanker Deborah McCormack dragged them right back into\u0026nbspcontention. Even after the no-nonsense Botterman had rampaged over for Saracens’ fourth try Quins kept coming and a stunning comeback might have been completed but for a rush‑of‑blood quick tap and subsequent knock-on in front of the posts which saved their relieved opponents.The RFU, which has invested £2.4m in women’s club rugby over three years, will also be hugging itself at how swiftly its newly minted tournament has captured hearts and minds. Let it not be forgotten women’s club rugby has been in this country for four decades – several of the leading pioneers were in Ealing on Sunday – but the scepticism which greeted its rebranding last year has proved mostly misplaced.“The quality of the games has been phenomenal,” Mather said. “It’s surprised even me. Women’s club rugby has been around for 40 years but never with financial support. The respect is now there.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/231b415867a341cf560dfb87f18f33d71955d4e2/1_0_4306_2584/master/4306.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ce65e9bcc56179f1616e890a771cee47","title":"bookies using ai to keep gamblers hooked insiders say","story":"Artificial intelligence being used to predict behaviour in ‘frightening new ways’ despite condemnation from MPs and campaignersThe gambling industry is increasingly using artificial intelligence to predict consumer habits and personalise promotions to keep gamblers hooked, industry insiders have revealed.Current and former gambling industry employees have described how people’s betting habits are scrutinised and modelled to manipulate their future behaviour.“The industry is using AI to profile customers and predict their behaviour in frightening new ways,” said Asif, a digital marketer who previously worked for a gambling company. “Every click is scrutinised in order to optimise profit, not to enhance a user’s experience.”“I’ve often heard people wonder about how they are targeted so accurately and it’s no wonder because its all hidden in the small print.”Publicly, gambling executives boast of increasingly sophisticated advertising keeping people betting, while privately conceding that some are more susceptible to gambling addiction when bombarded with these type of bespoke ads and incentives. Gamblers’ every click, page view and transaction is scientifically examined so that ads statistically more likely to work can be pushed through Google, Facebook and other platforms.“They’ll know everything about an inidual from their inside leg measurement onwards,” said Nick, a consultant within the gambling industry.Users unwittingly consent to the use of their data in ways they aren’t aware of due to lengthy terms and conditions, enabling their information to legally be used in this way.“Once someone has logged into a gambling platform it can do whatever they want with them,” said Brian, a digital marketer for the gambling industry. “It’s like a science, it’s not just random advertising messages, the whole thing is personalised, and data-driven customer profiles are constructed from gamblers’ behaviour.”Last August, the  revealed the gambling industry uses third-party companies to harvest people’s data, helping bookmakers and online casinos target people on low incomes and those who have stopped gambling.Despite condemnation from MPs, experts and campaigners, such practices remain an industry norm.“You can buy email lists with more than 100,000 people’s emails and phone numbers from data warehouses who regularly sell data to help market gambling promotions,” said Brian. “They say it’s all opted in but people haven’t opted in at all.”In this way, among others, gambling companies and advertisers create detailed customer profiles including masses of information about their interests, earnings, personal details and credit history.“I never cease to be amazed at how low the gambling industry is prepared to go to exploit those who have indicated an interest in gambling,” says Carolyn Harris, a Labour MP who has campaigned for gambling reform.“The industry is geared to get people addicted to something that will cause immense harm, not just to society but to iniduals and their families. They are parasitical leeches and I will offer no apology for saying that.”The Facebook data scandal highlighted the potential risks of transferring people’s data to third parties, but there remains precious little regulation or transparency when it comes to data collection, retention and use.“The legislation on data is a long way behind the technology itself,” said Asif. “We were often audited, and there were strict regulations on advertisements, but there was never any oversight on data.“There are no safeguards to stop advertisers putting an email list with hundreds of thousands of people’s data on a USB and taking it with them when they finish a contract.”The Information Commissioner’s Office points to the Data Protection Act 1998 and GDPR, which both place requirements on organisations to inform iniduals about the ways in which their personal data is used.“The GDPR strengthens this right to be informed, requiring organisations to provide people with additional information, including the lawful basis for processing, the period for which data will be stored and details of any third parties that will receive the data,” an ICO spokesperson said.Elsewhere, there are plans to geolocate customers in order to identify when they arrive at stadiums so they can prompted via texts to bet on the game they are about to watch.The gambling industry earned£14bn in 2016, £4.5bn of which from online betting, and it is pumping some of that money into making its products more sophisticated and, in effect, addictive.“It’s no surprise that these companies are investing as much as they are into these sorts of algorithms to supposedly detect people who may be at risk of developing gambling problems, because the exact same technology allows them to market to people very effectively,” said Nick.“It’s not a benign move on the part of operators, and although I wouldn’t say it is a cynical ploy, there are clearly huge commercial benefits from this sort of investment.”A spokesperson for the Campaign for Fairer Gambling said: “Big Data is being cynically exploited by the gambling industry to target vulnerable consumers. So the Gambling Commission’s trust in operators to use customer data for social responsibility purposes is naïve at best.”Mark Etches, chief executive of GambleAware, a gambling-related harm charity, said: “Gambling advertising can be anywhere from TV screens, to social media, to mobile phone apps, and it can be hard for people at risk of developing a gambling problem to ignore the overload of messages.“We hope all gambling companies put a similar level of commitment and resources behind promoting safer gambling and the help available at BeGambleAware.org as they do their own products.”Some names have been changed to protect identities."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5bfa27efad28d741ff94c9124800edfe5decb204/589_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0c6c91812e9a67782fce923bee7edeeb","title":"windows 10 april 2018 update microsoft task management cortana edge sharing","story":"Microsoft has released the latest version of Windows 10, adding improvements to task management, Cortana, Edge and sharingThe next version of Windows 10 is finally ready to download as a free update that adds some potentially game-changing new features as well as some welcome features that bring it up to par with what you might expect from a smartphone.Instead of adding tools for people creating media, as the previous two updates have, the latest version of Windows 10 is focused on time and task management.“We want to give you back some of your greatest currency, your time. Our hope is that you’ll have more time to do what matters most to you – create, play, work or simply do what you love,” said Yusuf Mehdi, corporate vice president of Microsoft’s Windows and Devices group.That’s what was reported earlier in the year, but Microsoft has made the wise choice to simplify the name this time round. Instead of trying to work out which year the Fall or Spring might be in, now we’ve got month and year, which makes a lot more sense.It’s true. The update has only just squeaked in at the last minute to make it into April. It was scheduled to be released a couple of weeks ago, but a bug found at the last minute by testers had to be fixed before it was released beyond the early adopter “Windows Insider” community.Most people will probably get the update after April as it gradually rolls out.The easiest way is to wait for the notification from Windows Update, which lets the user know a feature update is ready to install, but you can also manually check for updates from the Settings app. Failing that you can manually download the latest version of Windows 10 direct from Microsoft and upgrade from that.In a word, yes. While there are ways to stop Windows 10 from downloading it, Microsoft only supports older versions of Windows 10 for two years or less from release.That means that the Windows 10 Anniversary Update, which was released in August 2016 is no longer supported and will not receive further bug fixes and security updates. The Creators Update, released in April 2017 will no longer be supported from 9 October this year, so the only way to keep using a supported version of Windows 10 is to keep upgrading.The biggest and most obvious change is the addition of a timeline feature to the task view. Essentially a history of the apps and files you had open earlier that day or week, Timeline allows you to see what you were doing on the PC you’re currently using and other devices, and resume from where you left off.As Microsoft’s apps on other platforms gain Timeline support their activities will show up on your PC. One of the first is Microsoft Edge for Android and iOS.Focus Assist is a beefed-up version of Do Not Disturb. You can turn it on manually or set it up on a schedule, and it’ll block notifications and other distractions until you’re done. At the end it’ll provide a summary of what happened while you were doing whatever it was you were doing.Like a DND mode you can whitelist certain people so that their emails and messages get through, even when you’re trying to concentrate.Microsoft is pushing improved dictation as a feature of the April 2018 update. In any text box you can now hit the Windows Key + H and start talking.Microsoft’s virtual assistant gets some new powers with the April 2018 update. It will now suggest tasks you might want to resume from previous devices, tapping into the Timeline feature. Support for some smart home appliances has also been rolled out, including Google’s Nest thermostat, and natural language voice control for third-party apps such as Spotify is also being added.Still seeking to convince people to use it over Chrome, Microsoft’s Edge browser gains the ability to strip out clutter when you print from a website, and the ability to mute audio from specific tabs. Some new Grammar Tools will also help break down complex words into syllables and highlight nouns, verbs and adjectives. That adds to several other ebook, design and gesture support improvements.Microsoft has implemented its own version of Apple’s AirDrop, sending files over Bluetooth and wifi without having to mess about with cables. You can limit it to just your devices or any Windows 10 device. How useful the feature turns out to be depends on how many Windows 10 devices you have around you."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/da8a2b6483c373a8c35387af7848693464225378/0_84_3916_2350/master/3916.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=80f9a107c7498a889d8d718fd1df54b0","title":"north korea denuclearization john bolton mike pompeo","story":"North Korea will have to show concrete and tangible evidence it has made a strategic decision to give up nuclear weapons before any move is made to ease pressure on the regime, Donald Trump’s national security adviser, John Bolton, said on Sunday.With a summit between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un potentially as close as three weeks away, Bolton warned that no progress would be made without verifiable evidence of Pyongyang’s commitment to complete and “irreversible” denuclearization. “What we want to see from them is evidence that it’s real and not just rhetoric,” he told CBS’ Face the Nation.The famously hawkish Bolton took a notably less hardline approach than was reflected in his many disparaging remarks towards North Korea before he was brought into the White House earlier this month. In one typical comment on Fox News he made what he called a joke: “How do you know the North Korean regime is lying – answer, their lips are moving.”Now Bolton is striking a more nuanced position. In an interview with Fox News Sunday, he stressed that the US had made no commitment to remove its military presence from the Korean peninsula and said: “There’s nobody in the Trump administration who’s starry-eyed about what’s happening here.”He went on to say that if North Korea were willing to allow full and complete disclosure of its nuclear weapons programme coupled with international verification, “things could move quickly”.Hopes of a breakthrough in dismantling North Korea’s nuclear weapons at a Trump-Kim summit have risen in the wake of fast-moving events. Details emerging from the office of South Korean president Moon Jae-in following his historic face-to-face encounter with Kim suggest the North Korean leader offered to allow foreign inspectors and journalists to witness nuclear decommissioning ahead of the Trump summit.The Trump administration is remaining noncommittal about such dramatic posturing from Kim, as the US tries to walk a hazardous path that both pursues a breakthrough and remains aware of broken promises made in the past. In his first interview as secretary of state, former CIA director Mike Pompeo characterized the current flurry of diplomatic activity as a “real opportunity for something that would be transformative for the world if we could achieve it”.Pompeo spoke to ABC’s This Week from Saudi Arabia, giving generally stilted answers and bringing the interview to an abrupt close after facing questions on US strategy. He declined to reveal intelligence on North Korean nuclear capabilities and said repeatedly: “This administration has its eyes wide open.”He added: “We know the history, we know the risks. We’re going to negotiate in a different way than before, we’re going to require steps that demonstrate denuclearization is going to be achieved. We’re not going to take promises or words, we are going to look for actions and deeds.”Earlier this year, Pompeo had a secret meeting with Kim in Pyongyang, lasting more than an hour. He told ABC it had been a “good conversation. We talked about serious matters, on the hardest issues that face our two countries.”Bolton went into further details about subjects that Trump will want to raise should the summit with Kim go ahead at a time and location still to be determined. North Korean ballistic missile programs, biological and chemical weapons programs, and the “abduction of innocent Japanese and South Korean citizens over the years” would all be on the list, Bolton said.Despite the reticence on the part of both Pompeo and Bolton to go into details about the precise US gameplan, top administration figures were outspoken on one point: all praise for current extraordinary events should be bestowed on Trump.The most passionate proponent of that idea is Trump himself. At a rally in Michigan on Saturday night he told the crowd: “I had one of the fake news groups this morning saying: ‘What do you think President Trump had to do with it?’ I’ll tell you what. Like, how about everything?”In response, there were chants of “Nobel! Nobel!”, in reference to the Nobel peace prize.Bolton made the same point on Sunday to CBS, albeit in more measured terms: “I think it’s clear we’re here where we are today because of the pressure that the Trump administration has put on North Korea. Economic pressure, political, military pressure. I think this is widely recognized.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/382261a9a7820c66b20f1c2433217523bb9b3a1f/693_272_3808_2286/master/3808.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5760d9fd1f8406a9d26eb586528fbf25","title":"monday briefing rudd blown away by windrush","story":"Good morning. I’m Martin Farrer and these are the top stories to start your week.Her departure from the government creates a number of problems for May, not least that the person who was taking the flak for the tough immigration policy built by the PM while she was home secretary has now gone. May faced immediate calls from Labour and the Lib Dems to front up to the Commons about Rudd’s resignation and the whole Windrush scandal. The other problem is who she should pick to replace Rudd at the Home Office and whether the loss of a “soft Brexiter” upsets the cabinet’s precarious balance of leave and remain forces. Here are the most likely runners and riders, a list led by Sajid Javid and Michael Gove. reporter who broke open the Windrush story, Amelia Gentleman, has written about how her low-key investigation transformed into a scandal that has shamed Britain’s reputation for fairness. And, lest we forget, this is a story about the shocking mistreatment of Windrush generation immigrants including Hubert Howard, who arrived here from Jamaica aged three, has never lived anywhere else, and yet lost his job as a caretaker because he couldn’t prove his citizenship. As he tells Amelia: “I’m just satisfied that people are finally listening.”You can follow all the action at our live blog here. ‘Truth telling’ – America’s sharply polarised politics were exposed again by the reaction to Michelle Wolf’s scathing attack on the Trump administration in her standup routine at the annual White House correspondents’ dinner on Saturday night. Wolf’s barbs about the press secretary, Sarah Sanders, and Trump’s daughter, Ivanka, provoked an angry response from conservatives. The White House adviser Mercedes Schlapp and her husband, Matt Schlapp, who chairs the American Conservative Union, walked out. He later tweeted: “Enough of elites mocking all of us.” Several leading journalists and Trump critics agreed that Wolf had gone too far. But the comedian was defended by many people on social media who said she had the right to say what she wanted under the first amendment. Rosie O’Donnell, one of Trump’s bêtes noires, slammed those who called Wolf’s speech vulgar by replying: “It’s a roast – truth telling is required.”Rail cutbacks – Millions of trees are at risk of being chopped down as Network Rail engages in a “pre-emptive strike” to prevent falling leaves and branches from disrupting services. The company has used drones to create an aerial map of its 40,000 hectares of railway and identified “hotspots” it needs to deal with. But the cull has angered conservation groups who say the chainsaw massacre endangers the habitat of wildlife along the country’s railways. One passenger said of his journey between Leeds and Manchester: “It looked like some kind of logging operation .. all you could see was mile after mile of tree stumps and sawdust.”Cancer care alarm – More alarm bells have sounded for the NHS in the shape of a report by Macmillan Cancer Support which says specialist cancer nurses are being “run ragged” as they are forced to take on heavier workloads because of high vacancy rates in the profession. There is also a “startlingly broad variation” in the number of specialist cancer nurses in some parts of England compared with how many new patients are being diagnosed. New lung cancer cases each year per specialist nurse vary from 62 to 203 in different areas, while for breast cancer nurses they vary from 56 to 145. Vocation, vocation, vocation – As we enter local election week, it has emerged that almost one in 10 councillors in London either work for property businesses or have received gifts or hospitality from them. A  investigation has revealed that nearly 100 councillors hold a variety of jobs working for property companies or lobbying and communications consultancies, while also sitting on planning committees where they make decisions over major developments. While we’re on the elections, Polly Toynbee writes today that the polls could shock the government as people hit back against cuts in services.It’s often said that we live in turbulent times but the riots, assassinations and spirit of revolution that spread across the western world 50 years ago take some beating.

From the musical Hair to Star Trek’s interracial kiss, and from Josef Koudelka’s celebrated photograph of his wristwatch above the deserted streets of post-putsch Prague to rock’s “hippy idealism”, our critics delve back in time. Writing about Jean Luc Godard’s documentary about the Rolling Stones, One Plus One, Peter Bradshaw sums it up neatly: “It shows the strange, tense moodiness of the times: the simmering sense of disorder: jittery, euphoric, but with an edge of bleary cynicism, like the voice of Jagger’s Lucifer.”The problem with football, as Arsène Wenger is rapidly finding out, is that there is never any guarantee of a happy ending the Arsenal manager had been clapped to his seat at Old Trafford but his team conceded a 91st-minute goal as Marouane Fellaini’s header gave Manchester United a 2-1 win.

Chinese officials and state media focused instead on president Xi Jinping’s meeting with Indian prime minister Narendra Modi and a visit by Xi to China’s Yangtze river. After the summit, China’s ministry of foreign affairs released a short statement saying Beijing “welcomed” the results of the talks. “China stands ready to continue to play its positive role to this end,” it added, according to Xinhua news agency. Then, on Monday, China’s foreign ministry announced it was sending its top diplomat, foreign minister Wang Yi, to visit North Korea this week.The visit comes as China, North Korea’s most powerful ally, moves to reassert itself in quickly moving peace talks with the formerly isolated Korean state. China has long said that North Korea’s nuclear programme is for Washington and Pyongyang to work out between themselves. But now warming ties between North Korea and the US could dramatically alter the power structure in the region, leaving Beijing on the outside.Kim said on Friday he is willing to give up nuclear weapons if the US promises not to invade and commits to a formal end to the Korean War that ended with an armistice in 1953. Kim and US president Donald Trump could meet within the next month.North and South Korea have been ided since the end of the Korean War (1950-53), and except for about a decade ending in 2008, relations between the two have remained frosty. The two nations technically remain in a state of war, since a peace treaty was never signed.\u0026nbspThere have been occasional outbreaks of violence, most recently in 2010 when 50 people were killed when a South Korean navy corvette was sunk and several islands close to the border were attacked.This meeting\u0026nbspcould touch on a formal truce\u0026nbspbut this is also not the first time North Korea has expressed a willingness to abandon its nuclear ambitions. A deal with the US, Japan and South Korea in the 1990s was meant to give the North civilian nuclear power without the ability to build a weapon, but the reactor was never finished.North Korea\u0026nbsppledged to relinquish its nuclear programme\u0026nbspin 2007 in exchange for sanctions relief and fuel, but later pulled out of that agreement and expelled inspectors in 2009.Read a full explainer on the Korea summit here“So now things are out of China’s control and it is no surprise that it is being excluded from the discussions.”While talks between North and South Korea and Washington fit China’s interest in stability on the Korean peninsula, Beijing is also worried about an unfavourable regional strategic balance unfolding.China will still be part of any discussions over a formal peace treaty to replace the armistice signed by China, the US and North Korea in 1953, ending more than three years of fighting between the North and the South. A trilateral summit in May between Japan, South Korea, and China will also provide Beijing another chance to exert influence, according to Kovrig. “Politically, I think China is being careful to give North and South Korea the space to advance the diplomatic process, because that’s in Beijing’s interest. Watching closely and working behind the scenes to position itself,” said Kovrig."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c7367799adc822bdfd24c4f8625cef7eff67e830/0_80_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=35d69f76f4e11be8bdd1e38e50a78438","title":"my financial future can i have my brunch and eat it too","story":"The options appear to be: never socialise and stay in to save for a house, or live a normal, modern urban life and spiral into debt. But is there a third way?Sitting firmly in the middle of the millennial generation (those born 1981-2000) and I’m told I could easily afford to buy my first home in London if I just give up: coffee, my gym membership, an annual weekend away, takeaway food, and a mobile upgrade, or one night out a week, for five years – or avocados.Sure, London living is afforded by renting the equivalent of a dodgy hostel dorm, nights out revolving around two-for-one deals, and “side-hustles”, which is a glorified term for my three jobs. So, should I accept that I can’t have my brunch and eat it too? Living paycheck to paycheck isn’t the dream and maybe neither is owning a home, but there must be a way I could at least consider the option.I’m certainly not alone, but maybe we’re placing too much value on “Yolo” – apparently a typical habit of young people today – so I’ve asked Paul Bridgwater, head of commercial and proposition at financial services provider OneFamily, and millennial lifestyle and personal finance expert Lisa Rowan from The Penny Hoarder what they think – and luckily neither suggested a five-year period where I give up all that I hold dear.Is it really that hard to save in a big city or am I being led astray?Rowan suggests that, unfortunately, it’s not all in my head. “Affordable, low-amenity units are being replaced with luxury buildings that are simply out of reach for many people, especially young people in the early stages of their careers,” she says. “This competitive housing environment means more workers in their 20s and 30s are enduring long commutes from the suburbs or are living with several roommates in order to make the most of their budgets.” But, Bridgwater says, while it can feel unattainable without the help from “the bank of mum and dad” we do have the benefit of living in a connected, digital age that can help us achieve our financial goals.I really value my social life – do I have to give up a chunk of it for five years?No, says Rowan, but there are some hacks to help make sure you don’t spend most of your monthly wages during the excitement of payday. In short, be at least a bit prepared. “Knowing the type of activity upfront can help you determine whether an event is a social and financial priority for you – then, it’s easier to make compromises. You may skip on the 12-person birthday dinner at a fancy restaurant, but you can still meet the group for drinks or dessert afterward. You can still go on a bar crawl with your friends, but perhaps eat a hearty meal before you leave the house,” she says.Bridgwater agrees, and says it’s safe to assume that most of your friends are in the same boat, so be straight up with them. “Money is a bit of a taboo subject for any age group, especially in the UK. On a practical level, earnings, savings and debts are not really discussed and perhaps they should be,” he says. “Like anything else in life, by talking and sharing issues, interesting solutions will come to light.”OK, so maybe I should be budgeting. What are some handy guidelines?Bridgwater says that budgeting isn’t the same for everyone, but taking away the temptation to spend is often the easiest way to save. “Create different accounts for your big expenses (housing, bills and savings) and then set up a standing order into these accounts one to two days after your wages go in from your main account. You’ll then know the money you have left in your main account is money you can spend,” he says.So, can I think about saving for a big purchase and still keep seeing my friends?Yes, says Rowan: “You can have your instant and delayed gratification at the same time.” A product like OneFamily’s stocks and shares Lifetime Isa is a good start when considering your options. With a Lifetime Isa, for every £4 put in, the government adds £1 – so save up to £4,000 a year and get £1,000 as a bonus (available after 12 months). Lifetime Isas are available either based on cash investments, which can be preferable for first-time house purchases in the short-term or stocks and shares investments, which might be preferable if you are aiming to buy your first home in five or more years, as they offer potentially better returns over the longer term, but be aware that capital is at risk.For information on the OneFamily stocks and shares Lifetime Isa, visit OneFamily.

About €14m has been invested in the school to date. Photograph: Dara MacDónaillThe  Ireland most expensive school is expecting up to 180 pupils when its doors open next September.The Nord Anglia International School Dublin, which will charge day pupils up to €24,000 a year, declined to say how many pupils it has signed up already. Speaking at an open day on Sunday, founding principal Paul Crute said student enrolment was positive and he expected to enrol about 20 pupils in each year, which would deliver a pupil-teacher ratio of about nine to one. About €14 million has been invested in the school so far.“This group of students is made up of Irish students moving to our international curriculum, students of international executives, and students of expats some living and some relocating back to Ireland,” he said.According to the school website, pupils are being accepted for nine “year groups” from about three years to 14 years in the autumn. With 20 pupils in each year this would deliver an enrolment of 180, each paying from €5,900 per term to €8,000 per term depending on tuition and extras. Many of the families attending the open day were from Asia, but a spokesman said this was not necessarily representative of interest so far.Previews of what life will be like for those enrolled in the school in south Co Dublin were given to parents and prospective pupils on Sunday.The event featured a music and dancing session with teachers flown in from The Juilliard School for performing arts in New York.Nord Anglia which is to open in Leopardstown in September has a “strategic association” with the Juilliard School which allows pupils to develop their creative and dramatic skills “on the world stage” said Mr Crute. A previous “learning lab” introduction for prospective parents featured a session with Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Pupils in Dublin will be offered the opportunity to get involved in the “adopt a slum” programme in New Delhi, India, said Mr Crute. Mr Crute said the school would not teach the Irish curriculum, but will opt instead for the International Baccalaureate. The Irish language will be offered. Mr Crute said the school would attract the children of diplomats and those of foreign executives. He said many of the latter group work for global firms which will pay the school fees bill. “We have strategic partnerships with many global companies,” he added. When fully open the school will accept pupils aged from three to 18 years. But in September the school will offer places only to those up to about 14 years to allow children to progress through the International Baccalaureate format. Sports will include basketball, volleyball, martial arts, tennis, fencing and dance. “We are not a rugby school,” said Mr Crute before joking that Ireland “doesn’t need another private, rugby school”."},{"url":null,"title":"cork looks set to go to the wire in referendum on eight amendment","story":"  April 28, 2018Both sides in abortion referendum believe they have the edge.

Photograph: Dimitar DilkoffAFPGetty ImagesWhen Michel Barnier visits Derry on Wednesday as part of his tour of Ireland, the city will just have celebrated the launch of a new four-year project funded by the EU’s Peace IV programme.It is an apt reminder that the EU’s chief brexit negotiator has been here before. As commissioner for regional policy from 1999 to 2004, in the immediate aftermath of the signing of the Belfast Agreement, Barnier was responsible for the EU Peace programmes in Northern Ireland, crucial underpinnings of the agreement. He signed off on hundreds of millions of euro of EU support for both the Derry region and the North.Barnier has often spoken emotionally of how important that work was to him and how it informs his engagement with and commitment to Irish issues in the Brexit talks.He and his team also talk of the Belfast Agreement as a European agreement – safeguarding its provisions through the Brexit talks is as much about ensuring that the UK honours its undertakings to the EU as to the citizens of the North.He has been completely unambiguous in his warnings to the UK that agreement on a backstop Border provision is a precondition for the much broader Withdrawal Agreement and its provisions on transition. And soon.A sprightly and fit 67, Barnier, who has been described as austere, has been engaged in politics at national level and then Brussels for 40 years, and shows no sign of tiring. He is proud of his rural upbringing in the mountainous Savoie region and revels in hiking there. He was elected to represent it at 27, then the youngest politician in the National Assembly.He has served as EU commissioner twice – as regional commissioner, and from 2010 to 2014 as internal market commissioner – before being drafted in as a “safe pair of hands” by commission president Jean-Claude Juncker to head the task force on Brexit.He now aspires, it is reported, to succeed Juncker as president next year. If, that is, he can get the support of France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, although the latter is no supporter of the Gaullist tradition in French politics to which Barnier belongs.He might have more chance to get a nomination as the European People’s Party candidate from party colleague Leo Varadkar.His skill in leading the Brexit process has been in marshalling the many constituencies to which he reports , some almost daily, to maintain a remarkable unanimity over his evolving mandate. That need to communicate with so many parties has facilitated a mantra of “transparency” about the talks process – with so many in the loop, they might as well engage regularly and in detail with the press. (Except, it should be noted on the Irish strand).The task force is involved in a constant detailed dialogue with Irish diplomats, and reports on an almost weekly basis to the Brexit group of member states, and it to ambassadors. He reports to the commission and meets the European Parliament’s team under his old friend Guy Verhofstadt almost as regularly. Visiting delegations find his team’s door always open.Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3478345.1525029383!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"no uk deal until ireland satisfied with border solution barnier","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMichel Barnier to increase pressure on the British government to come forward with initiatives on ensuring there is no barrier between the Republic and the North.

However, how this is achieved has yet to be worked out.Mr Barnier will use his two-day programme to visit Derry, Newry and Dungannon but he will not meet with either political leaders in the North.The focus of the visit is on meeting business stakeholders and cross-border groups to assess the impact of Brexit, Mr Barnier’s spokesman said.Speaking yesterday, Mr Coveney said the Irish Government and the EU were united on the view that significant progress must be made on the Border by June.He believed an agreement should be reached by the end of October and included in the withdrawal deal.Mr Coveney stressed the Irish Government could not allow the negotiations to be delayed because it was politically difficult or sensitive in Britain.Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3468658.1524242996!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"le big mac emmanuel macron s rise and rise","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tWinning ways: Emmanuel Macron at his victory rally in Paris after being elected president, in May 2017. Photograph: Patrick KovarikAFPGettyPresident Emmanuel Macron likes to convince people. In manner and method, he is unlike his predecessors. Nicolas Sarkozy cajoled and bullied. François Hollande just gave up. Macron fixes interlocutors with his intense blue stare and builds a Cartesian argument. If that doesn’t work, he starts over, patiently, but with determination.The past week has tested the young president’s powers of persuasion. Early in the hours of April 14th, Macron used his constitutional power as commander in chief for the first time, joining the US and Britain in launching cruise missiles against three chemical weapons installations in Syria. The goal, Macron said later, was to convince Bashar al Assad and Vladimir Putin that the international community was more than a “nice” and “weak” body they could push around.In a further exercise in persuasion, Macron volunteered for a combative, 2½ hour live television interview on Sunday night, during which he made the surprising claim that, “Ten days ago, President Trump said the US would pull out of Syria. We convinced him it was necessary to stay for the duration.”The White House later issued a statement saying Trump’s view had not changed, and the French president made an embarrassing climbdown on Monday, claiming he “never said” the US or France would remain militarily engaged in Syria for the long term.Perhaps Macron, whose nickname is “Jupiter”, is threatened by hubris, the sin of pride that afflicted Greek gods.The rest of the week was one long attempt to convince Europeans and the French of the rightness of his positions. Macron – who has become the de facto leader of Europe – received the heads of the three Baltic states who have teamed up with five other northern EU countries, including the Netherlands and Ireland, to thwart his efforts to further integrate the euro zone.Then, before a more sympathetic audience at the EU parliament in Strasbourg, Macron pleaded with proponents of liberal democracy to wake up and oppose the populist authoritarians who deny European values. Macron then travelled to Berlin in yet another effort to enlist German chancellor Angela Merkel’s support for his European reform agenda.On Monday, Macron will go to Washington for a three-day state visit, the first of Trump’s presidential term. Although the two men have clashed on climate change, the Iran nuclear accord, trade protectionism and the rise of Eurosceptical populism, Trump appears to have been charmed by the young president, who says Franco-American co-operation is crucial in the fight against terrorism.As the first anniversary of Macron’s election approaches on May 7th, and a half century after the May 1968 revolution, a different kind of spring is flowering in France. For the first time in decades, the country is reversing its post second World War decline, and the persuasive Macron is turning France into the world’s greatest soft power.There is, of course, discontent. It wouldn’t be France if there wasn’t. This week Macron also confronted striking railway workers in the Vosges, telling them to “stop taking people hostage.” The country is struggling through a rolling strike over the reform of the SNCF railway company.And despite Macron’s best efforts to reassure them, many in France suspect their young president is out to destroy the familiar but dysfunctional “French social model”. In their eyes, Macron is pushing France into the chasm of savage, race-to-the bottom capitalism.So what do they make of him in his home town? The  travelled there to find out.Macron was born in Amiens, the capital of Picardy, 40 years ago and lived here until just before his 17th birthday. From age 11 to 16, he studied at the Jesuit school La Providence.Built in the graceless concrete style of the 1950s, “La Pro” is an elementary, secondary and technical school for 2,000 pupils, spread over several acres. Aside from occasional crucifixes, calendars of Pope Francis and portraits of St Ignatius of Loyola, the religious footprint is light. The teachers are lay people. The priest visits only once a week now.Not a single plaque or photograph records that the president and first lady of France passed through these corridors. Yet this is where Macron asked to be baptised at the age of 12, and where, at 15, he fell in love with his future wife, a French and drama teacher called Brigitte Trogneux Auzière.Macron has always been drawn to older people. His maternal grandmother, Germaine “Manette” Nogues, died in his arms five years ago, at the age of 97. The Protestant humanist philosopher Paul Ricoeur was a spiritual father to him the progressive socialist millionaire Henry Hermand his political mentor. “He’s attracted by knowledge, by people who have experience,” his neurologist father, Jean-Michel (67), says over lunch in Amiens.At La Pro and subsequently at Henri IV, France’s leading lycée and prep school in Paris, Macron often stayed after class to talk to teachers.Marc Defernand (78) taught Macron history and geography here, and was principal of Macron’s section. “He was more mature than other students,” says Defernand. “He always asked a lot of questions. Sometimes he would pick up a conversation we’d started eight days earlier, exactly where we’d left off.”In the autumn of 2016, Defernand queued in a local bookshop to ask Macron to sign his autobiographical manifesto, Révolution. The retired educator is moved, recalling what happened. “He grabbed me by the hand and said, ‘Monsieur Defernand! It’s so good to see you!’” Macron inscribed the book: “To Marc, this ‘Revolution’, which owes more to him than he knows. In friendship, Emmanuel.”We visit the 700-seat theatre where Emmanuel Macron and Brigitte Trogneux Auzière adapted a play by Eduardo De Filippo together.“He was dynamite,” Defernand says. “I told him that if he continued, he would be the Gérard Philippe of the 21st century. It was difficult for others to act in the same play with him. In the same way, it’s difficult for his cabinet ministers now.”Defernand wasn’t aware of the relationship at the time, though he knew Macron went often to Auzière’s house. “I assumed there was a flirt between him and her daughter Laurence,” he says.The scandal of a married teacher with three children having an affair with a student nearly 25 years her junior has been transformed into romantic legend. Everyone would rather forget the trauma.“Jesuits never pried into people’s private lives. There was no morality investigation,” Defernand says. “There were unmarried teachers living together at the time. I was more worried about students taking drugs.”The fact that Brigitte continued to teach at La Pro for years after her lover’s departure, and then transferred to Lycée St Louis de Gonzague when they began to live together later in Paris, is further evidence of tolerance, Defernand says.A tragic love story, known to most French people, occurred a quarter-century earlier and helped pave the way for Macron and Auzière.Schoolteacher Gabrielle Russier (32) had an affair with a lycée student half her age, Christian Rossi, in Marseille. The youth’s parents filed a complaint against the teacher and had their son placed in a mental hospital. Russier was given a suspended prison sentence and took her own life. The story became the subject of books, films and songs. Asked about it at a press conference, former president Georges Pompidou famously quoted a poem by Paul Eluard that was sympathetic to women accused of having slept with German soldiers during the war.The historian Jean-François Sirinelli\u0026nbspcompares the Russier and Macron stories in his book Les Révolutions françaises, to show how much France evolved in a single generation. “Gabrielle Russier takes her own life in 1969. Emmanuel Macron and his teacher start an affair in the 1990s, and in May 2017, Brigitte Macron becomes first lady of France.”Macron’s parents learned of the affair by chance. “My wife was much more upset than I was,” Prof Macron says. “It may sound macho, but I thought he’d get over it. He didn’t . . . I thought it was a little early. It wasn’t the way I envisioned life, but it wasn’t my life. I raised my children to be free and independent.”The Macrons didn’t consider filing charges against Brigitte Auzière, but they asked to meet her. “I was requisitioned to impose authority,” Prof Macron laughs. “I told her, ‘He’s a minor. I want him to complete his studies. After that, he’s free to do what he wants.’”The president’s parents have been hurt by press reports that they sent their son to Paris to get him away from Auzière. “He was going to go to Henri IV anyway. It was planned,” Prof Macron says, nonetheless admitting that perhaps Emmanuel “went a little early”.At La Pro, I ask a class of 14-15 year-olds, Macron’s age when he met Brigitte, if they could fall in love with a teacher. The teenagers laugh and say yes. “If it happened to someone our age, it would shock me,” says a student called Grégoire. “But now that he’s an adult, it doesn’t bother me.”The students say it’s “cool” that Macron is president. “He was elected because there was Marine Le Pen,” pipes in Ayoub, of north African origin. Perhaps parroting their parents’ opinions, the youths object to rising taxes and praise the appointment of cabinet ministers who are not professional politicians. For the future, they predict flying cars and tell me France will never know full employment.On a scale of one to 10, they give the young president an approval rating of seven. “He has to prove himself,” one explains. Like France, Macron’s successors at La Pro are waiting to see.The Amienois may seem blasé about their president, but his father attributes this attitude to the “taciturn, reserved” character of Picard people. The region particularly suffered in both world wars, has a miserable climate and has been decimated by de-industralisation.His son is an atypical Picard, “an extrovert” infused with the sun of the southwest on the side of his mother, Françoise Nogues-Macron.History and bloodlines led me to Macron père, to find out more about the family’s English ancestry. In February, Macron spent an evening with the Presidential Press Association. As the representative for foreign journalists, I was part of the welcoming party. I gave him a sepia postcard of English soldiers in Amiens in 1918. \u0026nbspMacron studied the photograph closely. “You know, they found me an English great grandfather,” he said with a laugh, staring at the postcard. “He was called George Robertson.” The president scrutinised the English faces for a long moment. He was looking for a face that resembled his own.Towards the end of last year’s presidential campaign, Brigitte Macron mentioned to British journalists that her husband had a great grandfather called “Mr Robertson from Bristol”. The London Times, Mirror and Daily Mail researched the story and told the Macrons more than they had ever known about “Mr Robertson”.George William Robertson was born in Bristol in December 1887, and is believed to have fought in the Battle of the Somme. Distant relatives in England have preserved his war medals.Robertson married Macron’s great grandmother, Suzanne Leblond, in the town of Abbeville, 40km from Amiens, in 1919. They had three daughters. The middle daughter, Jacqueline, born in 1922, was Emmanuel Macron’s paternal grandmother.“He disappeared from one day to the next,” Prof Macron told me. “No one in the family ever heard from him. Suzanne raised three daughters alone. She kept a very modest grocery shop in Abbeville. My parents sent me to live with her and my aunts for two years as a child.”The failed marriage to an Englishman “was never, never talked about. The family kept no trace of him. I never saw a picture,” Prof Macron continues. George Robertson married again, settled in east London and kept a grocery shop, like his ex-wife, Suzanne. A step-daughter told the Mirror that he liked to sing Roses of Picardy, which he had learned in the trenches.Had a butcher from Bristol not fought in the Somme, married a Frenchwoman and fathered her children, Emmanuel Macron would not exist, would not be president of France today.Macron’s intellectual precociousness and his relationship with Brigitte meant he “skipped his adolescence”, his father says. In the autumn of 1993, three months short of his 17th birthday, the future president moved to a garret near the Lycée Henri IV in Paris. \u0026nbspHe continued his relationship with Brigitte. “When I went to see him in his chambre de bonne, sometimes he called through the door for me to come back later,” Prof Macron laughs. “I knew she was there with him.”Christian Monjou taught Macron American and British civilisation for three years at Henri IV. Though he did not know about the romance, Monjou noticed that Macron raced off to Amiens the moment classes ended on Saturday. “It was a case of\u0026nbsp ‘the ided self’,” Monjou says in an interview in his book-lined study.Macron obtained his baccalauréat with honours, but twice failed the entrance exam for the École Normale Supérieure, which trains French academics. It was the only failure of his life. Had it not been for the distraction of romance with Brigitte, Monjou says, Macron would have succeeded in the exam and become an academic.Against all odds, Brigitte Macron eventually orced and moved to Paris to live with Emmanuel. They married in 2007. “Without her, I would not be me,” Macron said during the campaign.Macron went on to earn a doctorate in philosophy, then reoriented his life towards politics with degrees from Sciences Po and the École Nationale d’Administration (ENA). “He used failure as a launching pad,” says Monjou. “That is typical of a leader.”“Have you brought your helmet and bulletproof vest?” the taxi driver who takes me to the Whirlpool clothes dryer factory in north Amiens asks. It’s a joke, of course, but the “Whirlpools” are notoriously hostile. A year ago, Marine Le Pen promised their factory would not close if she became president. Macron ignored advice and plunged into the crowd of angry strikers, saying, “If you listen to the security guys, you’re dead.”The factory will move to Poland at the end of May. Most of the 290 workers have been promised retraining or jobs building “intelligent” refrigerators by the factory’s new owner. But they’re still angry. On the day I visit, management proposed a clothes dryer in lieu of a severance bonus.“Macron, Macron. He’s not a god. We’re losing jobs. We don’t give a damn about Macron,” François Gorlia, the in-house union leader, tells me on the phone when he refuses to come to the gate to talk to me.“He’s a right-wing guy. Everything for the rich. Nothing for the poor,” Sibylle (39), an assembly line worker says as she arrives for the 1pm shift. She’ll benefit from Macron’s investment in training for the jobless, but she isn’t convinced. “Training is fine and dandy, but there are no jobs.”After lunch in a simple bistro, Macron’s father Jean-Michel guides me through a maze of streets under construction, to the music conservatory where his son studied piano for nine years. When he failed the conservatory exam after his first year, Macron’s mother told his biographer Anne Fulda, the boy insisted on having the same examiner the second year, an early sign of his determination to convince. He played well, Prof Macron recalls, mastering Bach’s devilishly difficult Goldberg Variations.Prof Macron gives me the address of the modest, two-storey brick bungalow where Emmanuel and his two siblings grew up, and where the neurologist still lives with his second wife. “It’s not Neuilly,” Macron père says laughing, referring to the Beverly Hills-like Paris suburb where Nicolas Sarkozy came from. Though they are both doctors, Macron’s parents earned low, public sector salaries. “They weren’t neurosurgeons with private jets,” comments a presidential adviser.The Trogneux chocolate shop, near the cathedral in central Amiens, is where Brigitte Macron’s family have made chocolates and macaroons for five generations. They also own the local Renault dealership.Black-and-white photographs of successive generations of the Trogneux chocolate dynasty hang inside the shop. There is no photograph or mention of Brigitte Trogneux Auzière Macron. Jean-Alexandre Trogneux (57), the first lady’s nephew and godson, agrees to be photographed, but refuses to talk about the presidential couple. “We’ve made it a golden rule,” he says. “We don’t talk about them and they don’t talk about us.”Fabien Dorémus (32) heads the political book section of a shop in central Amiens. Macron’s Révolution sold more than 400 copies there, an “enormous” number, Dorémus says. He had no desire to read it, and dismisses the book – and Macron – as “all slogans and clichés”. A former journalist whose local online newspaper failed for lack of funding, Dorémus is close to the far left party France Unbowed.\u0026nbspSince Macron’s election, Dorémus says, “I’m not optimistic for workers, pensioners and people who need public services. I am very optimistic for the rich.”The bookseller mentions various left-wing grievances against Macron, arising from a handful of disparaging remarks since 2014: Macron referred to slaughterhouse workers who were losing their jobs as “illiterate” Macron told a heckler wearing an anti-Macron T-shirt, “The best way to buy a suit is to get a job” Macron called protesters against his labour reforms “slackers” and accused strikers of wanting to foutre le bordel, or wreak havoc.It’s hardly “let them eat cake”. But the president has been hanged and burned in effigy by protesters. “You have to put yourself in the place of the people who get told they are slackers and freeloaders,” Dorémus says. “He’s contemptuous of the lower classes. People started hating him because they feel disrespected.”Another criticism, made by Macron’s former teachers, is that his speeches are often so long and intellectual that they can be difficult to follow.And attempts to control the president’s image can be counterproductive. The novelist Emmanuel Carrère was given exclusive access to the president and first lady. In two interviews with Macron, there was “one really strong, beautiful sentence”, Carrère wrote in the . “And this really strong, really beautiful sentence was off the record. In its place I was given permission to use a perfectly dull, perfectly formatted variant.”In the course of a day in President Macron’s home town, there is not a single photograph of him to be seen.Brigitte Fouré, the city’s mayor, tells me the poverty rate is two percentage points higher than the national average, and 80 per cent of inhabitants qualify for social housing. Amiens is ided between disadvantaged north and middle-class south. It was ruled by a communist mayor for 18 years in the 1970s and 1980s.Macron spent less than 17 years in Amiens, Fouré notes. He “went up” to Paris nearly a quarter of a century ago. “People here don’t know him. A lot of people are proud that the president is from Amiens, but that’s it. There has never been a real relationship between him and the city. There is no emotional tie.”On a beautiful spring day, the Élysée Palace feels light years away from dreary Picardy. The top-floor office of a close presidential adviser has a view over the gardens and the Eiffel Tower in the distance.Macron’s entourage is comprised mostly of fervently devoted young men with backgrounds similar to his own. No one at the Élysée, other than the president, can be quoted by name. “Our rule is that no one gets inidual credit for anything,” the adviser explains.The adviser reportedly thought up the slogan used by Macron when Trump pulled out of the Paris accord on climate change, “Make our planet great again!” But he refuses to confirm this. “We work collectively. Everything we do belongs to the president.”The adviser counts a resurgence of French pride as Macron’s greatest achievement so far. “It’s been a long time since the French have been proud to be French, in the eyes of the world,” he says. Though it contradicts my experience in Amiens, the statement rings true. Most people in the professional milieus of Paris adore Macron and are proud of his presidency.A few doors from the president’s office, the adviser lists Macron’s “important victories”: the revision of the labour code and the taxation of capital investments the overhaul of the country’s education system changes to the EU’s posted workers directive ending the giant squat at Notre-Dames-des-Landes and dismantling the nuclear reactor at Fessenheim. The last two issues had festered for decades. “They seemed impossible for any preceding majority,” the adviser says.Macron is doing as much for the disadvantaged as for the rich, the adviser insists. “We have increased basic payments to the poor, the disabled and the elderly. We’re decreasing social charges on lower salaries. The pendulum has swung much more towards the least advantaged than the most privileged.”So why isn’t that message getting through? Why do polls indicate that a majority consider Macron the “president of the rich”?For one reason, the adviser says. “He was an investment banker. What’s more, at Rothschild the most symbolic bank in the world. For many people, that proves his competence. The thing that makes him hated by some is the reason why he is respected by others.”Because Macron worked for four years as an investment banker, “everything he does that is perceived as right-wing or for the rich is blown out of proportion”, the adviser says.“And everything he does for the underprivileged, that would be seen as left-wing, is discounted. It’s a problem of perception.”Opinion polls can be read two ways. An Ifop-Fiducial poll published on April 10th gave Macron a 55 per cent approval rating, high for France, 11 months into a presidency. But a BFM poll published four days later showed that 44 per cent of voters are “disappointed”.Nine years of piano and the rigour of France’s best schools have honed Macron’s powers of concentration. On April 17th, he took questions from MEPs in Strasbourg for three hours, without notes, without so much as jotting down a question – a regular performance for Macron.“He is someone with a great capacity of attention and concentration,” says Monjou. “People who’ve met him often tell me they were struck by the intensity with which he looks at them, as if, for the time they are with him, they are all that matters.”“When you talk to him, it is as if he is downloading your brain,” says a former cabinet minister who sometimes advises Macron.Geraldine Byrne-Nason, now Ireland’s Ambassador to the United Nations, is doubtless the Irish official who knows Macron best. She became friends with the future president when both were “sherpas”, responsible for briefing and accompanying Irish and French leaders to EU summits, between 2012 until 2014. Byrne-Nason represented the taoiseach’s office, Macron the Élysée Palace.“We spent hours and hours in corridors through the night while the heads of state and government were locked in meetings,” Byrne-Nason recalls. “Emmanuel would be one of my first points of repair. If you’re going to be there for seven hours, you want someone interesting to talk to.”Byrne-Nason calls Macron “an insider-outsider” who has mastered the system but is able to regard it with detachment. “He has a healthy disrespect for bureaucracy, and Brussels is the home of process and procedure,” she says. “In that regard, we were kindred spirits. There was a slight impatience with the weight of slow-turning wheels.”Macron was particularly understanding of Irish difficulties during the bailout, Byrne-Nason says. She believes he was responsible for support offered by then president François Hollande.Byrne-Nason sent glowing reports about Macron’s potential to Dublin, long before he became a presidential candidate. Last September, she listened to what she calls his “extraordinary speech in favour of international co-operation and law” at the UN General Assembly. “It was poetic. It was powerful. It lit up the place.” Ireland could have signed off on every word, Byrne-Nason says, calling Macron “a superstar president who generates both respect and influence here amongst the 193 countries of the UN”.If Macron were Irish, he might be a hybrid of President Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar: part poetic intellectual, rooted in left-wing Christianity and fascinated by ideas part dynamic young liberal, determined to make the economy flourish.When Christian Monjou was Macron’s teacher at Henri IV, he says Macron talked a lot about the Fabians, the centre-left British intellectuals who founded the London School of Economics. The Fabians believed in “the inevitability of gradualness, the idea that everything that is gradual you won’t be able to go back on,” Monjou says. “It is totally anti-French, with our tradition of revolution, not evolution.“French political life is saturated in ideology,” Monjou continues. “With Macron, there is something you might call empirical or pragmatic. It’s familiar to an Anglo-Saxon, but it stands out in France. I suspect this slightly Anglo-Saxon approach may come from listening to me for three years.”Macron’s adviser stresses he is more than a mere pragmatist who would be content to solve one problem after another. “The two legs of Emmanuel Macron are action and reflection,” he says. “He always does both.”Macron’s en même temps mantra seeks to reconcile irreconcilabables, such as liberalism and social protection. The challenge is most obvious in his self-described “humane but realistic” immigration policy. Measures such as the Collomb circular, which authorises police to search emergency shelters for illegal migrants, have alienated some of Macron’s closest allies.In 1997, Macron’s spiritual father Paul Ricoeur delivered a lecture titled Foreigner Myself. Ricoeur cited Leviticus, about “the stranger that dwelleth with you”, and the Gospel of Matthew, which says: “I was a stranger and you took me in.” Opponents of Macron’s tough immigration policy say he has betrayed Ricoeur’s ideals. The criticism must sting, but Macron believes that unless he calms fears of unlimited migration, extreme right-wing populists will continue to gain ground, in France and across Europe.The necessity of ending the “society of status” in which family background, education and profession determine all aspects of one’s life, “gives coherence to everything we are doing”, says the presidential adviser.Philippe Aghion, who teaches economics at Harvard, the London School of Economics and the Collège de France, has greatly influenced the president’s economic thinking.Contrary to Thomas Piketty, the French author of the best-selling Capital in the 21st Century, Aghion and Macron believe that increasing social mobility, not high taxation, is the most effective way of reducing income inequality.Aghion wants to wean France off its post-second World War reliance on the Keynesian welfare state, in which government spending stimulates demand. He is inspired by John Maynard Keynes’s exact contemporary, the Austrian-born economist and Harvard professor Joseph Schumpeter, who believed that innovation and technical progress are the basis of a prosperous economy.Aghion’s theories underlie Macron’s reform of the French labour code last year, and the ongoing reform of professional training. It is, Aghion admitted in an interview, a liberal economic policy. But, he insists, it is also a social policy.Schumpeter believed in creative destruction, “which means you constantly have new jobs replacing old jobs, new firms replacing old firms”, Aghion says. It’s a hard sell to a French public that craves security and is adverse to change.Aghion advocates Danish-style “flexicurity” that combines labour market flexibility with unemployment benefits and retraining for laid-off workers. “In a nutshell: innovation, social protection and social mobility. That’s the triangle you want to achieve,” he says. Listening to him is like hearing Macron speak.Macron’s parents were left-leaning agnostics who did not baptise their children. At the age of 12, probably under the influence of his surroundings at La Pro, Macron asked to make his First Communion. A black-and-white photograph provided by one of his teachers, Gérard Banc, shows the future president making his profession of faith.Macron’s intellectual affiliation has been with the Christian left, with Ricoeur and Esprit magazine, for which he wrote a half-dozen articles, and whose board he sat on. French media interpreted gestures at Macron’s campaign rallies as signs of mysticism, for example when he asked his followers to “show benevolence”, or ended rallies Christ-like, with outstretched arms. On the night of his election, he concluded his speech in front of IM Pei’s glass pyramid at the Louvre with the words, “I will serve you with love”.During his evening with the Presidential Press Association, I asked Macron if, 28 years after his baptism, he still has faith. Personal belief is a taboo subject in secular France. Embarrassed laughter rippled across the room, but he addressed my question.“I believe in something we don’t see, yes,” Macron said. “I have faith in the generic sense of the term. If one doesn’t believe in one’s lucky star, in good fortune, in one’s country, one doesn’t do what I’m doing. I believe in a form of transcendency.”Following Macron’s April 9th speech to French bishops, leftists and Freemasons accused him of attacking la laicité, which has been France’s official policy of state-enforced secularism since 1905.“We share the confused feeling that the link between church and state has been damaged, and that it is as important to you as it is to me to repair it,” Macron said.\u0026nbsp The purpose of laicité was “certainly not to deny spirituality” he argued. \u0026nbsp“For biographical, personal and intellectual reasons, I have the highest opinion of Catholics.”There is something Jesuitical, indeed monklike, about Macron. Unlike his predecessors, he shows no need to eat, sleep or chase women. Asked what has been the “greatest trial” of being in office, the French president said he has “measured the weight and the solitude and the end of innocence” that come with power.“I do not think it is a trial,” Macron continued. “The French have authorised me to do what I committed to do. One thing is certain. There is no respite, which may explain why I sometimes look pale. I do not feel authorised to enjoy any form of leisure. I take time to reflect. I read and write. But in the times we live in, there is no room for respite. That may be the trial of power, though I don’t live it as such. There is undeniably a form of asceticism.”Macron sees his rise to power as the result of a troubled epoch. “I don’t forget where I come from and why I am here today,” he said. “I am the fruit of a form of brutality in history, of a break-in, because France was unhappy and uneasy. If I forget that for one moment, it will be the beginning of the trial.”"},{"url":null,"title":"telegraph launches next phase words chosen brand campaign","story":"The  has launched the second phase of the Words Chosen Well brand campaign which aims to showcase its award-winning quality journalism and raise brand awareness.The campaign started with a new television advert debuted during the commercial break of Channel 4’s Gogglebox on Friday 20th April. Created by adam\u0026ampeveDDB  in collaboration with The ’s in-house marketing and creative teams, it builds on the success of last year’s campaign with a bigger and bolder creative that utilises important cultural references and leans on some of the most emotive and impactful events of our times, highlighting iconic moments when words have been considered and chosen well.The ’s new campaign seeks to demonstrate the influence and importance of the spoken and written word, and the role that quality journalism plays in providing news, insight and analysis.

In practice, this means the infection is resistant to all commonly used antibiotics.The figures have emerged as Lord O\u0027Neill, the former Goldman Sachs banker who led a government-commissioned review into superbugs, accuses senior ministers of a lack of leadership on the issue. Lord O’Neill, former commercial secretary to the Treasury, said the Prime Minister, Theresa May, had allowed the issue to fade and that actions promised had not been taken.Lord O\u0026#39Neill has urged senior ministers to do more to tackle the threat of superbugs“It is disappointing to see that the UK government’s global and national efforts to fight AMR seem to have faded, he saidWriting exclusively for the  Lord O’Neill said that the UK was once seen as a leader in the field but that May had allowed the issue to slide.“The government should put this part of \u0027global Britain\u0027 back at the top of its priorities,” he writes. “There has been a lot of talk, but no action.Lord O’Neill’s review warned that if left unchecked antibiotic resistance would kill 10 million people and the world economy could lose up to $100 trillion by 2050.Antibiotic resistance | The true cost in Britain and around the worldOfficial figures suggest antimicrobial resistance claims the lives of 5,000 people a year in the UK, though experts have argued the real figure is at least double that. Getting global figures on the problem is difficult but reliable estimates suggest 700,000 are already dying each year – one person a minute.Lord O’Neill also attacked the major pharmaceutical companies for doing little to counter the problem, despite signing up to the Davos Declaration in 2015, where they pledged to combat the threat.He wrote: “Since then, no major pharmaceutical company has taken any fresh action.”Lord O’Neill said that since investigating the issue the number of reports of antibiotic resistance was rising faster and “in more places than we ever dreamt of.”.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:0}.html-embedponent .quoteponent ponent-content{margin-right:16px}.quote__source,.quote__author{white-space:normal}@media only screen and (min-width:730px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-60.83px}.html-embedponent .quoteponent .quote__content:before{margin-left:-12pxpadding-right:1px}}@media only screen and (min-width:1008px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-82.33px}}There has been a lot of talk, but no action.Lord O\u0026#x27NeillIn addition to the ‘super gonorrhoea’ case the PHE figures, obtained under a Freedom of Information request, show 29 people suffered from pan-drug-resistant-infections from Pseudomonas bacteria.Pseudomonas is a bug often found in soil or water (hospital sinks are tested for it) that usually affects people with a weaker immune system such as cancer patients, newborn babies, people with diabetes or patients with severe burns.Up to 11 per cent of Pseudomonas bacteria are now resistant to ciprofloxacin, an antibiotic commonly used in combination with others.A further six patients suffered pan-drug-resistant Klebsiella infections. New antibiotics to treat multi-drug-resistant Klebsiella infections were introduced last year in light of rising resistance, said Professor Peter Hawkey, a public health and bacteriology expert at the University of Birmingham. But they don’t work against every strain, he said.Antibiotic resistance | Global consumption fuels spread of superbugsProf Hawkey added that the cases show antimicrobial resistance is not a hypothetical or future threat but a real one currently affecting patients in British hospitals.These are organisms which are resistant to most antibiotics and then you’re in a tricky place, he said. The threat is very real. These figures are a wake up call,” he said.The pan-resistant infections recorded by PHE were from gram negative bacteria: rod-shaped bugs with thinner cell walls than their gram positive counterparts.Gram negative bacteria, some of which live in the human gut, are fast becoming resistant to antibiotics and are known as an emerging global threat. The government aims to halve the number of healthcare-associated gram-negative bloodstream infections by 2021.Prof Hawkey said pan-drug-resistant-infections are much more common in other areas of the world with lax surveillance and poor infection control, and these will spread to Britain.He said: With huge movement in populations people are coming back to the UK with these bugs in their guts. If you get it and you’re given the wrong antibiotic, you will die.Dr Susan Hopkins, deputy director for AMR and healthcare acquired infections at Public Health England, said: “While there is only a small number of bacteria identified that were resistant to a number of treatments in recent years, they serve as an example of the threat antibiotic resistance poses to public health.Madlen Davies is a reporter with the Bureau of Investigative JournalismProtect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Royal wedding guest list: Who did Meghan Markle and Prince Harry invite?TSB banking problems: what to do if you\u0026#39re affectedRead Amber Rudd\u0026#39s resignation letter and Theresa May\u0026#39s response in fullNorth Korea and Japan to discuss bilateral summit in latest round of diplomacyLocal elections 2018 polls: Latest predictions on what will happen and key seats to watchHalf of TSB online banking customers still locked out of accountsUK weather: Month\u0026#39s worth of rain set to fall in one day on \u0026#39unseasonably cold\u0026#39 start to weekTop photojournalist among dead as twin Kabul suicide blasts kill at least 21\u0026#39Iranians killed in suspected Israeli strike\u0026#39 in SyriaHow bad could the local elections be for the Conservatives in London?Mexico migrant caravan refused entry to US as border processing area ‘full’ Prince Louis Arthur Charles: Royal baby name announced by Duke and Duchess of CambridgeAmber Rudd: How the Home Secretary\u0026#39s rising star was brought back to earthPrince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s royal wedding 2018: date, details and latest newsAmber Rudd resigns as Home Secretary as she admitsSumo bows to pressure to reconsider ban on women entering ringImran Khan unveils populist plan as he launches Pakistan election campaignGiving vulnerable children a boarding school place can dramatically improve their future, Government study findsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"nature highlights national geographic travel photographer year","story":"A leaping leopard and a crowd of crocodiles are among the stunning photos released from the Nature section of the 2018 National Geographic Travel Photographer of the Year contest.

bans filipinos going work kuwait maid found","story":"Rodrigo Duterte says that a ban on Filipino workers from heading to Kuwait that\u0026#39s been in effect since February will now be permanentPhilippine President Rodrigo Duterte on Sunday said the temporary ban on Filipinos going to work in Kuwait is now permanent, intensifying a diplomatic standoff over the treatment of migrant workers in the Gulf nation.Mr Duterte in February imposed a prohibition on workers heading to Kuwait following the murder of a Filipina maid whose body was found stuffed in a freezer in the Gulf state.The crisis deepened after Kuwaiti authorities last week ordered Manila\u0027s envoy to leave the country over videos of Philippine embassy staff helping workers in Kuwait flee allegedly abusive employers.The two nations had been negotiating a labour deal that Philippine officials said could result in the lifting of the ban but the recent escalation in tensions has put an agreement in doubt.The ban stays permanently. There will be no more recruitment for especially domestic helpers. No more, Mr Duterte told reporters in the southern city of Davao.There was no immediate response from Kuwait, where around 262,000 Filipinos are employed - nearly 60 percent of them as domestic workers, according to the Philippines\u0027 foreign department.Last week the Philippines apologised over the rescue videos but Kuwaiti officials announced they were expelling Manila\u0027s ambassador and recalling their own envoy from the Southeast Asian nation.In quotes | Rodrigo Duterte, President of the PhilippinesKuwait also detained four Filipinos hired by the Philippine embassy and issued arrest warrants against three diplomatic personnel, Manila said.Mr Duterte on Sunday described the treatment of workers in Kuwait as a calamity. He said he would bring home Filipina maids who suffered abuse as he appealed to workers who wanted to stay in the oil-rich state.I would like to address to their patriotism: come home. No matter how poor we are, we will survive. The economy is doing good and we are short of our workers, he said.About 10 million Filipinos work abroad, seeking high-paying jobs they are unable to find at home, and their remittances are a major pillar of the Philippine economy.The Philippine government has for decades hailed overseas workers as modern heroes but advocacy groups have highlighted the social cost of migration, tearing families apart and making Filipinos vulnerable to abuse.Mr Duterte lashed out at Kuwait in February, alleging Arab employers routinely rape Filipina workers, force them to work 21 hours a day and feed them scraps.However after the latest row, Mr Duterte used a conciliatory tone as he addressed the diplomatic ruckus on Saturday.Apparently it seems as if they have anger against Filipinos ... I do not want to send (workers) because apparently you do not like Filipinos, he said in a speech before Filipinos in Singapore.Just do not hurt them. I plead that they\u0027d be given a treatment deserving of a human being, he said in the same event.Please review our commenting policyRoyal wedding guest list: Who did Meghan Markle and Prince Harry invite?TSB banking problems: what to do if you\u0026#39re affectedRead Amber Rudd\u0026#39s resignation letter and Theresa May\u0026#39s response in fullNorth Korea and Japan to discuss bilateral summit in latest round of diplomacyLocal elections 2018 polls: Latest predictions on what will happen and key seats to watchHalf of TSB online banking customers still locked out of accountsUK weather: Month\u0026#39s worth of rain set to fall in one day on \u0026#39unseasonably cold\u0026#39 start to weekTop photojournalist among dead as twin Kabul suicide blasts kill at least 21\u0026#39Iranians killed in suspected Israeli strike\u0026#39 in SyriaHow bad could the local elections be for the Conservatives in London?Mexico migrant caravan refused entry to US as border processing area ‘full’ Prince Louis Arthur Charles: Royal baby name announced by Duke and Duchess of CambridgeAmber Rudd: How the Home Secretary\u0026#39s rising star was brought back to earthPrince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s royal wedding 2018: date, details and latest newsAmber Rudd resigns as Home Secretary as she admitsSumo bows to pressure to reconsider ban on women entering ringImran Khan unveils populist plan as he launches Pakistan election campaignGiving vulnerable children a boarding school place can dramatically improve their future, Government study findsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"live michel barnier gives press conference ireland visit","story":"The EU\u0027s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier holds a joint news conference with Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar and the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Simon Coveney. Royal wedding guest list: Who did Meghan Markle and Prince Harry invite?TSB banking problems: what to do if you\u0026#39re affectedRead Amber Rudd\u0026#39s resignation letter and Theresa May\u0026#39s response in fullNorth Korea and Japan to discuss bilateral summit in latest round of diplomacyLocal elections 2018 polls: Latest predictions on what will happen and key seats to watchHalf of TSB online banking customers still locked out of accountsUK weather: Month\u0026#39s worth of rain set to fall in one day on \u0026#39unseasonably cold\u0026#39 start to weekTop photojournalist among dead as twin Kabul suicide blasts kill at least 21\u0026#39Iranians killed in suspected Israeli strike\u0026#39 in SyriaHow bad could the local elections be for the Conservatives in London?Mexico migrant caravan refused entry to US as border processing area ‘full’ Prince Louis Arthur Charles: Royal baby name announced by Duke and Duchess of CambridgeAmber Rudd: How the Home Secretary\u0026#39s rising star was brought back to earthPrince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s royal wedding 2018: date, details and latest newsAmber Rudd resigns as Home Secretary as she admitsSumo bows to pressure to reconsider ban on women entering ringImran Khan unveils populist plan as he launches Pakistan election campaignGiving vulnerable children a boarding school place can dramatically improve their future, Government study findsThe Woman in White, episode 2 recap: Sir Percival’s villainy goes up a gear, while Blackwater lives up to its nameRestaurant ceiling falls in on customers leaving six people injuredWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/04/30/TELEMMGLPICT000161830240_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqM37qcIWR9CtrqmiMdQVx7BLtn98wL2AYKlXhBnl-Gns.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"north korea japan discuss bilateral summit latest round diplomacy","story":"North Korean leader Kim Jong-un attends an unprecedented summit with South Korean President Moon Jae-in in PanmunjomShinzo Abe, the Japanese prime minister, and Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, are exploring a possible meeting to discuss the abduction of Japanese nationals and Pyongyang\u0027s pledge to move towards denuclearisation. Kim told Moon Jae-in, the South Korean president, at a historic summit on Friday that he was ready for dialogue with Japan at any time. The message was relayed by Mr Moon in a phone call to Mr Abe on Sunday. South Korean intelligence chief, Suh Hoon, also debriefed the Japanese leader about the inter-Korean summit, during a visit to Tokyo. Mr Abe had expressed deep interest, he later told reporters.Mr Abe is now expected to start taking steps towards arranging the suggested bilateral Tokyo-Pyongyang summit. Before leaving on a five-day Middle East tour, he thanked Mr Moon for his “sincerity” for keeping his word to raise the long-standing and sensitive issue of Japanese abductions with Kim.At least 17 Japanese citizens were abducted by North Korean agents in the 1970s and 1980s to help train their spies, an issue that Mr Abe has repeatedly pledged to tackle throughout his political career.The abductions, in addition to denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula, would dominate the agenda of any bilateral summit. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe walks with US President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump in Florida in AprilHowever, Japan has reacted cautiously to the joint North-South Korean pledge at Friday’s meeting to work towards “complete denuclearisation”, pointing to the absence of a clear roadmap for doing so.“We shouldn’t be caught up in the moment and swing too far in a reconciliatory direction,” an  anonymous senior foreign ministry official source told the Mainichi Shimbun newspaper.However, North Korea appears keen to show it is acting in good faith. On Monday, Pyongyang said that it would reset its clocks by half an hour this coming Saturday to realign with South Korea, in the latest conciliatory gesture in leader Kim’s ongoing international charm offensive. Pyongyang’s time zone has been 30 minutes behind Seoul since 2015, but Kim said it was a “painful wrench” to see clocks showing different times as he met with the South’s President Moon Jae-in for a historic, and amiable, summit on Friday. “Since it was we who changed the time standard, we will return to the original one. You can make it public,” Kim was quoted as saying by Mr Moon’s chief press secretary Yoon Young-chan. His decision was backed by North Korea’s leadership on Monday. State newswire, KCNA, reported that the Presidium of the Supreme People’s Assembly had decreed that the change would be “the first practical step for national reconciliation and unity.”The move will precede a more dramatic pledge by Kim to dismantle his country’s main nuclear testing site, Punggye-ri, at a later date in May, in full view of South Korean and US experts.Both decisions appear to be part of a determined recent effort by Kim to transform his international image from reclusive, war-mongering dictator to that of an international statesman committed to pursuing peace. “Pyongyang Time” was created in 2015 as a swipe at Japan, to cast off the legacy of “Japanese imperialists.” It was enforced on August 15, to mark the 70th anniversary of the country’s independence from Japanese rule at the end of World War II.The proposed meeting with Mr Abe is a sign of rapidly shifting diplomacy in East Asia, and one of several key meetings likely to take place over the next few months. China will also send the government’s top diplomat, Wang Yi, to visit North Korea on Wednesday and Thursday, it’s foreign ministry announced on Monday. Friday’s extraordinary meeting, heavy on the symbolism of renewed friendship but short on fresh policy decisions, prompted a mixed response from US leaders over the weekend. Former CIA chief Mike Pompeo meets Kim Jong-un in PyongyangNational Security Adviser John Bolton, a known sceptic towards North Korea, told Fox News that the Trump administration was not “starry-eyed” over Kim’s recent promises, adding that Washington was not ready to ease sanctions before Pyongyang fully committed to denuclearisation. Mr Bolton said the US had the “Libya model” in mind, referring to a 2003 agreement that resulted in the country relinquishing its nuclear weapons. The location of a future summit between Kim and US President Donald Trump was still under negotiation, he said.  “But if, in fact, Kim has made a strategic decision to give up his entire nuclear weapons programme, then I think deciding on the place and date should be fairly easy,” he added. Meanwhile newly appointed secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, who met personally with Kim over Easter while still CIA chief, told ABC news that the US had an obligation to find a peaceful diplomatic solution to North Korea’s nuclear weapons issue. He said he saw a “real opportunity” for progress since meeting with Kim, adding that they had a good conversation on the hardest issues that face our two countries.The North Korean leader was prepared to lay out a map that would help us achieve that objective, he said, referring to complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearisation.Royal wedding guest list: Who did Meghan Markle and Prince Harry invite?TSB banking problems: what to do if you\u0026#39re affectedRead Amber Rudd\u0026#39s resignation letter and

measures and the progress of Argos.The supermarket is tipped to report a 6.2 per cent dip in full year pre-tax profits to £472m, according to analysts at UBS.On an underlying basis, consensus estimates point to a 1.5 per cent fall in profits to £572m, which would be the fourth consecutive year the metric has fallen.The investment bank believes that Argos sales were dragged down in the fourth quarter as it came under pressure from stock clearances at collapsed rivals Maplin and Toys R Us.“There have been some high profile general merchandise capacity exits through the first quarter of this year, such as Toys R Us and Maplin Electrics, which we expect to have had some impact on Argos sales as stock is liquidated, although this plays to Argos ultimately benefiting as an industry consolidator,” UBS said in a research note.Sainsbury\u0027s recalls beetroot that may contain shards of glassSainsbury\u0027s announces thousands of jobs at risk in management shake-upBrexit hands

We can expect an update on cost saving measures and the expansion of Argos into its stores.“The crowded marketplace with the rise of Lidl and Aldi makes for a very difficult environment for the group, which has been reflected in the share price performance for many years.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Possibly complicating matters was the fact that Denzel Washington was sitting next to him at the table.“When someone says you’re like your idol,” Jordan said, “It’s like: ‘Really? You see that in me?’ I’d only done that one movie. But then I started using it as motivation,” he said. “I wanted to pop up on Denzel’s radar. He’s the OG. If I could get recognition from him, I know I’m going down the right path, you know?”Denzel: We’re only getting further apart in this technological ageFinally, Washington broke in with a booming laugh: “And here we are, Mike! Looks like it’s working out already,” he said.In truth, it would be hard for an actor to choose a better role model than Washington. In a career ning more than 40 years and 50 films – and kicked off by the hit TV drama St Elsewhere – Washington, 63, has been nominated for nine Academy Awards. He won twice: for best actor as a terrifying rogue cop in Training Day and for best supporting actor as a Union soldier in an African-American army unit in Glory. And he was nominated for best actor Oscars in both of the past two years.Jordan (left, with Kevin Durand) in the 2013’s ‘Fruitvale Station’ (Weinstein Company)In the past decade, Washington has ruled the stage, too. He won a Tony Award for best actor in the revival of August Wilson’s Fences in 2010, later directing and starring in an Oscar-nominated film version. He led the acclaimed revival of A Raisin in the Sun in 2014. And today (26 April), he will open again on Broadway in a revival of Eugene O’Neill’s play The Iceman Cometh, a searing and (at four hours long) monumental drama about the lies we tell ourselves to get through life.Like Washington, Jordan, 31, got his big break on television: on HBO’s The Wire, when he was just 15. After his heartbreaking performance in Fruitvale Station, about the last day in the life of a transit-police shooting victim, he starred in the popular Rocky reboot Creed. And this year, he played the villain, Erik Killmonger, in the Marvel juggernaut Black Panther, winning perhaps the best reviews of anyone in the extremely well-reviewed cast.Next month, he stars in Fahrenheit 451 on HBO, a dystopian film based on the novel by Ray Bradbury. Jordan plays a “fireman,” part of a state-sanctioned brigade that hunts down readers and burns books. His company, Outlier Society Productions, is one of the film’s producers and also among the first to adopt inclusion riders, requiring ersity among cast and crew, as called for by Frances McDormand from the stage of this year’s Academy Awards.Over a cocktail hour at the Lambs Club in Manhattan (a Diet Coke for Washington, a sauvignon blanc for Jordan), the actors traded notes about creating characters and the socially minded work that really matters to them. These are excerpts from the conversation.Galanes: If Mike reminds people of a young Denzel, who did young Denzel remind people of?Washington: I never saw it that way. I never even thought about movie stars. My goal was to be on Broadway, to earn $650 a week. My hero was James Earl Jones. And I came to acting green. I was taking pre-law courses, then journalism courses. Then I took an acting class and got bit by the bug. So I came down to Lincoln Centre and saw plays and stage actors.Galanes: But all those things you did – law, journalism, acting – they’re all about getting to the bottom of a story, right?Washington: I like that part: building a character. You start with the material that gives you clues. If you’re playing a boxer, you want to throw out punches. If you’re playing a conductor, you want to get on a train.Galanes: And the script?Washington: Sure, but you don’t know who the character is just by reading the script. I don’t read a script and go, “Now, I get it!” That’s just the beginning. The first thread you pull.Jordan: The script tells you what’s going up on screen. But the biggest part, the fun part, is figuring out what happened to that character before page one of the script. What kind of food does he like? Did he get into fights going to school? That back story determines the choices you make within the confines of the script. And going through that process with the director is a big part of the collaboration. Now I’ve got notebooks and notebooks of back stories. Some directors may want you to add something or change your version. That’s when you try to find common ground.Washington won an Oscar for his role as rogue cop Alonzo in 2001’s ‘Training Day’ (Warner Bros)Galanes: Is that why you’ve both worked with directors repeatedly? Mike with Ryan Coogler Denzel with Spike Lee and Antoine Fuqua. Your common ground?Washington (laughing): Maybe they’re the ones who called. What you’re saying is part of it, but I don’t think it’s just one way.Jordan: Those are the roles I was lucky enough to get. Ryan and I have worked together three times, and I have a really close relationship with him. But I said no to lots of other things with other people in between. They weren’t right. Personally, I think you’re defined by what you say no to.Washington: I say yes to everything!Galanes: Why do I doubt that? Managing a career as big as yours must take a lot of work.Washington: Not now. Maybe early on. Now, I just do what I want to do. And you don’t want to walk down the same road twice. I’m sure after doing Iceman Cometh, I won’t be looking to do another play.Washington: Yeah, not for a while.Galanes: You’re too young to remember this, Mike. But early in his career, Denzel was so beloved for playing good guys – in Glory and Cry Freedom – that we all freaked out when he started playing villains: in Training Day, American Gangster. And he was even better at bad guys! Was that about walking down different roads?Playing Killmonger (right) in ‘Black Panther’ brought rave reviews for Jordan (MarvelDisney)Jordan: So much trickles down from the director. That’s why I try to choose the ones who make the best environments to work in, so we can maybe make something as good as Training Day. You don’t want to go into a project with somebody who won’t be helpful to your process – or vice versa.Galanes: I read this funny thing about you, Mike: you started choosing projects where you wouldn’t die in the end?Jordan: It started with my mom, who’s super emotional. When I shot my death scene in The Wire, she was on set. And the PAs kept coming to me and saying: ‘You may want to check on your mom.’ I go see her, and she’s sitting there bawling. I’m just a kid. I’m going, ‘Come on, Ma. You’re embarrassing me.’ And after Fruitvale Station, I was like, ‘Man, this is really affecting her.’ But there was another thing, too. Look at Denzel’s career. I want people to see me win. I want audiences to see me ending up on top – not dying. I want to be the leading man.Washington: Man, I got underwear older than that.Jordan: That was the real thought process: How do I become a leading man? I know phenomenal actors who can’t open movies overseas. How do you become the guy who can carry a film?Washington: So, you study the game?Galanes Is that why you went down the superhero route?Galanes You probably made up for it with Black Panther. Why no superheroes for you, Denzel?Galanes: Superheroes have changed. When Denzel might have played one, they were dull. The villains were interesting: Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger. Like you in Black Panther, Mike.Washington: When I was a teenager, Shaft and Super Fly, those were our superheroes. I remember watching Super Fly with my boy Carl, and when we got back to the projects, he carved the character’s name – Priest – on the elevator door. And Richard Roundtree in those long leather coats in Shaft.Galanes: Both of your new projects are dark. Iceman Cometh is brutal. And in Fahrenheit 451, competing ideas are so scary that people decide to burn all the books and kill the readers. Why choose them now?27 films to look out for in the first half of 2018 27 films to look out for in the first half of 2018 Galanes: It’s powerful to watch a black man in your role.Jordan: But it wasn’t all there on the page. I needed to make sure that he was willing to collaborate, to change some things to help me, as a black man, feel more comfortable in that role. And my company’s co-producing it alongside HBO was important to me too. This is my first time working with the director and the network, giving my opinion and hoping that it’s taken seriously.Washington (laughing): Getting your big boy voice.Galanes Like coming back to the stage, Denzel?Washington: Yeah. Then we boiled it down to Iceman and King Lear. And he said: ‘Let’s do Lear five years from now.’ I said: “OK, we’ll do that next – God willing.”Washington: Eugene O’Neill. That simple. The chance to interpret his brilliant material. You know, my first role on stage, when I was a student at Fordham, was in The Emperor Jones. I’ve always loved O’Neill. And here I am, 40 years later, coming back to him in Iceman.Galanes: Your character, Hickey, seems like the life of the party at first, but what a tortured soul he turns out to be. What drew you to him?Washington: His desire to see people happy. Even when he knows he can’t make that happen, that desire is still there in him.Galanes: It’s a mountain of a play – four hours long. Is it hard to maintain that intensity every night?‘Fahrenheit 451’ sees Jordan plays a ‘fireman’, part of a state-sanctioned brigade that hunts down readers and burns books (HBO)Washington: Listen, this is what I love: acting on stage. And I don’t have to do anything else. Just be in this play. So, don’t feel sorry for me compared to most workers in America.Galanes: Is theatre on your radar, Mike?Jordan: Down the line. But right now, I want to take care of my family financially and grow my production company. That’s the big thing I want to do: set my family up.Jordan: As a kid, you don’t see your circumstances. I didn’t. It’s not until you look back and think, ‘Man, we were poor!’ My parents really hid that from me. They kept me safe.Washington: It wasn’t that tough. I was having a good time. A lot of my boys went to prison.Jordan: That’s why I want to take care of my family now. Then let me go and work on my craft, do something to fulfil me on the inside. That’s what I think theatre is going to be for me – when I’m older. What do you love about it, Denzel?Washington: The energy from the audience is immediate. And you get to develop a full life. See, in film, you might shoot the end first, then the middle. But on stage, it’s the full score of the character’s life. And you always get another night.Washington: In film, you don’t get another night to shoot a scene. You can try to fix it in other scenes. But film is a director’s medium. Theatre is for actors. We’re directed, but once the curtain goes up, it belongs to us. And every night’s as different as the audience. Some nights, they cheer the whole way through others, they don’t cheer at all.Galanes: Let me shift gears. We’re living through a time right now where men in power who’ve done ugly things –Washington: No. We’re not ‘living through a time right now’. It’s always been this way, from the beginning of time. Pick one: from Caesar to Caligula. Now, it’s just on the news cycle every 15 seconds.Jordan: And opinion is now fact – because anyone with a Twitter handle can say it.Washington: It doesn’t even have to be true it just has to be first.Galanes: Hang on, I’m asking something different: Based on your years as a powerful figure, why do you think some guys turn to ugly behaviour, and others don’t?Washington: Nobody’s perfect, man. Don’t put me on a pedestal, if that’s what you’re trying to do. I’m just a human being. I made mistakes I’ll make some more. Hopefully, you learn from them. My mother always said, ‘Keep it simple.’ The older I get, the more I understand her: cut away the fat. When you’re younger, you want to see, taste, touch.Washington (laughing): There you have it. But when you get to be my age, you learn you don’t have to. I have a beautiful wife, beautiful children, a great job. What more do I need?Jordan: And people like us, actors of colour, we don’t get a lot of second chances. It’s a different type of scrutiny. Knowing it’s not all fair and equal, you’ve got to make smart decisions in the moment.Washington: I remember going home one time and saying to my mother, ‘Hey, Ma, did you ever think that I...’ And she said: ‘Stop right there! Do you know all the people who’ve been praying for your raggedy butt?’ You don’t get there by yourself.Jordan: That’s crazy! I was just thinking: I’m going to church in the morning – because I know the people there have always prayed for me. Their blessings have protected me from terrible situations. That’s how I think about keeping it simple: remembering where it started – that village, that tribe that kept you safe.Galanes: And it was 38 years between Sidney Poitier’s Oscar for best actor and yours.Galanes: How about opportunities for people of colour?Washington: That’s why I’m here! That’s why I’m still in the race. And I’m passing the baton. What a lot of people don’t know is: when you pass the baton, you keep running behind the other runner, you don’t just stop. I’m like, ‘Make the turn, bring it home!’ I like helping people. I want to see them do well.Black Panther star reveals Denzel Washington paid for his acting classDenzel schools journalist with response to \u0027fake news\u0027 questionHow to stop Denzel Washington stealing your sceneJordan: That’s why I want to produce so much. I like creating opportunities for people.Galanes: You were right out of the gate on inclusion riders, Mike. The first to say, ‘My company guarantees that casts and crews will be erse.’Jordan: That’s super important to me. No matter what community we’re talking about. Everybody should be in a position where they can win.Washington: I’m just wired that way.Jordan: My path is my path. I can’t take nothing away from nobody, and nobody can take nothing away from me. I’m running my race. But we can still encourage each other.Washington: What’s the harm in that? You’ll never see a U-Haul behind a hearse.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The UK is also a top destination for wealthy Russians to spend their money on art collections, expensive cars and private schools for their children. In return, the UK often grants them visas and, in some cases, citizenship“We are going after the money,” Boris Johnson promised after being questioned on the absence of specific measures to impose sanctions and financial penalties on the UK assets of Russian oligarchs closely aligned to President Putin. But when pressed by MPs on why decisive action was not being taken, the foreign secretary replied: “This is not a country where we in the government can say ‘Oi! We think this so-and-so deserves to have his or her collar felt’. This is not how it works.” While Theresa May may yet impose sanctions against Putin-supporting billionaires in response to the attempted murder of the Russian spy Sergei Skripal, her government’s track record has been marred by procrastination and prevarication.   Privately, the prime minister regards the exploitation of London as a haven for dirty Russian money as a serious problem. She once listened in stunned silence as a senior MI6 officer briefed her on the activities of Russian organised crime and certain oligarchs in the UK. And in 2016 she authorised the National Security Council to review why and how wealthy Russians buy property in London. But she has been nervous about taking action. For the past three years she has dithered on implementing a legally-enforceable register that will force all foreign companies that own UK property to disclose the identity of their owners.Russia claims Skripals poisoned using toxin possessed by UK and USRussia has been spying on the Skripals for at least five years- UKRussia stock market crashes after US imposes sanctions on oligarchsFreezing property assets is the key to inflicting pain on the Russian state and its compliant plutocrats. Since 2004, £190m of UK property has been subject to criminal investigation as suspected proceeds of corruption. The London property market has been skewed by laundered money, as The Independent revealed exclusively in 2014. Prices are being artificially driven up by wealthy, influential, foreign men who want to hide their assets in the UK.Multi-million pound payments are accepted without their origin being questioned. Oligarchs hide ownership behind anonymous shell companies registered in secretive jurisdictions while a London address offers a veneer of legitimacy and prestige that helps launder reputations as well as cash. Transparency International estimates that Russians account for £729m of the £4.4bn acquired in UK property via what it regards as “suspicious wealth”.There is no suggestion that all London property bought by Russian oligarchs is derived from illegal or criminal sources. For some Russian plutocrats buying luxury property in London is a symbol that they have been accepted by the British establishment. This is illustrated by the eleven bedroom Regency house on Belgrave Square that Oleg Deripaska, regarded as one of Putin’s favourite oligarchs, snapped up for £17m through an offshore company registered in the British Virgin Islands in 2003 and now worth £45m.Oleg Deripaska’s 11-bedroom Regency house on Belgrave Square is seen as a symbol of acceptance by the British establishment (Alamy)Built in the 1820s, it was formerly the home of Sir Henry “Chips” Channon, society host, Conservative MP and notoriously indiscreet diarist. It was designed for entertaining royalty and diplomats with its grand staircase, Madame Récamier sofas and flamboyant decor. When Harold Nicolson arrived at the house for dinner, he exclaimed: “Oh my God, how rich and powerful Lord Channon has become.” The equally grand and historic mansion Beechwood House, set in 11 acres of land in Highgate, north London, was bought by the powerful oligarch Alisher Usmanov in 2008 for £48m from the Emir of Qatar. Usmanov is a major shareholder in Arsenal football club and has amassed a £14bn fortune from metals and commodities and has long been regarded as a pro-Putin figure. And his fellow football-loving oligarch Roman Abramovich owns houses on Kensington Palace Gardens and Chester Square, Belgravia, and apartments on Eaton Square and Manresa Road, Chelsea.  One Hyde Park, one of the wealthiest residencies in the world, was famously bought up by Russian oligarchs (Alamy)It is not just prestigious houses that attract Russian billionaires. The UK is also a top destination for wealthy Russians to spend their money on art collections, expensive cars and private schools for their children. In return for their cash, the UK often grants them visas and, in some cases, citizenship.  Since 2008 iniduals have been able to obtain “golden visas” if they invest as little as £2m in a UK business. And for £5m, they gain the right to become a UK resident on a temporary basis and then, after five years, a British citizen. By 2014, almost 700 rich Russians had paid for entry using this method, with Roman Rotenberg, son of Putin’s former judo partner Boris Rotenberg, being the most prominent example. He owns a mews house on Cadogan Lane in Belgravia.The government is taking some action to stop London becoming what David Cameron described as a haven to hide “dodgy foreign cash”. The National Crime Agency (NCA) is investigating a list of wealthy iniduals, not just oligarchs, to assess if they have used the UK to launder their fortunes.An estimated 149 iniduals are restricted on their travel and ability to conduct business in the UK. And the Unexplained Wealth Orders is now law, whereby the NCA can demand that the oligarch explain the origin of his wealth. But the problem with this order, according to a Russian businessman, is that the inidual in question could too easily lie about his source of wealth and instead produce a document that shows his fortune was based on, for example, share idends. Roman Rotenberg gained entry to the UK using the ‘golden visas’ method (Getty)Boris Johnson protests that the government cannot act directly against the pro-Putin brigade because it cannot interfere in criminal investigations. But it could make specific changes to the law, notably an amendment to the Sanctions and Money Laundering Bill, which would give Magnitsky-type powers to freeze the UK assets of relevant iniduals, including intelligence agents or other officials who have abused human rights.  The government could also implement the register of inidual owners of foreign and offshore companies that own UK property. But that bill has been delayed until 2021 and campaigners smell a cover-up after the government announced that one reason for the delay is that the Business Department has commissioned research on the impact of the register on investment decisions. “This is a crucial moment for the UK’s future trading relationship with the rest of the world, and we must proceed with as good an understanding as possible of the potential impacts on legitimate inward investment,” said foreign office minister Lord Ahmad. Skripal attack aftermath – in picturesSkripal attack aftermath – in picturesInvestigators in protective clothing remove a van from an address in Winterslow near Salisbury in Wiltshire, as police and members of the armed forces continue to investigate the suspected nerve agent attack on Russian double agent Sergei SkripaA police officer on duty near the protective tent which covers the bench where a man and woman were apparently poisoned with what was later identified as a nerve agent, in SalisburyMilitary in protective clothing prior to removing vehicles from a car park in SalisburyPersonnel in protective coveralls and breathing equipment cover an ambulance with a tarpaulin at the Salisbury District HospitalHome Secretary Amber Rudd visits the scene of the nerve agent attack in SalibsuryMembers of the emergency services in hazard suits fix the tent over the bench where Sergei and Yulia Skripal were foundOfficials in protective suits check their equipment before repositioning a forensics tent A poice officer stands guard outside a branch of the Italian chain restaurant ZizziDetective Sergeant Nick Bailey, who assisted the Russian ex-spy targeted with a nerve agent, was also hospitalisedSergei Skripal days before he was exposed to a mystery substance that has left him fighting for lifeSergei Skripal speaks to his lawyer from behind bars seen on a screen of a monitor outside a courtroom in Moscow.Yulia Skripal, who is thought to have been poisoned along with her father, Sergei SkripalProgress to legislation has thus been painfully slow. An insight into why political rhetoric has not resulted in legislative action can be gleaned by the recent flotation on the London stock exchange of the Russian energy company En+, then owned by Deripaska and chaired by former Conservative energy minister Lord Barker. For it revealed a fundamental dispute between MI6 and the financial regulators on how to make oligarchs who park their assets in London more accountable and transparent.MI6 and the prime minister’s national security advisor, Sir Mark Sedwill, were furious with the Stock Exchange and Financial Conduct Authority for failing to consult them and conduct the required due diligence of En+. Their main concern was about whether Rusal, a subsidiary of En+, had been manufacturing aluminium powder used by Russian arms firms for military purposes. Rusal adamantly denied it – yet its own website previously indicated that the defence industry was among the users of the type of aluminium powder it manufactured.Sir Mark Sedwill was furious when the required due diligence of En+ was not carried out ahead of its flotation on the London stock exchange (Getty)The En+ group could be a candidate for new sanctions as the Russian state-owned VTB Bank is a major shareholder with a 4.35 per cent holding, while Deripaska is known for being close to the Russian President. Leaked US diplomatic cables described Deripaska as “among the two to three oligarchs Putin turns to on a regular basis” and is “a more-or-less permanent fixture on Putin’s trips abroad”.Indeed, when the US imposed sanctions on seven oligarchs and the 12 companies they own or control last week, shares tumbled. Deripaska was among those affected, as was Rotenberg.  Still, Britiain cannot follow suit. And the anger of National Security officials and MI6 En+\u0027s flotation last year stemmed precisely from their belief that it typified the complacent approach to Russian money in London, which the infamous oligarch Boris Berezovsky once told me was “70 per cent dirty”. The inability to impose sanctions is similarly emblematic.The London Stock Exchange has long been a vehicle for Russian companies and oligarchs to raise money in shares and bonds – an estimated $200bn (£140bn) since 2004. Last summer, Russia’s largest gold producer Polyus, controlled by Suleyman Kerimov, a Russian senator awarded the Order of Merit by Putin, raised $879m. There are now 57 predominantly-Russian companies listed on the London Stock Exchange, more than anywhere else outside Moscow.   The wealthiest Russian oligarchs who call London homeA little-noticed loophole to avoid sanctions is that Russian sovereign debt is permitted to be sold in London. “We are allowing Russian sovereign debt to be sold in the UK and that debt is being used to reimburse Russians to bring back their money onshore in Moscow terms,” said the Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee. “As that gold is moving towards Moscow, we are quite extraordinarily enabling those bond and debt auctions...This is one of those areas where sanctions on businesses are being compensated by the Russian state.”Just hours after Theresa May’s retaliation against the poisoning of Sergei Skripal, Gazprom issued a $750m eurobond in London and the following day the Russian government joined in by issuing a $4bn bond in the capital. Within hours, the Russian Embassy issued a revealing tweet: “Business as usual?”Could the nerve-agent attack in Salisbury be the unwitting catalyst for finally cleaning up dirty Russian money in London? (Getty)But the irony is that it is the attempted assassination of a Russian spy and double agent living in Salisbury and the murder of Russian businessman Nikolai Glushkov in Surrey that could be the unwitting catalysts for finally cleaning up dirty Russian money in London.Mark Hollingsworth is the author of “Londongrad – From Russia with Cash’’ or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Ben Widdicombe visited the Marvel Comics creator at his home and heard him declare: ‘Nobody has more freedom’Stan Lee, the Marvel Comics maestro and co-creator of Spider-Man, X-Men and Black Panther, lives in a world of heroes and villains. But these days, it can be hard to tell which is which.Few creators have left as profound a mark on popular culture. According to The-Numbers, a box office data site, films featuring Lee’s superheroes have grossed more than $24bn (£17.2bn) worldwide. He has a huge Twitter following, and admirers have included Federico Fellini, Ronald Reagan and George RR Martin, the author of Game of Thrones.“Stan is right up there with Walt Disney as one of the great creators of not just one character, but a whole galaxy of characters that have become part of our lives,” Martin said. “Right now, I think he’s probably bigger than Disney.”Stan Lee\u0027s Avengers: Infinity War cameo might be his funniest yetYet at the summit of Lee’s career, storm clouds have gathered.The last year has brought an unsettling mix of tragedy and scandal, including the death in July of Joan Lee, his wife of almost 70 years suspicions that millions of dollars have been siphoned from his accounts even gossip reports that a former business associate stole his blood to sell to fans.Lee with his late wife Joan in 2011. Since she died last year the household has been thrown into disarray (Getty)Earlier this month, The Hollywood Reporter published an investigation that said Lee, 95, is the victim of “elder abuse”, partly at the hands of his 67-year-old daughter, Joan Celia Lee. The Daily Beast reported in March that Lee, who is said to be worth around $50m, was “surrounded by a panoply of Hollywood charlatans and mountebanks” and being “picked apart by vultures”.A radio talk show in Orlando, Florida, even aired a rumour that he is being “held captive” by handlers who “have him basically locked up in the house”.But on a recent visit to Lee’s home in the Bird Streets, a celebrity enclave high in the hills of West Hollywood, California, the man himself said otherwise.True, a 6ft 4in security guard, with a pistol on his hip, opened the front gate. And Lee hasn’t been getting out as much since a bout of pneumonia left him short of breath and looking frail. He also can no longer read because of macular degeneration.Lee pictured in New York in 1978: ‘Lately, I have found out that a lot of the money we made is no longer available for me’ (Getty)Despite all that, Lee seemed relaxed and enthusiastic. Wearing a yellow shirt and beige polyester slacks in his poolside sitting room, its Sherwood-green carpet bleached by 40 years of California sunshine, he welcomed a reporter into his home.So, is he a prisoner in his own house, surrounded by real-life supervillains?“I’m the luckiest guy in the world,” Lee said, chuckling and sounding like a 95-year-old teenager. “Nobody has more freedom.”He also defended his daughter, known as JC, against claims that she has been physically abusive and a financial drain. “My daughter has been a great help to me,” he said. “Life is pretty good.”A house in disarrayFor four decades, Lee has lived in a relatively modest two-storey house in the middle of what has become some of Los Angeles’ most valuable real estate. DrDre is a neighbour, and Leonardo DiCaprio lives down the block, on a street where houses can list for north of $30m.Inside the suburban-style home, a nurse and a maid bustled in the kitchen. Although Lee seemed at ease, the armed guard lent an air of surveillance that made it difficult to entirely relax.The house is a time capsule of late 1970s Hollywood. Decorated by his late wife, it is dotted with ceramic animals, carved figures in African and Asian styles, and large gilt-framed mirrors hung on mirrored walls. Empty hooks surrounded by dusty outlines sit amid prints and original works by noted artists – Joan Miro, Pablo Picasso, Alexander Calder, Salvador Dali and Roy Lichtenstein – suggesting a home being slowly eroded.“My wife, she’s the only person in the world that I would know of who would put a big mirror on top of a big mirror,” Lee said. “And when she was here, she had so many paintings, all over. Most of them have left now. My daughter took a lot of them, and a lot of them have gone elsewhere.”It’s the vagueness about what has “gone elsewhere” that has some of Lee’s friends so worried.Since Lee’s wife died last year, his household has been thrown into disarray, with three factions of once-trusted aides vying for control. Lee’s current gatekeeper is Keya Morgan, who has ousted former staff.Producer Keya Morgan and Joan C Lee – are they real-life supervillains holding Lee hostage? (Getty)A former memorabilia dealer from New York, Morgan moved to Los Angeles as the executive producer of the mobster biopic Gotti and now describes himself as a “producing partner of John Travolta”. Sitting at Lee’s side, he was dressed in a black suit and tie, black bowler hat and dark sunglasses, which he lowered on his nose to see indoors.In February, Morgan called police to the house to physically remove Lee’s longtime road manager, Mac Anderson, known as Max. Anderson was accused of, among other things, attempting to bribe a nurse to make statements that Lee was being held hostage. “He got into a big fight with Stan and Stan’s daughter” and was fired soon afterward, Morgan said.Reached by phone, Anderson declined to comment.Also out was Jerry Olivarez, a Hollywood publicist who briefly obtained power of attorney over Lee’s affairs last year, during which time more than $1m left the Marvel creator’s accounts. That included a $300,000 cheque made out to Hands of Respect, a novelty company owned by Olivarez and Lee that makes a $10 lapel pin advocating racial harmony.In unrelated matters, $1.4m may have vanished in a series of wire transfers, and a Chanel handbag full of cash may be missing from the house, according to Morgan. Also, a trove of Marvel memorabilia, including character sketches and figurines, is the subject of disputed ownership between Anderson and Lee, as reported by The Hollywood Reporter.Lee may be a creative genius, but he isn’t a financial one. “I’ve been very careless with money,” he said.“I had a partner or two who – since I’m not a money counter – I let them take care of keeping track of the money we made,” Lee said, as he sipped a bottle of mineral water to soothe his raspy voice. “Lately, I have found out that a lot of the money we made is no longer available for me. I don’t know where it is, but a guy, and maybe one or two others, have found a way to take it.“So, I feel bad about it, and of course we have a lawyer trying to get it back again,” he said. “But money isn’t worth losing your cool about, you know.”The child of Romanian Jewish immigrants, Stanley Lieber was born in New York City in 1922. He was hired in 1939 as an assistant at Timely Comics, the not-especially-promising ision of a pulp magazine publisher that would eventually be renamed Marvel.Following a staff exodus the next year, the newly rechristened Lee (an alias he adopted to save his real name for the great novels he aspired to write) was appointed its editor. The two great motifs of his life were established: a nagging feeling that his work in comics was cultural schlock and the fact that he would be a lifelong corporate employee, never owning the rights to his creations.His greatest streak of inspiration began in 1961, when Lee was almost 40 and thoroughly disenchanted with his career. With artist Jack Kirby, he created the Fantastic Four, a hit he bested the next year by inventing Spider-Man with artist Steve Ditko.Among the enduring characters he created over the next decade with those artists, and others, are the X-Men, Iron Man, the Hulk, Thor, Doctor Strange and, in 1966, Black Panther: an African warrior-king whose recent film adventure has grossed more than $1.3bn.“I’m sorry I didn’t introduce black characters a little sooner,” Lee said. “I tried to create an Asian superhero, I tried to create a South American superhero. And at that point I also was thinking it’s ridiculous that we don’t have a black superhero.”Asked if contemporary comics and films could be doing a better job of representing women and superheroes of colour, he replied, “yes”, but expanded: “You can’t force anything on the public. But if you do a black hero or heroine and you see that it’s well-received at the newsstand, then you’d be an idiot not to come up with more stories like that. Everything depends on the marketplace.”Evolution of Spider-Man: from the comics to Captain America: Civil WarEvolution of Spider-Man: from the comics to Captain America: Civil WarFirst introduction, art by Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko.First solo series, art by Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko.

Directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, played by Tom Holland. Yet Lee may have underestimated his own value in the marketplace. While he has made exponentially more money than any of his Marvel co-creators, he only ever collected a salary, and does not receive any continuing royalties from the films based on his characters.In 2005, he received a one-time payment of $10m from Marvel, to settle a provision in his contract that had entitled him to 10 per cent of the profits from television and film adaptations. Four years later, Disney bought Marvel for $4bn it is unclear whether Lee was able to reap any benefit. (As Marvel’s chairman emeritus, he still receives a salary, reported to be $1m.)And while his personal appearances (including charging fans $120 for an autograph) are a lucrative source of income, later-life attempts to create wholly owned superhero properties have foundered.Stan Lee Media, a digital content startup, crashed in 2000 and landed his business partner, Peter F Paul, in prison for securities fraud. And Lee is embroiled in disputes with POW! Entertainment, the company he started in 2001 to create new shows, including Stripperella, a cartoon animation starring Pamela Anderson.POW! was sold last year to Camsing International, a Hong Kong-based company seeking to clone Marvel for the Asian market. Lee says he has not been paid, which the company denies. “Mr Lee has been paid and continues to be paid by the company,” said Shane Duffy, the chief executive of POW! “Statements like this only heighten our concern for Stan’s wellbeing.”Lee and actor Chadwick Boseman at the LA world premiere of ‘Black Panther’ in January (Getty)As part of the escalating fight, Morgan and Lee’s daughter entered the POW! offices on Santa Monica Boulevard on the night of 14 March and removed items they say belong to Lee. They triggered a silent alarm, prompting POW! to file a police report.The Beverly Hills police subsequently dropped the burglary investigation, but the fighting continues. “They’re acting as if they bought the company and everything on the four walls belong to them,” said Lee, sounding downcast. “So, another lawsuit.”An Oscar for Stan Lee?Outside the bubble of legal drama and personal strife, however, Lee’s creative influence remains at an all-time high.“There’s no doubt that Stan, in terms of American popular culture, he’s one of the giants of the 20th century,” Martin said. “Spider-Man and Iron Man the X-Men – they’re still as viable as ever.”From the floral sofa in his sitting room, Lee is a font of highly entertaining stories from the glory days, even if some of them sound taller than his 1962 creation Giant-Man.Like the time Picasso was so taken by Joan Lee’s beauty that he approached the couple in a New York restaurant and sketched her on their tablecloth. “We ran home to tell my father about what happened,” Lee said. But, “in our excitement, we had left the drawing in the restaurant. We never found it!”Stan Lee turns 94: His 25 best cameos in Marvel filmsStan Lee has already filmed cameos for four more Marvel moviesStan Lee has only good things to say about Tom Holland\u0027s Spider-ManOr the time when DiCaprio told Lee that he had written to the president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, lobbying for Lee to receive an honorary Oscar for his numerous cameos over the years. (Lee appears in nearly every Marvel movie, including Black Panther, in which he plays a gambler in a South Korean casino.)DiCaprio also wants to portray Lee in a film about the Marvel creator, according to Morgan, who accompanied Lee on a recent visit to DiCaprio’s house. (A spokesman for DiCaprio would not confirm this account of their conversation.)The thought of a biopic starring DiCaprio gave Lee pause. He looked out over the pool, to the canyon beyond, and pondered being portrayed by an Oscar-winning actor.“I don’t know if he could capture the essence of me,” he said, after a moment. “We have to talk about that.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Others were able to log in but, when they did, some or all of their account details had disappeared.Customers have also reported that they could access other people’s accounts, including account numbers, sort codes and transaction histories.TSB apology after customers complain of online banking ‘data breach’​TSB could not say how many people were still locked out of the service or when the problems would be fully resolved.The ongoing IT disaster began with botched upgrade work on Friday, but has developed into one of the worst technology failures to hit a UK retail bank and has left many of TSB’s 1.9 million customers furious.Some said they were falling behind with bill payments.Others said they were worried their money had simply disappeared.Many customers expressed frustration that the bank was not being clear about what had happened.That came after Paul Pester, CEO of TSB, tweeted on Wednesday morning: “Our mobile banking app and online banking are now up and running. Thank you for your patience and for bearing with us.”Our mobile banking app and online banking are now up and running. Thank you for your patience and for bearing with us.MPs demanded answers from TSB on Tuesday. Nicky Morgan, chair of the Treasury Committee, said: “The reports of unauthorised transactions, access to other customers’ accounts and failures of in-branch services have all the hallmarks of an IT meltdown.“This is yet another addition to the litany of failures of banking IT systems. Potentially, millions of customers could be affected by uncertainty and disruption.“It simply isn’t good enough to expose customers to IT failures, including delays in paying bills and an inability to access their own money.”A spokesperson for the Financial Conduct Authority said on Tuesday that the watchdog was “aware of the issue and liaising with the firm”. A spokesperson for the Information Commissioner’s Office said: “We are aware of a potential data breach in relation to the TSB and are making enquiries.”Mr Pester said on Tuesday that he was “truly sorry” about the problems caused. “We’re still seeing issues with access to our digital services,” he added. “One of the steps we need to take to resolve this is to take our mobile app and online banking down for a few hours.“We did this at around 10.30 this morning and we hope to be back up later this afternoon.”The problems stemmed from a switch to a new online banking system. TSB had rented the technology behind its app and online banking from Lloyds Banking Group since the two companies split. Over the weekend, TSB moved customers to a new platform which experienced some teething problems.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

In the context of the Windrush crisis, surely the time has come for the Home Office to put an end to these flights. The public would be horrified if they knew the reality of this process.” Campaigners said the planned deportation flight “beggared belief” after Ms May formally apologised for the treatment of Caribbean families who were welcomed to the UK following the Second World War.Windrush generation: threat of deportation from UKWindrush generation: threat of deportation from UKThe ex-troopship \u0027Empire Windrush\u0027 arriving at Tilbury Docks from Jamaica, with 482 Jamaicans on board, emigrating to Britain.Jamaican immigrants being welcomed by RAF officials from the Colonial Office after the ex-troopship \u0027Empire Windrush\u0027 landed them at Tilbury.

Now 60 and a grandfather, Bryan thought the issue could be resolved swiftly, as he legally moved to Britain with his family as part of the Windrush generation of Caribbean migrants after World War II. In 1948, the ship Windrush brought the first group of migrants from the West Indies to help rebuild post-war Britain, and many others followed from around the Commonwealth. A 1971 law gave them indefinite leave to remain, but many never formalised their status, often because they were children who came over on their parents\u0027 passports and then never applied for their own.

In particular I will be reallocating £10m with the aim of increasing the number of enforced removals by more than 10 per cent over the next few years: something I believe is ambitious, but deliverable.”As calls mounted for Ms Rudd to resign, Conservative Party chairman Brandon Lewis claimed the figure was merely an “ambition” and she remained unaware of specific local targets.Ms Smith accused both the home secretary and the prime minister of attempting a “cover-up”.“They knew what they were doing, they’re just trying to cover it up,” she added. “Now everything has come out they’re trying to apologise but it doesn’t work.”Home Secretary Amber Rudd, who is to be recalled to give evidence to the Commons Home Affairs Committee (PA)Karen Doyle, national organiser for the Movement for Justice, said the immigrant rights and anti-racist organisation was working on making a submission to the European Court of Human Rights over her case.“Our argument is that the definition the government is working to on Windrush migrants could be widened and the only way that can happen is a full amnesty,” she added.“Notifying people of the charter flight now does seem absolutely crazy, it beggars belief.”The Black Activists Rising Against Cuts group is planning a protest on Tuesday and has started an online petition to stop the “astonishing” flight going ahead.“We oppose such mass deportations and until the government has set out a clear policy on who from Commonwealth countries are protected, they should not be authorising charter flights,” it said.The flights have long been the subject of controversy, with the death of Angolan man Jimmy Mubenga who was fatally restrained on a flight from Heathrow sparking the first national review of practices.In a report published last year, the Independent Monitoring Board Charter Flight Monitoring Team said the treatment of some migrants “fell short” of humane standards.A flight that took 42 people to Jamaica sparked concern about the use of force and restraint, with almost two thirds of detainees held in waist restraint belts.Monitors revealed that detainees had been taken out of immigration removal centres in the dead of night and held on coaches for up to seven-and-a-half hours, before being handed a booklet entitled “Coming Home”.The Home Office declined to comment on the charter flight but responded to MPs’ calls for laws protecting the Windrush generation’s rights by saying they could be guaranteed under existing immigration legislation.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

They happen to all governments to some degree at some point or another.\u0026nbspNone of us want to lose parliamentary colleagues but the truth is we have got a wealth of skill in the Conservative Parliamentary party.\u0026nbspAsked if he was going to be made the new Home Secretary, Mr Grayling said: I have absolutely no idea at this moment in time who the prime minister will appoint as the new home secretary.\u0026nbspMr Grayling, a Leave supporter, suggested Ms Rudd did not need to be replaced by another Remainer.We are now a government that is united in wanting to deliver the best outcome for Britain in Brexit, he said.\u0026nbspOkay, we have some debates and discussions about how we get there.\u0026nbspBut I think what\u0027s most important is she gives the right person this job because it is much more than the Brexit negotiations. It\u0027s about security and it\u0027s about the safety of our citizens.\u0026nbspMr Grayling said Ms Rudd had made a mistake because she had not been fully aware of what was happening on the ground.\u0026nbspShe\u0027s come to the view that she should have known more, that she didn\u0027t and she\u0027s got to take responsibility for that, he said.\u0026nbspMr Grayling said Ms Rudd would never deliberately mislead Parliament.Damian Hinds, the education secretary, said he hopes Ms Rudd will be back.He told Today: I very much regret that Amber has taken the decision to resign but I understand why she has done so.Mr Green said Ms Rudd, who has been a key Remainer in the Cabinet, would speak freely now she has left government.He said: I\u0027m sure that Amber will speak freely on all matters from the backbenches.\u0026nbspAsked if she would use her inside knowledge to inform the debate, he replied: I\u0027m sure she will.Damian Green, who was sacked as first secretary of state in December after making misleading statements about allegations police found pornography on computers in his parliamentary office in 2008 which breached the ministerial code, has said Ms Rudd was right to quit.The former immigration minister said he did not know during his time in the Home Office about the destruction of the landing cards of Windrush migrants.\u0026nbspHe told Today: I\u0027d never known about the landing cards at all. That\u0027s the sort of thing that happens in departments.\u0026nbspMr Green said he was told about the phrase hostile environment in relation to illegal immigrants.\u0026nbspThat was just a Home Office policy which we inherited, he added.Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, has\u0026nbspsaid Theresa May must face MPs following Amber Rudd\u0027s resignation.The prime minister\u0026nbspmust answer questions in the Commons about her knowledge of migrant removal targets, the Labour frontbencher said.\u0026nbspShe told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme: We want to talk to her about the aspects of the so-called hostile environment which she was responsible for and led to the Windrush fiasco.\u0026nbspMs Abbott added: I brought it to the House last week because there was this difficulty and problem about understanding her evidence to the Home Affairs select committee.\u0026nbspBut fundamentally the reason she had to resign was because of the Windrush fiasco.\u0026nbspSomebody had to take responsibility. It happened on her watch, therefore I think it is right that she resigned.Good morning and welcome to\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0027s live blog covering Amber Rudd\u0027s resignation.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspTheresa May will be forced into making another cabinet reshuffle after the home secretary resigned yesterday evening.Windrush generation: threat of deportation from UKWindrush generation: threat of deportation from UKThe ex-troopship \u0027Empire Windrush\u0027 arriving at Tilbury Docks from Jamaica, with 482 Jamaicans on board, emigrating to Britain.Jamaican immigrants being welcomed by RAF officials from the Colonial Office after the ex-troopship \u0027Empire Windrush\u0027 landed them at Tilbury.

As for who is behind this, we don’t know.”He pointed at a study suggesting that sentiments expressed on Twitter could affect the stock market as an indicator of the potential impact but that there was currently no measure of how tweets affected voting.Many of the Twitter bots studied by The Sunday Times shared 15-character alphanumeric usernames and English-sounding women’s names, despite listing their first language as Russian.Much of their activity was conducted in unison, retweeting official Labour accounts, Momentum and unions.Around 80 per cent of the automated accounts had been created after Theresa May called the snap election and became more active at key points including the launch of the Conservative Party manifesto, Manchester Arena bombing and television debates.The vast majority of accounts have now been suspended or removed by Twitter and it is impossible to view their full output, but it seems some were not exclusively political.Twitter works to detect and remove spam accounts (AFPGetty)One bot in the survey, under the name “Denis”, also sent out pornographic images and positive messages about Donald Trump.Ben Nimmo, a fellow at the Atlantic Council\u0027s Digital Forensic Research Lab, told The Independent that the dates the accounts were created pointed to their purpose but they could be used for several aims.“For me the key question is: are these commercial bots that someone hired to amplify political messaging in the UK, or are they dedicated bots that someone set up to generate the political effect themselves?” he asked.Bots can be used for a variety of purposes, including monitoring, marketing or allowing people to buy fake social media followers.Others are governed simply by traffic and interaction, causing them to share tweets on topics that are dominating social media at any given time, as Labour was during the general election.Owners of the networks can be paid to change what bots are programmed to do, seeing some switch between advertising cars and jewellery to political parties, for example.Even the Russian government’s own Internet Research Agency, known as the “troll factory” for its influence operations, periodically hires external botnets to amplify chosen messages.British Prime Minister Theresa May leaves 10 Downing Street for the 1922 committee on June 12, 2017 in London, England.

We continue to improve our internal systems to detect and prevent new forms of spam and malicious automation.”The research comes following persistent allegations of Russian influence in foreign elections, which the Kremlin denies, and wider cyber warfare.An unprecedented joint technical alert issued by British and American security services earlier this month said Russian hackers were targeting millions of devices around the world to spy, steal information and build networks for potentially devastating future cyberattacks.The government has announced £150m funding to bolster the NHS’s cyber defences after the devastating WannaCry virus, and intelligence agencies say other parts of Britain’s critical national infrastructure, including energy networks, have been targeted in the past.  or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

It has also helped draw attention to a number of other virtual currencies looming in its shadow, most notably ethereum.Ethereum was created in 2013 by a 19-year-old Russian programmer and launched in 2015. For the first two years its price remained below $10. Then, in 2017, it exploded. In the space of 12 months, one unit of the cyptocurrency – called an ether – surged in value to be worth around $1,400 at its peak in January 2018.While its price has since fallen back down to around $700, many still see it as the most promising of all cryptocurrency platforms, and therefore the one that holds the most potential for future price gains. Some even believe it could one day surpass bitcoin.“Ethereum has the possibility to overtake the market capitalisation, and thus value, of bitcoin,”  Hubert Olszewski, director of business development at Blockchain Board of Derivatives, tells The Independent. “This is because from the get-go it was a more versatile tool.” A smartphone displaying the current price chart for ethereum on April 25, 2018 in London, England. Cryptocurrency markets began to recover this month following a massive crash during the first quarter of 2018, seeing more than $550 billion wiped from the total market capitalisation. (Getty Images)When bitcoin became the world’s first decentralised digital currency upon its release in 2009, the world was reeling from the worst financial crisis in decades. So-called crypto-anarchists and others who were disillusioned by the recession hailed bitcoin for its ability to facilitate payments without the need for a bank. Essentially, they thought, it held the potential to revolutionise the global financial system.Since bitcoin’s inception, more than 1,500 other cryptocurrencies have appeared in its wake. Each one has attempted to offer something that bitcoin can’t, with the argument being that bitcoin’s core technology contains a number a fundamental flaws that are being exposed as its network grows. Here’s why bitcoin might be on the verge of another price explosionSome, like litecoin and bitcoin cash, have improved transaction times and lowered transaction costs. Ethereum’s aim, by contrast, is far more ambitious than simply improving upon bitcoin’s credentials as a payment system and store of value.“Bitcoin is a virtual currency, but also a store of value similar to gold. It’s limited to this function by its own design,” says Alessandra Sollberger, an early investor in bitcoin who has since ersified her cryptocurrency portfolio to include ethereum.“That’s different with ethereum. Beyond being a virtual currency, it’s been designed as a software platform that enables applications such as smart contracts – which are self-executing, secure contracts – to be built and to run without the need of a third party.”Bitcoin: Is the virtual currency the new gold standard?Bitcoin: Is the virtual currency the new gold standard?Bitcoin exists without a central bank able to manipulate its valueEthereum is therefore designed to not just decentralise traditional banks – as bitcoin sets out to do – but decentralise the entire internet. It does this by expanding upon bitcoin’s core technology called the blockchain, which is the online public ledger that permanently records the transactions made across the network.Using ethereum’s more versatile and advanced blockchain technology, anyone is able to create their own decentralised applications.“This opens up a vast potential of business use-case particularly as we move towards a much more connected and autonomous future,” says Erhan Korhaliller, founder of the blockchain specialist PR agency EAK Digital. “Ethereum has the potential to proliferate to all levels of business interaction.”By completely cutting out third parties, ethereum could one day transform the way we transfer everything, from online data to the property deeds of a house. In doing so, it has earned the nickname “World Computer”.“The ethereum platform has the potential to facilitate major innovation in applications, helping to usher a future in which self-driving cars, for example, can accept crypto in order to become self-sustainable,” says Gaurang Torvekar,co-founder and CEO of Indorse, a professional network powered by ethereum.“In the years ahead, there might even be a way in which we can use our smartphones for research that can cure cancer, and in turn get paid for it. With a growing number of companies across the globe working on groundbreaking applications using the ethereum blockchain, the future of innovation is bright, with endless possibilities on the horizon.”The Independent\u0027s bitcoin group on Facebook is the best place to follow the latest discussions and developments in cryptocurrency.

This enthusiasm for them wanting to make a deal ... We are going to hopefully make a deal,” he told reporters.Mr Trump added he would maintain pressure on the North not to “repeat the mistakes of past administrations”.Korea Summit: Kim Jong-un crosses border for historic meetingKorea Summit: Kim Jong-un crosses border for historic meetingNorth Korean leader Kim Jong-un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in raise their hands after signing on a joint statement Kim Jong-un heads towards Moon Jae-in to shake his hand between the military demarcation line, at the Joint Security Area on the Demilitarized Zone in the border village of Panmunjom in PajuSouth Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un hold hands as they cross the military demarcation lineSouth Koreans react while watching a screen reporting the Inter Korean SummitSouth Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un chat as they arrive at the Peace HouseNorth Korea’s leader Kim Jong-un was escorted by bodyguards from the North to the Military Demarcation Line that ides the two Koreas to meet with his South Korean counterpart at the truce village North Korean leader Kim Jong-un crosses the military demarcation line to meet with South Korean President Moon Jae-inKim Jong-un and Moon Jae-in shake handsNorth Korean leader Kim Jong-un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in shake hands after Kim crossing the military demarcation lineSouth Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un at the Joint Security AreaSouth Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un speak with two South Korean children who presented Kim Jong-un with a bouquet of flowersMoon Jae-in Kim Jong-un pose for photographers at the Joint Security Area (JSA)North Korean leader Kim Jong-un signs the guest book as South Korean President Moon Jae-in looks onNorth Korean leader Kim Jong-un’s entry in the guestbook.

They have provided support and provided a home for a child in need.It is therefore right that Government supports them in doing so.

Because expectations are so low for the Tories, they are almost bound to surpass them.Mrs May’s own position is also stronger than it was in January thanks to her handling of the Salisbury attack.At the start of the local election campaign, the talk was of how the Tories were facing a wipe-out in London, how they would do well to end up holding on to even one council.But senior figures involved in the campaign now admit they should do much better than that.Conservative Campaign Headquarters’ biggest worry in London is simply being outgunned on the day.They fear Labour’s return to being a mass membership party under Jeremy Corbyn will enable them to get nearly all their voters out, while the Tories will struggle to get more than 40 per cent of their supporters to the polls.There is, though, still cautious optimism that the Tories will hold at least one of their two flagship London boroughs, Wandsworth and Westminster.Then they could claim the results were respectable for a government in mid-term.This is especially true as results outside London are expected to be quite good for the party.One former Cabinet minister loyal to Theresa May tells me: “Things outside London really aren’t bad.”The Tories are particularly hopeful of making gains in the West Midlands.It will be tempting for the Tories to declare the local elections are further proof the capital and the rest of country are diverging politically, and so their decline in London doesn’t matter much as it will be made up for elsewhere.But this would be a catastrophic mistake.Labour’s rise in London is quite remarkable.They have gone from 37 per cent of the vote in 2010 to 55 per cent in 2017.There are several reasons why the capital is turning red but one of the biggest is the decline in home ownership.Home ownership in London peaked in the 1990s and has been falling since.Homeowners became a minority in London in 2011, the first time that has been the case since Margaret Thatcher’s Right To Buy revolution in the early 1980s.On current trends, 60 per cent of Londoners will be renters in seven years’ time.It is no coincidence that this rise in renting has coincided with Labour’s surge in the capital.For one of the things that makes you most likely to vote Tory is owning your own home.Labour’s surprise success at the last election was largely down to a big increase in turnout among renters who swung heavily to Labour.Labour London offers a preview of what happens to the Tories when homeowners become a minority.If the Tories want to win elections they need to get more homes built — and fast.CABINET Brexiteers are getting increasingly frustrated.They feel that key decisions are not being taken in Cabinet, or even the Cabinet Committee tasked with managing the negotiation, but elsewhere.One senior Brexiteer complains to me that Olly Robbins, the Prime Minister’s chief Europe adviser, is, “Running around telling everyone we have to back down on pretty much everything”.This grumpiness has been exacerbated by this week’s meeting of the Brexit inner Cabinet not discussing the big issue of the moment, customs.One member of it tells me: “When people left, they all felt a greater level of frustration.”There is a sense No10 is not respecting the political process.This all ups the ante ahead of the Brexit inner Cabinet’s meeting next week.This will discuss Theresa May’s plan for a hybrid customs model which would see the UK leave the customs union but collect tariffs on the EU’s behalf.Brexiteer ministers regard this as complicated and as having no chance of being accepted by Brussels. They think persisting with it just wastes valuable time.One tells me Mrs May has been told this hybrid plan is unworkable on eight occasions but doesn’t show any signs of abandoning the idea.Part of the problem is that Mrs May remains deeply worried about whether she has the votes in the Commons to leave the customs union.No10 is extremely concerned about the customs union amendment to the trade bill, which is expected to come to a vote in June.Its hope is the hybrid model is close enough to a customs union to see off a rebellion on this issue but if the model is unworkable, as pretty much everyone thinks, it doesn’t solve anything.Mrs May would be better off making the argument that Brexit won’t mean Brexit if Britain doesn’t regain the ability to run its own trade policy and that she couldn’t continue as Prime Minister in these circumstances.CHRIS GRAYLING wants to make it a criminal offence to cheat on auto emissions tests.This law change, which will be part of Grayling’s road to zero plan to cut exhaust emissions and improve air quality, will enable the Government to prosecute car manufacturers who try to diddle the system.The law won’t apply retrospectively.But the Department for Transport hope it will help prevent a repeat of the Volkswagen scandal.OUR political class needs to remember we are NOT Americans.The question about Donald Trump isn’t whether we would have voted for him or if we think he is the right person to be President of the United States.But how we should deal with the country he leads – which is our most important security ally.No country expelled more Russian diplomats following the Salisbury attack than the United States.Mrs May should make clear that she is delighted, not embarrassed, to welcome Donald Trump to Britain on his “working visit”.Why, because a strong relationship with the United States is in this country’s national interest.French President Emmanuel Macron, on his state visit to Washington this week, didn’t hold back in either cosying up to the president, quite literally at times, or in making clear where he disagreed with him.This is a far more sensible approach than acting all embarrassed about observing the necessary diplomatic niceties.Without Trump, yesterday’s moment of history would not have happened. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It aims to force a binding Parliamentary vote on the draft deal while talks are still ongoing.Crucially, if the deal is rejected, MPs and peers would then have power to instruct ministers what action to take – even if it means stopping Brexit.Last night, angry Brexiteers accused peers of sneaky and dishonest tactics to frustrate our departure from the EU.Brexit Minister Lord Callanan said: “Labour’s flawed amendment seeks to tie our hands by inserting false deadlines and shifting the power to negotiate from government to Parliament.“It asks for meaningless votes on the deal before the deal is done. Those who want to overturn the referendum call this the ‘no Brexit’ amendment.“The Conservatives are taking the scrutinising role of Parliament seriously, to improve an essential piece of legislation.

She was reported to be building a war chest in the event of the PM being ousted. For Ms Rudd this humiliation is a nightmare.But the simple truth is that she has been toppled because she was simply not up to the job.Misleading parliament over routine targets for deporting illegal immigrants is the least of it.Ms Rudd was already marked with the Black Spot.Her real blunders were the failure to act far quicker on both the Windrush victims and the knife massacre in London.The Home Office is the infamous “political graveyard” which chews ministers up and spits them out.Theresa May is the rarity who not only survived but used it as a springboard.Now the famously cautious PM needs to carry out emergency repairs with flair and imagination. She needs a new Home Secretary today.The right man for the job is Environment supremo Michael Gove.He has rebuilt his reputation, almost destroyed by his assassination of leadership rival Boris Johnson.He is the most articulate heavyweight minister in Cabinet and has proved that he can handle big responsibilities with both flair and courage.But Amber Rudd’s department has smashed the delicate Cabinet balance between Brexiteers and Remainers.It exposes deep divisions within Tory ranks over the roubled negotiations currently under way with Brussels.A handful of Remainers are threatening to defy the government in a critical vote over remaining in the EU customs union.Meanwhile Brexiteers who have remained silent are plotting a leadership coup if Mrs May gives in.The departure of Ms Rudd could explode all of this into open warfare.Will Mrs May risk putting potential rival Michael Gove in one of the really Great Offices of State?Jezza’s empty promise to crack down on anti-Semitism followed Commons applause for tearful Labour MPs as they read out vicious Jew-phobic abuse from JC4PM supporters.The answer to Mrs Merton is that Labour, with a 22 per cent poll lead, expects big things in London on Thursday, perhaps including scalps in Tory crown jewel boroughs Westminster and Wandsworth.JC doesn’t want a row over Jew-baiting to spoil a good night for Labour.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I’m a little and Johnny is my daddy.“My little age is five, which just kind of fits me. I don’t really ever go lower or move higher than that. That’s what I am comfortable with. That’s what I like.”Max has a list of rules to obey, including no tantrums, no back talk and no staying up past bedtime - and gets banished for a timeout in the naughty corner if she breaks them.She said: “Sometimes if I’m bad my daddy takes away my phone, or I don’t get to watch TV for a certain amount of time, or I have to go to bed early.“But the worst one is being put in timeout because I just have to sit there in the corner and stare at the wall and do nothing - that is not fun at all.”Johnny regularly reads Max a bedtime story before putting her down for her daily nap, after she’s tired herself out playing with her dolls and colouring books.And if Max has been especially good, he takes her to the nearby park to play on the swings and the slide.Max first became a “little” aged 18 after discovering the DDLG community on YouTube.She said: “Listening to people in the community talk about how they felt, that was how I felt. So, I decided to try it out and I have just loved it ever since. It’s just me.I understand why some people will look at the way that I am and the way that I live and be confused and think that it’s disgusting or shameful.But what people fail to see is that this is between two consenting adults and what we do in our home doesn’t really harm anyone else.The pair met while Johnny was working in a tattoo shop and Max came in to get some new artwork.Johnny said: When she came in for a tattoo she looked very nerdy and I was a gigantic nerd myself and we actually became best friends. And slowly but surely she kind of just moved her way into other aspects of my life.“When we first started dating she told me to call her princess and showed me her sippy cup.”However, the pair are adamant that DDLG is a more of a lifestyle for them and that that aspect of their relationship doesn’t transfer over into the bedroom.Max added: “To me, I am little and I use this to strengthen my relationship and to relax and have fun. For us it’s not a sexual thing, but we have no problem with people who do see in that way.And despite the unusual nature of their relationship, Max is at pains to stress that she is an adult capable of making rational decisions.She said: “I work from home, so during the day my littleness comes and goes but when I am with Johnny I am little most of the time.But I do adult stuff all the time. I am an adult. I am 20 years old, I pay my bills.“It’s not something that I can’t control. If we go out go out to a nice dinner of if we are in a grocery store or out in public, I just don’t randomly shout ‘daddy! because that’s involving other people in something that they didn’t consent to.”Max and Johnny educate others about their DDLG lifestyle on their YouTube and Instagram channels Baby Bear Max.And while Max is unsure if she’ll always be a “little”, she says she never wants to shed her childlike innocence.She said: I will always have that childlike sense of wonder about me. I will always be curious. I will always be eager to learn. I will always love Disney movies. I will always love to colour.And whether or not in 20 years I will still call myself a little, I know that I am going to have that inside me.Because I don’t want to grow up. I want to happy and carefree forever and I think that’s true of a lot of people.”Previously an adult baby who wears nappies day and night says his unusual dress-sense is about comfort NOT sex. Meanwhile a woman, 23 found fame as an ‘adult baby’ who wears a nappy as well…and her boyfriend LOVES it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

My ministers have made over 30 appearances to answer questions and debate the issues. And we will be giving Parliament a vote on the final deal when we have concluded our negotiations with the EU.When all is said and done, I’m a Parliamentarian before a Minister, and a democrat before a Conservative.But there is a clear distinction between the important work of revising legislation and attempting to overturn the referendum result to keep the UK inside the European Union, in direct opposition to the British people.The amendment Labour have proposed today in the House of Lords is at risk of doing just that.There are three crucial reasons why the Government could never accept it.Firstly, the amendment tries to secure a vote for Parliament before the negotiations have concluded. This is, quite frankly, nonsensical — because nothing in this negotiation is agreed until everything is agreed.Second, it demands specific votes by artificial deadlines which, if not met, would give Parliament the power to micromanage the Government on how to carry out these negotiations.This would give the EU Commission a clear incentive to delay the negotiations or present unacceptable propositions until the deadline has passed and the Government is stripped of its ability to negotiate freely.This fundamental change to the balance of our constitution would be both unprecedented and unworkable.And in our negotiations with the EU to date, the progress we have made has in part been down to the flexibility that both sides have shown.Imagine if every quick decision, proposal or response the Prime Minister and I have to take instead had to be timetabled, debated and voted on by over a thousand MPs and peers?Finally, the amendment proposes giving Parliament the power to direct the Government on anything relating to the negotiations – including extending the negotiation process and keeping the UK in the EU indefinitely.Sure, the peers proposing it may claim it is about keeping power in Parliament or ensuring their votes are ‘meaningful’.But those who want to overturn the result of the Referendum have been calling for a ‘no Brexit option’ for months, and this amendment would grant it to them.This is not what the British people want, and it is not something that we can accept. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I also did not lose fragments as the day went on.Dr Denholm Aspy, of the University of Adelaides School of Psychology, Australia, said:The average person spends around six years of their lives dreaming.If we are able to become lucid and control our dreams, we can then use our dreaming time more productively.Lucid dreaming, where you know that you are dreaming while the dream is still happening, has many potential benefits.For example, it may be possible to use lucid dreaming for overcoming nightmares, treating phobias, creative problem solving, refining motor skills and even helping with rehabilitation from physical trauma.Vitamin B6 known as pyridoxine occurs naturally in various foods, including whole grain cereals, legumes, fruits such as banana and avocado, vegetables such as spinach and potato, milk, cheese, eggs, red meat, liver, and fish.Vitamin B6 helps the body to use and store energy from protein and carbohydrates in food and form haemoglobin - the substance in red blood cells that carries oxygen around the body.The NHS said the daily amount of vitamin B6 adults aged 19 to 64 years need is about 1.4mg for men and 1.2mg for women which can be got from a normal diet.But it warns taking more than 200mg a day for a long time can lead to a loss of feeling in the arms and legs known as peripheral neuropathy.People should not take the supplement over 10mg unless advised to by a doctor.

I was at rock bottom. There were times when I thought I wouldn’t get through it.I was exhausted, fearing I would end up in jail – all for doing the right thing by the person I loved most in the world, so that she did not have to die an undignified and agonising death.”Helen was diagnosed with a lung disorder in 2004 called alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency that forced her to leave her job as a college lecturer.In 2015 she made the decision to contact Dignitas and carried out all the research and payments herself.James, who was in a relationship with Helen for 33 years, said she was in a helpless situation and was in pain and suffering every day.He added: She said, ‘I’m not frightened of dying, but I am frightened about the way I die’.She had my support at every stage but said if I was uncomfortable with going she would consider going alone.We knew there could be a legal issue but there was no way I was ever going to let [her] be waved off at the door.”When the couple boarded the train to Switzerland, Helens lung capacity was at 15 per cent and she had oxygen tanks and nebulisers keeping her alive.After spending their final hours together in a hotel, the pair made their way to the clinic in Zurich where Helen was giving life ending drugs to help her pass away incredibly peacefully.But in a devastating twist of fate, the couples home in West Bromwich in the West Midlands was ransacked by thieves while Helen was ending her life in November 2016.The callous raiders stole Helen’s computer containing cherished photos and wrapped the stolen items in “the last bed sheet she slept in”.Neighbours raised the alarm and told police the couple had gone to Switzerland for Helen so she could end her life.James was then quizzed by cops within hours of arriving back in the UK without his long-term partner.He said: “Initially they were fine... The detectives said I had nothing to worry about. I told them I had a letter written by Helen outlining her decision and we had copies of all of her medical notes and letters between her GP and consultant. They just said they would be in touch.”But two months later, he was interviewed under caution and was investigated for six months until the charges were dropped in June 2017 after cops got hold of Helens medical records.James is now campaigning alongside charity Dignity in Dying to overturn the UK’s ban on assisted dying and has been in contact with Julie Smith, 48, whose husband Paul died in September 2016.The 57-year-old had been diagnosed with cancer but died in agony as his GP said he could not provide medical records for him to send to Dignitas on “ethical and legal grounds”.The disease, also known as AATD or A1AD, is a rare inherited condition that can cause liver and lung problems.Around 25,000 people in the UK have the genetic condition though most remain healthy so few have been diagnosed.Sufferers are much more vulnerable to the effects of inhaling smoke or other toxic materials like dust, fumes or chemicals.The condition increases the risk of lung disease including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It costs around £10,000 for a person to go to Dignitas to end their life with the sentence for assisting a suicide up to 14 years in jail.A West Midlands Police spokesman said: “The investigation was delayed because, despite West Midlands police requests for medical records, they were not made [available] until June last year.“That month, it was decided that it did not meet the evidential threshold for prosecution and the investigation was discontinued.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nintchdbpict000277727470.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"baby boomers struggling pay rent maybe even more than young people","story":"Most of the baby boomer generation own homes but 1.13million rent from private landlords.The findings show that half a million baby boomers who rent privately may have had to take drastic decisions in the past year to cover their rent.A fifth of those battling to afford bills also cut down on food or heating, and one in ten have used credit.Of those who need vital changes made to their homes, such as adding handrails, stair lifts, ramps or wider doorways for wheelchairs, around two-fifths (42 per cent) have fallen over in their own home and a similar proportion at 43 per cent leave home less often then they want to.Nearly three-fifths (59 per cent) have needed these changes for over a year, the survey found.David Orr, chief executive of the National Housing Federation,  said: We often hear that young people bear the brunt of the housing crisis but todays report reveals a shocking number of hidden baby boomers who are struggling just as much if not more.There is a huge amount of inequality amongst this age group and unfortunately the wealthier majority have hidden the reality of hundreds of thousands of people who have never been able to afford a house. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Chris and I know how devastated and empty they will be feeling as their desperate fight to save Alfie has ended.Seeing them go through the agonies we have done has been incredibly hard.It has resurrected very painful memories about our own journey. Sometimes it has been too painful to watch.And now Alfies case has made us even more determined to fight for new laws to give parents more say in what happens to their child so that other parents might be spared the agony.Baby Charlie died aged 11 months old last July just a week before his first birthday after a long fight against a disease called mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome.His fight for life touched the world as Connie and Chris fought against a decision by doctors at Great Ormond Street Hospital who applied for permission to have Charlies ventilator switched off.They wanted to take him to the US for pioneering treatment and took their fight all the way through the court system of the UK and Europe.Alfie was admitted to Alder Hey Childrens Hospital in Liverpool in December 2016 aged seven months. It was believed he had a mitochondrial disorder, similar to Charlie, and parents Tom, 21, and Kate, 20, experienced a similar court-battle as they fought to take their son to a hospital in Rome.Both couples lost their legal cases to take their poorly children out of the country for treatment elsewhere.Charlies Law calls for independent mediation to be offered to all parents in a similar situation to prevent cases against doctors going to court."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nintchdbpict000402475535-e1525044266341.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"amber rudd pm hopes dashed","story":"She was first elected as the Conservative MP for Hastings and Rye in 2010, having lived in the East Sussex constituency since 2007.Her career saw her hold ministerial positions in the Treasury and the Department of Energy and Climate Change before becoming Energy Secretary in 2015.In the run-up to the 2016 Brexit vote Ms Rudd, 54, campaigned for Britain to stay in the EU.And when Theresa May became Prime Minister after David Cameron quit following the result of the referendum, Ms Rudd succeeded her as Home Secretary.
