Presley told the court that before they married, she and Lockwood discussed having a pre-nup agreement but none was ever signed. Lisa Marie Presley is seen second from right with daughter Riley Keough, and her twin girls who she had with Lockwood (far left) in October 2017Both Presley, 50, and Lockwood, 57, signed the post-nup a year after their January 2006 wedding when Presley was worth almost $63 million and Lockwood\u0027s net worth was zero.Lockwood, wants the document torn up, calling it invalid because, he claims, he was coerced into signing it, he didn\u0027t read it properly, his lawyer at the time - who has since died - didn\u0027t explain the agreement to him, and he doesn\u0027t remember the period when the post-nup was negotiated and signed.But Presley\u0027s attorney, Gary Fishbein, has fought back in court papers filed at LA Superior Court, accusing Lockwood of \u0027feigning amnesia or ignorance\u0027 and saying he \u0027had the full and complete opportunity to negotiate the terms of the agreement, was competently represented by counsel… and entered into the agreement freely and voluntarily, without duress or coercion.\u0027 On Monday, Presley took the witness stand  and accused Lockwood, of secretly running up \u0027possibly millions\u0027 on her credit card.\u0027I uncovered that he had been in control of finances for the 10 years before,\u0027 she told Judge Dianna Gould-Saltman at Los Angeles Superior on the first day of the expected four-day trial. \u0027He had spent hundreds of thousands of dollars, possibly millions on my credit card.\u0027 When Presley angrily confronted musician Lockwood in March 2016, three months before she filed for orce, he didn\u0027t deny running up the credit card bills, she said.And she insisted that he sign an agreement consenting to sell all his guitars, recording equipment, computers and other musical equipment to help make up for some of the credit card losses. \u0027It allowed me to pay off some of the Tennessee state taxes I owed,\u0027 she added.          Lisa Marie, daughter of music legend Elvis (pictured in 1970) allegedly asked her husband to sign a post-nup agreement \u0027to protect her assets and her inheritance\u0027Presley hired Lockwood for $3,500 a week as her musical director for her upcoming concert tour, in 2014 and married him two years later. In court Monday, she had trouble recalling the time of that marriage, her fourth.When Lockwood\u0027s attorney, Jeff Sturman asked her the date she got married she replied, \u0027I don\u0027t recall the date.\u0027 And when Sturman asked her, \u0027Do you remember what year?\u0027 she answered, \u0027I believe it was 2007.\u0027 In fact, she married Lockwood in Japan in January 2006. Presley told the court that before they married, she and Lockwood discussed having a pre-nup agreement but none was ever signed. Then, the year after they married, she asked him to sign a post-nup agreement \u0027to protect her assets and her inheritance.\u0027 \u0027He spent hundreds of thousands of dollars, possibly...Aubrey O\u0027Day confided in Omarosa about her 2011 affair with...Share this articleTo support his argument that Lockwood voluntarily agreed to sign the post-nup twice - in July and November 2007 - Presley\u0027s lawyer Gary Fishbein asked her: \u0027Did he (Lockwood) express any objections to signing the pre-nuptial agreement? Did you hold a gun to his head? Did you threaten to leave him if he didn\u0027t sign?\u0027 Presley answered \u0027No\u0027 to all three questions. And when Fishbein asked her, \u0027Did he tell you that he never wanted anything from you,\u0027 she answered, \u0027Yes, he did.\u0027 When Fishbein asked her if the spousal support clause of the pre-nup - in which both she and Lockwood agreed not to seek spousal support from the other if they orced - was important to her, Presley said, \u0027Very.\u0027 Presley admitted that she did pay spousal support to her first husband, Danny Keough, when they orced but she added, with a chuckle, that she didn\u0027t have to pay support to husband number 2, Michael Jackson, or husband number 3, actor Nicholas Cage. Earlier in the day, giving his version of the couple\u0027s fight over the credit card in March 2016, Lockwood told the court that Presley \u0027was extremely upset. We were having an argument about a credit card.\u0027 He added that he agreed to sell all his musical equipment \u0027to appease her.\u0027 Asked by his lawyer, Sturman, why he signed the post-nup in 2007, Lockwood said: \u0027Because my wife wanted me to.\u0027 He said she became angry when he first hesitated to sign after his lawyer told him there were possible issues in the agreement that needed to be sorted out. But he signed anyway, he said. \u0027She\u0027s not a take-no-for-an-answer kind of woman,\u0027 he said of his soon-to-be-ex wife.Asked if he would like the court to find that the pre-nup agreement is invalid, he added, \u0027I believe it\u0027s something the court should decide.\u0027 Lockwood told the court that when he and Presley separated in June 2016, he had nowhere to go so he first stayed in a Holiday Inn, then \u0027couch-surfed\u0027 for about two years, and has been making around $2,000-$2,500 a month working as a store clerk, a factory worker, teaching guitar and playing guitar in session recordings. He said that he\u0027s now living with his girlfriend Stephanie to whom he\u0027s engaged to be married.The revelation prompted Presley\u0027s attorney to ask, \u0027Do you know that when you re-marry you would lose the spousal support from your previous marriage? Does that change your mind about getting married again?\u0027 Lockwood answered, \u0027I don\u0027t know about that.\u0027 Presley - who was in court in a black dress and beige coat and ankle boots - said she doesn\u0027t want to pay up and, countered Lockwood\u0027s attorney, Sturman: \u0027She\u0027s feeling angry and vindictive. She wants him on the street. She\u0027s fine if he has nothing.\u0027Earlier in his opening statement, Presley\u0027s lawyer Fishbein told Judge Gould-Saltman that he found it \u0027incredible and unbelievable\u0027 that Lockwood\u0027s \u0027position is that he didn\u0027t read the post-nuptial agreement - which he signed twice.\u0027 \u0027You don\u0027t need to have graduated from MIT to understand that you are waiving spousal support,\u0027 added Fishbein who also questioned Lockwood\u0027s contention that when he signed the post-nup, his attorney - now deceased - didn\u0027t explain it to him.\u0027This attorney had been practicing law since 1956 - he had more than 40 years experience in family law. \u0027Now Lockwood is trying to get out from under a agreement he voluntarily agreed to and signed. He wants a chunk of cash and a bunch of spousal support.\u0027 Lockwood\u0027s attorney, Sturman hit back telling the court that Presley, her lawyers and business manager took an \u0027unfair advantage\u0027 of Lockwood when they persuaded him to sign the post-nup. \u0027They cooked the books - they wanted him to sign something they thought could be enforceable later on.\u0027 Despite the post-nup Sturman told the court, \u0027Spouses have a fiduciary (financial) duty to each other. \u0027Miss Presley is living off her inherited wealth….and Mr Lockwood has little or nothing. He is living at the poverty level. (Presley) is feeling angry and vindictive. She wants him on the street. She\u0027s fine if he has nothing.\u0027 Lockwood - who wore a blue suit and tie and a black shirt in court Monday - told Fishbein under questioning that didn\u0027t remember signing the prenup. \u0027I don\u0027t really understand contracts,\u0027 he said, adding that he didn\u0027t find \u0027contracts and legalese interesting.\u0027 But, he continued: \u0027Had I read it I would not have signed it…I think it\u0027s unfair.\u0027 The trial continues. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/15/23/4F1FAA3700000578-0-image-m-44_1534372987043.jpg","title":"S Africas ANC chairman wants state seize land 12 000 hectares","story":"    The rand fell on financial markets after ANC chair Gwede Mantashe, an ally of President Cyril Ramaphosa (pictured), said major landowners should have land taken without compensationMore than two decades after the end of apartheid, white people still own most of South Africa\u0027s land.Ownership patterns remain highly emotive as the government has been slow to transfer land to the black majority after centuries of colonial and racial oppression.The ANC\u0027s plans to amend the constitution to redistribute land have been interpreted negatively by some investors, who see them as undermining property rights.The ruling party has sought to assuage those fears by saying that land reform will follow a parliamentary process.That\u0027s rich!

Here’s all you need to know about it.Munich massacre at 1972 Summer OlympicsThe Munich massacre was an attack during the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, West Germany in which the Palestinian terrorist organization Black September took eleven members of the Israeli Olympic team hostage and subsequently killed them. A West German police officer was also killed in the attack.The terrorist attack took place from approximately 4:30am local time on September 5, 1972 until about 1:30am am local time on September 6, 1972.The incident started as a hostage crisis in the early morning hours of September 5, 1972 after eight armed members of the Black September terror group infiltrated the Munich Olympic Village and used stolen keys to enter two apartments being used by the Israeli Olympic team.Some team members resisted the intrusion, ultimately leading to the deaths of two of them. Ultimately, the terror group took nine hostages, with a spokesman for them demanding the release of 234 Palestinian prisoners jailed in Israel and Red Army Faction leaders Ulrike Meinhof and Andreas Baader in West Germany. Black September also demanded a plane for their own escape.After debating whether to engage in negotiations with the terrorist group, West German authorities ultimately determined that a rescue attempt would be the only way to solve the crisis. They decided to feign an agreement with Black September, allowing them to transport the bound hostages to Fürstenfeldbruck Air Base nearby.          Nine hostages were taken by the Black September terrorist group during the Munich massacreThe West German police decided to secretly ambush the Black September members there with snipers, but the plan suffered from poor communication, improper planning and an inadequate number of sharpshooters to eliminate all of the terrorists efficiently.At the airport, the Black September members became aware of their deception and engaged in a fierce gun battle with West German police. Despite premature media reports that the hostages had all been successfully rescued, all of them were ultimately killed in the failed rescue attempt by gunfire or grenades from Black September members.The Black September members were all killed by around 1:30am local time on September 6. However, the tragedy that resulted from the botched rescue attempt was summed up by ABC reporter Jim McKay who was covering the Summer Olympics and hostage crisis: ‘…When I was a kid, my father used to say Our greatest hopes and our worst fears are seldom realized. Our worst fears have been realized tonight. They\u0027ve now said that there were eleven hostages. Two were killed in their rooms yesterday morning, nine were killed at the airport tonight. They\u0027re all gone.’          Despite erroneous reports that the hostages were freed, all were killed during the massacreWhat was Black September?Black September was a terrorist organization founded in September 1970 as an offshoot of the Palestinian Liberation Organization.A secular nationalist terrorist group, it notoriously launched a number of other terrorist attacks during its existence in addition to the Munich attack, including assassinating Jordanian Prime Minister Wasfi al-Tal in November 1971 and hijacking Sabena Flight 572 in May 1972 during its flight from Vienna to Lod, Israel.The group was ultimately disbanded by the Palestinian Liberation Organization in September 1973.Crazy Rich Asians: All you need to knowWho is Ashley Benson?

Narendra Modi taking part in a yoga session to mark International Yoga Day in DehradunNarendra joined the BJP in 1987 and soon became the General Secretary of the Gujarat branch, influential in ensuring that the party’s presence was strong in the following years. Three years after joining, he participated in a coalition government and helped to achieve success in the 1995 state legislative assembly elections.Despite the BJP’s control over the Indian government being short-lived, only lasting a few months in 1996, Modi was made the secretary of the BJP’s national organisation in New Delhi and three years later, appointed the General Secretary.However, because of fellow BJP member and Gujarat Chief Minister Keshubhai Patel’s poor response to the Bhuj earthquake in 2000, that killed more than 20,000 people, Modi replaced him and went on to enter his first-ever electoral contest in February 2002, which he went on to win and take a seat in the state assembly.Modi’s political career was then marred with controversy and scandal: his role during the Gujarat riots in 2002 were questioned and he was accused of condoning violence, or at least, not doing enough to stop the killing of over 1,000 people, mostly Muslims.          Theresa May and Narendra Modi arrive for a photograph ahead of the India-U.K. Tech SummitIn 2005, the US declined to issue him a diplomatic visa on the grounds that he was responsible for these riots and the UK also criticised him for this. While Modi escaped without any indictment, his close associates were found guilty of complicity and were jailed.His government has also been accused of extrajudicial killings: one case resulting the deaths of a woman and three men, members of the Pakistan-based terrorist organisation Lashkar-e-Taiba, involved in the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks, were alleged to have been plotting to assassinate Modi.Modi was soon indispensable to the BJP and under his leadership, the party secured victory in 2002 after winning 127 of the 182 seats in the chamber and again in 2007 before prevailing again in 2012. Both times he won his contests and returned as Chief Minister.          Justin Trudeau, Bill Gates, Barack Obama, Francois Hollande and Narendra Modi poseModi speechIn Narendra Modi’s Independence Day speech, he hailed India’s rise under his government and said that ‘policy paralysis’ during the UPA rule was over, according to The Times of India. From the Red Fort, Modi spent 88 minutes addressing his nation and explored burning issues.‘When 125 crore people move towards achieving a goal, there is nothing that cannot happen. In 2014, the people of the country did not just stop at forming the government. They moved together towards nation-building and are contributing to do so.’After showcasing his achievements, he stated that ‘India was earlier a sleeping elephant which has woken up now and started running’ and went on to quote Tamil nationalist icon Subramania Bharti to say in Tamil, ‘India will show the path to the world.‘I am restless, I am agitated and I am also impatient for my country to lead the fourth industrial revolution, the revolution that is based on knowledge, the revolution which will be led by those who have IT skills. I am impatient for my county to lead it.’          Former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee, former Deputy L.K. Advani and Narendra Modi picturedHe also announced the rollout of the Ayushman Bharat-National Health Protection Scheme, which has been described as the world’s largest healthcare measure and will cover 500 million people, providing a cover of 500,000 rupees (£5,600) per family a year.In addition to discussing the commissioning of women in the armed forces, he spoke about the recent incidents of rape, but made no mention of the hot topic being debated in this country at the moment of lynching.Modi also promised that he would send a manned flight into space by 2022 and become the fourth country to achieve this. India is currently the sixth-largest economy in the world and Modi said that international institutions will see the subcontinent as as engine to strengthen the world economy for the next three decades.He will seek another five-year term for his party at elections due by March-April next year.Narendra Modi net worthWhile Narendra Modi may be the leader of the sixth-largest economy in the world, he only keeps a measly Rs 4,700 (£55) as cash in hand.His total assets are worth Rs 14 million (£16,000) because of a property he owns in Gandhinagar, the value of which has increased by more than 25 times since it was purchased 13 years ago, according to Mashable.He does not own any vehicles, aircrafts, yachts or ships and while he has no loans, Modi owns four gold rings, which are worth Rs 1,19,000 (£1380). It was also revealed that he was one of the most modestly-paid world leaders and earned a salary of Rs 1.9 million (£24,000).Crazy Rich Asians: All you need to knowWho is Ashley Benson?

They had insisted Stokes protected them from verbal abuse.Stokes, who had admitted drinking heavily but denied being \u0027really very drunk\u0027 had insisted in court: \u0027Everything I did that night, I did in defence of myself.\u0027He said he had acted to protect Mr Barry and Mr O\u0027Connor from homophobic abuse.          Following his acquittal Stokes was immediately restored to the England squad for Saturday’s Test against IndiaNottinghamshire batsman Hales, 29, had been credited by the prosecution with attempting to calm the ruckus until footage of him \u0027stamping\u0027 on Mr Ali emerged in evidence. In police bodycam footage of Stokes\u0027 arrest, Hales appeared to lie to PC Stacey Alway, claiming he had missed the fight.Despite the severity of the violence he allegedly used, and his apparent lies to police, Hales was not arrested or charged, merely interviewed under caution.In his closing speech, Stokes\u0027 barrister Gordon Cole QC went as far as to suggest that Hales could have been responsible for Mr Ali\u0027s injuries, which included a fractured eye socket. The CPS said it was an Avon and Somerset Police decision not to pursue Hales.On the morning the trial began, prosecutors sought to lay two additional, more serious charges against Stokes to reflect the injuries suffered by Mr Hale and Mr Ali. But Judge Peter Blair QC said introducing the counts of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, an offence carrying a sentence of up to five years in jail, would be unfair on Stokes and his legal team at such a late stage. The decision  is under scrutiny following the last-minute attempt to introduce the extra charges and the acquittal of Mr Hale halfway through the trial.Jurors may have been baffled by the absence of Mr Barry and Mr O\u0027Connor, who maintain that Stokes defended them against homophobic abuse. Sources said the CPS deemed them unreliable.As the jury, who deliberated for two hours and 34 minutes, announced the not guilty verdicts, Stokes\u0027 chest heaved and he staggered forward, tears welling in his eyes, before he shook Mr Ali\u0027s hand. In the public gallery, Stokes\u0027 wife Clare wept and embraced his agent Neil Fairbrother.Outside court, Mr Stokes\u0027 solicitor Paul Lunt told reporters: \u0027Today\u0027s verdict represents the end of an 11-month ordeal for Ben during which time he has had to maintain his silence at times when many on social media, and certain parts of the Press, predetermined his guilt long before the trial began.\u0027The jury\u0027s decision ... fairly reflects the truth of what happened in Bristol that night.\u0027A CPS spokesman said: \u0027A decision to charge this case was made following detailed consideration of the evidence and in accordance with the Code for Crown Prosecutors. The function of the CPS is not to decide whether a person is guilty of a criminal offence, but to make fair, independent and objective assessments about whether it is appropriate to present charges for a jury to consider. We respect the jury\u0027s decision. The CPS keeps cases under continual review.\u0027We selected the charge of affray at the outset in accordance with the Code. Upon further review we considered that additional assault charges would be appropriate.\u0027Avon and Somerset Police said: \u0027Early investigative advice was sought from the CPS in relation to Alex Hales\u0027 involvement in the incident and a decision was subsequently made at a senior level to take no further action against him "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/16/12/4F21D4A200000578-0-image-m-39_1534418018796.jpg","title":"Romanian people smugglers tried sneak four Afghani nationals UK inside secret compartment","story":"    A migrant is pictured inside the hidden compartment that was uncovered by Border Force officials          A panel beneath a mattress which was fixed with new screws was pulled away (pictured) to reveal a compartment built from plywood around a metal frameA panel beneath the mattress which was fixed with new screws was pulled away to reveal a compartment built from plywood around a metal frame.Officers peered in and saw a man and a woman crouching inside with their two-year-old daughter and a 15-year-old boy who was not related to them. They were crammed into the compartment for the seven hour crossing, which was just 18 inches wide at its narrowest point, 3ft 10 ins high and 5ft 6ins wide.  Van driver Gheorghe Virlan, 23, and his front seat passenger Darius Flavius Stanis, 24, were arrested at the scene on July 8 this year. Border Force chiefs said the pair carried out a “reckless gamble” with the lives of their human cargo who would have been trapped in the event of an accident.            The Mercedes Sprinter van that contained the hidden chamber was stopped at Harwich port in Essex  Van driver Gheorghe Virlan (left) and his front seat passenger Darius Flavius Stanis (right) were arrested at the scene on July 8 this year.Romanian driver who tried to smuggle Afghan father and his...Hunt is underway for up to 15 migrant stowaways after they...Share this articleThe pair who have no fixed UK address both admitted a charge of assisting illegal immigration and were each jailed for three years at Chelmsford Crown Court.Judge Christopher Morgan said he was satisfied the refugees had been trafficked and \u0027therefore were vulnerable\u0027.He said: \u0027That family included a child of 15 and also a child I\u0027m told was a matter of months old.\u0027I\u0027ve no doubt, because of their circumstances, they were desperate to find a safe haven in the UK and that involved them making a perilous journey across Europe, assisted by those who are prepared to take their limited resources and transport them, and then try and gain access to the UK.

The marriage broke down in 1972 and matters soon became acrimonious. Up to his eyeballs in debt, Lord Lucan became obsessed with getting his children back.Lady Lucan was the only known witness to the events in 1974 which led to the murder of the children’s nanny, Sandra Rivett. Lady Lucan always maintained that it was her estranged husband who bludgeoned the nanny to death, a case of mistaken identity.Lord Lucan, she said, hit her four times with a length of bandaged metal piping before she managed to escape and raise the alarm at a local pub, bursting through the door of the Plumber’s Arms screaming: “Help me, help me! I have just escaped from a murderer. My children, my children. He’s in my house. He’s murdered the nanny. Help me!”He disappeared almost immediately, his borrowed car found abandoned and blood-spattered at the cross-Channel port of Newhaven in East Sussex. On the way he stopped off to tell a friend, Susan Maxwell-Scott, that he had stumbled on an attacker hitting his wife and had tried to save her. Lucan said he was going to “lie doggo” for a while.What followed was one of the most bizarre missing person cases there has ever been. Over the years there were reported sightings of him working as a waiter in San Francisco, at a clinic for alcoholics in Brisbane, living rough in a Land Rover in the rural outback of New Zealand’s North Island with a menagerie of pets including a cat, goat and possum.In 2003 the Sunday  published claims by a former Scotland Yard detective that Lucan had been living in a hippy commune in Goa and was known to friends as Jungle Barry. Days later the  reported the truth: Jungle Barry was in fact a now deceased folk singer from St Helens.If Lucan were to still be alive, he would be 83.Lady Lucan was found dead at her home in Eaton Row, near Buckingham Palace, last September. An inquest ruled that she had taken her own life in the mistaken belief she had Parkinson’s disease.For decades Lady Lucan cut a lonely, tortured figure, severing ties with her children and their families in the 1980s. In her will she expressed her wish to leave her estate to the homeless and housing charity Shelter.Shelter will benefit from the sale at Bonhams of 40 objects from Lady Lucan’s house including a 1972 portrait of her husband by artist Dominick Elwes.Observers have found it curious that Lady Lucan appeared less bitter towards her husband than her children. In one rare interview, to the Sunday Times in 1998, the journalist remarked on how the Elwes portrait dominated the drawing room along with a display of silver cups Lord Lucan won at the Clermont Club backgammon tournaments.The portrait, with an estimate of £2,000-£3,000, is layered with extra poignancy in that Elwes, one of Lucan’s closest friends from their Eton schooldays, killed himself in 1975. Elwes had been shunned by Lucan’s friends for selling a drawing of them to the Sunday Times.Charlie Thomas, Bonhams director of private sales, said the Lucan name resonated throughout history with the 3rd earl, for example, giving the order to deploy the Light Brigade at the Battle of Balaclava. “These items offer a rare chance to acquire pieces belonging to one of this country’s most famous aristocratic families.”Other objects in the 3 October sale include a backgammon trophy with an estimate of £200-£300 and a Victorian silver cigar box engraved with B - for Bingham - with an estimate of £700-£900.There are also boxes of books including, with perhaps morbid irony, Graham Greene’s novel The End of the Affair and his short story collection May We Borrow Your Husband?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e3bcf4c623b5e4266790080db02bc17662e6847/0_592_2362_1416/master/2362.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7a1006225f6f5f483d9bbfca569b4713","title":"wendy mcmurdo best photograph girl bears museum","story":"‘The children kept asking the attendant: Are the bears alive or dead?’ I have always been interested in childhood and play, that unguarded space of imagination and reverie that children access so easily. In the 1990s, I started thinking about how children were engaging with gaming and the internet, which were still embryonic. So when I moved back to Edinburgh from London, I set about exploring how digital learning was being used in schools.The more time I spent in schools, the more I saw what children were actually doing. One of those things was museum visits – and it was clear that digital culture was greatly affecting museums too. So I spent a year trailing school parties taking guided tours around the Royal Museums of Scotland. I would secrete myself in a corner with my lights – this was in the days before cordless equipment – and shoot large groups quickly, then in post-production isolate single children. Here, you can see a split reflection of two girls in the vitrine, but only one of them actually looking.The memories you have of going to a museum are not of your classmates, they are of the objects. I remember the children speaking to the guards, often asking them: “Is it alive or is it dead?” They were five or six years old. The guard would hesitate, saying: “Well, it was alive and now it’s dead.” I can relate to that sense of anxiety. Even now at the zoo, if I’m standing too close to the lion enclosure, I feel nervous. It just appears too open, even though you know the animals cannot get out.The vitrines became a really important part of all the images. This one was an amazing display case in a Victorian gallery, with a glass cupola that gave beautiful overhead light. I remember visiting it myself as a child. On the other side of the bears, there was a Bengal tiger. We would line up to sit down on our little padded seats, inches away from this huge creature. Being in such close proximity to something like that was a strange, memorable experience. And that inidual experience is what I wanted to capture: a child engaging with something much larger than itself.These Victorian displays and dioramas were often quite ferocious and bloody, with animals ripping out each other’s gizzards. That kind of containment of emotion or feeling is a gift for a photographer.The children loved the bears and the birds most. There’s another image of an owl swooping on a taxidermied mouse with a little boy looking out to the camera in front of the case. And another of an impossibly huge albatross in a beautiful sculpted case. The images that worked best were those that played with scale: a very small child engaging with a very large object.I was thinking about children’s engagement with the outside world, especially in the face of the rapidly evolving culture of gaming and the screen. When I was that age, the museum was the place where everything important was held. Now with the internet, that is very different. If a child wants to learn about something, they don’t naturally go to the museum. They go online.This gallery no longer exists. Some of the objects have been brought out, cleaned up and displayed elsewhere, freed from the glass cases.

The postal service said it agreed with Citizens Advice that there was a “need for a different pricing structure” and added that it was finalising new fees.Royal Mail said: “We wrote to Citizens Advice last week, before the report was issued, to confirm that we will change the pricing structure of our popular redirections service away from a per surname basis or anything similar. We are currently working on the details of this new pricing structure and will share once finalised.”Royal Mail, however, insisted that its redirection packages offered “excellent value for money”, noting that a six-month direction works out at 30p a day.Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: “Many people rely on Royal Mail’s redirection service yet it’s designed for households of the past. Consumers are facing a double whammy.

Sébastien Maire, the city’s chief resilience officer, points to the school’s lower courtyard, a classic heat trap: surrounded by concrete walls that reflect sunlight inside. Last June, the courtyard hit 55C (131F).“For three days, school activities stopped,” Maire says. “It was not possible for the children to study, nor to go into the schoolyard. We would forbid them because it’s 55 degrees – you can fry an egg on the ground.”Maire explains how the courtyards at this school will be transformed: a green wall here, a vegetable planter there, expanded areas of shade and special drainable concrete surfaces that can absorb water when it rains. If all goes to plan, all of Paris’s 800 schools will be transformed into green spaces by 2040. The City of Paris plan is also being facilitated by 100 Resilient Cities (100RC), a project of the Rockefeller Foundation, which also supports  Cities. But if the trees and planters are uncontroversial, the next two steps of the scheme could prove more difficult for the city to sell. Maire first wants to open up these newly built green spaces to vulnerable people during heatwaves, and eventually wants the general public to enjoy them too – albeit outside school hours.“By 2050, we’ll have 800 cool spots in the city using school infrastructure,” he says, arguing that it is a better alternative than taking vulnerable people to supermarkets and churches. In Paris, which has the highest population density in Europe, no one lives more than 200 metres from a school, meaning the plan could dramatically increase access to green space for many residents.Lina Liakou, the regional director for Europe at 100RC, says of the new green spaces: “They don’t just address the environmental challenges, but also improve social cohesion and create a better environment for the people around them.”That holistic approach stemmed from an 18-month resilience-building process that the city underwent in collaboration with 100RC, attempting to think in a more interconnected way – not just focusing on climate after the Paris Agreement, but also “the social and inclusion issues that have so clearly impacted the city”, says Andrew Brenner, associate director of global communications at 100RC. “The fact that the city is looking at the oases as not climate interventions – tackling a singular challenge, in this case heat – but rather resilience interventions with multiple benefits, and elaborating that from the start, is a huge development.” Still, opening up Paris’s fortress-like schools to everyone is not an easy pitch in a city that remains on high alert. Terror attacks have killed 150 people since 2015. Heightened security measures make it difficult even for parents to access schools. Liakou says this part of the project has not yet been finalised. “It’s a challenge for the city of Paris, and we want to work with them and pressure them more,” she says.Maire is undeterred. He says the spaces will be kept safe and clean, and says no one will force a school to open its doors to the public if parents and teachers don’t agree to it.He points out that heatwaves have killed many more people in France than terrorism has: 580 people died in a single week of heat last year, and the European heatwave of 2003 killed 14,800. Maire also argues that bringing people together in school grounds is an essential part of making Paris more resilient to terrorism – setting himself in stark opposition to the French state.“They have been forbidding people to organise small things together because of terrorism: ‘You shouldn’t convene, you shouldn’t meet together, you’re going to be targets, so stay at home,’” Maire says. “But the resilient vision says, ‘If a crazy guy wants to commit something, we won’t be able to prevent it. Stop lying to the people.’”“Our concern is much more how society can face this and bounce back afterwards. What is the way? To know your neighbour, to do things with people. Not to be alone in front of your TV scared by terrorism, but to convene.” As for whether increasing green cover in schools can actually bring down temperatures across Paris, it’s still unclear. There is some evidence that making Paris greener can cool the city. In 2012, researchers from the French weather service simulated the 2003 heatwave against a number of adaptation scenarios. They found that turning every bit of bare land in the city of Paris into green space, including half of all pavements wider than 15 metres, could bring heatwave temperatures down by three to five degrees during the day.But that’s only if more than a thousand hectares of land turn green in the next few decades. Together, Paris’s schoolyards comprise just 80 hectares, and they won’t go completely green: École Riblette is keeping two of its yards asphalted so students can play sport.“Vegetation in schools is one step towards putting more vegetation in the city, which could have an overall microclimate effect and cool the entire city,” says Vincent Viguié, a research scientist at the International Research Centre on the Environment and Development. But he warns that even the best-case scenario isn’t good enough to take on Paris’s rapidly warming climate. “It’s nice, but it’s not sufficient.”Virué also points out that drainable concrete surfaces like the one proposed for École Riblette are less effective than grass lawns, which would reflect heat outwards instead of absorbing it. “When there is a heatwave, it doesn’t rain,” he says. “So to have porous bitumen doesn’t have such a big effect to cool the air.”In another pilot school for the project, heat sensors will be embedded in the ground to measure how the new surfaces respond to heatwaves.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/51ce67573b1e40e0f1009c325a357a50565d138f/0_232_4424_2655/master/4424.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=94f4fb3c83f7225349bc8f3836ce83b4","title":"railway fares rise privatisation commuters passengers","story":"The unmitigated failure of privatised railways is plain for all to see and passengers are the victimsRailways signal the state of a nation. Fast, clean, cheap, punctual trains make a country look well run: Mussolini and Hitler knew the potency of “making the trains run on time”. Any prime minister who puts Chris Grayling in charge, an ideological obsessive who destroys all he touches, is tone deaf to the national pulse.To make the point, one protester bought a car, taxed it, filled it with petrol and travelled from Bristol to Crouch End for less than the £218 full train fare, with £11 left over for lunch. People are spending one-fifth and more of their disposable incomes on season tickets, so these fare rises up-end super-fine calculations on the lower cost of a mortgage balanced against rising train fares with every mile travelled from centres of work. The missing ingredient is a reminder to business, forever whingeing about taxes, that unless the state carries their staff to work, low pay doesn’t cover fares. Dishonestly, the government uses the higher retail prices index to raise regulated fares and student loans, an index the Treasury and Bank of England declare “flawed” and “useless”, yet conveniently choose the lower consumer price index to keep pension and benefit rises low.Companies can spend £60m a year just to bid for franchises. That’s an administrative madness that far outstrips the old rightwing complaint against British Rail that it was a bureaucratic monolith synonymous with state-owned, shabby, producer-captured sluggishness. John Major may be a revered anti-Brexit hero now, but it was his personal ideological fixation that dreamed up dashing liveries for different companies, which he imagined steaming away in hot competition embodying the free market. But there’s precious little competition – instead passengers are stuck with empty choices.Meanwhile Network Rail scavenges for cash with a £1.5bn sell-off of railway arches harbouring 4,455 age-old businesses alongside new start-ups, going against every ethos of a state-owned company.Is nationalisation a magic bullet train? There are risks: will the Treasury invest enough or, as before, keep cutting back on capital? Will the unions hold more sway than passengers? The same basic dilemmas will remain – how much should the state spend on a minority mode of transport, when cars and buses take most people to work? Council funding for buses has halved since 2010, and 3,000 vital services have been cut. Three-quarters of goods travel by road, not rail.Can Labour for the first time offer a genuinely integrated transport system where at last everything links up? Imagining joined-up trains, buses, trams and bike-routes has been beyond all transport secretaries. Right now, no one is in charge, and that goes for virtually every department in Theresa May’s paralysed, swinging-in-the-wind regime.Trains do signify the fitness of a government. If an incoming Labour government concentrates hard on making trains run on time at fair fares, that would be a potent signal of all-round efficiency worth investing in heavily. But what perplexes me is the passivity of train-travelling commuters, among the most well-heeled, empowered of citizens. Yet apart from a minor kicking down of a gate in St Albans during the worst of the timetabling disaster, they fail to rebel. Along Southern’s lines, passing through nothing but top Tory MPs’ constituencies, passengers tolerate years of strikes and disruption, with more to come. Why aren’t they taking direct action, voting out their MPs and super-gluing ticket barriers? Ah, I forgot. The private companies get paid regardless of ticket income: only the state loses if people refuse to pay, another brilliant bit of contracting in these failed franchises."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2350c419d64c714384be5559c5d22607a430daae/0_169_5003_3002/master/5003.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7f1810e7dede19bc373e6de3068d1ce8","title":"stormzy oxbridge black student scholarships bame","story":"Stormzy is the people’s champion. In the past two years, he has proven himself to be one of the most committed public figures to furthering the interests of young black British people. He has made surprise appearances at youth sports days, access conferences and even singing at a funeral for a fan. From sponsoring Oxford University alumna Fiona Asiedu to take up a place at graduate school at Harvard, to launching the publishing imprint #MerkyBooks in partnership with Penguin, Stormzy has kept us on our toes, eagerly anticipating his next big move.This pattern of education-focused philanthropy follows on from Beyoncé’s Formation Scholarships, with funds directed towards sponsoring African American students to take up places at historically black universities and colleges and other celebrities such as Alicia Keys, Oprah Winfrey, Nas and Nicki Minaj who have financed college places. The message from black public figures has been transatlantic: black students are as deserving of places at elite establishments as their white counterparts, and economic and systematic barriers will be clawed down.However, whilst Stormzy deserves all credit for launching this initiative, the university itself should not be complacent about its need to commit and redouble its efforts in terms of access. On the day of the photoshoot, many of us were surprised to see the senior pro-vice-chancellor for education, Graham Virgo, attending and taking photos with us as a cohort. Don’t get me wrong, I was grateful for his presence and was pleased to have met him for the first time, but I couldn’t help but worry that this initiative was being co-opted as positive publicity for the university, particularly since black students and societies have struggled to get senior university figures to engage in discussing the problem of access.There has been a lot of media coverage about the lack of black students getting into Oxbridge. Cambridge African and Caribbean Society’s Black Men of Cambridge photo in 2017 highlighted that only 15 black male students had been accepted in the university’s 2015 intake, and freedom of information enquiries conducted by the Labour MP David Lammy have shown that only one in four Cambridge colleges made offers to Black British students every year in the period 2010-2015.Many assume that the universities are doing all they can to improve access, but fail to recognise the labour output of inidual students of colour who lead these initiatives. Oxford and Cambridge’s African and Caribbean Societies both host an annual access conference for A-level and International Baccalaureate students, Cambridge students Courtney Daniella and Chiedza Matsvai both run YouTube channels where they discuss the black student experience at Cambridge and implore students of colour to take up space at Oxbridge. The previous access officer of the students’ union, Olivia Hylton-Pennant, has committed herself to outreach projects, particularly through launching the first access conference exclusively for Caribbean students, who represent a single-digit annual intake from 2011-2016 (excluding 2015).This is not to say that the universities themselves have played no part in furthering access initiatives, and much credit should be given to schools liaison officers and public engagement teams. My own college, Pembroke, has been fantastic. As ethnic minorities officer, I was personally supported by the master when I elected to run a black and minority ethnic (BAME) open day, where he gave an inspiring speech on ersity and representation in the academy.However, we cannot continue to rely on the grace of iniduals for the issue of black students’ access to be taken seriously. It is not Stormzy’s responsibility to solve the problem of black student’s access, and it is not enough for the university to simply be grateful for the cash and kudos with no follow up-action. Cambridge needs to think about the experience that those students who take up the scholarship will have when they arrive. Increased funding and support for the students’ union, centralised access work for BAME students and direct support for black students in their own access work are necessary and overdue demands. How can the university celebrate black students being sponsored to attend if they still face a culture of racism, insufficient welfare structures, whitewashed curriculums, and an educational attainment gap?For me, Cambridge was definitely a struggle, and grappling with institutional failures to address the sometimes hostile environment for black students defined my time. However, to incoming black students and the forthcoming Stormzy scholars, be inspired to take action and contribute to an established tradition of black students pushing for change.

What once was a last chance saloon for students who didn’t get the grades is increasingly about offering students the chance to reassess. Have they chosen the right course at the right place to spend three to four years of their life? It can’t hurt to shop around for a better fit. Clearing officially starts on A-level results day, 16 August, although many universities will have already been advertising their vacancies and registering student applications from July. Thousands of universities will be looking to fill vacancies on courses that haven’t yet been filled, and will hand out offers with a fixed acceptance window – normally a day or two – to the first students they hear from who meet their requirements. Naturally, the most popular courses and the most prestigious universities tend to run out of places first – some as soon as the phone lines open on the day itself.Clearing is part of the\u0026nbspUcas\u0026nbspadmissions process matching students with unfilled places at universities and colleges.But there are plenty of options available this year, so even students holding a firm offer and feeling confident about their grades may be looking around. “When it came to initially choosing my firm and insurance offers on Ucas, I rushed,” says Katherine McLaughlin, who went through clearing last year despite hitting her grades. “I was swayed by other people’s opinions and the fact the university offered reduced grade boundaries if you chose it as your firm. Almost instantly, I knew I had made a mistake.”McLaughlin is now headed into her second year of criminology and social policy at Loughborough University. She needed the extra time between accepting her Ucas offers and clearing to realise that she didn’t want to study in a big city, and would rather be in a student town near big cities and Loughborough fitted the bill.But while clearing definitely offers a second chance, it’s important to start the day prepared – especially if you have an idea what you want. Emma Leech, director of marketing and advancement at Loughborough, points out that students accepted through clearing have higher dropout rates, possibly because they’ve rushed into making a choice or been influenced by non-essential factors. She adds that the clearing process will be better supported than ever this year. “We’re going to see phone lines opening earlier and earlier, more staff in call centres, lots more focus on other methods of getting in touch, and a big push in advance of clearing.”Bear in mind that clearing in 2018 won’t just be about students competing for places universities will also be competing for students. Leech warns there may be some “unethical practices” as a result, with offers of laptops, tablets and bus travel passes dangled in front of students. “Don’t go for shortcuts and things that glitter it’s student experience, outcomes, academic quality and provision that matter,” she adds.Olivia Capocci knew her A-levels hadn’t gone well enough to secure her law place, but one 10-minute call turned her fortunes around. Interview by Lucy Tobin“Results day at school felt like a surreal scene in a Hollywood film,” says 19-year-old Olivia Capocci. “Everyone who’d done well was outside jumping up and down, taking selfies and celebrating – and anyone who was disappointed, like me, was inside with parents and teachers. There were a few shocked faces, but most of us were trying hard to work out exactly what to do next.”Capocci, who’s from Gosforth in Newcastle upon Tyne, opened her A-level results envelope in the car outside school. “I got really stressed during exams and knew I hadn’t got the three As I needed for my offer to study law at the University of York. I didn’t want to find that out in front of everyone.” She had Bs in English literature and biology, and a C in chemistry, which meant she’d also missed out on her ABB insurance offer at the University of Liverpool.“I was a bit panicked because I’d worked my socks off – and when I phoned York, they immediately said no. The Liverpool phoneline was engaged, so I went into school to start tackling clearing.”Some groundwork ahead of results day helped. “Since I’d known my exams did not go to plan, I’d come up with a list of possible clearing options based on the ’s university league tables. Having that list helped calm my nerves.”She quickly scooped an offer to read law at Northumbria, but didn’t like the idea of staying in Newcastle for university. Then she finally got through to Liverpool’s clearing hotline. “They were fantastic on the phone, really calm and friendly, which was such a relief. The call only lasted 10 minutes, but at the end I was offered a place to study English literature.”It was a subject Capocci had been thinking of studying instead of law at the beginning of sixth form. “So I was over the moon – especially as the course allowed me to study law as a subsidiary in my first year, meaning I could still get a taste for the subject I’d originally picked to study.”Not everything was organised so quickly. “It took several stressful days to sort accommodation, but eventually I managed to get into one of the popular first-year halls,” Capocci adds. “Now I’ve settled in really well. I love the city, I’m really enjoying the course and I’m rowing too, training six days a week and travelling around the country for competitions.”To others facing clearing this year, Olivia advises: “Be flexible about your choice of subject - and city - and have back-up ideas if the grades don’t all go to plan.“Slipping a grade or two is not the end of the world – even if that’s how it feels when you’re staring at A-level results that you didn’t want to see. Clearing can be great – I couldn’t be happier with how mine turned out.”Danelle Cuffie’s A-level grades were lower than expected, but she landed a psychology place at the University of Bedfordshire through clearing. Now in her final year, she’s predicted a first After my results (DEE), I felt so disappointed I spent the first half of the day out shopping. My parents were comforting and supportive, though, and I knew that even if I hadn’t done well, I still had the academic ability to do a degree. I was still set on studying to become a psychologist, and I’d put a lot of pressure on myself to go on to higher education.I started ringing up other universities. I’d signed up for an email service from Ucas, which is how I heard Bedfordshire had places in psychology. It all happened quickly – I rang and spoke to an academic coordinator who was really welcoming. They asked me my English and maths GCSE grades – which were good – and then they made me an offer. I really liked the sound of the teaching style, and the course has exceeded my expectations. I’m planning to do a doctorate in educational psychology in 2019 – so I’ve still got a bit more studying to go.Failing to get my grades is the most valuable experience I’ve ever had. If you fall flat on your face, you can still pull yourself up – I’ve not allowed it to hold me back."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f9896a2b0a6f5b4a49e9a7174bb5af083085e98/276_288_6547_3929/master/6547.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f8f1056abbe385751e2920c14d789c46","title":"the guardians review xavier beauvois nathalie baye","story":"In Xavier Beauvois’ fierce, compassionate drama, the first world war casts a terrible shadow over a farming community The gender ide of this movie, and its whole point, are clearer in the original French title: Les Gardiennes, the female s, the women who worked the land in France during the first world war. This richly compassionate, fiercely acted and beautifully shot period drama is about the second conflict, the battle of wills on the home front, as its characters struggle to maintain a family farm in the Deux-Sèvres region of western France.A way of life, with its Hardyesque seasonal rhythms of sowing and reaping, is minutely, sumptuously depicted. But all the time in the background – in the letters home, in the muttered hints of the grim-faced men on leave and their shellshocked dreams – is the horror of war. Those seasonal rhythms come to include regular visits from officials with telegrams.s is directed by Xavier Beauvois, terrifically shot by cinematographer Caroline Champetier, and adapted by Beauvois, Frédérique Moreau and the film’s editor Marie-Julie Maille from a 1924 novel by Ernest Pérochon, the teacher, Goncourt-winning author and first world war veteran who in 1940 refused to collaborate with the Vichy regime, had his books banned and finally died of a heart attack brought on by the stress of daily Gestapo harassment.Nathalie Baye gives a performance of effortless authority as the widowed Madame Hortense, the matriarch who must impose her will on the running of the farm. Her daughter Solange (played by Baye’s real-life daughter Laura Smet) is her most important worker, given that her father-in-law Henri (played by non-professional Gilbert Bonneau) is too elderly to do much. Smet plays Solange as a passionate woman who, like her mother, has accepted the patriotic duty of reining in her emotions. Her husband Clovis (Olivier Rabourdin) comes home from the front, angry at the hypocrisy and cruelty of war. The Germans, he tells them all, are just like them: workers, husbands, fathers.This is not quite what Solange’s enlisted brothers have to say on their visits home. Constant (Nicolas Giraud) is a decorated officer, a teacher in civilian life who, on an appearance in the classroom, listens with faintly pained reserve to his pupils eagerly reciting in his honour a poem attacking the “Boches” (Krauts). Most importantly, there is Georges (Cyril Descours), who is perhaps his mother’s favourite: she comes alive in his presence as she does not with Constant, and it is Georges’s longed-for visits that put into motion the film’s tragedy.Hortense has just hired a new worker, Francine, played by newcomer Iris Bry, who instantly impresses with her hard work and cheerful attitude. Georges is clearly smitten with the pretty, charming Francine they agree to write to each other when he returns to the front, and watchful Hortense is not displeased with this turn of events. She can imagine this young woman as a permanent addition to the household and even as a daughter-in-law. But Francine is an outsider, and the courtship enrages Marguerite (Mathilde Viseux), a longtime intimate of the family who had regarded herself as his intended. And then the Americans turn up: swaggeringly handsome young soldiers who are the source of terrible sexual tension and cause Hortense to make a dreadful mistake. Francine is to become a living victim of war.The beauty and the pathos of the film are vivid in every frame. Most unbearable is the shot in which Constant says his farewells before returning to the war and walks away from the farm up a shady country lane that leads back to the station: he turns and waves, framed by the trees, his brave, open face lit by a heartbreakingly good-natured smile. The terrible omen is obvious.Then there is the remarkable scene in which Georges takes Francine into the forest, which is part of the family’s estate – a magical place made even more mysterious by the standing stones there, which, incidentally, are a further reminder of Tess of the D’Urbervilles and Stonehenge. The stones’ presence imbues that whole place with something profoundly moving and erotic, and the woodland itself consecrates the love between Georges and Francine.The years are flashed up on screen as the time goes by: the harrowingly important years of 1914 and 1918, but then, without any great fanfare, we get 1919 and 1920. There is no war’s-over scene with dancing in the streets – or farmyard.

The group operates the International Champions Cup, the world’s largest summer club tournament. Barcelona and Real Madrid faced each other in the tournament in Miami last year.La Liga gave few details on the planned regular-season game. The league president, Javier Tebas, however, dismissed the possibility of taking the clásico away from Spain. The league said it is still making arrangements for the game and though there is no timetable for when it will happen, it could be this season.The Spanish league has been trying to expand internationally for some time, hoping to grow and keep pace with the Premier League in England. Tebas last year also talked about the league possibly playing a regular-season match in China, and a few days ago the Spanish Super Cup was held in Tangier, Morocco, the first time it has been played outside Spain. “Joining with Relevent to create La Liga North America is a major milestone in our international expansion strategy,” Oscar Mayo, the league’s international development director, said. “This agreement ensures not only a bright future for soccer in North America, but also for La Liga and our clubs.”The league added: “The operation will support the league’s growth in the US and Canada through consumer-related activities including youth academies, development of youth soccer coaches, marketing agreements, consumer activations, exhibition matches and plans to have an official La Liga Santander match played in the US.”A decade ago, the Premier League tried to introduce an additional international match but plans for each team to play a 39th game overseas were abandoned amid opposition from Fifa and fan groups.The Premier League has more exposure than its Spanish counterpart in the US, in part because of a six-year TV deal with NBC worth about $1bn. Since 2012, the Spanish league has been on beIN Sports, which was received by fewer than a quarter of American English-language television households before it was recently dropped by the Comcast Xfinity cable system.Relevent was founded and is owned by Miami Dolphins owner Stephen Ross, who called the partnership “the next giant leap in growing soccer’s popularity in North America”. He added: “This unique relationship will create new opportunities for millions of North American soccer fans to experience the most passionate, exciting, and highest level of soccer in the world.”The Spanish league called the agreement “an inflection point for soccer in the US and Canada”, coming in anticipation of the 2026 World Cup that will be hosted in North America."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/271300e7ee30672b32c49c990d20f9b07bac23fa/0_106_3070_1842/master/3070.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=503f3e44b4f6133693dbb6256e4691f7","title":"pleas alisher usmanov riches big six glasgow united","story":"Careful what you wish for Newcastle and Everton fans – more competition could stave off a European Super League, but forward-thinking billionaires may find other corners to cutIt’s a good thing that Alisher Usmanov is not, so far as we can tell, Sacha Baron Cohen in disguise. Otherwise there would be no telling what kind of abominations the ostensible Russian billionaire could get needy football fans to commit in return for a hint of investment in their club.Since last week’s announcement that Usmanov is selling his stake in Arsenal to Stan Kroenke – and thus will soon have another £550m testing the strength of his finely tailored pockets – inidual supporters of various clubs have been publicly appealing for salvation from the Russian moneygod, boasting of their clubs’ proud histories and limitless potentials while trying not to appear offputtingly desperate, although hooked is exactly how a lot of clubs’ owners like their customers – oops! – supporters to be.But, the way Bloomberg tell it, the Almighty Tease added that he is also a fan of Bayern Munich, Roma and Milan. We may need to get Susie Dent in to discuss definitions of “fan”.Usmanov, let’s deduce, is one of those prospective owners who is a fan of any club from which he could make money. Invoking “good potential returns” does not appear to have turned anyone off as there is a belief that the Premier League is such a financial wonderland that astute investors can splurge fortunes on players and still reap profits by conjuring success and satisfying their custofans.The Russian portrayed himself as a champion of that model during his 11 years as a big but frustrated investor in Arsenal – he was never allowed on to the board and complained in 2017 that he was still “isolated from decision-making” five years after publicly castigating the club’s rulers for selling Robin van Persie to Manchester United and pursuing a strategy that “does not allow our great manager to fully realise his managerial talent and deliver success for the fans”.Moshiri’s spending at Everton so far suggests he buys into that model. And if Usmanov joined forces up with him anew, even neutrals may cheer their attempt to expand the Premier League’s Big Six, especially if it were motivated partly by a lust for vengeance on Arsenal. An entertaining alternative might be to buy Tottenham Hotspur, injecting fresh zeal into the north London derby. Barnet or Boreham Wood would have greater scope for Trading Places-style japes but would be much longer-term projects for the 64-year-old Usmanov.Timing, then, favours investment in Everton. Or Newcastle. Or Southampton. Or Leeds or Middlesbrough or West Brom. Or anyone who, with a big cash boost, could progress quickly enough to ridicule the future that Arsène Wenger foretold in one of his last press conferences as Arsenal manager, when he warned that a European super league is nigh and will relegate domestic championships to secondary status. “In a few years you will certainly have a European league over the weekends,” he said. “It is inevitable.”Wenger’s reasoning was that top European clubs are aghast at dwindling interest in the Champions League group stages and attribute the decline to the fact that matches are midweek and still feature too many small and medium-sized clubs. Yes, too many S and M clubs when what the public crave at weekends is more clashes of XL outfits. And “public” means the people watching on Facebook in Santiago or on a phone in Guangzhou. So big European clubs will form their own championship, forcing domestic leagues into midweek slots. “If you have Real v Barça or Real v Arsenal or Manchester v Bayern Munich every week, the audiences will be good,” Wenger explained. Big clubs would still compete nationally but probably view the domestic front as an after-thought or a testing ground, like the Carabao Cup.Wenger was only saying what he had heard others saying. Perhaps Kroenke has heard similar chat. Arsenal are one of three members of the Premier League’s Big Six to be owned by Americans well versed in the NFL and the policy of chasing audiences and minimising the sort of risk that exists when six clubs compete for four Champions League spots. He could probably see the sense in a cosy league for Europe’s aristocrats. Would localised gripes and decades of heritage stand in his way?No doubt the owners of Wolves, Fulham, West Ham, Leicester and others have heard the talk, too. Has their recent spending been about earning an invitation when the European super league arrives? If they carry on, it could sure make it hard to distinguish the Premier League’s Big Six when that time comes. So let’s enjoy this lavish scrambling while it lasts. And then let’s see how long a breakaway league lasts with neglected roots.As for Usmanov or any forward-thinking billionaire at a loose end, maybe get ahead by buying both Sheffield clubs and forming one Super Sheffield club, ready for the continent’s call. Or procure both Ipswich Town and Norwich City to form a single Folk Club. Or look to Scotland and snap up both Old Firm sides to enter them in a European league as Glasgow United, creating a fearsome sporting ogre while eradicating years of sectarian animosity at a stroke. That’s definitely what would happen.Or maybe Usmanov should pre-empt matters by first investing in a stadium – a mobile one that could be towed from city to city and country to county, the amphibious home of a team of headhunted all-stars who would take on the cream of Europe wherever the market demanded, or wherever the wind blew them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0e0271d57ae9456dc90b056a259c91cc7e8ec94/0_301_5352_3211/master/5352.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=485c7a6439221cb639cf647d021d7a0e","title":"super cup reaction and celtics champions league exit football weekly extra","story":"Max Rushden and co on Atlético’s win over Madrid, European woe for Celtic and Bristol Rovers’ dubious half-time entertainmentRate, review, share on Apple Podcasts, Soundcloud, Audioboom, Mixcloud, Acast and Stitcher, and join the conversation on Facebook, Twitter and email.

Here are a few of themOf all the players who seemed to play football with a passion and joie de vivre, Batistuta seemed among the most passionate and joiest de vivrest. Those lusty shots, those screaming celebrations, those goals. But, it seems, he wasn’t especially keen on football. “I do not like football, it is just my profession,” he once said in an interview with Argentinian TV.The man who helped Batistuta write his autobiography seemed to confirm this. “He is not like other players,” Alessandro Rialti told the Sunday Times in 1999. “Once he leaves the stadium, he doesn’t want football encroaching upon the rest of his life. When we were doing the book, he came to my office and for five full days he spoke about his family and his life in Argentina. But when it came to the football and his career, he switched off. ‘The records are there,’ he said. ‘You can look them up.’” When Blackburn had a reunion of their 1994-95 Premier League title-winning side in 2015, only one member of the squad didn’t turn up. Since retiring in 2004, Batty has broadly gone off grid, not keen to join in the traditional carousel of punditry and personal appearances. This is just a man happy to live his life, not let his career dominate his existence.The extent to which Batty actively disliked football is perhaps exaggerated by his absence from the game. In this interview with The City Talking he says a few times how much he loved certain aspects of football, but every now and then reminders of a man who kept the game in perspective – too much perspective, if anything – pop up. Like this description of international football: “When you make your debut for England, at the very beginning, it’s the pinnacle of your career … and then it just becomes normal. Yeah, you play in the World Cup, but it’s still just another game in a different country.” So perhaps this was closer to a healthy detachment. “I was always a home bird, so I’d go play and then I just loved getting home,” he said. “That never changed. At the World Cup, as soon as we got in the changing rooms after the shootout, I was looking forward to getting home and seeing my kids – so football didn’t matter. I could detach. I’d give my all. And then that was me finished with football.” It’s still strangely taboo for footballers to admit they’re just doing this for the money. Like various art forms, for some reason people still expect them to be driven by a higher purpose: because lots of people like playing football, and would like to be footballers, the idea that actual footballers should thus ignore the broader concerns of earning as good a living as they can is weirdly still common.Assou-Ekotto wasn’t afraid of admitting his primary motivation, though. “If I play football with my friends back in France, I can love football,” he told the  in 2010. “But if I come to England, where I knew nobody and I didn’t speak English … why did I come here? For a job. A career is only 10, 15 years. It’s only a job. Yes, it’s a good, good job and I don’t say that I hate football but it’s not my passion. “You read the paper, it’s like a movie,” he continued. “Very bizarre … only in England. That’s why football is not my passion because when you are professional, the world of football is not good.” At the 1998 World Cup, before Italy faced France in the quarter-finals, a group of French journalists asked Vieri who his childhood idol was. “Allan Border,” came the reply, to bemused faces. Vieri was born in Bologna but raised in Sydney, which is where Border – rather than Paolo Rossi, Bruno Conti or Toto Schillaci – became his idol, and cricket his first love. “To be honest I wasn’t very good at football,” he said. “I loved cricket and when I started making some big scores for my boys’ team, I dreamed of becoming the next Border.” Quite a handy player in his youth, he might even have made a decent professional cricketer, but the practicalities of playing the game in Italy and, to be frank, the remuneration on offer made football a more viable option. “I would have loved to have been a cricketer,” he said in 2003. “I was telling a friend last week, I would stop playing now to play cricket if I could get the same contract. I was a bit of an all-rounder at school.” Football’s arrogance is such that we assume everyone regards it as the absolute pinnacle, but this is a man who, in an ideal world, would simply rather be doing something else. Many can probably sympathise with that. People think football is fun because they remember having fun playing it as a kid. Or, they have fun in their Sunday league team, or at their weekly five-a-side. But, when you listen to the way some who have played professionally talk about it, the game sounds like more trouble than it’s worth. People like Baardsen, for example, the former Spurs and Watford goalkeeper who retired aged 25 before going on to work as a fund manager. Speaking to the Observer in 2008, he said: “You wouldn’t think a person working in the city could say this, but I’m more relaxed, five kilos lighter, fitter and healthier than I was at the end of my football career. Football is stressful, try playing in front of 40,000 crazy football supporters who are happy or sad for their whole weekend depending on how you perform. Never mind all the people criticising you on TV.”It might be stretching things a bit to say Bale doesn’t like football. Playing, he’s very much on board with: his keenness when it comes to international football, particularly in comparison to some previous high-profile Welsh players, is proof enough. When he’s not on the pitch though, he’s not so fussed. While players such as Jamie Carragher and Thierry Henry were famous for watching as many games as they could feasibly fit into their schedules, Bale would rather do other things with his time. “I don’t really watch much football,” he said to ESPN earlier this year. “I’d rather watch the golf to be honest.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/14f7f46d935b84e23455f4d4d49b0969f3f1a719/0_0_3462_2077/master/3462.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=859a82ce28aca4e2be2ec004158592cb","title":"she insulted my manhood turkey faces fresh scrutiny lgbt rights","story":"In a country where violence against gay people is often excused on grounds of unjust provocation, the fatal shooting of a trans woman has caused renewed fear Simge Avcı loved practical jokes, says her roommate Bahar, recalling how her friend would giggle after pretending to spill the contents of an empty teapot on her startled victims.Bahar (not her real name), 25, had lived with Avcı for seven years in Samsun, a small, sleepy city on the Black Sea coast of Turkey.On 13 July, the roommates went out for a long breakfast with Avcı’s boyfriend, Mecit Sezer, and her mother. They chatted as they ate and later went to a local pool to combat the sweltering heat. “It was a normal day,” says Bahar. The group parted company at about 7pm. Less than five hours later, Avcı was shot in the stomach and died. Sezer, her boyfriend of six months, has been arrested, but not charged. Sezer has reportedly claimed that Avcı “insulted his manhood”.Bahar and Avcı are both trans women. At 24, Avcı had just started her transition. She was excited about getting surgery, and being able to live fully and honestly with her family. Once the home of one of the largest LGBT pride marches in the wider region, in recent years there has been a growing backlash against the community in Turkey. Pride marches were banned four years ago. People who have taken to the streets have been met with teargas and violent dispersals.In 2017 all public LGBT events in Ankara, the capital, were banned. Earlier this month, the head of Turkey’s public broadcaster TRT said that Turkey would not rejoin Eurovision if it continued to have contestants like “the bearded Austrian in the skirt” – in reference to 2014’s winner, Conchita.“There’s this constant emphasis on one nation, one religion, one ethnicity. Everything is consolidated around this uniformity of what it means to be a Turkish citizen who deserves to live,” says Asli Zengin, an LGBT activist and visiting professor at Brown University’s anthropology department.Transgender women are especially vulnerable to violence. Discrimination means it can be difficult to find jobs many are forced into sex work to survive, putting them at even greater risk. Institutionally, the court system is stacked against them. Under Turkish law an “unjust provocation” can lower sentences. In cases of violence against transgender women, men will often say they did not know the woman was trans and, like Sezer, that she “insulted their manhood” as evidence for an “unjust provocation”.“Often, judges use their discretion to interpret the whole interaction between a transgender woman and a cisgender man – and their sexual intercourse – as a trigger of unjust provocation,” explains Zengin.Yasemin Öz, a Turkish LGBT rights activist and lawyer, says the number of judges willing to accept an “insult to manhood” as a reason for an unjust provocation defence has decreased over the years, as LGBT lawyers and activists have worked on more of these cases. Nevertheless, it remains potent: in a recent case, the killers of a gay Syrian refugee murdered in 2016 were given a reduced sentence on grounds of “unjust provocation”. In places like Samsun, where there are no LGBT organisations advocating for the rights of the local community, the situation is even more insecure. “It all depends on the attitude of the judge, unfortunately,” says Öz. “But where there are no LGBT organisations, the attitude change can be slower.”Istanbul, Ankara and Izmir all have multiple LGBT organisations that provide legal and social support to the community. Samsun is a quiet, traditional city in a part of the country that has consistently voted for the conservative ruling party AKP.Deniz, 25, a trans woman who did not want to reveal her last name, says some trans women in Samsun do not like to leave the house. “If someone has long hair and breasts as a trans woman, they’re excluded from society,” she says. Deniz recently stopped taking hormones and cut her hair so she could pass more easily on the street. Her family does not accept her as a trans woman, and she says she doesn’t feel safe going outside while presenting as female.In contrast, Avcı’s family accepted her, and were able to help her financially. Her friends are full of anecdotes about her generosity. “If she saw someone on the street, she would give them 100 Turkish lira,” recalls Can, a 22-year-old trans woman and friend of Avcı’s.“There is this sense of masculinity, which feels entitled to anything,” says Zengin. “Impunity is becoming the norm … it’s not only transgender murders, but also cis women whose murders have reached a statistically high number in Turkey.” In Samsun, this feeling is visceral. After Avcı’s death the community was in shock. “We wondered if this is how we’re going to die in the end,” says Can. For many in the LGBT community, the atmosphere in Samsun is now tinged with fear. Avcı’s death has made the dangers starker.“I feel alone now,” says Bahar. “We’d understand each other just by looks, not even through talking. We were together every day … I can’t express it. I still don’t believe that it’s real, I still don’t believe she’s gone.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac7c0ab042230838c3bf83754ed7765793fbfb6d/0_6_1654_992/master/1654.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cd0e449f1469bb25f36ead5777af238c","title":"good nights sleep cure loneliness","story":"New studies have shown that sleep deprivation can make people feel lonely – and social isolation can disrupt sleep. It is vital to break the vicious cycleHere is a new problem to keep you awake at night: could sleep deprivation be affecting your social life? Not in the sense that you’re too tired to go out – although it could mean that, too – but could your very sleeplessness be off-putting to other people?In another experiment, 1,000 people were asked to rate photographs of people – some in a sleep-deprived state – according to how socially attractive they seemed. The sleep-deprived people came off worse. And the researchers concluded that sleep-related alienation could “trigger the transmission of loneliness” – after viewing clips of sleep-deprived people, otherwise healthy and happy participants then felt lonelier.“We humans are a social species. Yet sleep deprivation can turn us into social lepers,” said Matthew Walker, a professor of psychology and neuroscience and the senior author of the study, who wrote the bestselling book Why We Sleep. “The less sleep you get, the less you want to socially interact. In turn, other people perceive you as more socially repulsive, further increasing the grave social-isolation impact of sleep loss. That vicious cycle may be a significant contributing factor to the public health crisis that is loneliness.”Last year, a study of 2,000 young adults by researchers at King’s College London found lonelier people had poorer-quality sleep, were more likely to feel tired and had more difficulty focusing on tasks during the day than those who didn’t report feeling lonely. “It could be that feeling you’re all on your own in the world, a fundamentally unsafe feeling, could make it difficult to have a restful night’s sleep,” says Timothy Matthews, a research associate at the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience at King’s College London. “And that, in turn, could mean you’re not at your best and you don’t get the best out of your social interactions, which could increase feelings of loneliness.”There could be an evolutionary element, he says. “Some scientists believe that loneliness is part of our evolutionary heritage, because our ancestors would stick together in groups in order to succeed. If you have an aversion to being cut off from the group, that would have served an adaptive purpose. If you feel you’re alone, that’s comparable to feeling unsafe. The world seems a more threatening place and that perception could make it difficult to have a more restful sleep because you’re more on guard for your safety.”Could it be useful for people to keep in mind that poor sleep could be a reason for their feelings of loneliness? “Loneliness is really complex and you can’t put it down to one thing,” she says. “I think we would say it would be a factor, but we’d need to look at other factors, too.” Things such as health problems and economic status “are big factors in loneliness. If you have ill-health or you are worried about money, that is probably going to keep you up, so it can all become part of this vicious cycle.”But for some people experiencing loneliness, the idea that poor-quality sleep can be improved, and can reduce their social isolation, may be a wake-up call."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc27adf384ac9bdafc8054c73b28ea3aa199c4c8/0_1310_2912_1747/master/2912.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=94f5b069f5b9c5fbdbc8220a34222d63","title":"classical album of the week stravinsky persephone review beautifully modulated drama","story":"Radiant beauty is not a quality that is automatically associated with Stravinsky’s music. But in Perséphone, the “melodrama” for tenor, female narrator, chorus, children’s chorus and large orchestra that he completed in 1934 to a text by André Gide, he composed one of the most radiant and lyrically beautiful scores to be found anywhere in 20th-century music. It’s one of Stravinsky’s greatest achievements, and alongside his opera-oratorio Oedipus Rex, one of the high points of his neoclassical period, though perhaps because of the forces it requires and its curious hybrid nature – part ballet, part cantata – performances and recordings have always been rare.Perséphone was written for the dancer Ida Rubinstein, who had already commissioned Stravinsky’s Tchaikovsky-based ballet Le Baiser de la Fée six years earlier. Rubinstein both danced and spoke the title role at the Paris premiere, which was not well received. Gide’s text puts a Christian spin on Homer’s original story instead of being abducted and raped by Pluto, Perséphone goes down to Hades of her own volition, out of pity for the lost souls of the underworld. But the text is a discursive patchwork of short episodes, and Gide also objected to the way in which Stravinsky set his jewelled words the two parted with the composer accusing the writer of “a complete absence of rapport, which obviously originated in your attitude.”But the extraordinary thing about Perséphone is how the score as a whole utterly transcends the dramatic shortcomings of the text, as well as its own stylistic unevenness. There’s choral writing and narrative passages for the solo tenor, who takes the role of the priest Eumolpus, that seem both to hark back to the French classicism of Gluck and to echo elements of the Russian Orthodox liturgy, alongside other moments that almost recall Offenbach and even Massenet.As Esa-Pekka Salonen’s beautifully modulated performance demonstrates, however, those inconsistencies do not matter at all when the music is unfolded with such meticulous attention to detail. Nothing is forced, and all the elements, sung, played and spoken, are integrated so carefully. Salonen conducted the score in London two years ago with the same tenor soloist, Andrew Staples, and the same Francophone narrator, Pauline Cheviller, as on this recording, which stems from a concert performance at the Finnish National Opera in Helsinki a year ago. There are moments when the sound of the orchestra seems recessed slightly too far behind the voices, but every morsel of detail in the scoring, which uses a large orchestra with chamber music-like fastidiousness, is there, and glowing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c052c4d409e29bbb9073b883ee13602262f0deab/0_399_2101_1260/master/2101.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dbf6a7e354597e9224bf31fd4928c1fb","title":"every one of madonnas 78 singles ranked","story":"To honour the best-selling female artist of all time on her 60th birthday, we’ve rated all her full single releasesEven creators of brilliant pop can go wrong.

While rapping.A half-annoying, half-brilliant EDM career manifesto, positing Madonna as Duracell bunny: “When the lights go down and there’s no one leftI can go on and on and on”.In a world of “too many questions”, “distractions” and “options”, love was Madonna’s saving grace in 2003. The tune begins labouredly, but digs in.Madonna’s six months of vocal training before Evita reveal new capacities for feeling here. But sorry, Lloyd Webber – it’s no Live To Tell.1987 soundtrack signature song, lifted by a curious, featherlight chorus line. As Balearic moments go, La Isla Bonita was better.Madonna’s babyish 1940s-style vocals, filtered to sound like they’re wavering through a wireless, still crackle with charm.Written by Madonna for her co-writer Patrick Leonard’s nine-year-old daughter, this song’s moments of twisted childhood psychedelia lessen the schmaltz.Madonna usually makes others’ styles sound like her own. This Björk co-write, gorgeously hypnotic as it is, sounds too much like Björk.Co-written with 80s fist-pumping emotional supremo David Foster (Peter Cetera’s Glory of Love, the St Elmo’s Fire soundtrack). It tries hard, and snags.One of the US Parental Advisory Committee’s original “Filthy 15” banned songs. Today, its mentions of velvet kisses over a body are gently erting.Madonna’s best performance in Evita, in the 1996 film’s brand new Webber-and-Rice composition. The quaking desperation in her vocal stays the right side of emotional.An awkward, pleasingly punky track for the Matthew Modine wrestling film Vision Quest. Reached No 4 in Madonna’s chart-gobbling summer of 1985.A quiet, gospel-dazzled jewel from American Life, written by Guy Sigsworth (Seal, Björk, Goldie) and Welsh singer-songwriter Jem.A simple meditation on LA’s golden district, anchored on a fantastic Roland bassline and a reflective sun-dappled guitar.Widescreen, affecting nostalgia from the soundtrack to the underrated women’s baseball film, A League of Their Own. Madonna played the wise-cracking Mae.“Drunk by six” and smoked too many cigarettes? Madonna’s singing your song, a well-honed, slow piece of pop theatre.Over propulsive early-90s electronica, Madonna tells us she’s “drowningBaby, throw out your rope”. Her delivery suggests she’ll save herself.Before being signed, Madonna was a New York no-waver (and Thurston Moore’s neighbour). You hear delicious hints of that here.The atmospheric verses to this mid-90s ballad look towards Madonna’s Ray of Light masterpieces. Cigarette lighters in the air are optional.Proof that Madonna can still do classically simple pop singles nearly four decades into her career. This is bright, glossy and fun.Well-tailored, retro-positioned pop that’s aged remarkably well. Written as a wide-eyed Valentine for Madonna’s then-husband, Sean Penn.Heavenly ode to early motherhood, released when Madonna’s daughter Lourdes was two. Occasionally, honesty cuts through: “When she’s awakeI’m up all night”.A failed relationship turned into compellingly cinematic orchestral drama, co-written with R\u0026ampB producer Babyface.From its effortlessly English sample of Charlotte Gainsbourg’s voice in the 1993 film The Cement Garden, this sounds like a Saint Etienne song accidentally covered by a superstar.Madonna’s first big pop ballad, showing the world she could do more than provocative pop. Slightly soupy, but still sweet.Timbaland’s synth-brass intro here is fantastic, and the song’s end-of-the-world grandeur still sounds razor-sharp. Would be better without Justin Timberlake, though.A gorgeously slinky, impish love song to Madonna’s then-boyfriend, film runner Andy Bird. The affair ended quickly, but the song endures.Sultry, persuasive R\u0026ampB with a Spanish guitar undertow. Madonna’s deep vocals cleverly never disclose what her baby’s secret actually is.Adapted by Madonna from a country song written by her brother-in-law, Joe Henry, its catchiness pivoting off that brilliantly strange, fractured guitar figure.Stuttering into life like a long-lost Tom Tom Club single, before introducing us to a new brand of pop attitude. Everybody demanded we dance.A hit glowing with summer, throwing in early Balearic-era guitars, and some delicious winks and nods to the Latin pop market.One of Ray of Light’s many powerful sub-aquatic electronic ballads. Co-written with Rick Nowels, later a Lana Del Rey and Lykke Li collaborator.Lush strings and bassy pianos on this classy 1989 primal scream. Hugely emo, parent-baiting lyrics, but gorgeous in its execution.A classy post-Vogue excursion into 90s R\u0026ampB. Stabs of house piano and synthesised strings propel us brilliantly into Madonna’s cavern of love.A starlit, star-brightened nursery rhyme that flutters gently into life, before becoming the first properly polished, distinctively Madonna-sounding pop song.Credit and interest are reappropriated playfully as metaphors in Madonna’s career-changing hit. Till-ringing pop hooks were never so much fun to play with again.Launching off from a West End Girls synthesiser sound (Madonna told Stuart Price “I fucking love the Pet Shop Boys” when she recognised the nod), this is a slice of Confessions pop perfection.Twisting the agonies of heartbreak into a song about hope for the future, this track’s pulsing house piano, gospel vocals and boxfresh Diplo production sound fantastic.More filter-sweeping gorgeousness from the mid-2000s. “Do you believe in love at first sight?  It’s an illusion, I don’t care,” she sings, thrillingly.Male-run record labels appropriated the V-word, but female pop stars didn’t, before Madonna, unless they were singing Christmas carols. Madonna reclaimed it, and then some.Childlike innocence rushes through the Like a Prayer album, but while Dear Jessie smothered itself in schmaltz, Cherish was all impish, forthright joy.Best-of extra tracks are rarely as dreamily sexy as this, adapted from a love letter sung to Lenny Kravitz by Prince collaborator Ingrid Chavez.In the midst of its parent album’s panting obviousness, Rain was Erotica’s most properly erogenous moment. The rain builds slowly, then pours, its “dark clouds bursting in a perfect sky”. Madonna’s vocals teem with longing too, first sounding full of hope, then full of welcome, moving to release.A song either about the power of dancing, or about a girl begging her boy to get into her groove sexually, as it were, to cement their relationship (“touch my body  move in time  now I know you’re mine”). Or both. It doesn’t matter. The whole confection’s irresistible.A rousing Rebel Heart single set after the apocalypse about the power of love. In it, a woman gives a man the fire, cover and light that he needs – a nice twist in a world turned to dust. Inspired by growing religious and political intolerance, Madonna’s lyrics and a skyscraping melody pack punches.Madonna’s best excursion into the sounds of hip-hop and R\u0026ampB, sampling the bassline from What You Need by USCanadian trio Main Source, with Dave Hall (Mary J Blige, Mariah Carey) as her co-writer. Contains some killer lines, both sneered or whispered: “I’m not your bitch  Don’t hang your shit on me”.Madonna’s a good agony aunt when it comes to men. “Put your love to the test”, she advises, not that she means trying out his satin sheets (“what happens when you’re not in bed?”, she adds sensibly). Get someone emotionally available, who can “lift you to your higher ground”. Horns and synths joyously fanfare this advice.A fabulous ascending-then-descending bassline bolsters one of Madonna’s most club-ready songs. Its lyric is also one of her most unforgiving, reprimanding a serial apologist. “You’re not half the man you think you are,” she sings, before her knockout blow arrives a verse later. “There’s more important things than hearing you speak.”Majestic, reflective and sung in a subdued style for Madonna, this meditation on fame with a Ballardian reference in its title soars quietly and gorgeously.“I had so many loversWho settled for the thrillOf basking in my spotlight,” float her words, without emotion. Then the most desperate lie arrives, sadder than anything: “I never felt so happy.”One of Madonna’s sparkliest imperial-period pop singles. It plays today like a pitch to those still not then believing in her: “I’ve had to work much harder than thisFor something I want, don’t try to resist me.” Escape was impossible anyway, we discover. “Don’t try to runI can keep up with you.”A glorious update of the blissfully simple sentiments of Holiday and Everybody, infused with a Daft Punk-like robotic swagger, courtesy of Mirwais’ production. Its unlikely inspiration was Madonna’s attendance at a Sting gig: she was moved at how physically his songs connected his fans. Bonus points for the way she sings “bourgeoisie”.Probably the best thing Madonna’s done in cinema, despite the mediocrity of the film that it’s from (At Close Range, directed by James Foley, who would later shoot Fifty Shades Darker and Fifty Shades Freed). Madonna’s lyrics for the bridge were written on the spot, giving the song’s incredible, stark atmosphere even more stunning, bruised drama.Written by the disco group Pure Energy and turned down by Phyllis Hyman and the Supremes’ Mary Wilson, Madonna and Jellybean Benitez’s take on this blissfully simple four minutes of summer has never lost its freshness or warmth. That stuttering bassline and those Latin drums help. Madonna played cowbell.Dark, orchestral ambient is a mood at which Madonna excels. Frozen marries the different temperatures of 90s pop stunningly: the faltering chill of William Orbit’s electronica with the dusty, cinematic heat of North African melodies and strings. The extremes are fair enough. Madonna’s character’s attempting the melting of a heart, after all.Made quickly as a B-side for Dick Tracy single Keep It Together, Vogue updated Salsoul disco brilliantly for the end of the century. It also made gay culture celebratory again after the crushing Aids decade (“everywhere you turn is heartacheit’s everywhere that you go”). It became the A-side soon enough.That title, and this whole glorious song, teem with imperative instructions to the older generation by the mid-80s Madonna’s time had truly come. Determination pulses in her no-nonsense vocals – her character’s going to keep her baby, she’s made up her mind – while that glorious string arrangement adds cinematic authority to an all-too-relatable, everyday drama.Curtis Muldoon’s 1972 album track Sepheryn sounds like a track destined for a Nuggets-style noughties’ psych-folk anthology. But after Madonna heard William Orbit’s demo of the track with singer Christine Leach, she adapted the melody, added a verse, and invoked absolute magic. One of her most joyous electronic pop singles.Madonna’s entire career in glitterball-brightened time travel. We filter-sweep from the disco sounds of late 70s clubs to the mashup phenomenon of the early 2000s, before ascending to another level entirely. An Abba sample could have been a death-knell. It was a career rejuvenator.Touchingly, this was Madonna’s first US top 10 hit. The young, untutored star is at her most gentle and beseeching here: “Just try to understandI’ve given all I can.” The song’s pure melody underlines how much she had already, and how much she would thereafter. Madonna still performs it regularly, and with reason.Madonna’s greatest single was written with Patrick Leonard in a day, just like a dream. Its lyrics play famously, with the euphoric possibilities within religion and sex, but they also explore ideas of vulnerability and power within its layers of sumptuous, immediate sound. Madonna’s character has “no choice” when she hears “your voice”, her vocals conveying wilful submissiveness with absolute tenderness. But she also has faith in herself: “you know I’ll take you there” is repeated like the Staple Singers’ early 70s mantra. Here, however, it transforms into a celebration of emotional, personal conviction. She is Madonna, after all.

Mariam Munang took her bar professional training course (BPTC) at the University of Law, and is currently based in New York as an associate legal officer at the United Nations. Munang says that her time at the University of Law – which has 10 centres across the UK – gave her the skills and confidence to get to her current position. “I chose to study there because of its strong emphasis on honing practical legal skills, such as drafting and advocacy,” she says. “I prepare for trial in much the same way as I prepared for mock trials at the University of Law. The BPTC gave me the space and opportunity to make errors, learn from them, and hone my own style.”Baroness Shami Chakrabarti is one of many lawyers who choose to use their skills in the political world. She received an honorary doctorate from the University of Law, where she is now a mentor to students. She’s a member of the House of Lords, a politician, a barrister and a former director of human rights group Liberty. “I am proud to be the shadow attorney general in a shadow cabinet of many lawyers and many more colleagues who champion human rights and the rule of law,” she says. “During my time at Liberty, we defeated proposals to lock people up for 42 days without charge, halted ID cards, and won important victories on issues like stop-and-search.”One of the proudest moments of her career, she says, came when the Human Rights Act was passed. “In a sense, there’s no such thing as human rights law, only a whole host of legal and policy areas that engage people’s human rights,” she says. “Human rights are a powerful shield against abuse of power.” Simon Firth, partner at Linklaters LLP and visiting professor, says teaching those at the start of their careers is one of the best aspects of his job. “I love explaining the principles of the subject I am covering,” he says. “The University of Law has a very practical approach to preparing students for legal practice. That means trainees are effective from the moment they start training contracts.” As graduation approaches, the university’s award-winning careers service offers students guidance on achieving ambitions – another step to set them up for success.Mayor of London Sadiq Khan graduated from the University of Law Guildford with Law Society finals, the predecessor to the LPC. “At the University of Law I really valued the support of my fellow students, my lecturers and my tutors,” he says. “They kept my motivation levels up through many long days and late nights of revision.”Khan, who grew up on a south London council estate, was a human rights lawyer before entering politics. In 2016, he won the largest personal mandate in British political history to become mayor of London. His legal background provided vital experience for the world of politics, he says. “I was a member of parliament for my home town in Tooting before becoming the mayor for all Londoners,” he says. “As a human rights lawyer, I defended people who were victims of discrimination and that made me more determined than ever to fight injustice wherever I see it.” Visit the University of Law for more information"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e2ff1de818bd09248d29d6ce0e1221811da3159/0_371_1554_932/master/1554.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=53697f9860e8e6366cab47e9bc3df17c","title":"conservatives call for lord sheikh to be expelled from party","story":"Peer says criticism he faces for attending same Palestinian conference as Jeremy Corbyn is motivated by IslamophobiaA Conservative peer has said that calls for him to be expelled from the party because he attended the same Palestinian rights conference as Jeremy Corbyn are motivated by Islamophobia and his criticism of Boris Johnson.Lord Sheikh has faced criticism for attending the 2014 event in Tunisia in the wake of a furore surrounding the Labour leader’s presence there and claims that Corbyn was involved in commemorating Black September terrorists behind the Munich Olympics attack in 1972. These claims have been described as “false and misleading” by the party.On Wednesday, Tory MPs Robert Halfon and Zac Goldsmith complained that Sheikh was in breach of the party’s code of conduct, while Goldsmith tweeted that he should be “immediately expelled”.Responding to the complaints on Thursday, Sheikh insisted that he was not antisemitic and suggested he has been targeted because he is Muslim and because he criticised Johnson’s controversial comments about the burqa.The Tory peer took particular umbrage at the involvement of Goldsmith, a close friend of Johnson, who defended the foreign secretary’s comments likening Muslim women to letterboxes, and who was accused of trying to exploit anti-Muslim feeling when he stood for mayor of London against Sadiq Khan.Sheikh told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “I think the complaints against me are politically motivated, I think the complaint against me is totally trivial and I think these people, whoever are trying to complain against me, are perhaps doing this because I have talked about what Boris Johnson has said being wrong.”He continued: “I was very surprised about the fact that Zac Goldsmith has made the complaint. When Zac Goldsmith was standing for mayor at the election, he made some unsavoury remarks about Sadiq Khan and that campaign backfired and I feel Zac Goldsmith should have learnt following his failure to be elected mayor of London.”Asked if he believed the complaint was motivated by Islamophobia, he replied: “I presume so.”Sheikh said he is a member of the all party parliamentary group on antisemitism and promoted good relationships between different communities. He said he had gone to the Tunisian conference to speak about the Arab Spring and settlements in Palestine.Challenged about the title of the conference – the International Conference on Monitoring the Palestinian Political and Legal Situation in the Light of Israeli Aggression – Sheikh said he was not aware of it.“I did not meet any members of Hamas,” he said. “I was not aware that there were people there who had extreme views. I am totally against extremism, I am totally against any form of terrorism.”In their letter to the Conservative party board, Halfon and Goldsmith wrote: “We cannot, as a party, rightly and robustly criticise the leader of the opposition for his attendance at this conference while allowing the attendance of a Conservative peer at the same event to pass without comment or complaint. To do so would be to indulge in hypocrisy and double standards.”Another Tory peer, Andrew Percy, has reportedly filed a separate complaint about Sheikh and called for the whip to be suspended."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5fdff98f37cc9745e76c0557290b8589dd5a1475/0_1_1280_768/master/1280.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=20e2d8aba43801b331f0b3a44fcf51ee","title":"allotments share your pictures","story":"Far more than just a plot of land, the UK’s allotments are some of our most treasured green spaces.

That’s not to detract from the potency of Jayde Adams’ third fringe outing, a musical comedy created and performed with the Jerry Springer: The Opera maestro Richard Thomas. But it’s also one of those shows – and Adams has one of those personae – designed with bums-from-seats vertical takeoff in mind. In comedic terms, it’s so-so. But Thomas’s music, Adams’ powerful voice and her spotlight-compelling personality still add up to emphatic entertainment.You could see it coming after 2017’s Jayded, which laid the ghosts of her low self-esteem to rest, but this year Adams goes full a. She is wheeled on stage under a flowery bower. She splays herself louchely across a grand piano. She emotes like a trouper – albeit for laughs – in a number demonstrating how to tearjerk on stage. (It’s all in the wrists, surprisingly.) Elsewhere, several songs (Whatever Happened to Baby Jayde? Things I Wish I’d Known When I Was Younger) send up musical-theatre soul-searching without discarding sentimentality.It’s a neat trick, which would be neater if the jokes had more edge. As it is, her routine about the Bristol accent (this is a very Bristolian show) echoes Bill Bailey, her lyrics raise more smiles than laughs and one song proffers an apology to her dad despite her having little, seemingly, to apologise for. The stronger moments – in chat and song – are more about forthright personality than wit, as Adams questions Beyoncé’s feminism and celebrates plus-size bodies.

The outside areas, covering 230 hectares, were also impressive, with an array of native planting including many varieties of Welsh apple tree, and water is woven throughout the gardens.

The farm has an adopt-an-animal scheme, which costs £20 a year, and helps towards conservation of its rare breed animals.Actually, the highlight is a visit to a Horrible Histories-style explanation of the slaughter process, where the opening salvo is a projected image of a pig hanging upside down from a winch. It’s a way of explaining how parts of animals are used for different products and the importance of good animal husbandry. It’s handled sensitively, with a focus on the educational aspect, rather than shock value, and set out the facts clearly. My two daughters found it more thought-provoking than upsetting.The Stables restaurant is self-service and has hot and cold snacks, and children’s lunch boxes (from £4.50) which can be filled with five items, including sandwiches, fresh fruit, cheese strips, yoghurt, crisps, cookies and fruit juice. The Gardener’s Cottage in the Victorian walled garden is more upmarket and serves posh afternoon teas (from £16.95pp), using estate-sourced produce. Better still, bring your own picnic to the farm, stocking up on local produce en route.There’s a small range on a farming theme, including toy tractors (£3.99), fluffy toy pigs (£10.95) and kids’ wellies (£8.50). A copy of Wisdom for Hen Keepers – 500 tips for Keeping Chickens was on sale for £4.99.It’s signposted from junction 10 of the M6 and junction 7 of the M56 in east Cheshire. It’s a 2½-mile walk from Knutsford railway station.It’s not the cheapest day out, with vehicle entry to the park costing £7 (free to walkers and cyclists), plus entry to the farm (adult £7, child £5, family £19, under 4s free) on top. A combined “Totally Tatton Ticket” costs £33 a family (two adults, three children) with entry to The farm, stately home and gardens but excluding parking.The farm is open Tuesday to Sunday (plus bank holidays), noon to 5pm (last entry 4pm). The park is open daily from 10am to 7pm.7 out of 10. Not cheap but it does offer a combination of educational attractions and great-outdoors exploration. Best of all, it sensitively handles introducing kids to the concept of provenance.Looking for a holiday with a difference?

The 29-storey glass-fronted skyscraper towers over the low-rise historic centre of La Paz.For Morales and his supporters, it represents a new Bolivia, a break from a painful colonial past. For others it is an overpriced vanity project aimed at glorifying the country’s longest-serving leader.Public disquiet turned to outrage when it was reported Morales would enjoy a 1,068 sq metre suite fitted out with a jacuzzi, sauna, gym and massage room. Other luxuries included a private lift, according to architectural plans leaked to local newspaper Pagina Siete.Bolivia’s communications minister, Gisela López, refused to confirm or deny the report but said the high-rise had been built “for the people” without running over a $34m budget, the state news agency reported.But the building has also become a focal point for growing anger at Morales’ refusal to relinquish power after 12 years and his vow to run for a fourth term in the country’s 2019 elections.Amid street protests, Morales inaugurated the building last Thursday.“We leave behind the palace of a colonial state to come here to the People’s Great House of the plurinational state of Bolivia,” he said in a speech, which listed the many presidents and independence leaders who had been killed inside or near the old palace during Bolivia’s tumultuous past.“It’s another historic milestone thanks to the struggle of the Bolivian people.”At 120 metres tall, the newly completed People’s Great House or Casa Grande del Pueblo looms overthe old government palace, which it replaces.Known as the Burned Palace or Palacio Quemado, the old building – which was twice gutted by fire – will now become a museum.Its replacement flouts municipal bylaws prohibiting high-rise constructions in the city centre but Morales used his party’s parliamentary majority to override the ban.“It’s an insult to the country,” Carlos Toranzo, a political analyst, told the . “(Morales) wants to immortalise himself with a building which is not only anti-aesthetic but also anti-ethical because in Bolivia we don’t have even the right to be ill,” he added, referring to the city’s woefully under-resourced main hospital.Opposition leader Samuel Doria said the new building should be turned into a cancer hospital which, he insists, is an urgent necessity in the country that remains one of South America’s poorest, despite a decade of strong growth.But Morales has brushed off criticism, saying the construction will save government spending by housing, along with the presidential and administrative offices – five ministries that currently rent quarters costing about $20m a year.Topped with a helipad and with three underground floors, the glass-fronted tower has architectural features resembling Tiwanaku, Bolivia’s preeminent archeological site. It features indigenous symbols such as the chakana, or Andean cross, and has several large murals, some of which depict workers overcoming social injustice."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e9f644ad995eccac984934c4b02a6285b8c816da/0_346_4292_2576/master/4292.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6da035308dcc8753548ce5d068a959f0","title":"regreening niger how magical gaos transformed land","story":"Farmers in Niger are nurturing gao trees to drive Africa’s biggest environmental changeRain had come to nearby villages, but not yet to Droum in south-east Niger. The sand under its stately trees looked completely barren, but Souley Cheibou, a farmer in his 60s, was not worried. He crooked a finger, fished in the sand, and brought out a millet seed. In a week or two, this seed would germinate and sprout, and soon the whole field would be green.Cheibou’s peace of mind stemmed from the trees encircling him, which had been standing long before he was born. Despite appearances, these were not any old acacias. They were gao trees – known as winterthorns in English – with unique, seemingly magical powers.From the peanut basin of Senegal to the Seno plains of Mali, to Yatenga, formerly the most degraded region of Burkina Faso, and as far south as Malawi: gaos are thriving in Africa. And over the past three decades, the landscape of southern Niger has been transformed by more than 200m new trees, many of them gaos. They have not been planted but have grown naturally on over 5m hectares of farmland, nurtured by thousands of farmers.According to scientists, what has happened in Niger – one of the world’s poorest countries – is the largest-scale positive transformation of the environment in the whole of Africa. This is not a grand UN-funded project aiming to offset climate change. Small-scale farmers have achieved it because of what the trees can do for crop yields and other aspects of farming life.“It’s a magic tree, a very wonderful tree,” said Abasse Tougiani of Niger’s National Institute of Agricultural Research, who has travelled all over Niger studying Faidherbia albida – the gao’s Latin name.Shielded from the sun, crops planted under the canopy of a tree usually do not do well in the short term, although there can be longer-term benefits. That’s one reason why many west African rainforests have been decimated. But with gaos, it’s the other way round. The root system of the gao is nearly as big as its branches, and unusually it draws nitrogen from the air, fertilising the soil. And unlike other trees in the area, gao tree leaves fall in the rainy season, allowing more sunlight through to the crops at a key moment.Used along with mineral fertilisers, crop yields double under gaos, and the gao-nourished soil holds water better, ensuring a better crop in drought years.Counterintuitively, the great gao regreening is only happening in areas of Niger with high-density populations. With less space to expand into as more people are born, hard-up farmers are increasingly realising that the trees can regenerate degraded land.“It’s literally a story of more people, more trees,” said Chris Reij, a sustainable land management specialist. “The whole point is that the trees are not protected and managed by farmers for their environmental beauty, but because they are part of the agricultural production system.”Inadvertently, the farmers are also doing their bit to offset climate change. Trees are crucial for storing carbon, absorbing it out of the atmosphere. “In mature, fairly dense areas, you get 30 tons of wood per hectare. Half of that is carbon,” said Gray Tappan, a geographer.Efforts to restore 100m hectares of degraded African land by 2030 are underway. The ambitious Great Green Wall project to surround the Sahara desert with trees and other plants has changed beyond recognition after debate over whether desertification - the process by which soil loses its fertitlity - is real. Progress is slow. In Niger, where temperatures often reach the 40s, the trees create a cooler microclimate, and rabbits and jackals are coming back.But none of these grand political projects explains why gaos have caught on. The trees’ pods make very nutritious animal fodder, and fallen branches make good firewood, meaning Droum’s women and children – whose job it is to collect fuel for cooking fires – rarely have to venture further than a few kilometres to find it.Tales about how the gao came to be so revered abound. Legend has it that crimes against gaos have been taken very seriously since the mid-19th century. “If you touched a branch, you would go to jail,” Tougiani said. In splendid brocade robes and curly-toed velvet slippers, surrounded by self-portraits and stick-wielding guards dressed in red and green, today’s district chief in Droum takes a slightly softer approach.“It’s shameful to have to come before the chief and explain yourself. Often that’s punishment enough,” Maman Ali Kaoura said. Droum’s reoffenders face fines of between 5,000 to 10,000 West African CFA francs (£6.75-£13.50), a huge amount for hard-up farmers.A sense of ownership has been key in the regreening of Niger. Until the mid-1980s, every tree was considered to belong to the state. When this changed, regreening began, as people were happier to look after trees that belonged to them. In areas with the best cover, they organised patrols to protect their trees from passing farmers and neighbouring villagers seeking firewood.Once people discovered that “one gao was equal to 10 cows” for fertilising, as Tougiani put it, the tree’s popularity took off. Several schemes, including one where farmers with more than 50 gaos were paid 50 CFA for each one, helped it along.But their loyalty to their gaos could make areas around Zinder the most vulnerable to a disease that Reij and Tougiani have recently spotted killing trees near Niamey, the capital. If it spreads, the losses could be enormous, particularly in places where there is a near-monoculture of gaos.“I’m worried, because it’s green oil for farmers – it’s their wealth,” said Tougiani. “If they lose Faidherbia albida, they’ll lose their way of life. They’ll have to leave the village.”News doesn\u0027t always have to be bad – indeed, the relentless focus on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame risks convincing the public that the world is hopeless and there is nothing we can do.This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theFor Cheibou, losing his trees is unthinkable – they were his birthright. “I have nearly 100 gao trees in my fields, which I inherited from my father,” he said.

Many of the children were treated at a hospital supported by the International Committee of the Red Cross. Marta Rivas Blanco, an ICRC nurse, shares her account of the day.They came to the hospital in cars and ambulances. Dozens of children with an array of grisly wounds. Some were screaming, some were scared. Many went straight to the morgue.I’d like to say this was the first time I’ve treated so many civilians after an attack, but it’s not. I’ve been here too many times before, both in Yemen and in Mosul, Iraq.What happened last week in Saada, however, was unprecedented for me in that nearly all the victims were children. As part of an ICRC mobile surgical team, we work alongside Yemeni healthcare workers at the Talh hospital on a daily basis. Yemen’s health system has been decimated by conflict and it’s a challenging environment at the best of times. What happened on Thursday was the stuff of nightmares.A colleague called me while we were driving to the hospital in the morning. He told me there had been an attack and that we should expect an influx of patients. When he said most of them were children, my heart sank.It was intense. Very quickly the emergency room was full, as were the two extra emergency tents outside. You can’t imagine such a scene. We’d already enacted our mass casualty plan, so everyone knew what to do.The first thing was to triage the patients. The red cases – those with life-threatening injuries – went straight to the emergency room. They have to be treated immediately or they will die. The less severe cases went into the tents for treatment.When you’re in this moment, you lose track of time. You focus on your job and you don’t let emotions get in the way. For around four hours everyone was working flat out. Local staff, who were not supposed to be working, came in to help out. Even the cleaners were helping. You just do your best, but sometimes even that’s not enough.Two children died in the emergency room with me. The brutal truth is that you cannot save everyone. In total, 51 people died, including 40 children. Dozens more were injured, the majority of whom were children. There were a lot of children who had difficulty breathing, due to lung injuries caused by shockwaves from the blast. Some had fractures to the arms and legs, and broken glass had caused perforations to the skin. One small mercy is that there were no amputations. Physically, the children will recover. But I worry for their mental state. Many were in shock they had no idea what had just happened to them. One minute they were on a bus, the next they were in a hospital.The health system in Yemen is on the brink of collapse and Saada is a very poor area. There is little by way of psychological support. This attack could affect the children long after their wounds have healed.Funerals for some of the children were held on Monday. Those who are still in hospital are on the path to recovery. While it’s good to see wounds on the mend, the hospital is still full of children who should otherwise be at school, or outside playing. This conflict has robbed them of their childhood.I don’t expect we’ll get much of a break for the next fortnight. But that’s OK. To be here and to be able to help is deeply gratifying for me. On Monday I went to the office to take stock of the medical supplies. It’s in these quiet moments that you start replaying the images in your head – the anguish etched on those children’s faces, the sound of young voices screaming.Whether in Yemen, Syria, Iraq, or any other conflict, attacks on civilians are unacceptable and cannot be idly tolerated. International humanitarian law strictly prohibits attacks against civilians and civilian objects. But I’ve found myself treating civilians more times than I care to remember. That’s why I had to go to the office: to submit an order to replenish our stock of medicines and equipment. We have to be ready for the next time.Marta Rivas Blanco is part of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) mobile surgical team at Al-Talh hospital in Yemen."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8292b60a352c3fd51bdf0825dfa58cb3193a8870/0_217_4200_2520/master/4200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c2c0a563d2378238042b61694f1709e8","title":"uk playwrights condemn bombing of gaza theatre","story":"Caryl Churchill and National Theatre director bemoan ‘devastating loss’ after Israeli strikeLeading playwrights and directors in Britain have severely criticised the bombing of a major cultural centre in the Gaza Strip by Israel’s air force, calling it a “devastating loss for the already isolated community”.In a letter to the , 14 figures from UK theatre, including the director of the National Theatre, Rufus Norris, and dramatist Caryl Churchill, condemned the “total destruction” of the Said al-Mishal Culture Centre.“We support our dear friends and colleagues who describe ‘their great rage and deep pain’ at the obliteration of this symbol of Palestinian culture and identity as they mourn the destruction of one of the few large venues for theatre and music performances in besieged Gaza,” the group said.“Since its establishment in 2004, Al-Mishal served as a home for hundreds of plays, ceremonies, exhibits, musical performances and national ceremonies. It was the venue of choice for theatre companies in Gaza and a space for Gaza’s top musical acts.”Most recently, the centre hosted a joint performance with artists in the UK. At Home in Gaza and London, which ran in June and July, attempted to connect people living under severe blockade with British audiences.The multi-storey building was flattened on Thursday last week during a peak in violence, as Israel launched more than 150 airstrikes in Gaza and Palestinian militants fired more than 180 rockets and mortars into southern Israel.Three Palestinians were killed that day, including a pregnant woman, a toddler and a fighter from the armed wing of Hamas, the group that runs the enclave. Several Israelis were wounded.In an apparent reference to the cultural centre bombing, the Israeli army said at the time that its jets had targeted a five-storey structure which it said was “used by the Hamas terror organisation’s interior security forces for military purposes”.It shared a photo of the building and a video of the airstrike, showing an overhead view of the explosion. “The strike is an example of the (Israeli Defense Force’s) intelligence and operational capabilities, which will intensify as necessary,” it added.The centre was seen as a cultural landmark in Gaza, holding a theatre, a library and offices for artistic associations. It was also used as a recreation centre for children affected by the three wars waged between Israel and Hamas during the past decade. Artists working at the centre strongly denied Israeli claims of any Hamas military use.The British letter’s signatories also included Vicky Featherstone, artistic director of the Royal Court theatre, as well as Phyllida Lloyd, who directed the films Mamma Mia! and The Iron Lady. In 2009, shortly after the first Gaza war, Churchill wrote a 10-minute play on attitudes to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.“It is a devastating loss for the already isolated community,” the group said in the letter. “We are deeply shocked that this act of destruction has not been widely reported in the British press. We support all efforts to continue Al-Mishal’s mission and the campaign for the centre’s reconstruction.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/504a4f36e61e9262a1fcd02dc8fb5b66fbab7622/0_135_2835_1702/master/2835.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6656955d68e085d32ba5bffe04ec3637","title":"we condemn the destruction of gaza cultural centre in israeli airstrike","story":"As theatre practitioners who have worked closely with Palestinian artists, we write to condemn the bombing and total destruction of the Said Al-Mishal Cultural Centre in Gaza on 9 August by an Israeli airstrike.

Photo: Leon FarrellPhotocall Ireland.Ho ho nooooo, say it ain’t so. There are still 131 sleeps until Christmas and already Brown Thomas shops in Dublin, Cork and Limerick have decked the halls and are suggesting it is the season to be jolly. It is hardly much of a surprise that the high end retailer has opened its Christmas shops even before nation’s children have gone back to school as this is what it has done every year for the best part of a decade. And as with every other year the retailer was entirely unapologetic. “We open our Christmas shop every year in August which always proves to be very popular with customers,” BT’s managing director Steven Sealy said. He suggested that the store’s fake trees would be “in high demand from the beginning of the season” while its decorations “start to sell-out in early November”.One of the trees which is likely to attract considerable attention is a seven-and-a-half foot plastic tree festooned with 200 sparkling lights that can be up and running from out of the box in less than five minutes without so much as a single cross word about tangled Christmas lights spoken by anyone. At €550, the tree is not cheap but forward-thinking souls who bunow may be laughing in five or six years when the consequences of this year’s drought will be felt on the real tree market. The woman who has chosen the Miracle Tree is Woods, Edel Woods. She has been thinking about Christmas 2018 since before Christmas 2017 which must be terribly confusing.Like Sealy she is unapologetic about her role in making Wizzard’s wish that it be Christmas every day come a step closer to being an absolutely horrific reality. She said the BTs Christmas shop had become known for its “beautiful and unusual Christmas decorations and trees” and claimed that customers “love to snap up decorations whether it is to be organised or to build on a collection they already have.”Certainly shoppers The  spoke to seemed happy enough with the premature festivity. “I always like it,” said Elena Mihovia who is originally from Bulgaria but is living in Islandbridge. “Last August it was the same. It lifts people mood when they see Christmas in the store.”Dairin Pernet is Irish but lives in Switzerland and she was in the store with her four-year-old son stocking up. “I love it, “ she said. “It is so cute. This just conjures up all the nostalgia for me. And look, it is a small space, and Dublin is full of tourists and they will love it.”She was buying presents for her son’s teachers. “That must be the Swiss rubbing off on me,” she said. When asked if she had any concerns that her child might start counting down the days until Santa arrives because of the shop visit she said no. “He is still caught up in the back-to-school thing and he has a new Incredibles costume in this bag so that’s going to keep him occupied.” Aisling Creevey from Naas wasn’t so convinced. “It gets earlier and earlier doesn’t it,” she said. “I understand why people might give out but it’s nice to look at. I can’t get my head around back to school yet never mind Christmas, mind you I am a teacher.” She said she had no plans to buy anything. “I’ve had a look but it Christmas shopping really isn’t my agenda today.”It wasn’t on Michelle Clancy from Glasnevin’s agenda either. “I think it takes the novelty out of Christmas,” she said. “What is seldom is wonderful.” "},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Brown Thomas unapologetic about selling festive decorations and fake trees in AugustOwners granted injunctions against occupation that has been described as political protestCosgrave and de Valera deserve credit for preserving democracy in the new StateDisciplinary proceedings were brought after a passenger complained that he had been punched on the back of the head by a Luas staff memberChilean flamingo chicks hatch after 30-day incubation in DublinCelebrated Irish chaplain Fr Willie Doyle SJ also to get a blue plaque near where he diedRole of women seen as \u0026lsquofirst and most important\u0026rsquo of radical reforms neededMan (22) held after drugs, guns seized in BallyfermotWorldwide \u0026lsquothe problem is not managed effectively anywhere\u0026rsquoMother-of-seven given three-bed apartment on trial basisSinn F\u0026eacutein say the \u0026lsquodisplay of hate\u0026rsquo had \u0026lsquonothing whatsoever to do with republicanism\u0026rsquoKerry music festival commemorates groundbreaking work on jellyfishHead of communications says GPO is \u0026lsquosardine-like\u0026rsquo with 950 people working thereWoman (18) is in serious condition after the collision on Wednesday night\u0026lsquoIt is nearly impossible for people to move on from emergency and homeless services\u0026rsquoPresidential candidate tells Carlow councillors he would avoid \u0026lsquomegaphone diplomacy\u0026rsquoSuspect linked to remote areas of Wicklow and Carlow-Laois borderIan Elliott, chief executive of church\u0026rsquos child protection body, said his work was resistedTeams from Cambridge University and Ireland seek genetic markers for diseaseNew alliance with Genomics Medicine Ireland a chance to complete unfinished business"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3598280.1534424193!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"nine flamingo chicks born at dublin zoo and more on the way","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tOne of the chicks which hatched in Dublin Zoo.Nine flamingos chicks have been born at Dublin Zoo.The Chilean flamingo chicks hatched after a 30-day incubation and now join the 86-strong flock at the zoo.With a number of eggs still in the nest, keepers are eagerly awaiting several more hatchlings in the coming weeks, the zoo said in a statement.The Chilean Flamingo stands over a metre tall with a wing of up to 100cm.

Thar has always been ruled by the feudal class, but they have given us nothing. They only visit us during election time to collect votes. They give money in exchange for votes, and people accept it out of greed. And then they leave.”“Our people don’t realise the importance of their vote – they sell themselves. The people of Thar do not have roads, water to drink, hospitals, schools – the basic necessities of life.”Analysis | Post-election, Imran Khan faces his toughest battle yetPakistan\u0027s minorities have this year seen the first election of a female, scheduled caste Hindu senator, Krishna Kumari Kohli. At the time of her election she vowed to work for the “empowerment of women, their health, and education”.Pakistan\u0027s assembly has 70 seats reserved for minorities and women, but the general election also saw the first election of a Hindu politician to a general seat, Mahesh Kumar Malan.Seema Maheshwari, a human rights activist in Sindh, said the fact many of the 10 minority women had stood for general seats as independents in the rural parts of the province or in the port of Karachi was a “sea change”.She said it was sign of growing confidence among women. She said: “We can see that not only male persons, but also female persons can stand. Women think they are adults, they are citizens, they are also human beings.”Basic healthcare, clean water and education were often the core of their election demands.The Thar desert in Sindh province is one of the most deprived parts of the country and its residents are largely Hindu..html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:0}.html-embedponent .quoteponent ponent-content{margin-right:16px}.quote__source,.quote__author{white-space:normal}@media only screen and (min-width:730px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-60.83px}.html-embedponent .quoteponent .quote__content:before{margin-left:-12pxpadding-right:1px}}@media only screen and (min-width:1008px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-82.33px}}When I talk to people, I sense their frustration. The biggest issue is the lack of clean drinking waterSunita Parmar MenghwarMrs Parmar, a university graduate from the local city of Mithi, said: “In particular, I would like to open a hospital that has a gynecology department, with all the equipment and tools for delivery, so women don’t have to travel far. The way it is in other places. Many women die during child birth.“When I go out campaigning, I notice that there are hospitals – but no doctors. There are schools – but no teachers. When I talk to people, I sense their frustration. The biggest issue is the lack of clean drinking water.”Another minority candidate, a Christian woman called Nomi Bashir, had similar complaints in Karachi.“There is no water, we don’t have proper roads and our education system is completely flawed,” she said in a newspaper interview while on the campaign trail.The rough-and-tumble of Pakistan\u0027s politics can be tough for candidates without money or powerful support.Mrs Parmar said she had been intimidated and told to back down.“Yes, there have been instances where I’ve gotten calls telling me to step aside. These feudals that rule over us have tried to pressure me. They’d call at my house and say, \u0027Tell Sunita to step aside\u0027. But I have stepped forward for my community and I will not back down. I’m not alone, I have the entire downtrodden class with me.”On the July 25 polling day she picked up 352 votes. The winner, Fakir Sher Mohammad of the Pakistan People\u0027s Party, picked up nearly 55,000.Perhaps it was fear that stopped her neighbours voting for her, or perhaps they were paid off, she said.I thought more people would vote, I thought I would win,” she told the .“But I still feel happy. I don’t care about win or loss, I’m happy I competed. I met with the people, took part in the process and represented my community.

They\u0027re going to drink in the aircraft, he said. He warned that the plans could also hit sales of premium whisky as US tourists returning home on early morning flights would be prevented from buying the spirit as a gift or souvenir.He said the issue should instead be tackled by giving passengers warnings about the consequences if they were drunk on board and airlines intervening to speak to high-risk groups such as stag and hen parties.The Home Office is due to launch a consultation on extending the Licensing Act after a House of Lords select committee recommended that the exemption be removed. A spokeswoman for the IAS said that arguments from all parties were awarded the same consideration without preferential treatment for any one stakeholder group..html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:0}.html-embedponent .quoteponent ponent-content{margin-right:16px}.quote__source,.quote__author{white-space:normal}@media only screen and (min-width:730px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-60.83px}.html-embedponent .quoteponent .quote__content:before{margin-left:-12pxpadding-right:1px}}@media only screen and (min-width:1008px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-82.33px}}Problems do not arise from the sale of alcohol on board, as the measures are small, the flights short, and sales controlled by trained staffDiarmuid Ó Conghaile, RyanairWe chose the three key recommendations for the report based on levels of public support, stakeholder support, and likely effectiveness, she said. Diarmuid Ó Conghaile, Ryanair’s director of public affairs, said that a small number of passengers were causing disturbance and disruption to others.Problems do not arise from the sale of alcohol on board, as the measures are small, the flights short, and sales controlled by trained staff, he said. Indian Hindu musicians labelled traitors for collaborating with ChristiansAretha Franklin, Queen of Soul, dies aged 76Comment: Don\u0026#39t listen to university sceptics – it\u0026#39s definitely not a waste of timeUS newspapers attack Donald Trump\u0026#39s \u0026#39dirty war\u0026#39 on free press with coordinated editorialsA-level results day 2018: Highest number of top grades for six years despite new \u0026#39tougher\u0026#39 examsThailand to ban imports of electronic waste as Southeast Asia nations fear they are new dumping groundHit and run near GCHQ as police probe death of pedestrian outside UK spy listening post Polar bear knocked out for hay fever testMichael Schumacher will not be transferred to mansion on Majorca, says manager\u0026#39Dinner\u0026#39s on me!\u0026#39: Gordon Ramsay celebrates his twins\u0026#39 A-level results Queen\u0026#39s physician, Dr Peter Fisher, killed in crash with lorry while cycling in central LondonISS crew release tiny satellites into space and install bird tracker Danny Cipriani \u0026#39mortified\u0026#39 after bruising female officer during bar row as he pleads guilty to assault\u0026#39Miracle\u0026#39 rescue after man found alive in van hanging from Genoa bridge wreckageAquarius ship arrives in Malta after migrant-sharing dealGenoa collapse: Hundreds more bridges \u0026#39at risk\u0026#39 across Italy as ministers blast highways firmParliament \u0026#39attack\u0026#39: Birmingham community where suspect lived thought he was \u0026#39normal person\u0026#39Students can get an A with almost half the questions wrong in new \u0026#39tougher\u0026#39 A-levels, leak revealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"aretha franklin","story":"The Queen of Soul - best known for hits such as Respect, Think and I Say a Little Prayer - passed away in Detroit on Thursday after battling ill health for several years.The cause of her death was advanced pancreatic cancer, her publicist Gwendolyn Quinn said.

As we grieve, we ask that you respect our privacy during this difficult time.Quinn added that funeral arrangements will be announced in the coming days.Sir Elton John led the tributes to Aretha Franklin, with whom he shared a birthday. Praising her music from the heart, he said on Instagram that the whole world will rejoice in her remarkable legacy. Singer Annie Lennox, who duetted with Franklin on the 1985 hit Sisters Are Doin\u0027 It For Themselves, posted a lengthy tribute on Instagram, describing her as simply peerless and insisting her voice will soar on forever. Singer Barbra Streisand shared a picture of herself with Franklin taken six years ago as she paid tribute to the Queen of Soul.Bill and Hilary Clinton described how the singer for more than 50 years, stirred our souls and the former Democrat leader, who lost out to Donald Trump in the 2016 election, tweeted a personal tribute to her friend.Singer-songwriter Bette Midler also paid tribute to Franklin, who she described as a musical lighthouse.Carole King, who wrote arguably one of Franklin\u0027s biggest hits (You Make Me Feel Like A) Natural Woman simply tweeted a link to the Queen of Soul performing her record along with a short tribute.The Beatles stars Sir Paul McCartney and Sir Ringo Starr both took to Twitter to post their tributes to the Queen of Soul.  Singer Paloma Faith wrote on Instagram that Franklin would be forever in our memories.Franklin\u0027s hits include (You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman (1968), Day Dreaming (1972), Jump to It (1982), Freeway of Love (1985) and A Rose Is Still A Rose (1998).In 1987, she became the first woman inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.I Knew You Were Waiting for Me - a duet she sang with the late singer George Michael - was one of her Grammy-winning hits.Video: Aretha Franklin moves Barack Obama to tears with 2015 performanceIn 2005, Franklin was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom - the highest award for an American civilian - by then-president George W Bush.And in January 2009 Franklin sang at Barack Obama\u0027s presidential inauguration.The star was born Aretha Louise Franklin in Memphis, Tennessee on March 25 1942 to travelling Baptist preacher Clarence LaVaughn CL Franklin and mother Barbara, an accomplished singer and pianist.Franklin\u0027s family relocated to Detroit, Michigan while she was still an infant.Her father led the city\u0027s New Bethel Baptist Church, which became a centre for the civil rights movement.Following her parents\u0027 separation, Franklin\u0027s mother moved to Buffalo in New York but she would frequently visit her children in Detroit. Barbara died weeks before Franklin\u0027s 10th birthday.At age 12 Franklin had the first of her four sons, Clarence, named after her father, and her second child Edward followed two years later.Franklin\u0027s father became famous for his emotionally charged sermons, becoming known as the man with the million-dollar voice.Franklin\u0027s childhood home was frequented by celebrities including civil rights activist Martin Luther King Jr and singer Sam Cooke, while gospel singer Mahalia Jackson helped to take care of Franklin and her siblings following her mother\u0027s death.Franklin\u0027s love and knack for all things musical started early on in her life, when she learned how to play the piano by ear and singing in church.Her father became her manager and she joined him on his tours of churches across the country.She released her first studio album, Songs Of Faith, in 1956 when she was 14 years old.At the age of 18, Franklin told her father she wanted to start singing and recording pop music.She was signed by Columbia who released her first single on the label Today I Sing The Blues in 1960.Her first single to land on America\u0027s main industry chart came the following year with Won\u0027t Be Long, but it was in the latter half of the decade that Franklin\u0027s commercial success really soared.Franklin opted to move to Atlantic Records from Columbia in 1966 and the following year she scored her first top 10 hit with I Never Loved A Man (The Way I Love You).Her album of the same name also featured her signature number, a rendition of Otis Redding\u0027s Respect, which topped the chart.The song became widely considered as a feminist and civil rights anthem, and today still remains one of her most beloved songs.The singer had a string of popular hits in the late 1960s including (You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman, Chain Of Fools, Baby I Love You, and her version of I Say A Little Prayer by Dionne Warwick.In June 1968, she appeared on the cover of Time magazine and earned the first of her 18 Grammy awards for Respect. She would be recognised at the Grammys with a lifetime achievement award in 1994.Franklin had cancelled concerts in 2010 while recovering from surgery that removed a tumour and, Franklin said, would add 15 to 20 years to her life.However, illness had affected her performing career over the past decade, with shows cancelled in 2013.Franklin said in August of that year that she had undergone a miraculous recovery, but continued to drop out of shows.Aretha Franklin previously spoke about her \u0026#39ballooning\u0026#39 weight and subsequent weight lossFranklin\u0027s most recent performance was in November last year, for the Elton John AIDS Foundation in New York, and she gave her last public performance a year ago in Philadelphia. A reviewer wrote of her performance: Regardless of advancing years and medical setbacks, Franklin seemed largely undiminished in voice or spirit, even if her exclamations sometimes soared past the limits of her breath.”A former chain smoker who suffered from bouts of alcoholism, Franklin had also spoken about her ballooning weight and subsequent weight loss.Please review our commenting policyIndian Hindu musicians labelled traitors for collaborating with ChristiansComment: Don\u0026#39t listen to university sceptics – it\u0026#39s definitely not a waste of timeUS newspapers attack Donald Trump\u0026#39s \u0026#39dirty war\u0026#39 on free press with coordinated editorialsA-level results day 2018: Highest number of top grades for six years despite new \u0026#39tougher\u0026#39 examsThailand to ban imports of electronic waste as Southeast Asia nations fear they are new dumping groundHit and run near GCHQ as police probe death of pedestrian outside UK spy listening post Polar bear knocked out for hay fever testMichael Schumacher will not be transferred to mansion on Majorca, says manager\u0026#39Dinner\u0026#39s on me!\u0026#39: Gordon Ramsay celebrates his twins\u0026#39 A-level results Queen\u0026#39s physician, Dr Peter Fisher, killed in crash with lorry while cycling in central LondonISS crew release tiny satellites into space and install bird tracker Danny Cipriani \u0026#39mortified\u0026#39 after bruising female officer during bar row as he pleads guilty to assault\u0026#39Miracle\u0026#39 rescue after man found alive in van hanging from Genoa bridge wreckageAquarius ship arrives in Malta after migrant-sharing dealGenoa collapse: Hundreds more bridges \u0026#39at risk\u0026#39 across Italy as ministers blast highways firmParliament \u0026#39attack\u0026#39: Birmingham community where suspect lived thought he was \u0026#39normal person\u0026#39Students can get an A with almost half the questions wrong in new \u0026#39tougher\u0026#39 A-levels, leak revealsPupils increasingly sceptical of importance of university, poll findsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"aretha franklin","story":"The Queen of Soul - best known for hits such as Respect, Think and I Say a Little Prayer - passed away in Detroit on Thursday after battling ill health for several years.The cause of her death was advanced pancreatic cancer, her publicist Gwendolyn Quinn said.

As we grieve, we ask that you respect our privacy during this difficult time.Quinn added that funeral arrangements will be announced in the coming days.Sir Elton John led the tributes to Aretha Franklin, with whom he shared a birthday. Praising her music from the heart, he said on Instagram that the whole world will rejoice in her remarkable legacy. Singer Annie Lennox, who duetted with Franklin on the 1985 hit Sisters Are Doin\u0027 It For Themselves, posted a lengthy tribute on Instagram, describing her as simply peerless and insisting her voice will soar on forever. Singer Barbra Streisand shared a picture of herself with Franklin taken six years ago as she paid tribute to the Queen of Soul.Bill and Hilary Clinton described how the singer for more than 50 years, stirred our souls and the former Democrat leader, who lost out to Donald Trump in the 2016 election, tweeted a personal tribute to her friend.Singer-songwriter Bette Midler also paid tribute to Franklin, who she described as a musical lighthouse.Carole King, who wrote arguably one of Franklin\u0027s biggest hits (You Make Me Feel Like A) Natural Woman simply tweeted a link to the Queen of Soul performing her record along with a short tribute.The Beatles stars Sir Paul McCartney and Sir Ringo Starr both took to Twitter to post their tributes to the Queen of Soul.  Singer Paloma Faith wrote on Instagram that Franklin would be forever in our memories.Franklin\u0027s hits include (You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman (1968), Day Dreaming (1972), Jump to It (1982), Freeway of Love (1985) and A Rose Is Still A Rose (1998).In 1987, she became the first woman inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.I Knew You Were Waiting for Me - a duet she sang with the late singer George Michael - was one of her Grammy-winning hits.Video: Aretha Franklin moves Barack Obama to tears with 2015 performanceIn 2005, Franklin was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom - the highest award for an American civilian - by then-president George W Bush.And in January 2009 Franklin sang at Barack Obama\u0027s presidential inauguration.The star was born Aretha Louise Franklin in Memphis, Tennessee on March 25 1942 to travelling Baptist preacher Clarence LaVaughn CL Franklin and mother Barbara, an accomplished singer and pianist.Franklin\u0027s family relocated to Detroit, Michigan while she was still an infant.Her father led the city\u0027s New Bethel Baptist Church, which became a centre for the civil rights movement.Following her parents\u0027 separation, Franklin\u0027s mother moved to Buffalo in New York but she would frequently visit her children in Detroit. Barbara died weeks before Franklin\u0027s 10th birthday.At age 12 Franklin had the first of her four sons, Clarence, named after her father, and her second child Edward followed two years later.Franklin\u0027s father became famous for his emotionally charged sermons, becoming known as the man with the million-dollar voice.Franklin\u0027s childhood home was frequented by celebrities including civil rights activist Martin Luther King Jr and singer Sam Cooke, while gospel singer Mahalia Jackson helped to take care of Franklin and her siblings following her mother\u0027s death.Franklin\u0027s love and knack for all things musical started early on in her life, when she learned how to play the piano by ear and singing in church.Her father became her manager and she joined him on his tours of churches across the country.She released her first studio album, Songs Of Faith, in 1956 when she was 14 years old.At the age of 18, Franklin told her father she wanted to start singing and recording pop music.She was signed by Columbia who released her first single on the label Today I Sing The Blues in 1960.Her first single to land on America\u0027s main industry chart came the following year with Won\u0027t Be Long, but it was in the latter half of the decade that Franklin\u0027s commercial success really soared.Franklin opted to move to Atlantic Records from Columbia in 1966 and the following year she scored her first top 10 hit with I Never Loved A Man (The Way I Love You).Her album of the same name also featured her signature number, a rendition of Otis Redding\u0027s Respect, which topped the chart.The song became widely considered as a feminist and civil rights anthem, and today still remains one of her most beloved songs.The singer had a string of popular hits in the late 1960s including (You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman, Chain Of Fools, Baby I Love You, and her version of I Say A Little Prayer by Dionne Warwick.In June 1968, she appeared on the cover of Time magazine and earned the first of her 18 Grammy awards for Respect. She would be recognised at the Grammys with a lifetime achievement award in 1994.Franklin had cancelled concerts in 2010 while recovering from surgery that removed a tumour and, Franklin said, would add 15 to 20 years to her life.However, illness had affected her performing career over the past decade, with shows cancelled in 2013.Franklin said in August of that year that she had undergone a miraculous recovery, but continued to drop out of shows.Aretha Franklin previously spoke about her \u0026#39ballooning\u0026#39 weight and subsequent weight lossFranklin\u0027s most recent performance was in November last year, for the Elton John AIDS Foundation in New York, and she gave her last public performance a year ago in Philadelphia. A reviewer wrote of her performance: Regardless of advancing years and medical setbacks, Franklin seemed largely undiminished in voice or spirit, even if her exclamations sometimes soared past the limits of her breath.”A former chain smoker who suffered from bouts of alcoholism, Franklin had also spoken about her ballooning weight and subsequent weight loss.Please review our commenting policyIndian Hindu musicians labelled traitors for collaborating with ChristiansComment: Don\u0026#39t listen to university sceptics – it\u0026#39s definitely not a waste of timeUS newspapers attack Donald Trump\u0026#39s \u0026#39dirty war\u0026#39 on free press with coordinated editorialsA-level results day 2018: Highest number of top grades for six years despite new \u0026#39tougher\u0026#39 examsThailand to ban imports of electronic waste as Southeast Asia nations fear they are new dumping groundHit and run near GCHQ as police probe death of pedestrian outside UK spy listening post Polar bear knocked out for hay fever testMichael Schumacher will not be transferred to mansion on Majorca, says manager\u0026#39Dinner\u0026#39s on me!\u0026#39: Gordon Ramsay celebrates his twins\u0026#39 A-level results Queen\u0026#39s physician, Dr Peter Fisher, killed in crash with lorry while cycling in central LondonISS crew release tiny satellites into space and install bird tracker Danny Cipriani \u0026#39mortified\u0026#39 after bruising female officer during bar row as he pleads guilty to assault\u0026#39Miracle\u0026#39 rescue after man found alive in van hanging from Genoa bridge wreckageAquarius ship arrives in Malta after migrant-sharing dealGenoa collapse: Hundreds more bridges \u0026#39at risk\u0026#39 across Italy as ministers blast highways firmParliament \u0026#39attack\u0026#39: Birmingham community where suspect lived thought he was \u0026#39normal person\u0026#39Students can get an A with almost half the questions wrong in new \u0026#39tougher\u0026#39 A-levels, leak revealsPupils increasingly sceptical of importance of university, poll findsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/education/2018/08/15/TELEMMGLPICT000171718487_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidt","title":"dont listen university sceptics definitely not waste time","story":"University is crucial to certain careers and helps people to growNot everybody needs to go to university, but education bashing has gone too far Three things always happen on the Thursday that falls in the middle of August.

of three vets, a nurse, three dermatologists and five more park staff were on hand when 97.6 stone (620kg) Victor needed to be given an allergy test.The major operation was put in place after Victor and his smaller friend, Nobby, began suffering from abscesses on their feet.Staff suspected it was caused by an allergic reaction to pollen after moving from concrete bear pit enclosures elsewhere to the more natural setting at the attraction near Doncaster.Victor, a 620 kg polar bear, is given an allergy test at the Yorkshire Wildlife Park near Doncaster after he and a smaller bear, Nobby, began suffering from abscesses on their feetSuch was the bear\u0027s bulk, Press Association photographer Danny Lawson was also asked to put down his camera and help manoeuvre Victor into a comfortable position after he had been anaesthetised.Dermatologists from Liverpool University were brought in to carry out tests on Victor\u0027s skin, once he had safely been put under, to verify the theory.The results will be known in the coming days.Victor the polar bear undergoes pollen allergy testVictor was shaved and there are about 50 test sites on his side.Fingers crossed we can find out which allergies he has and we can set about making life more comfortable for him.Ms Porter said it was often the case that bears which had previously been in sterile, frequently disinfected enclosures developed pollen allergies when they were moved to more natural quarters.A team of three vets, a nurse, three dermatologists and five more park staff were on hand to carry out tests while the bear was under sedation.Antibiotics have previously helped - while antihistamines have not - but Ms Porter said finding the right serum for Victor and fellow sufferer Nobby was the best idea long term.And he seemed none the worse for the experience on Wednesday, with Ms Porter saying: He\u0027s come around nicely, he\u0027s very calm and seems settled.Indian Hindu musicians labelled traitors for

More than two thirds (64 per cent) of consumers are expecting prices to rise due to the UK leaving the European Union, with 24 per cent preparing for a “substantial” increase, according to a poll of 1,000 shoppers carried out by Censuswide. Meanwhile, more than half (54 per cent) expect to see more stores closing down in future.

The issue of costs is one of the main problems retailers are facing, Parliament Street said in its Retail Revolution report. “Long-term leases are costly and preventing stores from downsizing or moving to cheaper rental properties,” the study said. “One of the newer aspects we are seeing is that retail centres and high streets are investing in pop-up spaces to try out new areas to drive\u0026nbspprofits.”The think tank also noted the launch of the Amazon Go store was a sign the online giant was “beginning to change the traditional high street model”.“The traditional high street model is at risk of being forgotten with online retailers trying their luck at moving into the physical store after making a name for themselves online first,” the report said.

followThe Independent OnlineThe Advertising Standards Authority has intervened in a number of cases were rules have been breached, including one post by Millie MackintoshSocial media stars promoting goods on Instagram, Snapchat and other social media platforms are being probed by the competition regulator over concerns that paid advertisements are not being properly declared.The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) launched an investigation on Tuesday into the labelling of online endorsements.Some celebrities and influencers have a considerable amount of commercial power thanks to millions of followers who watch their channels to see where they go on holiday, what they wear, which products they use, the books they read and more.This makes online endorsements from celebrities and influencers valuable to brands trying to reach target audiences and boost sales.But the watchdog fears some influencers are flouting consumer protection law which requires that any reward received for an endorsement, is made clear.If celebrities do not label their posts properly, fans or followers may be led to believe that an endorsement represents the star’s own view, rather than a paid-for promotion, the CMA\u0026nbspsaid.They are then more likely to place trust in that product than they would otherwise have been, the watchdog said, as they think it has been recommended by someone they admire.The five biggest fashion influencers from this year’s Love IslandThis LA mural is reserved for social media influencersLuxury hotel overwhelmed by influencers asking for free roomsFitness influencer criticised for promoting \u0027dangerous\u0027 diet pillsThe CMA investigation will seek to find whether and to what extent people are being misled by social media posts.Several

this year.George Lusty, the CMA’s Senior director for consumer\u0026nbspprotection, said: Social media stars can have a big influence on what their followers do and buy.If people see clothes, cosmetics, a car, or a holiday being plugged by someone they admire, they might be swayed into buying it.So, it’s really important they are clearly told whether a celebrity is promoting a product because they have bought it themselves, or because they have been paid or thanked in some way by the brand.The\u0026nbspCMA\u0026nbsphas written to a range of celebrities and social media influencers to gather more information about the deals they have with brands.If it finds practices that break consumer protection law, it can take enforcement action.Enter your email addressFill out this

She has adopted four Malawian children and was in the country to celebrate the first anniversary of the Mercy James Centre for Pediatric Surgery and Intensive Care, named after one of her adopted daughtersMadonna and Jean Paul Gaultier arrive for the 2018 Met Gala But there is one area where the older woman is suddenly and somewhat unexpectedly thriving – rock music. Madonna celebrates her 60th birthday on Saturday. Kate Bush has just celebrated hers. In fact, they are the spring chickens. Suzi Quatro, 68, and Patti Smith, 71, are not just still rocking, they are still snarling. Cher at 72 pops up with a delightful cameo in the Mamma Mia!\u0026nbspmovie. The queen of soul, Aretha Franklin, is still recording at 76.\u0026nbspWho’d have thought it? Look back to the 1960s and there were precious few women at all in pop music, let alone older ones. In the UK, Sandie Shaw, Dusty Springfield, Marianne Faithfull and a handful of others carried the fight to the mass of male groups (the word boyband had yet to be invented).No one thought then about whether the stars would still be recording and performing in old age. Indeed the concept was unthinkable – for men as well as women, for stars as well as fans. When I put it to Paul McCartney that he must be surprised to be still going, he replied: “I do rub my eyes. I didn’t foresee it. In The Beatles we always said 10 years. But it kept on and kept on and it kept being good and we seemed to be the people who could do it. Now there is a great young generation of people who can also do it, but it tends to be that the people packing them in are the people who have the material, have hits, songs people know, and I think that’s important. I think they have stagecraft, they have an ability with an audience.”There’s no doubting that the likes of Madonna and Kate Bush have stagecraft in spades. Even in an industry that ostensibly prizes youthfulness and a certain amount of athleticism on stage, the female superstars, like the male, are now gliding into pensionable age, with fan bases, voices, charisma and downright sexiness still intact.\u0026nbspThough, when it comes to longevity, the women themselves didn’t always think it would be the case. Joni Mitchell once remarked, all too despondently: “Record companies want the look. And if you’re over 50, however well preserved, you just don’t have the look.”Maybe the look, or audience perception of the look, has changed. No one remotely cared that Kate Bush looked older than they remembered her (quelle surprise) when she made her stage comeback after 35 years in 2014. And tickets were inevitably like gold dust. I was there to note that she sounded the same, and she still exuded charisma and stage presence.She did a staggering run of 22 performances. Two things perhaps attested to the more mature Kate. The show was only part rock concert, it was also part theatre with video and dance, and even the odd comedy sketch starring her son. Also, she gave all her audiences an instruction on her website, which bore witness to the fact that she comes from an earlier generation than today’s performers. She wrote: “I very much want to have contact with you as an audience, not with iPhones, iPads or cameras.”Suzi, 68,\u0026nbspsays she\u0027ll \u0027retire when I go on stage, shake my ass and there is\u0026nbspsilence\u0027 (Getty)\u0026nbspEarlier this year I witnessed the return to live performance of Annie Lennox, at the age of 63. To raise funds for her charity she did a one-off show which was largely a chat show, interspersed with the odd song at the piano, going through her life and career. The self-deprecating humour was erting: “When I was studying at the Royal Academy of Music, I lived on £3 a week.” Pause. “Scottish people can do that.” Pause. “And we like it.”Perhaps she had stumbled across the format for the older star, a chat show setting interspersed with the odd song. Except, at the end that she knocked everyone there for six with a breathtaking 30 minute performance of Eurythmics and solo hits that showed she retained all her talent. She was the epitome of soul as she belted out Eurythmics anthems, sometimes crawling sensuously across the floor as she did so. The only surprise was that she had (lamentably) eschewed live performance for 10 years.For some female legends, the routine can be tiring. I was at Marianne Faithfull’s most recent London appearance, an intimate show at Ronnie Scott’s jazz club. Plagued by a variety of physical problems over the years, she had a walking stick and performed most of the show sitting down. It was nevertheless a beguiling evening. But notably at one point she actually pleaded with her fans to allow her to retire. “Please let me go,” she said, “I can’t go on for ever. I’m not Keith,” referring to her long-time friend Keith Richards of The Rolling Stones, definitely not one of life’s quitters.Madonna, too, is not one of life’s quitters. Her fitness routine keeps her more than show-ready, even for a show as heavy on breathless choreography as hers. But I think there is another clue to her longevity in what she said to the audience at one of her shows that I attended 15 years ago. Just before her final encore, she said in idiosyncratic style: “When I was a girl I always thought ‘grown-ups can f**k off’. But now I’m 45 years old, I have children of my own, and you know what, grown-ups can still f**k off!”As I say, it was a piece of philosophy delivered in her personal style. But it perhaps partly explains her longevity and continuing appeal. She retains the anarchic spirit she had when she burst on the scene. Female rock stars, just like their male counterparts, and possibly more so, have no intention of growing old gracefully. They haven’t just retained their vocal prowess and stage presence, they have retained the hint of adolescent rebelliousness that has always been an intrinsic part of rock’s appeal. And having met both Madonna and Suzi Quatro, I can attest that in both cases the aggressive, in yer face attitude is not just a stage technique.But rock-star rebelliousness is not the only reason that rock and pop’s biggest female stars go on and on or come back after long absences. Kate Bush was never keen on playing live and before her comeback had only done one tour of the country. But she was persuaded to perform again by her teenage son. As she had a song on one album about watching his clothes go round and round in the washing machine, it was clear that a request from him would, fortunately, carry weight.Victoria Beckham is, of course, far from the vintage of Bush, Madonna and the other older stars. But when the Spice Girls had their reunion tour, it’s interesting that she said the key reason she wanted to do it was that her children had seen Dad play football and knew all about his skills. Now was a chance for them “to see what Mummy did” before they were born.Performing for a global audience is important. But performing for the family clearly also is a factor in keeping the career going.Jonathan Morrish, a long-time senior executive at Sony record company, and now a music industry PR consultant, says: “Women generally live longer than men, so it should come as no surprise that so many as they get older seem to flourish creatively with their music and on stage. None of this is easy. I know from the many artists that I have worked with you need tenacity. So perhaps it’s the staying power they had to show at the beginning of their careers, perhaps a savvy emotional intelligence –\u0026nbspwhatever it is, I admire and welcome it. And applaud them.”\u0026nbspAnd even for those female rock and pop stars who have decided to call it a day, a new avenue has opened up: the stage musical. Right now in London, audiences can see Tina Turner on stage at one theatre, and The Supremes and all the other Motown stars at another. Or at least, one can enjoy their music and life stories, delivered by lookalikes and sound-alikes. It’s possible not just to go on into old age, but literally forever.Faithfull pleaded with a crowd at Ronnie Scotts: \u0027Please let me go. I\u0026nbspcan’t go on for ever. I’m not Keith\u0027 (Alamy)Meanwhile, there is a core of\u0026nbsp 60- and 70- something female rock stars, who thankfully show no signs of even thinking about stopping and relying on musicals to seal their immortality.No one puts it better than Suzi Quatro, celebrating 54 years in the business, who states: “I will retire when I go on stage, shake my ass and there is silence.”David Lister is the former arts editor of The IndependentEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/10/16/south-africa-school.jpg","title":"south africa corruption president ramaphosa mabuza zuma anc","story":"Created with Sketch.The ruling African National Congress pledges education and opportunity\u0026nbspfor black people\u0026nbsp– but embezzlement in the\u0026nbspdeputy president’s province has left schools so decrepit that children plunge to their death in toiletsClick to followThe Independent OnlineSchool at Orange Farm, near Soweto: one of the ANC’s policies is to improve education for black South African childrenZiyanda\u0026nbspNkosi hated going to the bathroom at school. The pit toilets were so dark, dirty and crumbling. Many children were so afraid of them that they simply relieved themselves in the schoolyard to avoid the ordeal.But as she played with her best friend during recess, the little girl, a six-year-old first-grader, really had to go. She stepped warily inside the closet-like latrine.Even with the gentle pressure of her tiny frame, the floor caved in. Ziyanda flailed wildly, clinging to the edges of the hole, frantically trying to keep herself from falling in and drowning in the fetid pool below.“Mommy! Mommy!” she screamed, managing to hold on long enough for an older boy to run in and save her.Hundreds of parents, enraged that their warnings about the dilapidated school had been ignored for years, burst into protest a couple of days later, upending their quiet rural town for two weeks last August. They burned tires, blocked roads and demanded justice from the provincial government led by David Mabuza, a former maths teacher who had become one of the most powerful figures in the African National Congress (ANC) and was positioning himself to become South Africa’s deputy president.One of the party’s historic promises had been to provide a good education for black people, who had been deliberately denied the opportunity under apartheid. ANC leaders like Nelson Mandela often spoke about freeing black South Africans through school\u0026nbspand Mabuza, whose first big post in the province was education minister, got his political start by promising just that.But under the ANC the education system has been a\u0026nbspshambles, so gutted by corruption that even party officials are dismayed at how little students are learning, in schools so decrepit that children have plunged to their deaths in pit toilets.The rage in Ziyanda’s town grew so intense that protesters hurled stones at a local ANC leader, who narrowly escaped by whipping out his handgun and shooting randomly into the crowd, wounding two children and roiling the community all the more.Mabuza never came to the school or met with the parents –\u0026nbspand for good reason, local officials contend. The dangerous conditions were a clear reflection of his control over the province, where millions of dollars for education have disappeared into a vortex of suspicious spending, shoddy public construction and brazen corruption to fuel his political ambitions, according to government records and officials in his party.But the uprising and allegations against Mabuza did not crimp his political rise. To the contrary, only a few months later, as the ANC tried to quash national outrage over misrule by its leaders, Mabuza scored his biggest triumph by far. He was picked to become second-in-command of the entire ANC, launching him into an even more prominent post\u0026nbspas South Africa’s deputy president, second only to the nation’s leader.Mabuza may seem an odd choice, especially at a time when the ANC is desperate to purge its reputation for graft and restore its image as the rightful heir to Mandela’s legacy. After all, Mabuza’s rural province, Mpumalanga, is fairly small, has little economic clout and is widely regarded as one of the country’s most corrupt.But that is the vexing secret behind Mabuza’s spectacular climb, current and former ANC officials say: he siphoned off money from schools and other public services to buy loyalty and amass enormous power, making him impossible to ignore on the national stage and putting him in position to shape South Africa for years to come.Mabuza (second right) (AFPGetty)“He didn’t become what he is now because of his political capability,” says\u0026nbspFish Mahlalela, a senior ANC figure in the province and a national lawmaker.“No, no, it was out of money and\u0026nbspmanipulation,” he adds. “Nothing else.”Perhaps more than any other member of South Africa’s new government, Mabuza undercuts the promise of a “new dawn” in the country after the removal of President Jacob Zuma this year.Besieged by scandals that have hacked away at the ANC’s legitimacy and electoral prospects, the party installed a new president, Cyril Ramaphosa, in February. From the start, he pledged to root out corruption and finally deliver on the promise of a just South Africa for all of its citizens.But to seal his new post, Ramaphosa first had to secure the backing of Mabuza, 57, who built such a formidable political machine that he became kingmaker in the back-room negotiations to choose South Africa’s new president. After campaigning for a rival, Mabuza abruptly switched sides and joined forces with Ramaphosa, helping the two emerge from a pivotal party conference last December as the country’s undisputed leaders.Then, to the surprise of many in his province, Mabuza gave a speech just weeks after being sworn in as deputy president this year, lamenting the poor state of the schools and the “tragedies that take away the innocence of our children”. He spoke movingly of a kindergartner electrocuted at school. Of a toddler who drowned after falling into a broken pit latrine. And of a five-year-old boy whose body was discovered by his mother at the bottom of another dilapidated pit, his hand sticking out of a pool of faeces.Such deplorable conditions were all too common, he noted, symbolising the failure to provide black South Africans with a decent chance at life.“Where is our care?” Mabuza said in the speech. “What has gone wrong with our nation?”Yet under Mabuza’s leadership, millions of dollars for schools in his province have been misspent year after year, according to the national government. His province routinely spent less on poor students than required\u0026nbspand school construction projects have been riddled with inflated costs, government records show.Nearly a quarter of the primary schools in Mabuza’s province still have only dilapidated pit toilets, despite ample government funds to fix them. And during his tenure, his province was caught fabricating the passing rates on the annual national exam, enabling him to claim big leaps forward that never happened.The schools Mabuza did champion provided an easy way to funnel large amounts of money into politics, according to ANC officials, high-ranking defectors and anti-corruption groups. He pushed to build big boarding schools whose costs tripled\u0026nbspfor unexplained reasons\u0026nbspto $30m (£23m) each, alarming education experts. Some construction was so shoddy that roofs sprouted leaks soon after being finished, toilets barely worked, students lacked water, retaining walls collapsed and dormitories were missing doors, according to a provincial report.Over the years, Mabuza’s province also became known as one of South Africa’s most dangerous. Nearly 20 politicians, most from inside the ANC, were assassinated in the past two decades, some after exposing graft in public works projects.All the while\u0026nbspMabuza’s political career flourished. He attracted legions of new ANC members with government contracts, cash handouts and even KFC meals, according to current and former party officials.His sweeping recruitment drive turned his relatively insignificant province into the ANC’s second biggest voting bloc. Under the party’s delegate system, his territory became more influential than even Gauteng, the province that includes Johannesburg and Pretoria\u0026nbspwith a population three times the size and an economy nearly five times as big.Now, critics contend, Mabuza’s role as the country’s second most powerful politician casts doubt on the legitimacy of the new government and its assertions that the ANC is turning the page on corruption.Under the ANC, Mandela’s once-heralded liberation movement, tens of billions of dollars meant to lift poor black South Africans have been stolen by party leaders. Strong institutions like the tax agency have been hollowed out by party officials bent on shielding their illicit activities.But the nation’s poor schools are perhaps the ANC’s greatest betrayal of the dreams of black South Africans – some of whom have turned to burning down such institutions in protest.Mabuza, who declined to be interviewed, built his political career on the schools. Unlike other, more celebrated anti-apartheid leaders, he did not go into exile he was not imprisoned on the infamous Robben Island. Instead, he fought for the right of black South Africans to receive an equal education, a call he echoed in his recent speech.As many South Africans pin their hopes on Ramaphosa’s pledge for a fresh start, analysts say that much of the country is looking past an unpleasant truth: the new president owes his victory in part to corruption, and much of his administration’s future – as well as the country’s – rests in the hands of Mabuza.“If there is any powerful person whom Ramaphosa’s presidency actually relies on, it is Mabuza,” says\u0026nbspRalph Mathekga, the author of Ramaphosa’s Turn: Can Cyril Save South Africa?“We are being reluctant as a nation to face the reality of Mabuza,” he adds. “If Ramaphosa gets hit by a bus, Mabuza is going to be the president.”Scandal from the startThe numbers just didn’t add up, even at the beginning.After apartheid ended in 1994, Mabuza got his first big break: he became Mpumalanga’s education minister, a chance to shape the schools and generations of students attending them.He had the perfect resume. The son of farmers, Mabuza grew up here in the province, walking miles from his village to the only primary school in a nearby town. Though he often had no shoes, he always tucked in his shirt and buttoned it up to the neck, recalls\u0026nbspReginah Mhaule, a childhood peer.“He was never late,” says\u0026nbspMhaule, a longtime ally who recently became one of South Africa’s two deputy foreign ministers.A bright student, Mabuza ultimately took one of the few jobs available to black South Africans back then. He taught maths at the local high school and later became a founding leader of a teachers’ association.Poor schooling was a major spark in the anti-apartheid movement, most notably in Soweto in 1976, when thousands of students protested the introduction of Afrikaans as the language of instruction. In Mabuza’s province, teachers and students began organising against white minority rule in the early 1980s.The teachers were at the centre\u0026nbspof the movement, says\u0026nbspSandile Sukati, a teacher who recruited Mabuza into the main student organisation. Mabuza quickly stood out, he says, travelling far and wide to build ties among anti-apartheid groups.Museum of London  Henry GrantMuseum of London  Henry GrantA United Nations photograph by Kay MuldoonCourtesy of the News LineCourtesy of the International Defence and Aid Fund for Southern AfricaSATIS (Southern Africa - the Imprisoned Society)Museum of London  Henry GrantMuseum of London  Henry GrantA United Nations photograph by Kay MuldoonCourtesy of the News LineCourtesy of the International Defence and Aid Fund for Southern AfricaSATIS (Southern Africa - the Imprisoned Society)“He was a leader in his own right,” Sukati says.But after apartheid ended, Mabuza quickly ran into trouble, leading to the province’s first big scandal of the democratic era.\u0026nbspIn 1997, three years into his tenure as education minister, the schools were performing poorly, especially on the national obsession: the annual matriculation exams that determine whether students graduate from high school. The passing rate in his province was 46 per cent that year, slightly below the national average.Mabuza was feeling the pressure, particularly as powerful ANC leaders returned from exile, often with military credentials that overshadowed his own, several current and former ANC officials say.Sukati, who worked under Mabuza at the education department, recalls Mabuza\u0026nbsptelling some of the teachers: “I am in a tight situation.”\u0026nbspThe next year brought a stunning improvement. The passing rate inexplicably jumped to 72 per cent – an incredible turnaround that catapulted Mpumalanga to second place\u0026nbspamong the nation’s nine provinces.“I was suspicious,” says\u0026nbspSukati, who is now a senior education official. “It couldn’t just happen like that.”A whistleblower exposed the cheating a few weeks later. The real passing rate, authorities announced, was under 53 per cent. Moreover, the doctoring had taken place inside Mabuza’s residence, where he met with a small circle of bureaucrats, some of whom were later fired.An investigation was never completed. Mabuza never admitted wrongdoing or suffered any significant consequences. Dropped as education minister, he was named head of housing instead.Ever since, Mabuza’s career has been remembered for that scandal, one that helped establish the kind of culture of impunity in his province that has tarnished the ANC across South Africa..“I think\u0026nbspthe man, he had to be charged, but unfortunately I don’t know what went wrong,” says\u0026nbspRonnie Malomane, an ANC official who was taught maths by Mabuza in the early 1980s. “They were just giving him position after position.”Nationally, Mabuza’s standing kept rising, propelled by his success at attracting new party members. In 2009, Zuma appointed him premier of all of Mpumalanga province.But Mabuza raised more red flags, stripping some of the decision-making power over government projects from local officials and concentrating it in his own office. He justified the move – called the “Rapid Implementation Unit” – as a way to act quickly. Others had a different explanation.“That’s how he managed to loot,” says\u0026nbspCollen Sedibe, a former ANC leader who grew up on the same street as Mabuza and worked under him in the provincial housing department.Treasury officials in the province say they are now investigating the irregular expenditures “incurred through the contracts arranged centrally by the Office of the Premier”.But parents, officials and educators had warned about the damage from corruption and neglect for years, pointing to the painfully overcrowded classrooms and decaying, apartheid-era schools.‘They wanted to kill me’It took four days of rage before the local ANC councillor showed up.The councillor, Justice Twelve Siboza, explained that he had been busy the week Ziyanda fell into the toilet, tending to another corner of his ward. Other activities had also drawn his attention: he is a gospel singer with his own radio show, so he crisscrosses the region to perform at weddings and funerals.By the time he got to Ziyanda’s school, hundreds of parents had closed off the unpaved roads, furious that their grievances had been met with near silence from the ANC’s leaders.Siboza made sure to bring a gun. Politics is dangerous in South Africa, sometimes lethal, he says.The ANC has a grip on the area around the school because most residents, aside from the lucky few working at the sugar cane plant, are poor and rely on the party for government jobs, contracts or monthly welfare grants.It is an area Mabuza knows well. He began his ascent inside the ANC as the head of this part of the province. It was once part of a homeland set aside for black people by the apartheid government. To this day, several ANC officials say, Mabuza has kept a hold on it through powerful proxies.Some see a deep cynicism behind the conditions in the schools. When black South Africans become educated and move into the middle class, their loyalty to the party tends to wane, recent elections have shown. So by perpetuating a culture of dependence, critics contend, the ANC ensures its dominance.But Mhaule, the childhood peer of Mabuza, rejects\u0026nbspany suggestion that the ANC had failed to prioritise education.Officials like Mhaule say the rising pass rate on the national high school exam provides clear evidence of progress. But the figures can be misleading. The number of students taking the exam has declined in the past two years. Weaker students who would drag down the rate are being held back, education experts say.About 600 protesters gathered at the school that cold Friday morning when Siboza, the local ANC councillor, arrived with a police escort. As he moved to talk to the parents, demonstrators showered him with rocks.“They wanted to kill me,” the councillor says.Siboza made a run for it, reaching for the hip holster under his brown overcoat. He took out his gun – firing three times and hitting two teenagers, a girl and a boy.Agreement Mashele, the school board chairman, was shocked. “This man is a church member,” he says.A few days later, the ANC councillor visited the children he had wounded.“The councillor said he was very sorry,” says\u0026nbspthe girl, Siphesihle Ngobeni, whose left leg was grazed by a bullet. The councillor pleaded with her not to press charges and gave her about $15, she says. She used the money to buy sanitary pads.The boy’s injury was more severe. His father, Petros Thobela, who had gone to the same primary school and did not have a job, accepted a similar apology and compensation of, according to the councillor, about $150.The boy’s mother, Nobuhle Ndlovu, who does odd jobs, deplores\u0026nbspthe state of education.“They promise,” she says, “and they just disappear.”Still, she would remain loyal to the governing party.“Yes, of course, I vote ANC,” she says. “It’s our freedom.”‘He always had money in his house’The protests spilled into September, but the country’s attention was fixed on another battle: the national push to replace Zuma as South Africa’s president.The all-important ANC party election was only a few months away, and officials in Mabuza’s province were bracing to see whether his years of hard work had paid off.In early October, the ANC released the delegate breakdown, with good news for Mabuza: his previously low-ranking province was now the ANC’s second most powerful.Mabuza owed his outsize influence to a single feat. In the past decade, ANC membership in his province had skyrocketed nearly 190 per cent, eclipsing the national increase of less than 60 per cent. No other province came close to matching Mpumalanga’s explosive growth.But Mabuza’s numbers were as cooked as his high school passing rates, current and former ANC officials contend.In South Africa, taxes are collected by the national government, which distributes the money to provinces. The provinces then use the money – with little oversight from above.Treasury officials in Mpumalanga say that “irregular expenditures” more than doubled in the previous two budget years, particularly in education, housing and health.Wages account for most of the education and health budgets. So money is usually siphoned off by politicians and business allies through contracts for services or construction, ANC officials say. When costs are suspiciously high, schools are poorly built or facilities are badly maintained, they say, it is often a warning that money is being skimmed, at the students’ expense.Thousands in Israel protest draft law that would ‘exclude’ ArabsGrenfell victims were subject to ‘social apartheid’, says Diane AbbottSouth Africa is the most unequal country in the world, says World BankMandela’s letters chart his heartbreaking struggle from behind barsAs premier, Mabuza promoted the construction of big boarding schools, or mega-schools, in farm areas to improve rural education. Since 2012, the province has completed five, with two more in the pipeline.For reasons that have not been explained, the price of each school has ballooned from $11m to around $30m.Asked whether Mabuza wanted the mega-schools to facilitate the theft of public funds, Mhaule, his former education minister, laughs\u0026nbspand says:\u0026nbsp“I don’t know.”But other officials say the mega-schools were overpriced projects to reward Mabuza’s allies and finance his ANC membership drive.Mabuza\u0026nbspwas sworn in as deputy president in February. “His passion,” reads his official biography, “still remains in education.”Minutes after the swearing-in, he faced questions about corruption and political killings in his province. “There’s nothing to set straight,” he told the national public broadcaster.“I’m here to serve South Africans,” he added. “Let’s give this government a chance.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click

brands trying to reach target audiences and boost sales.But the watchdog fears some influencers are flouting consumer protection law which requires that any reward received for an endorsement, is made clear.If celebrities do not label their posts properly, fans or followers may be led to believe that an endorsement represents the star’s own view, rather than a paid-for promotion, the

taken down the survey from his websiteA senior Conservative minister ran a survey on his website asking constituents whether they want a new referendum on Brexit.Foreign Office minister Alistair Burt asked both if people backed a fresh referendum and what options should be covered on the ballot paper.He was later forced to clarify that he was not supporting another public vote on Brexit, which would constitute a major break from Theresa May’s official stance, but was merely using the survey to discover what voters in his constituency thought.It comes as polls show fast increasing support for a new referendum, amid deepening Tory isions over withdrawal, doubts that Ms May can secure parliamentary backing for her plans and meagre public support for her approach.The Independent has launched its own campaign for a new referendum which would give the British public the Final Say on whatever Brexit outcome emerges.After asking constituents in the survey whether they backed a “further vote”, Mr Burt, an advocate of Remain in 2016, asked which options should be on the ballot paper of a new referendum including, a vote on the final deal, a re-run of the original or a three-way vote – soft Brexit, hard Brexit or remaining in.He later said: “I don’t support a second referendum as any constituents who have written to me about it know.“But how am I to know who thinks what unless I ask?”Ms May has been adamant that there will not be a further referendum on Brexit, despite the growing tide of opinion in favour of one, meaning ministers wanting to publically back one would likely have to resign their posts.British expats in the EU launch High Court bid to overturn Brexit50:50 chance of a no-deal Brexit, says Latvian foreign ministerA no-deal Brexit would be a

forcing up wages in some sectorsIn a further statement on his website, Mr Burt said the survey had now been taken down, highlighted his previous opposition to a new referendum, said there is “no going back” on the first referendum and underlined that he is fully behind the prime minister’s efforts to find a Brexit deal.But the move still provoked some anger from Brexit-backing MPs, with one telling The Independent he was not convinced by Mr Burt’s explanation that he was merely canvassing public opinion.North West Leicestershire MP Andrew Bridgen said: “I’m a bit puzzled because as a member of the government he is bound by collective responsibility.“I wasn’t aware it was government policy to canvass people on another referendum, especially as we haven’t fulfilled the will of the people on the first referendum yet.”Rees-Mogg suggests a second Brexit referendum would be acceptable in clip from 2011If he did back a new vote on Brexit, Mr Burt would not be the first senior Conservative to do so, with ex-cabinet ministers Justine Greening and Dominic Grieve both having written for The Independent in support of one.The Final Say campaign petition now has some 615,000 signatures after being launched just three weeks ago.An exclusive poll carried out by BMG Research this week found that 48 per cent of the public would now back a vote on any deal struck between the UK and the EU – up from 44 per cent just four weeks ago.Just 24 per cent opposed the idea, down three points over the same period. Only 14 per cent of the 1,500 people surveyed supported Ms May’s chequers deal given a choice.It comes as members of the Brexit-backing Tory backbench organisation, the European Research Group, is said to be drawing up its alternative to Ms May’s proposals, highlighting the benefits of a no-deal Brexit.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/11/12/AFP-15V57T.jpg","title":"brexit referendum no deal snp poll yougov peoples vote jeremy corbyn nicola sturgeon","story":"Created with Sketch.Pollster Peter Kellner says survey suggests both Jeremy Corbyn and Nicola Sturgeon\u0027s party are \u0027in the wrong place with most of their supporters\u0027Click to followIndy PoliticsThe Independent launched its campaign to win a Final Say Brexit referendum for the British people just three weeks ago – with more than 610,000 people signing the petition so farLabour and the SNP in Scotland are under pressure to adopt a stronger stance on Brexit as a new poll shows Scottish voters strongly support a fresh referendum on the final deal.The YouGov survey for the People’s Vote campaign – calling for a public vote on the deal Theresa May returns from Brussels with – found that 48 per cent of respondents were in favour of the idea, with 31 per cent opposed.While the SNP’s leader Nicola Sturgeon has previously said the case for a second vote may become “irresistible”, the party does not support the policy and Jeremy Corbyn\u0026nbsphas repeatedly said Labour is not backing the idea.Why has John McDonnell\u0027s constituency changed its mind on Brexit?Senior Conservative asks constituents if they want new Brexit voteBritish expats in the EU launch High Court bid to overturn Brexit50:50 chance of a no-deal Brexit, says Latvian foreign ministerPeter Kellner, former president of pollster YouGov, said the new poll suggested\u0026nbspboth party leaders were “in the wrong place with most of their supporters” and claimed their could be electoral benefits to reap if either party strengthened their position on Brexit.The Independent launched its campaign to win a Final Say Brexit referendum for the British people just three weeks ago – with more than 610,000 people signing the petition so far.Researchers, who surveyed 2,013 adults in Scotland, found rising support for staying in the European Union.

It is unclear whether the North Korean leader responded.When Mr Peskov was asked whether the two leaders could meet in Vlaostok, he said the economic forum is\u0026nbsp”open for all the leaders of the region” but said Moscow has “so far” received no confirmation\u0026nbspfrom Pyongyang to indicate Mr Kim\u0026nbspwill attend.Mr Kim also sent a message to Mr Putin, KCNA reported, noting the “valuable tradition” as they “struggled shoulder to shoulder against the common enemy in the arduous anti-Japanese war”, which it said provided the “strong roots” for their diplomatic relations.It was unclear if the message came before or after Mr Putin’s invitation.It comes as North Korea marked its liberation from Japanese rule\u0026nbspwith relatively low-key celebrations.A group of war veterans from the former Soviet Union participated and thousands of people cheered their football team to victory over a South Korean squad in the opening match of an under-15 youth tournament in Pyongyang, which featured players from several countries.People also streamed to statues of the country’s leaders or other monuments to observe the anniversary, as is customary.Escape from North KoreaA hat belonging to Jeong Min-woo in Seoul. Min-woo is from Hyesan, on the border with China. He was a commissioned officer in the Korean People\u0027s Army, and left in his uniform. South Korean intelligence confiscated it, but he persuaded his North Korean military contacts to send him a new one.Jeong Min-woo, 29, poses for a photograph in SeoulKang, 28, who wanted to be identified only by her surname, poses for a photograph in Seoul. The parents of Kang sent out a coat across the Chinese border after she reached the South in 2010. I didn\u0027t ask my mother to send me this coat, said Kang. But she knew I feel the cold easily and sent it to me. She sent some honey too, but it went missing on the way. The coat is made of dog fur. I don\u0027t know what kind of dog. In 2010, it cost about 700,000 North Korean won ($88 at the unofficial rate). It was really expensive. A North Korean friend went to China to pick it up for me. I liked this coat when I got it. I thought my mother must\u0027ve spent quite a lot of money on it.  The dog fur coat belonging to Kang, My father was a party officer. Our family had a car and we lived in a special apartment. Ordinary people couldn\u0027t afford to wear this kind of coat, not even soldiers. Commissioned officers could afford them. Border guards would wear them. It wasn\u0027t easy to buy this kind of coat, but as time went on, fake ones began to appear. The state often clamped down on this item. It\u0027s technically military supplies so the state monitored people who altered the design of the coat. I know just from looking at this coat that it\u0027s a counterfeit one, not the official version. The counterfeit ones look quite different from the original ones. Military officials preferred the fakes to the original because the design looked much better. The children of rich families would wear them. I look too chubby in this, so don\u0027t wear it here. I thought I could probably wear it if I altered it.Lee Oui-ryuk is from Onsong, near the border with China. He defected in 2010, and brought his ID card with him. I brought my ID with me when I left North Korea. Juche 95.11.7 (the date in the North Korean calendar, which equates to Nov. 7, 2006) is the date I was issued with my ID. It says here my blood type is A, but I\u0027m actually an O. For the 23 years I lived in North Korea, I thought my blood type was A. They wrote down my blood type without even doing a test. They just wrote whatever they wanted to. I was caught trying to defect to South Korea around Kim Jong Il\u0027s birthday. They strengthen border security just before and after that date.The bottom of the lamp is dark, as the saying goes, and I thought I\u0027d be able to cross right under their noses. The soldiers shot at me as I tried to run away from the Tumen River. I managed to get away and hid, but someone reported me and I was caught. That\u0027s when I was taken to the bowibu (North Korean secret police) for three months of interrogation. The state ruled that I had tried to defect to South Korea, and I was sent to a camp for political prisoners. I escaped when they were transferring me to the camp. I hid and managed to make it to my big sister\u0027s house - that\u0027s when I grabbed these photos. I couldn\u0027t go home easily, so decided I had to hide in the mountains or somewhere remote. I needed my ID to move around without getting caught. and I took these 12 photos with me in case I wanted to look back and reminisce. I wrote on the back of them so as not to forget.Ji Sung-ho, 35, from Hoeryong, near the border with China. He left North Korea in 2006 with a pair of wooden crutches. I lived as a child beggar in North Korea. I was stealing coals from a train when I fell off and lost my leg and my hand. I had to bring the crutches with me. If I didn\u0027t have them, I wouldn\u0027t have made it here. The state doesn\u0027t help you in North Korea, and people who need crutches make their own. Mine are therefore not factory-made, so they\u0027re not perfect and break easily. I had several pairs of crutches but they all broke, and this was the last pair. I used these crutches for 10 years, until I was 25, when I arrived in South Korea. I would steal coal from moving trains and fall off, destroying my crutches. Or I would get beaten up by the police and they\u0027d take and then break my crutches. When they broke, I would make new ones. When I had new ones, I could go back outside.When I first arrived in South Korea I thought about throwing them out. South Korea\u0027s intelligence agency gave me a prosthetic leg. My friends said I should throw the crutches out and not think about North Korea. They said I should show Kim Jong Il I was living a new life in South Korea and throw out everything I had from the North. Some asked if I got upset when I saw my crutches. But I couldn\u0027t just throw them out. To make my crutches, my friends had given me some wood that they had bought, and someone I knew in North Korea who had carpentry skills had made them. It was my father who added the final touches. There is a lot of love from my North Korean friends and family in these crutches. So I didn\u0027t throw them out. The South Korean government gave me some new crutches because the wood from my North Korean ones is hard and painful. But I still keep them, so as not to forget those memories. Kim Ryen Hui, 48, is from Pyongyang. She says she never wanted to defect. In 2011, she says, a broker helped her go to China for treatment on her liver. But the broker tricked her, she said, and she ended up in South Korea. She is campaigning to return, which Seoul says would be against the law. I miss my parents even more than I miss my daughter. They\u0027re everything to me. For the first few years, I couldn\u0027t even breathe properly when I thought of them. My little brother lives with them in Pyongyang now. My mother can\u0027t see out of one eye. The thing I fear the most is finding out they\u0027ve passed away before I have the chance to go back. My daughter and I have been writing letters and sending photos to each other. My cousin lives in China, so she\u0027s been sending them on. My daughter\u0027s name is Ri Ryon Gum. She was born on February 15, 1993. I don\u0027t want her to live out her life with me here. When she was young, she did taekwondo. She wanted to get involved in espionage operations against South Korea. She was so fearless. That\u0027s why she was doing taekwondo - to get involved in anti-South espionage. So I was really surprised to hear she became a chef. In a video of her I received, she explained why. She said that after I had left, she moved in with her father in Pyongyang and had been cooking for him. She said she decided to become a chef so she could fulfill my role at home. I was sad when I heard that.Lee Min-bok, 60, was a researcher at North Korea\u0027s Academy of Agricultural Science. He first tried to defect, unsuccessfully, in 1990. He eventually left North Korea in June 1991 and came to South Korea in 1995. His family sent him these diaries. I have a bit of an academic side. According to Kim Il Sung\u0027s teachings, people are supposed to keep diaries. Everyone in North Korea should strictly follow Kim Il Sung\u0027s teachings, so I did as I was supposed to and kept a diary. Even though Kim Il Sung is a villain here, in North Korea he\u0027s above everything. We learned that he studied well and gave our lives purpose. I lived according to those teachings. I wrote these out of loyalty to the Leader. That was our ideology, and I lived my life in strict adherence to it. No one could think differently.I got hold of these diaries 10 years after I arrived in South Korea. I had been sending money to my family in the North and they sent them to me. I didn\u0027t write any complaints in diaries. I would\u0027ve been in big trouble if I did. My diaries are a record of my history in North Korea. I am thinking about turning these diaries into a book. I\u0027d like to publish a book about how to change North Koreans\u0027 thinking when unification happens. These diaries show how North Koreans think and how their minds are constructed. People need to make these into a textbook, because they need proof. Talking is not as effective.Song Byeok was a propaganda artist. His father drowned trying to cross the Tumen river, in 2000. When the artist finally left North Korea in 2001, he brought photos of his family with him. We left that August to find food, Byeok recalled, describing the first attempt. We were from a town further inland, and we weren\u0027t sure where the river was high and where it was low. I didn\u0027t know at the time but the river was swollen because of the rainy season. I thought we had to cross it anyway. All I could think about was getting to China to buy food. I took off my clothes and tied them into a rope to strap us together. I told my father not to let go. As we approached the middle of the river, the strap felt lighter. I looked back and saw my father drifting away. I was devastated.He was going under the water and couldn\u0027t get out. I rushed up to the (North Korean) border guards and asked them to save him but they just said why did I come out, why didn\u0027t I die too. They handcuffed me and took me away. It was Aug. 28. I was tortured by the bowibu (North Korean secret police) in Hoeryong, then jailed for four months in Chongjin prison camp. But after I was released from the camp I felt like I needed to survive and carry on living. Right before I tried to defect again, I went back home and grabbed my family photos. Even if I died trying, I thought, at least I would have this picture with me. I never found my father. After I came to South Korea, I went back to China in 2004 and held a memorial service for him by the river. My heart still aches.Baek Hwa-sung, 33, left Sinuiju, on the border with China, in 2003 and resettled in South Korea in 2008. He kept a diary as he defected. In 2004, I started to write down all my thoughts in a diary. I didn\u0027t know if I\u0027d get caught. I just wanted to let it be known where I was from, and where I wanted to go. After I left the North, I became very depressed, hiding in the mountains alone for a while. The people who were watching over me told me not to come down to the village and left me by myself in a mountain shelter. Alone, with no one to engage with or talk to, I felt like I would go insane. So I wanted to leave something behind in case I died there or got caught - that\u0027s why I started to write.Alone in the mountains, I desperately sought something to talk to. That was my diary. My diaries are proof of my life\u0027s journey. I read them when I want to remember home. I can\u0027t return home, and I already have no memories of my hometown. But when I go through my diaries, there are notes which detail the vivid memories of that time. Sometimes I might forget my father\u0027s birthday, but when I go back to my diary, his birthday and my mother\u0027s birthday are there. My diaries are a record of my life. They prove I\u0027m alive.A hat belonging to Jeong Min-woo in Seoul. Min-woo is from Hyesan, on the border with China. He was a commissioned officer in the Korean People\u0027s Army, and left in his uniform. South Korean intelligence confiscated it, but he persuaded his North Korean military contacts to send him a new one.Jeong Min-woo, 29, poses for a photograph in SeoulKang, 28, who wanted to be identified only by her surname, poses for a photograph in Seoul. The parents of Kang sent out a coat across the Chinese border after she reached the South in 2010. I didn\u0027t ask my mother to send me this coat, said Kang. But she knew I feel the cold easily and sent it to me. She sent some honey too, but it went missing on the way. The coat is made of dog fur. I don\u0027t know what kind of dog. In 2010, it cost about 700,000 North Korean won ($88 at the unofficial rate). It was really expensive. A North Korean friend went to China to pick it up for me. I liked this coat when I got it. I thought my mother must\u0027ve spent quite a lot of money on it.  The dog fur coat belonging to Kang, My father was a party officer. Our family had a car and we lived in a special apartment. Ordinary people couldn\u0027t afford to wear this kind of coat, not even soldiers. Commissioned officers could afford them. Border guards would wear them. It wasn\u0027t easy to buy this kind of coat, but as time went on, fake ones began to appear. The state often clamped down on this item. It\u0027s technically military supplies so the state monitored people who altered the design of the coat. I know just from looking at this coat that it\u0027s a counterfeit one, not the official version. The counterfeit ones look quite different from the original ones. Military officials preferred the fakes to the original because the design looked much better. The children of rich families would wear them. I look too chubby in this, so don\u0027t wear it here. I thought I could probably wear it if I altered it.Lee Oui-ryuk is from Onsong, near the border with China. He defected in 2010, and brought his ID card with him. I brought my ID with me when I left North Korea. Juche 95.11.7 (the date in the North Korean calendar, which equates to Nov. 7, 2006) is the date I was issued with my ID. It says here my blood type is A, but I\u0027m actually an O. For the 23 years I lived in North Korea, I thought my blood type was A. They wrote down my blood type without even doing a test. They just wrote whatever they wanted to. I was caught trying to defect to South Korea around Kim Jong Il\u0027s birthday. They strengthen border security just before and after that date.The bottom of the lamp is dark, as the saying goes, and I thought I\u0027d be able to cross right under their noses. The soldiers shot at me as I tried to run away from the Tumen River. I managed to get away and hid, but someone reported me and I was caught. That\u0027s when I was taken to the bowibu (North Korean secret police) for three months of interrogation. The state ruled that I had tried to defect to South Korea, and I was sent to a camp for political prisoners. I escaped when they were transferring me to the camp. I hid and managed to make it to my big sister\u0027s house - that\u0027s when I grabbed these photos. I couldn\u0027t go home easily, so decided I had to hide in the mountains or somewhere remote. I needed my ID to move around without getting caught. and I took these 12 photos with me in case I wanted to look back and reminisce. I wrote on the back of them so as not to forget.Ji Sung-ho, 35, from Hoeryong, near the border with China. He left North Korea in 2006 with a pair of wooden crutches. I lived as a child beggar in North Korea. I was stealing coals from a train when I fell off and lost my leg and my hand. I had to bring the crutches with me. If I didn\u0027t have them, I wouldn\u0027t have made it here. The state doesn\u0027t help you in North Korea, and people who need crutches make their own. Mine are therefore not factory-made, so they\u0027re not perfect and break easily. I had several pairs of crutches but they all broke, and this was the last pair. I used these crutches for 10 years, until I was 25, when I arrived in South Korea. I would steal coal from moving trains and fall off, destroying my crutches. Or I would get beaten up by the police and they\u0027d take and then break my crutches. When they broke, I would make new ones. When I had new ones, I could go back outside.When I first arrived in South Korea I thought about throwing them out. South Korea\u0027s intelligence agency gave me a prosthetic leg. My friends said I should throw the crutches out and not think about North Korea. They said I should show Kim Jong Il I was living a new life in South Korea and throw out everything I had from the North. Some asked if I got upset when I saw my crutches. But I couldn\u0027t just throw them out. To make my crutches, my friends had given me some wood that they had bought, and someone I knew in North Korea who had carpentry skills had made them. It was my father who added the final touches. There is a lot of love from my North Korean friends and family in these crutches. So I didn\u0027t throw them out. The South Korean government gave me some new crutches because the wood from my North Korean ones is hard and painful. But I still keep them, so as not to forget those memories. Kim Ryen Hui, 48, is from Pyongyang. She says she never wanted to defect. In 2011, she says, a broker helped her go to China for treatment on her liver. But the broker tricked her, she said, and she ended up in South Korea. She is campaigning to return, which Seoul says would be against the law. I miss my parents even more than I miss my daughter. They\u0027re everything to me. For the first few years, I couldn\u0027t even breathe properly when I thought of them. My little brother lives with them in Pyongyang now. My mother can\u0027t see out of one eye. The thing I fear the most is finding out they\u0027ve passed away before I have the chance to go back. My daughter and I have been writing letters and sending photos to each other. My cousin lives in China, so she\u0027s been sending them on. My daughter\u0027s name is Ri Ryon Gum. She was born on February 15, 1993. I don\u0027t want her to live out her life with me here. When she was young, she did taekwondo. She wanted to get involved in espionage operations against South Korea. She was so fearless. That\u0027s why she was doing taekwondo - to get involved in anti-South espionage. So I was really surprised to hear she became a chef. In a video of her I received, she explained why.

Cyclists should face same punishment as drivers, says motoring lawyer                 Car tax changes could see YOU charged based on the amount of miles ...The revised energy labels for tyres strengthen the requirements on fuel efficiency, noise and safety, and will apply to tyres on all road-using vehicles including cars, vans and lorries.EU officials say the new labelling will be beneficial for the environment by increasing fuel efficiency and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\u0026nbsp It will lead to CO2 savings equivalent of removing almost four million passenger cars from EU roads per year by 2030, according to Brussels estimates.The RAC last night backed the new labelling system. RAC spokesman Simon Williams said: \u0026ldquoStrengthening the tyre labelling regulations is good news for UK motorists and road safety generally.Currently, there is no requirement for tyre fitters to show labels at the point of purchase so motorists are oblivious to the pros and cons of the tyres they are buying.As a result few motorists are shown the labels when buying tyres, leaving them completely in the dark about the three ratings of fuel efficiency, wet grip and passing noise.Updating the regulations should fix this by making it mandatory for tyre labels to be shown to motorists in all situations.\u0026ldquoInformation on tyres\u0026rsquo snow and ice performance is going to be included which will be very beneficial.The labels are also being future-proofed as the amended regulations allow for the addition of other useful information such as ratings for mileage, wear and a potential indication for re-treaded tyres.

Less heat in a solar minimum is due to a decrease in magnetic waves.The sun was not expected to head into a solar minimum until around 2020, but it appears to be heading in earlySpace Weather says: \u0026ldquoThe phenomenon could be linked to solar minimum, now underway. It is notable that the coldest and wettest years in the mesosphere prior to 2018 were 2008-2009\u0026ndashthe previous minimum of the 11-year solar cycle.\u0026ldquoAnother possibility involves planetary wave activity in the southern hemisphere which can, ironically, boost the upwelling of water vapour tens of thousands of miles away in the north.

Don’t they know many thousands of people agree with him? Or do they chose to again ignore the people of this country? Any movement on Boris from the out-of-touch Government will cost them dear.SO Dominic Grieve has threatened to quit Parliament if Boris Johnson became PM. I can think of no better reason for wishing him success.BANG on Boris, about the burka. It being worn in public is scary for children who see it.FREEDOM of speech must not be compromised – and there can be no question of legal action being taken against Boris Johnson, it would be prejudiced by all the attacks on him.THIS week it has been especially hard to be a Muslim woman. Apparently I am not getting the joke, I’m over sensitive, bullied, oppressed, unintegrated, politically motivated, dividing Britain – this list goes on. Perhaps Boris Johnson’s Etonian education did not enable him to understand that in polite society it’s rude to comment with ridicule on the way people dress.ONE thing critics of Boris Johnson’s burka comment overlook is the impact of burka-wearers on those who are deaf and rely on seeing facial expressions, and lip-reading.THE do-gooders complaining about Boris are fanning the flames of hatred by highlighting issues that one wouldn’t really think about. Talk about “integration” appears to be one-sided and discriminatory towards the indigenous people. There is some equilibrium lacking in our “fair, just and equal” land of ours.WHILE I am not sure Boris used a good choice of words likening women in burkas to pillar boxes, he was right that we are frightened by what it represents. We must not destroy Boris, he is good for the people of this country, he cares. He must also be allowed to speak honestly, he has nothing to apologise for.LIGHTEN up, Boris spoke the thoughts of many millions of Brits. If making a gaffe was against the law, Prince Philip could have been banged up in the Tower of London on many occasions during the last 50 years. He wrote the book on it.Boris might have an agenda – what politician doesn’t? – but this mustn’t mean people don’t have a right to voice criticism. Face veils in public, and burkas, are not religious requirements and we must have the right to criticise the wearers.IF I was Boris Johnson, I would agree to attend the diversity training some have suggested . . . and then tear the training session to pieces.I SAW Ranvir Singh berating her guests on morning TV for daring to agree with Boris Johnson? I wonder what her bosses would say if she suggested that she presented her programme wearing a burka. I think we all know the answer to that.PHIL GROWDENNOTHING Theresa May says can be taken at face value. Not so long ago, she promised to stop the witch-hunt of British soldiers, who have seen action and survived in many parts of the world. However, the victimisation of our veterans continues unabated. They are now joined by Boris Johnson, who has frequently ignited the Prime Minister’s wrath and must therefore, be thrown to the wolves.A BUS company has apologised after a driver told a woman to remove her niqab. So would a bank apologise if a security guard asked a man to remove his ski mask?HOW would I stand as a Christian male finding a Muslim lady, dressed in a burka, having a heart attack? Would I be allowed to remove her veil to perform mouth-to-mouth?THE controversy surrounding Boris Johnson’s burka comments has reached ridiculous heights. Police conducting an investigation. Really?IF Theresa May had the guts to ban the burka like a lot of other countries, we might not be having this discussion about what Boris Johnson said.SOMETHING featureless with a rectangular hole in it can resemble a letter box, there’s probably one on your front door, go and have a look. It has also been known for the person inside to be a terrorist, not an innocent woman. Stop being so pathetic, have a sense of humour, act like adultsI READ about a motorcyclist at a filling station having to remove his crash helmet while a woman (who could have been a criminal’s getaway driver) filling up at the pump next to him was wearing a burka. Meanwhile Boris’s remarks are causing hysteria.I HAVE been visiting garden centres and supermarket car parks in my car, which is bedecked with Brexit stickers, asking many people their opinion on the Boris situation. For Boris, I find there is a great deal of love out there. For the Chequers “deal” there is none.IT’S true that Boris Johnson has used strong language but Muslim terrorists are doing far worse things than robbing banks, by committing terrorist atrocities. It would be a sad day when the Muslim community can’t take such a comment, especially when many Muslim women, in my view, do not want this clothing themselves.IT’S confirmed, lunatics are ruining the country. We have the enemy (EU) knocking art the door and all the idiots can find to discuss is Boris Johnson’s perfectly fair comment. If it wasn’t so serious it would be funny. Brexit should be top of the agenda.THERE are easily as many people who agree with BoJo’s comments as those who don’t. So why is it those who don’t will instigate an investigation, leaving those who do without a voice? Even senior Muslims and imams have said that the burka is not a requirement in Islam, so why is it we only tend to listen to those who are offended?Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Last Leg is a television safe space, the authentic voice of the PC establishment and as predictable as the sun rising in the morning.So you knew, long before Friday’s transmission, that they’d be targeting Boris, who is a thousand times funnier and edgier than anyone on this show, in his own way.Nearly a whole working week host Adam Hills and his two mates had to prepare some decent material as well, and this was the best three professional comedians could do.Alex Brooker: “The burka is an item of clothing worn by a human being, the other is a postbox, you f***ing idiot.”Adam Hills: “I’d much rather sit next to a person in burka than a p***k in a suit.”Josh Widdicombe: “Theresa May has only just realised Boris is a t**t, so she should apologise as well.”On and on it went, for 12 minutes and 54 seconds, a figure I mention because I’ve had the clock on this lot, and if you want to know exactly how much of a toss they really give about religious sensitivities then it’s best measured by the fact this series of The Last Leg has devoted just 65 hand-wringing seconds to the anti-Semitic poison infecting the Labour Party.It was crammed hurriedly into the previous episode, which was worth watching just to see Adam Hills describe Corbyn’s handling of this crisis as “a faux pas”, (which isn’t French for “shameful cluster-f***”) and the C4 audience react with evident discomfort because he’d drawn attention to the Labour leader’s failings and, therefore, broken one of comedy’s secret and golden rules.If you doubted these rules exist, incidentally, then ever the virtue-signalling fool, Adam Hills was good enough to spell them out for us on Friday.“Every religion should be open to ridicule . . . but you kind of need to be in the club.“Alex and I can make jokes about disabilities as we’re technically disabled.”Boris, he then explained, can’t make jokes about burkas, ’cos he’s “a white Etonian”, nor could comedy giant Rowan Atkinson defend him, as he was “a white man who lives in Oxford and drives an F1 car”.Even if we ignore the fact he’s assumed that all Muslims are black, something pretty staggering is going on here.For Mary Whitehouse, in all her pearl-clutching glory, never imagined anything quite as Draconian and controlling as this form of satirical Apartheid.Adam Hills has a point, though, when he uses the word “club”. That’s exactly what television comedy has become.A closed, left-wing shop where you don’t even bother joining the audience unless you follow the rigid “Tories and Brexit are evil” party line.This is not creating comedy, it’s policing it, and also the reason why applause has replaced laughter on all those Channel 4 and BBC news satires which have failed to realise there is only one simple rule to be observed when creating these shows: Make it funny, dumbo.I would suggest, at this point, Adam Hills gets off his moral high horse, for once, and gives this “funny” idea a go.But then I could also ask Boris to have a crack at anchoring the British women’s 4x100m relay team to gold at the next Olympics, wearing a burka, and I’d know there was only the remotest chance of one ever happening.Run Boris, run.MEANWHILE, back on Channel 4’s Meet The Drug Lords: Inside The Real Narcos, Jason “Foxy” Fox was with the Colombian navy this week and desperate for a look inside one of the incredible home-made submarines they’d confiscated from drug-smugglers.“Is it locked?”“Yes.”And there’ll be more Bafta-worthy action from Foxy and his forward-planning department this week, I’m sure.EVER since it discovered that Danny Dyer was the rightful heir to the English throne, Who Do You Think You Are? has been struggling to find a purpose, or indeed a celebrity, who could see the bigger picture.That special someone who would acknowledge history’s great events with more than a few “wows” and shrugs and not think their own career made all of their ancestors’ suffering worthwhile.Finally, last night, they found him.Judge Robert Rinder, who as well as having the best brain at ITV (Luna the Labrador off This Morning has the second best) also turns out to be a natural television journalist, telling the story of his maternal great-grandfather, Israel, and his beloved grandfather, Morris, simply, beautifully and without ever letting the details overwhelm him.The former fled revolutionary Latvia at the turn of the last century.The latter’s entire family was wiped out in Treblinka’s gas chambers.Yet he somehow survived the Buchen-wald, Theresienstadt and Schlieben concentration camps and made it to Britain, which offered him salvation, friendship, justice and, above all, a sense that “life is worth living” that has been passed down through eternally grateful generations.It’s a remarkable story, so if you missed it, try to catch tonight’s repeat (BBC1, 11.25pm).SCENES and characters the viewers are unlikely to forget in a hurry on the final episode of BBC2’s wonderful Travels In Trumpland With Ed Balls.First stop, the President’s Mar-a-Lago compound in Florida, where Ed spent the most uncomfortable night of his life, since Strictly, at a one-year-in-office party for Trump, with Toni Holt Kramer and a group of fans who were called The Trumpettes, but could well have been the provisional wing of The Golden Girls.If you thought they were a bit sinister, though, he was then off squirrel hunting in the forests of Georgia with two hillbillies who might not have been plucking banjos but they certainly had the mad cackling laughs and slightly unsettling line in hospitality.“Are you ready to be a man today, Ed?” asked one, as you began to wonder if he could escape with his dignity intact, let alone blend in with the local gene pool.Then he suddenly reappeared – and this was a masterstroke – wearing a Norwich City scarf.Scrub everything I ever said about Ed Balls.The man’s a diplomatic genius.Sent in by Rob Milner, East Yorkshire. Picture research: Alfie SnellingTHIS Morning, Wednesday:Gok Wan: “Coming up, Ninja nanas, in a minute, John Torode’s in the Lake District at 11.45, and we’ve got the return of the Hawaiian shirt at midday.“First, would you like to live ten years longer?”Ten years?

It means young people are missing out on essential skills as they approach adulthood.GRANT ROLLINGS asked five Sun columnists what their first part-time jobs were and the valuable lessons they learned – from being polite to skiving.I ALWAYS had a summer job, usually it meant working full-time hours on my normal Saturday job as holiday cover. This was either in a boutique such as Chelsea Girl or in BHS, where I worked on the sweetie counter.I coped with the boredom by sneakily munching on the best chocolate sweets from the pick-and-mix. I also worked as a waitress in a trendy Glasgow eaterie during the holidays.All of these jobs gave me the most enormous respect for the men and women who toil for long hours, often dealing with unreasonable members of the public for too little pay and not much prospect of promotion.Working in the service industry taught me the power of a disarming smile, and proved that my old granny’s saying that “you get more in life from sugar than vinegar” could not be more true.Grumpy customers demanding refunds and diners moaning that they had been waiting too long for their main course were usually placated with a swift apology and a promise to sort things out.A major restaurant blunder could often be smoothed over with a free coffee or pudding.MY favourite summer job came in 1977. I was a traffic enumerator for Middlesbrough Council. That meant I spent all day counting cars. All the way up one side of Linthorpe Road, all the way back down the other.I had to write down all the number plates. In the end, I got a bit bored and spent the time hanging out at my mate’s T-shirt shop or Fearnley Records and made the numbers up, always remembering to have them end in the local codes of HN or (I think) XG. I hope the council thought it worthwhile.It was better than the glue factory, where I’d been very briefly working on a weighbridge. Foreman pressed a button and this vast door opened and thousands of rotting animal carcasses fell out. I can still smell it now, all these years later. I passed out — soft lad, you see.Or there was working the nightshift pricing cans of food and stuff in Hintons, the local convenience store. Every time I turned up, the manager would say, ‘Here he is, the poor man’s Rod Stewart’.A friend of mine, Mark, had a much better summer job.He was a Club 18-30 holiday rep. He shagged 21 girls in 25 days, which gave me my first story to sell to the national newspapers.MY first holiday job was in the summer of 1985 when I was 16 years old. I had already been turned down from working at Waitrose in Enfield Town on the basis I was “too glamorous”.That just goes to show how far we have come in such a short time. I have never set foot in a Waitrose since that day because I was beyond furious. Anyway, the job I did get was working in a hairdresser’s on Goodge Street in London.My journey involved three changes and about 14 stops every day. The job was meant to be answering the phone, sweeping up and generally helping out, but before the end of the first week I was running the till, the appointment system, cashing up and generally managing the place.The only thing I could not do was cut hair, but that didn’t stop me cutting my friends’ hair — with very mixed results, more bad than good — on the basis I worked in a hairdresser’s so they thought I should. I remember the liberating feeling of earning my own money, it gave me the greatest sense of independence, self-esteem and self-belief.I worked out I was actually good in a work environment, talking to people — for example, talking women into perms they didn’t want — being responsible, handling money and making a difference to my employer.The biggest transition we make in our lives is leaving education to go into the workplace, and summer jobs prepare you for this.I HAD dozens of summer jobs, from working as a scaffolder’s mate with a convicted murderer, who kept a pistol in the glove compartment of his Ford Escort, to donning a white suit and Geiger counter to carry out maintenance on the core of the main reactor at a nuclear power station.I learned a hundred things from each and every job, but it was working as a grocery assistant at my local supermarket that had the most impact.My best friend and I both got jobs there at the same time. He was a star performer at school, a brilliant academic, but he couldn’t take the pace and got fired after a couple of months.It was incredibly hard, repetitive work.The manager was an ex-Army major — very strict on haircuts, discipline and stealing.There was always the prospect of the Tannoy announcement “customer service one hundred”, which was code for a shoplifter having been spotted.All the male floor staff were required to assemble at till number one to tackle the suspect, who would sometimes become violent.I was much happier making the cheese look pretty and eventually became the ruler of the entire soft dairy aisle — a project I’m still working on.I WAS 13 in Brownes Wine bar, Stafford Street, Derby, summer 1987, some years before it burned down in mysterious circumstances (has a bar ever burnt down innocently?). I was chief bottler-up.This involved the soul-sapping exercise of sifting through bins taller than me for all the recyclable bottles from the previous night’s festivities and putting them in their correct crates. This took all morning and you ended up cut to shreds and stinking of Britvic and Schlitz.I was then asked to be the cook — this involved microwaving lasagne for drunk people. I was paid the princely sum of £3 per hour. I realised how crap this was, so one scorching Saturday I nicked the shampoo that came with my dad’s company car and took advantage of the sketchy Eighties attitude to drink-driving and washed all the customers’ cars in the car park for a fiver a pop.I literally cleaned up. It was the greatest Dragons’ Den moment I’ve ever had. I waxed on and off all day, rinsing my dad of his prized BMW product. He arrived to pick me up and I was minted. A 13-year-old with £64 in his pocket. That coveted Swatch would finally be mine.He then told me the dog had been run over, so that’s another memory ruined.Thanks for reminding me.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

To say that he was “present but not involved” is an insult to voters’ intelligence when photographs show him holding a wreath and gurning for a nearby camera.To allow his press office to say the widows of those murdered in Munich were being “misled” is, even among the many shameful episodes we’ve seen since he became Labour leader three hate-filled years ago, disgraceful.The most vital qualification for power in this country must be integrity. And Jeremy Corbyn has demonstrated this week that he has absolutely none of it.But for all of the shame that he brings upon Labour, it is nothing compared to the spinelessness of the party’s “moderate” MPs whose opposition to Corbyn extends not much further than wishy-washy tweets.“Present but not involved” isn’t an excuse for Corbyn but nor is it for the cowards on Labour’s backbenches.Corbyn cannot be allowed near government. But the rest of the party has lost the public’s faith too.TOMORROW, official figures are likely to suggest that train fares will go up by another 3.5 per cent in January.If you’re a commuter who has put up with delayed and cancelled trains, you’ll be wondering what you’re paying for.After a disastrous year, there is no other industry that would turn round and ask customers for even more.The failure of the Government to take responsibility, blaming unions or claiming the cash is for “investment”, is simply not good enough. It’s the same as last year’s excuse.It is time for a radical overhaul — but that does not mean nationalisation. Far from it. Our railways need MORE private sector involvement.The hybrid system we have, in which private operators rely on publicly owned tracks and have their fares regulated by government, has led us into the worst of both worlds.Transport supremo Chris Grayling needs to take on the unions once and for all. And he needs to introduce real competition on the railways, giving operators far more freedom.Commuters deserve better than finger-pointing and higher fares.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He says he was told that he couldn’t speak at the wedding and that Harry berated him on the phone for mishandling the Press while he was recovering from a heart attack.The official royal response to these outbursts has been, effectively, to shove their fingers in their ears and shout la-la-la (or lah-lah-lah).The snobby courtiers and hangers-on dismiss Markle père as fame-hungry.That’s not altogether wrong — he is clearly desperate, as he proved by posing for snaps with the paparazzi in the run-up to the wedding.But it’s not good enough to wish he’d just go away.Meghan is now one of the most photographed and sought-after women in the world. Her very well-paid PR flunkies should have seen these familial landmines a mile off and defused them.But they have failed.Thomas Markle is a difficult and proud man, no doubt. But that is why he should have been treated with care, not frozen out.Why did Team Windsor not find him a role and approach him long before the wedding to make sure he didn’t feel excluded.It’s hard not to feel for him.His ex, Meghan’s mother Doria, was hailed as one of the stars of the wedding.Because she’s a black woman, she invited lots of gushing commentary about the monarchy becoming more diverse and modern.Amen to that. But poor old podgy Thomas, an awkward-looking white bloke, has been shunned from his daughter’s nuptials. You can’t blame him for speaking out.The royal courtiers enjoy the adulation the monarchy receives because Prince Harry has been “brave” enough to marry a woman with a complicated background.But the Palace spin machine freaks out when it comes to confronting the reality of Meghan’s parentage.Perhaps they just find it too vulgar.Harry’s PR man is Jason Knauf, an American specialist in “crisis management” having worked for Royal Bank of Scotland. He excels at sending angry letters to journalists he feels have gone too far snooping into Harry and Meghan’s private lives.But he doesn’t seem to have a clue as to how to handle his clients’ grumpy relatives.As a result, the monarchy is facing arguably its worst crisis since the death of Diana, Princess of Wales.We are often told how brilliant the Royal Family’s PR is. Part of the new royal spin, in fact, is about how great the royals now are at spin. They have “rebranded” the monarchy for the 21st century, and so on.Look at the blizzard of positive guff accompanying Prince William, Kate, and Harry’s campaign for mental illness last year.They were, it was said, making the younger Windsors seem more touchy-feely.At the moment, however, they don’t seem sensitive enough to speak to Meghan’s suffering in-laws.That’s not what you’d call a good look.The truth is, royal press officers have long got too much credit.The British admire the Queen because she is admirable.Overall, we prefer monarchy to any other system of government. That’s just common sense. It’s nothing to do with any ingenious branding and media strategy.The public also feels that the younger royals deserve a chance.At a time when our country is consumed by Brexit and political arguments, the wedding of Harry and Meghan came as a blessed relief — something we could all celebrate.The couple both came from broken homes, and nobody cared so long as they were happy. That’s all great.   But it’s obvious that Meghan has, as one royal expert put it, “background baggage that needs unpacking”.Insiders now say the treatment of the Markle family has been a “shambles”.This is before we consider the potential PR bombshells that could erupt if and when Meghan’s ex-husband, Trevor Engelson, decides to grant some interviews.The British don’t want to see the monarchy turned into a reality TV soap, as the Markles and Windsors wage a media war with each other.It’s trashy and embarrassing.But unless the Palace can tackle Meghan’s disgruntled kin, that’s exactly what is happening.Maybe we need a changing of the royal PR guard — before it’s too late.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And the party will look at this I am sure extremely forcefully at the next conference.Lets wait and see what conference decides.“Theres always a rule in politics: if youre on the front pages for too long you become the story and thats not good because you miss all the good and effective things that the Labour Party is doing in terms of policy and holding this government to account.”Host Julia Hartley-Brewer asked her: “Do you think that a man who lays wreaths at the tombs of terrorists who have killed innocent people is fit to be the British Prime Minister?”But Ms Moon would only reply: “That will be a decision for the British people.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Around 46 per cent of 25 to 34 year-olds now live in private rentals as house prices rocket.Some 80 per cent of the tenancies in England and Wales are set at six or 12 months.Charities warned this leaves tenants at the risk of eviction at short notice- and demanded a change.Shelter chief Polly Neate last night said the Government’s decision was “very good news” that would transform the lives of many struggling to make ends meet.She said: “The current renting system is a complete mess, with families teetering on the edge of blink-and-you-miss-it six-month contracts – barely enough time to set your broadband up, let alone see your kids through school.“This problem will not be fixed by giving landlords a tax break to coax them into doing what everyone should be doing anyway.”Shelter earlier this week said 55 per cent of private renters believe longer tenancies would improve their situation.And they claimed two-thirds of renters would think better of a political party that brought in longer contracts.GOT a story?

Yesterdays employment figures revealed that the proportion of young people unemployed (and not in full-time education) is now at a record low of 4.7% for our country - and far lower than for many other developed countries.It sends a significant message out about the drive and innovation of our young people, and the opportunities that our economy offers to them and their future.With our welfare changes this country can now be powered forward by this young generation.Since 2010, youth unemployment has fallen by over 45%, giving 130,000 more young people a job, and a future.Add the fact that wages are on the up and there are more than 829,000 vacancies nationwide, it’s clear that young people are entering the best jobs market in a decade.On average, the number of vacancies has increased by 4,280 each month over the last year, and those vacancies span from construction to technology.So when young people this week are deciding on their next steps, they can think big as there are plenty of opportunities out there for them, from a job with career progression, to taking up an apprenticeship.Look at Daisy, who turned down five university offers to work at global engineering firm JCB designing new equipment, and she didn’t have to go to university to get there.I’m forever being told, and intrinsically understand, that people want to study at different times in their lives, often inspired to do so when they see the practical benefits of their studies.That’s why so many people prefer, and do better, getting a job first and then studying for exams while they work.Even over the last few decades, how the world of education and work are linked has shifted dramatically. People no longer have one job for life, and lifelong learning is becoming more and more commonplace as people dip in and out of education.Many more people up-skill and retrain throughout their career – and this is how the future jobs market will remain vibrant and strong.And when I speak to employers up and down the country, from manufacturers to marketers, what they want are young people with the right attitude, prepared to work and learn. As they say, ‘if you’ve the will, we can give you the skill’.So when young people this week are deciding their next steps, the academic route isn’t the only option.You can now become a solicitor, an accountant or even a nuclear engineer through the apprenticeship route, earning as you learn and without the cost of going to University. Studying a Higher Apprenticeship gives an average wage boost of £150,000 over a working life.When I speak to young people around the country, I’m impressed with the confidence and self-assuredness with which they look to the future, and the range of options they consider beyond traditional routes.Im certainly no job snob. Life teaches you its not where you come from, its where you get to, and work is exactly the same.You can start anywhere and get to the top as Im repeatedly being told by our countrys top entrepreneurs.Top performers in their fields such as Debbie Moore, Jean-Christophe Novelli, Deborah Meaden and Jo Malone, did not go to university and are just a handful of the individuals who show that with drive and determination you can succeed by treading your own path.Its all about getting a break and taking the opportunities that come your way.So best of luck to everyone today, but whatever your results, there are many opportunities and pathways into a successful career.    Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If they go on to university they incur debts of over £50,000 and will be paying back their loans well into middle age. And in a number of cases they end up with degrees that dont get them into graduate jobs.On the other hand, degree-level apprenticeships are almost non-existent with less than 10,000 available each year compared with over 300,000 university places. There is effectively no viable alternative to university.Jeremy Clarkson had some words of advice for students who fell short of what they hoped to get.He tweeted: Dont worry if your A-level grades arent any good. I got a C and 2 Us.And Im sitting here deciding which of my Range Rovers to use today.And ITV news anchor Alastair Stewart also wished students good luck.He wrote: However you do, remember: in 5 years they wont matter too much in ten, not at all in 20, theyll probably be called something else.Boys have outperformed girls at the top A-level grade for the first time since it was introduced in Northern Ireland.They overtook girls by 0.4 per cent at the A* grade, which was first awarded in 2010.The performance gap between the genders also narrowed at the A*-A grade boundary, and it follows concerted efforts to address the disparity by education authorities.Last year, 26.3 per cent of A-levels scored an A or A*, national figures showed, and the results were predicted to be broadly similar again this year.There have been major changes to A-levels in England, with a move away from coursework and modular exams throughout the course.A Department for Education spokesman said university isnt for everyone and the Government does not want one route to a career to be considered better than any other.That is why we are transforming technical education in this country to put it on a par with our amazing academic system, he said.Students who havent got the results they hoped for can try their luck through clearing.The process works by helping students find out what university courses still have places remaining.Hopefuls are able to search for a course against the subject they are interested in, or the university they want to head to."},{"url":null,"title":"a level results day memes twitter","story":"Teens have been sharing their funny reactions to the big day on under the hashtag #alevelresults2018 -

I thought I was quite a rare case in that I knew that was possible.That’s not always the case. When students are young, academically brilliant and getting great grades, they should know that’s an option.Back in 2016, he told students at the Oxford University Guild: You guys did something I couldn’t do, which is get sick A Level grades. It was my dream to come to Oxford and study Political Science.Stormzy follows in the footsteps of Nicki Minaj, who pledged to pay tuition fees for her young American fans in 2016.The news has been welcomed by fans and politicians alike.Labour MP David Lammy heaped praise on the rapper, writing on Twitter: Well done Stormzy for giving back and leading the way, once again. You dont need to use your power and platform to bring others with you, but you do it anyway.And Shadow Education Secretary Angela Rayner added: Great news that #Stormzy is trying to help 4 black students get to a top university, my job is to ensure the system enables all students to reach their full potential regardless of gender, disability, race or class background.Today teens across Britain are receiving their A-level results - and finding out whether they got into uni.But eight of ten courses today STILL had spaces left, as students appeared to turn their back on higher education.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Well, you must have been getting your news from the BBC, then.This was the latest example of Corbyn simpering around terrorists. Honouring scumbags who massacred 11 Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olympics in Munich.The Black September gangsters castrated their male victims while they were still alive.But then, Corbyn was happy to attend the funerals of dead IRA terrorists. That’s the kind of chap he is. Actually, I say that was the “latest” case of Corbyn simpering around terrorists.Not quite. A day or two later a photo emerged of him giving the salute of the Muslim Brotherhood, a foul organisation proscribed as terrorists in six countries.And it’s all part of the anti-Semitism scandal which is tearing the Labour Party apart. An important story.Good people have left Labour as a consequence. The Jewish community in the UK is in uproar.Frightened of the far Left’s support for vile Islamists and its loathing of Israel and its right to exist.Scared of the morons who now lead Labour and its retinue of lefties who have said the most appalling, racist, stuff about Jews.Jeremy Corbyn, a genuine halfwit, thinks it is all “fake news”.He rolls his eyes when asked about it and gives different answers every time he is questioned.And guess who agrees with him? Yep, the BBC.The corporation refused to touch the story for a whole day, when it was first reported by blogger Guido Fawkes. Ignored it.Everyone else — including the left-wing  — thought it important.Instead, the front page of the BBC’s online news carried no fewer than SIX stories about former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and the allegations of Islamophobia made against him. Six!Boris had likened women who wear the burka to letter boxes or bank robbers.The vast majority of the country agreed that he wasn’t being racist. The vast majority want the burka banned here — as it is in Denmark, France, parts of Germany, Belgium and . . . Morocco.His comments were not much of a story at all. And the moves to sanction him solely a case of his enemies in the Conservative Party gleefully hammering the bloke.But the BBC became obsessed by it. It is always obsessed when the word Islamophobia is mentioned.And it loves to stick the boot into the Tories. Yet was utterly silent on the latest example of anti-Semitism in the Labour Party.It took them a full day to even mention the story.It’s another shocking case of the BBC’s bias. A left-liberal prejudice which runs right through the corporation from top to bottom.The same prejudice you hear whenever it deals with immigration (bloody marvellous!) or Brexit (absolutely ghastly!).Haven’t we had enough of this?

Freda thinks she should have been warned about the possibility of being surrounded by Spaniards in Spain.She added that they should go “somewhere else” for their holidays.Brits are flooding to Turkey to take advantage of the crashing lira.

And she just sounds so damn good.\"It could be because her life, born to the family of a philandering baptist minister and ending up the female artist with the most entries in the US R\u0026B chart\u0027s history, in many ways exemplified the trials and fortunes of many from her background.She was born in the spiritual home of R\u0026B, Memphis, in 1942, to an itinerant preacher and a piano player and singer.Before she was five, the family moved to Detroit where her father had been given the pastorship of a church.But her childhood was not a happy one. Amid rumours of infidelity, her parents separated in 1948 and her mother moved to Buffalo with a son from a previous relationship. A few years later her mother was dead. The job of looking after the young Franklin fell to several women, including one who was known as the \"greatest gospel singer in the world\", Mahalia Jackson.The world she grew up in was one in which gospel singing took centre stage, and where the growing popularity of her father\u0027s driving sermons led to his mission being visited by various performers like Jackie Wilson and Sam Cooke.The young Franklin would accompany her father on the road as he and other singers toured churches - moves that eventually led to her releasing gospel records herself. It may have been because of the unstable nature of life at home that she fell pregnant and had children twice before the age of 15.At 18, she told her father she wanted to follow in Sam Cooke\u0027s footsteps and become a pop artist, and after she signed to Columbia she enjoyed a degree of success on the R\u0026B chart.She was managed by Ted White, a man she married in 1961 at the age of 19 and had another child with three years later.White was described by a number of sources as controlling, dealing out domestic abuse on many occasions.In 1970, after their marriage broke down, Jet magazine reported that White was investigated for shooting Sam Cooke\u0027s brother, who attempted to protect Franklin when her husband turned up at her house.It was after a move to Atlantic in 1966 she achieved wider success, with her first single with the new label, I Never Loved A Man (The Way I Love You), reaching number one on the R\u0026B chart and the top ten in the US pop chart.It was closely followed up by an adapted cover of Otis Redding\u0027s classic hit Respect, which went to number one in the US and made the UK top ten.The release of Lady Soul, in early 1968 - her 14th album - cemented her place in rock and pop history, with hits like Chain Of Fools and (You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman entering the songbook for decades and (Sweet Sweet Baby) Since You\u0027ve Been Gone showing Franklin herself could co-write big sellers.A cover of Dionne Warwick\u0027s I Say A Little Prayer had similar success later the same year. She married again in 1978, to actor Glynn Turman, but they also divorced six years later.The 1980s were a period beset with family tragedy.

Steve Baker, a Tory MP and prominent Leave campaigner, is a shareholder in Glint Pay Ltd, which has encouraged people to “buy, save \u0026amp spend physical gold” to protect them against the economic impact of a hard Brexit, according to Business Insider. One blog entry on the firm’s website says: “If Brexit does prove to be a mistake, that should, all other beings equal, push the pound down.” It goes on to suggest it is “worth considering putting some gold in your portfolio” because it isn’t tied to currency. The same blog also suggests Gold could “provide a bit of reassurance if you’re worried that Donald Trump may trigger a major war.”  It comes after Jacob Rees-Mogg was forced to deny his firm Somerset Capital had created an investment fund in Ireland to insulate investors against a hard Brexit. Mr Rees-Mogg is chair of the hardline European Research Group of Tory Brexiteers. The Group is rumoured to be gearing up to present an alternative no-deal Brexit plan to Tory Colleagues before the party’s annual conference in September. Mr Baker has also repeatedly endorsed the firm on his Twitter account, telling followers “With Glintpay you can buy, hold and spend multiple currencies and gold instantly”. Mr Baker’s shares in the firm were declared on his Register of Members’ interests. There is no suggestion of any wrongdoing.

No-one died. The terrorist was caught alive. There is no martyr, and if the worst they can do is smack their heads against a reinforced anti-terrorist barrier next to the most heavily-guarded building in Britain then, frankly, there\u0027s not a lot to lose sleep over.  Except there is, because as with every terror attack the hardest questions that must be asked are not, while official knees jerk to protect themselves.  Attacks on Parliament bring home to MPs that they are targets for those who take exception to their views, their politics or their existence. It\u0027s natural that after the second car-based attempt at mass murder on their place of work in 17 months, they would start to think that cars might be the problem. Only we don\u0027t say men are the problem, even though every single terror attack carried out on our shores of late has been conducted by people with testicles. The Islamists who have attacked us may have been Muslims, people of colour, slightly-thick zealots, and one-time petty criminals, but we have not and will not outlaw all such people for the crimes of a few. Boris Johnson would be stuffed, for a start. Yet some say it\u0027s time to pedestrianise Parliament Square. Because terrorists are never on foot, are they?   Terrorists have never been in cars, then got out of them to kill someone, have they?    Terrorists have never targeted places where all their potential victims are walking or sitting down, have they?   Terrorists are always the driver, aren\u0027t they?  Terror attacks often lead to changes, many of them useful. When the IRA bombed the Grand Hotel in Brighton it led to stringent security measures for party political conferences. After 6 were killed and 50 injured at the Westminster Bridge terror attack, Theresa May promised another \u0026pound50m for counter-terrorism, having earlier been criticised for cuts.  And let\u0027s not be too architecturally-conservative about Parliament Square. It was laid out only in 1868, around the same time as the Victorians rebuilt the Houses of Parliament. It is a space owned by the Greater London Authority, which has the power to make bylaws for it, and has used this power in recent years to repeatedly curb the right to protest.  While there is a right to assembly on any public highway, on the roads around Parliament you must ask for police permission. So, on the face of it, pedestrianising the area - putting even the roads under local authority control, banning cars which happens anyway for approved protests, and keeping weapons-on-wheels away from the seat of our democracy - may seem like a sound idea. But it isn\u0027t.  Manchester Arena is not a public space, is privately-owned, and keeps its concert-goers away from vehicles. Salman Abedi still managed to blow himself and 22 others to pieces, killing and injuring huge numbers of children.   Abedi used a backpack and a suitcase. Parliament Square attracts millions of tourists a year, most of them with backpacks and suitcases.  Perhaps police and politicians would like bollards at the entrance to the square to include x-ray scanners, to catch those carrying bombs or knives in their backpacks?  In which case, we can look forward to everyone with a penknife or nail scissors being stopped, liquids being bagged and belts and shoes removed at the entrance to the square, just as they already are when you attempt to enter Parliament itself. And anyone who wishes to stage a protest or go to the TV studios at Millbank to criticise the government, will not only have to seek formal approval but be questioned as to their purpose on the way in and the way out. At this uncomfortably-authoritarian juncture, it might be wise to remind ourselves of the few times in recent history that Parliamentarians have actually been attacked.  Jo Cox MP was shot and stabbed on the roadside in Birstall, West Yorkshire in 2016 while on her way to meet constituents.  Stephen Timms MP was stabbed twice at a constituency surgery in a library in Beckton, east London in 2010.  More recently, Conservative life peer David Prior was the victim of a pig blood-based graffiti attack in his own home by an angry ex-girlfriend. When a brick was thrown through Angela Eagle\u0027s office, Stella Creasy was threatened with rape and Jess Phillips given death threats, it happened either in their own constituencies or online. And who could forget when deputy Labour leader John Prescott was egged outside a theatre in Rhyl, north Wales, in 2001 when on his way to a political rally.  As yet, no Islamist has yet come within 10 yards of a Parliamentarian at Parliament. Those who have launched attacks outside have not got in, and it has become quite apparent that while cars are good at killing pedestrians, they are rubbish at getting past armed police officers, metal barriers and brick walls.  Of course a Parliamentarian could be outside on his bike, as others were yesterday, or walking over Westminster Bridge, or coming through the gate at the wrong time. So could any one of a thousand other humans, and it is not for the public\u0027s sake anyone has suggested banning vehicles.  It has been suggested purely to look like something is being done - even though that thing would not deter a single terrorist. We have yet to hear of an incident averted because a devoted Islamist saw a \u0027keep off the grass\u0027 sign. They are not known for being law-abiding, and it should be noted that this latest attack involved an illegal turn on the wrong side of the road, in clear contravention of the Highway Code.  You can say this for cars being used as weapons - they tend to at least keep the driver alive. And if you ask any counter-terrorism officer what he\u0027d like most after a terror attack, he\u0027d say someone to interrogate.  He might further point out that, in his ideal world, the terrorists come to him. They choose the most-guarded, secure and bristling-with-police-officers building in the country, and run at it one at a time, almost as though they were idiots.  Parliament is a place that can handle terror. Blocking it off to cars does not stop terrorists - it just moves them down the road, to Tesco or the Tower of London or Top Shop. And there isn\u0027t a person on the planet who can\u0027t see that an attack on soft targets is not only easier for even the most stupid of zealots to manage, but it\u0027ll kill an awful lot more people.   Pedestrianisation is the go-to solution for every politician from the local town hall to Downing Street. Banning cars is the only way they can think of to boost local cafes, cut pollution and, now, protect democracy. Never mind that business rates, car manufacturers and sanity might all have more to do with it.  The ability to drive, in cars, taxis or buses, and to walk or cycle unhindered, through Parliament Square does two important things. First, it means millions of us get to see the place close up. On visits, school trips, holidays, the daily commute and in tiny glimpses on our way to somewhere else, we are reminded it is there, and that it is ours. If it were pedestrianised it would be seen only by those who seek it out. And secondly, it tells the terrorists - these dense meat-sacks who could not in any other situation terrify a wet kitten - that we are unmoved. Our democracy has survived worse, and it will survive them.

Boris Johnson said back in 2016 that Britain will make a titanic success of Brexit.  But while the ex cabinet minister may have been using the word to mean big, he seems to have forgotten that for most of people Titanic refers to a ship which sunk in 1912 when it hit an ice berg.  It is also notable that the ship was believed to be unsinkable - and then it sank. You can draw your own conclusions as to how that might compare to Brexit.  The comic video, which uses scenes from the 1997 film starring Leonardo Di Caprio and Kate Winslet, features David Cameron as captain of the sinking ship.    He is heard to say I do not think it would be right for me to be the captain that steers our country to its next destination, in reference to his resignation following the referendum, before the water bursts in and he disappears from view. Brexiteers Boris Johnson, Michael Gove and David Davis are seen in the ship\u0027s navigation room, while the spectre of Nigel Farage floats in the background.  Meanwhile Jeremy Corbyn is seen as one of the violinists in the orchestra which famously kept on playing while the ship sank.   In the video created by Josh Pappenheim, Foreign Secretary Mr Johnson is also shown as a child who manages to get on a lifeboat to escape.     The pound is seen falling - as it did in the wake of the poll.  While the 42%/ 52% which was the result of the vote is projected on to the two halves of the ship.

Always on time, well organised and, based on all the conversations the Ku Klux Klan’s members had with him, a powerful advocate for their hateful racist politics. What they didn’t know was that Ron was a black police officer. In 1979, Officer Stallworth, then 29, spent a year infiltrating the KKK and exposing their links with the police, military and organised crime. His audacious scheme, which started when he saw an advert in his local paper asking for potential KKK members, has inspired what some critics have called “the most important film of the year”, BlacKkKlansman. But in many ways, the truth is even stranger than Spike Lee’s movie makes it out to be. Working as an intelligence officer for the Colorado Springs Police Department, Ron was the only black officer on the force. So he took the rising tide of racist violence very seriously. And when he answered that advert, picking up the phone to talk to local KKK organiser Ken O’Dell, Ron knew he was risking more than embarrassment if they found out who he was.  America was gripped by far-right terrorism in the 1970s. In 1971, KKK members used dynamite to blow up ten buses which were to be used to desegregate schools in Pontiac, Michigan. In the months when Ron was planning his scheme, five communist protestors demonstrating in a Death To The Klan march were killed by the KKK and the American Nazi Party in the Greensboro massacre in North Carolina. In 1980, four black women were shot in Chattanooga, Tennessee, after a KKK rally. Just six months, later Michael Donald, age 20, was lynched in Alabama, his body found hanging from a tree. With this kind of bigoted violence going on, it’s fair to say that Ron knew the kind of character he was supposed to be playing when trying to ingratiate himself with the KKK’s O’Dell. Ron said: “I eventually spoke with him over the phone responding to that ad, and he explained to me that he was starting a Klan chapter in Colorado Springs and was looking for new people. “So I told him that I was a white man, that I hated blacks, Jews, Mexicans, Asians. That I thought the white man had not gotten a fair deal in this country. “[That] I was really upset because my sister had dated a n***** and it offended me that his black hands had touched her white body. And, as a result, I wanted to join the group and do what I could to put a stop to all of this nonsense.”  That was all it took – Ron, who now lives in El Paso, Texas, with his wife, was in. But very quickly he knew he was going to get caught if he couldn’t solve a major problem. How could he, a black man, walk into the public meetings of a large and violent racist organisation dedicated to seeing him back in chains? He was fine dealing with them over the phone, but he knew that when it came to having face-to-face meet-ups, he couldn’t go himself. So he drafted in his friend, Chuck, who worked in the drug squad, to be Ron Stallworth in person. It was also at this point that Ron realised he had – perhaps shortsightedly – signed his own name on his first letter to the KKK. However, it wasn’t just the practical problems holding up Ron’s investigation. Senior officers took a while to be convinced of its merits. “They felt like they couldn’t lose investigators to a bunch of nonsense like ‘men running around in sheets’,” said Ron. But with no signs of America’s racial violence subsiding, senior officers eventually agreed. Ron arranged to meet O’Dell, who was a serving soldier, at a bar near Fort Carson military base. He sent Chuck in wearing a wire, and guided him through the tricky conversations. “That’s how we conducted this investigation over the next eight or nine months or so,” Ron said. “I did most of the talking on the phone with these individuals, and when it came time for physical contact, the face-to-face meeting, I would send the white officer in posing as me.”  After months of phone calls and secret meetings, the infiltration was going so well that, incredibly, O’Dell recommended that Ron be made the head of the Colorado Springs branch of the KKK. He was put in touch with the hate group’s leader, David Duke. At one point – clearly confident that his plan hadn’t been rumbled – he even asked the KKK’s leader about the threat of infiltration. Ron explained: “I said, aren’t you afraid of an undercover police officer infiltrating your organisation or maybe a black man calling you up and pretending to be white?” “He said no, he wasn’t fearful of that at all, because he could always tell when he was talking to a black person.” Pushing his luck, Ron asked how Duke knew that he wasn’t black. “He said, you don’t talk like a black man. You talk like a very smart, intellectual white man. I can tell by the way you pronounce certain words.” Then, in an incident that seems more like far-fetched movie plot than real life, Ron – in his role as a serving police officer, rather than an undercover agent – met Duke in person. He was tasked with protecting the so-called Grand Wizard while he delivered a racist rant in public. He said: “I went and introduced myself to David Duke without giving him a name and told him I would do everything I could to protect him, even though I didn’t agree with him. We shook hands and I became his bodyguard.” Ron’s investigation in many ways highlighted his worst-possible fears. He found Klansmen in all walks of life, from local shop owners to school teachers and his neighbours.

The delivery driver added: Messed me about. You wasted half an hour cos of you.

Lisa, 45, says she received 13 calls from an unknown London landline around the time of the delivery.  She answered on three occasions but the line was empty each time, meaning she ignored subsequent calls.

Developer Paul Mager said he didn\u0027t know the underground pipe was there until after the two-storey, detached house was already built. He decided to matters into my own hands and tear down the house in Tetney, Lincolnshire, amid a row with Anglian Water that he didn\u0027t think he would win. But it could only be the start of his trouble, as the local council says it received no prior approval for the demolition work, Grimsby Live reports.  Bulldozers moved in to demolish the executive house on Wednesday morning, sparking bemusement from neighbours. Mr Mager said the construction work could have ruptured the main, which serves homes across Cleethorpes and Waltham, leading to a major disaster. The head of Mager Homes Limited said: The detached house that is as we speak coming down has been built on the main water main from the Tetney Blow Wells. So that detached house has been built on the main water main artery that runs into Waltham and Cleethorpes. So to cut a long story short, having tried to do a deal with Anglian Water, it became apparent that the best thing to do was to take it down and re-site it.  It\u0027s a bit more complicated than that. But I have had a major row with Anglian Water and it looks like I was going to lose so I took matters into my own hands. Built on top of a main taking water from Tetney Blow Wells nature reserve, the house has never been occupied. It was approved in 2016 by East Lindsey District Council as part of an application for seven properties on Humberston Road. Mr Mager said: In order to avert that puncture taking place, the quickest thing was to take it down in order to avoid any damage to Anglian Water property. That little corner will be flattened and we will resubmit a planning application to redevelop in a different way.  I am not going into the argument with Anglian Water. But basically either the house had to move or the main had to move. For piece of mind, I decided to move the house on my own timetable. Mr Mager said the main only came to light after the house had been constructed. He said: I have been doing it all my life. If we had known it was there, we would never have done it. The ongoing demolition came as news to East Lindsey District Council\u0027s planning department, who said no prior permission had been given for the work. Development control service manager Chris Panton said: “This is the first we have heard of the demolition currently ongoing on Humberston Road, Tetney.

A poll of 2,000 Brits found the nation’s favourite flavours in each region, with the results being boiled down by expert mixologists into unusual alcoholic concoctions. Almost three in 10 Brummies believe the flavour of a Balti best represents their area, leading to the ‘Brummie Sweet Spice’ cocktail being born – also containing dark chocolate, Bitters and Cr\u0026egraveme de P\u0026ecircches liqueur. And for gravy-loving Manchester, mixologists created the ‘Rock My Manchester Gravy Boat’, a beer-based cocktail topped off with Bovril and raspberry liqueur. Louise Lynch, Product Developer for Beers, Wines and Spirits at Sainsbury’s says “Having worked in the drinks industry for many years, I’m surprised that we’ve never seen a British cocktail earn its place amongst the classics.  “It seemed like an obvious solution for us to use our new range of cocktail ingredients to create a bespoke collection of cocktails the nation can be proud of. “Our cities are famous for their identity and we’re confident that these creations represent the charm and character of our home-grown regions.” The Edinburgh Irn Punch takes inspiration from the iconic Old Fashioned, and mixes whisky with Scotland’s other famous export Irn Bru, served with a side of shortbread. The supermarket giant worked with the London Cocktail Club to invent the bold new flavours, culminating in ‘The Great British G\u0026ampTea’. Combining two of Brits’ greatest loves – gin and tea – the wacky drink mixes tea with London Dry Gin, a dash of cassis liqueur and a spoonful of blackberry jam – and is best served with a custard cream.  JJ Goodman, the founder of London Cocktail Club, said “We had a lot of fun creating cocktails which represent these great cities. “The key for me was to keep the drinks simple, but also creatively interesting so they can not only be re-created at home but also feel like a taste of home. “Sainsbury’s has done a great job with their new range of cocktail ingredients, which help to keep the cost down when experimenting in mixology and I hope this encourages more people to get inventive with their creations.” "},{"url":null,"title":"couple unrecognisable after losing whopping","story":"NewsCouple are unrecognisable after losing a whopping 12 STONE in less than a yearMatt and Naomi Opie from Plymouth say that they struggled with their weight after their son was diagnosed with ADHDShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByMiles O\u0027Leary11:03, 16 AUG 2018NewsThe pair joined their local Slimming World branch (Image: Matt Opie)Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA husband and wife who once gorged on five takeaways a week have shed almost 12 STONE between them in just under a year. The transformation first came into fruition after Matt Opie, who topped the scales at nearly 16 stone, thought he was going to \u0027die\u0027 running after his son at their local park in Plymouth. Desperate to make a change to their lives, he and his partner Naomi, decided to head to their local Slimming World. Since they embarked on their weight-loss journey, the couple have said that their marriage has improved and has made them even better parents to their boy, Jack. It\u0027s been no easy feat and Matt was anxious at first about taking the plunge with so many other women around him aching to trim down.  Speaking to Plymouth Live , Matt said: When I first went, I walked in and there were 40 women in there, and perhaps two or three men, and I just thought, this isn\u0027t a man thing to do.   That\u0027s what people would think - but it\u0027s changed our lives. When I started, I was 15 stone, 11 pounds, Matt explained. I\u0027ve managed to lose four stone - I had diabetes as well and that\u0027s gone. It\u0027s taken me 10 months. It sounds a bit funny, but we were laying in bed the other night and we were saying about all the extra room we\u0027ve got now. We\u0027ve lost more weight than what Naomi weighs now. You would think there were three of us in this bed. It\u0027s absolutely crazy. Naomi\u0027s journey is quite remarkable - she\u0027s shifted seven and a half stone and has not put on a single pound since she started weighing in at Slimming World last year. Matt reflected on what made him want to change his life.  My son has problems and we were seeing him at school, I was trying to get him but he was having a meltdown and I thought I was going to die having to try and run after him, he explained. As soon as that happened, I knew things had to change. My son has been diagnosed with ADHD - and now I can do more stuff with him. When he was going to the park and I was trying to run after him, I was out of breath. It may seem stupid to some people, but we are having more fun as a family now, doing more stuff together that we wouldn\u0027t do before like taking selfies. You should see the photos we had previously. Now, we\u0027re just taking selfies with everything. It feels like we\u0027re making up for lost time, Matt admitted.  We didn\u0027t really have family photos up before, now we\u0027re going to places like the zoo and taking lots of photos. Matt said the couple\u0027s weight climbed as problems got worse with their son. Struggling to get him to bed, they felt too exhausted to cook - and relied on their local takeouts to keep them going. But that only fed their weight problems - and made them feel exhausted and stressed. I was having four or five takeaways a week, sometimes twice a day, Matt said. Matt says - a diet full of salad and vegetables and swapping out chips for jacket potatoes. I eat salad and veg every day now, Matt said. Jacket potatoes - in my 37 years I had never eaten one until I started Slimming World and now I love jacket potatoes. We live on the third floor and we have a lift. For the last year, I\u0027ve probably only used it three times. I would definitely advise any man to do Slimming World - it\u0027s changed my life. It changes every part of your life.

And evidence suggests it\u0027s one of the most effective ways to lose weight and keep in shape. Obesity is now a major issue in the UK. Put simply, we eat more and move less than our parents did. 26.9 per cent of UK adults are classed as obese, compared with 3% of adults in 1970. This is largely because many of us are now taking on far more calories than we realise , and leading more sedentary lifestyles. According to the Department of Health , a brisk walk burns 150 calories per half hour, while a moderately challenging cycle consumes 180 calories in the same amount of time. It\u0027s one of several reasons why cycling trumps most other forms of exercise if you\u0027re trying to achieve weight loss and better levels of overall fitness. Why cycling? Unlike running, cycling is a reasonably low-impact activity. This is great for people just getting into exercise, where the advice from doctors is to start off slow and build up. And of course, the fitter you become, the harder you can work: cycling is ideal for a wide range of ages and abilities. But it\u0027s also proven to be extremely effective. Researchers use a measure called metabolic equivalents (METs) in studies to define the value of exercise. While slow walk uses 2.0 METs per hour, slow cycling uses 4.0 METs per hour, and moderate cycling 6-10 METs per hour. Cycling is one of the easiest types of exercise to work in your daily routine, simply by cycling to work.  The NHS says that to get the best boost to your cardiovascular health is to spend around 150 minutes a week cycling – that\u0027s just 30 minutes per working day. So unless your workplace is next to your home, you should easily see some health benefits.  Wednesday, August 15, 2018 is also this year’s annual Cycle to Work Day . The UK’s biggest cycle commuting event is encouraging all cyclists – from newbies to lycra-loving regulars – to abandon their usual means of transport and get on their bikes.   Those planning to take part are being encouraged to share their plans at cycletoworkday.org and use the #cycletoworkday hashtag. There are all sorts of prizes on offer and so far, 250,000 miles of commute have been pledged. For more information on Cycle to Work Day, visit cycletoworkday.org. Why skipping the train may help you feel better   Research suggests that regular physical activity promotes mental wellbeing. When you cycle (or do any vigorous exercise) your body produces endorphins which can make you feel relaxed and optimistic. Exercise also helps reduce the body’s stress hormones adrenaline and cortisol. Many of us face a long journey to work, which makes cycling all the way impractical. But it is of course possible to cycle part of the journey, and the health benefits of this are still considerable. One excellent option is cycle to your local station rather than driving. You can lock your bike there and commute as usual. Alternatively, folding bikes are allowed on most train services (non-folding bikes are often not), which allows you to cycle at both ends of your commute.  The Carrera Transit Folding Bike , \u0026pound320, is one of many adult bikes with 30 per cent off at Halfords. It features a lightweight aluminium frame and a Nexus hub gearing system for easy maintenance and an easier fold. Get some help early on  Getting healthy is great, but lots of people tell themselves they aren\u0027t fit enough to cycle. The truth is that everyone has to start somewhere and modern technology can make the route to health easier. If you\u0027re worried about that, or perhaps want a little help on steep hills, then an ebike could be the answer. An ebike has a built-in battery which can be recharged using any mains socket. An electrically-driven motor will then help when you need it, keeping your pace steady and helping on hills. The range of an ebike varies based on the capacity of the battery, weight of the rider and type of terrain you\u0027re cycling but expect 30 to 60 miles of assisted range on them, depending on the model.  For example, the Carrera Crosscity E Electric Folding Bike , \u0026pound850, has a battery range of around 30 miles. For most people, this is more than enough for their commute. You can take a folding bike on trains and buses in most cases (check with your local operator), so you have the flexibility to decide how you commute. Not feeling like getting on hot public transport? No problem, jump on the bike instead.  If you\u0027re not using public transport then you can opt for a non-folding eBike. The Carrera Crossfire-E Electric Hybrid Bike , \u0026pound1,000 (save \u0026pound250), has a motor that provides up to 60 miles of pedalling assistance on a single charge and will propel you on to speeds of 15.5mph. Its lightweight alloy frame and 8-speed gearing will also help you out when riding uphill. You might just catch the cycling bug   If you stick at that NHS target of 150 minutes a week you’ll start to feel better, you may lose weight and you’ll find your stamina improves. All in all, it has the potential to do wonders for your overall wellbeing. If Cycle to Work Day gives you the cycling bug, then you may decide to upgrade your bike. One thing to consider when choosing a new bike for your commute is how you\u0027ll use it outside of work. Are you interested in getting up some speed? Do you fancy trying some off road trails? Then you won\u0027t necessarily want to pick a folding bike. If you\u0027re cycling the whole way then you might want to look into a road bike or hybrid. These are lighter than other bikes and offer the chance to get up some real speed.  The Boardman SLR 8.6 , \u0026pound550, is a great choice. Its aluminium alloy frame makes it great for zipping along and the 16-speed gears will help make light work of hills, too. Keep in mind that road bikes have thin tyres and are often slick, which means they might not be best suited to use in the rain. A hybrid on the other hand is a perfect balance between speed and accessibility. Hybrid bikes take elements from road bikes and mountain bikes, so they are a great choice if you are looking for something that\u0027s great on the roads but also suitable for some slightly rougher terrain.  When it comes to hybrids, we love the Carrera Parva Hybrid Bike , \u0026pound200 (save \u0026pound100), which boasts 21-speed Shimano Tourney gears and Tektro V-brakes for improved stopping power. Look after your safety as well as your health  If you\u0027re planning to cycle to work, make sure you invest in a decent helmet - wearing one reduces the risk of serious head injury by nearly 70 per cent. The range of helmets on offer nowadays is huge, varying from ultra light weight helmets that make you feel like you\u0027re wearing nothing, chic and sophisticated helmets ideal for the commuter - to ultra high tech smart helmets that connect to your phone.  The Livall MTL Bluetooth Enabled Smart Helmet , \u0026pound69, has LED indicators and an intelligent SOS alert system which connects to your phone via Bluetooth and will send a distress signal to loved ones with your location in the event of a sudden or unexpected movement. You will also need bike lights if you\u0027re cycling after dark. Grab the Cateye Bike Light Set , \u0026pound17 (save \u0026pound8), and you\u0027re good to go. Even if it\u0027s not night time, many cyclists like to keep lights on all the time for extra visibility.

But public loos are being wiped out at a staggering rate as councils struggle with government budget cuts. More than a QUARTER of public toilets have disappeared since the turn of the century, according to data obtained under Freedom of Information laws. According to the new information - supplied by council areas across the UK - the total number of public toilets across the country has dropped from 3,084 in 2000 to 2,290 in 2018. That is a fall of nearly 800. And authorities in Bolsover, North East Derbyshire, and Wokingham admitted they no longer had ANY council-run loos. In London, of the councils that provided information, the number of public loos was down from 197 in 2000 to just 132 today. The rest of England saw a fall from 2,400 to 1,534, while in Wales numbers had more than halved from 504 to 243. Scotland was down from 759 to 421 while Northern Ireland dropped from 95 to 84.  Campaigners say the problem leaves people with nowhere to go when they need to go and it is affecting everyone from outdoor workers such as builders as well as pregnant women and parents with children. Toilets that can be easily found and used are essential for the elderly and disabled. And with one in five people above 40 suffering from an over-active bladder, the lack of public facilities can make some reluctant to leave their homes due to the risk of being caught short. It is not a legal requirement to provide public lavatories and so when councils aren\u0027t feeling flush, toilet blocks are often targeted first when it comes to cuts. A typical toilet block is estimated to cost between \u0026pound12,000 to \u0026pound15,000 a year to maintain. But Domestos believes that clean, safe toilets should be within everyone’s reach. That is why it is launching the nationwide Use Our Loos initiative to tackle the demise and unlock loos in local coffee shops, cafes, restaurants and bars across Britain’s towns, cities and villages.  The scheme is supported by The Daily Mirror, which is urging local shops and businesses to sign up, throw open their cubicles and make their toilets available to non-customers. As part of the initiative, Domestos is also partnering with The Great British Public Toilet Map – an interactive street map that shows users where their nearest public toilet is and which businesses have signed up to the scheme. The map will be regularly updated as new businesses join. Domestos also plays a role in the Unilever Sustainable Living Plan’s aim to get 25 million people across the world access to a clean and safe toilet by 2020. Domestos has partnered with Unicef, the world’s leading children’s organisa\u0026shytion, since 2012 and has already helped 10 million people around the world get cleaner, safer toilets.  Raymond Martin of the British Toilet Association which campaigns for better public facilities, has praised the initiative, saying it will increase visitors to Britain’s high streets. He says : “As human beings we all have to eat, drink, sleep, breathe and go to the toilet,” he said. “Having access to a clean hygienic toilet is absolutely vital for our everyday life and activity. Rebecca Light, Domestos Senior Brand Manager, says: “In the UK the problem is locating a public toilet. An estimated 2.3 billion people worldwide lack access to clean, safe sanitation. This comes with significant health risks, including diarrhoea, which kills one child every two minutes. It’s vital we change this – and quickly.” "},{"url":null,"title":"government worker bound gagged chair","story":"NewsGovernment worker \u0027bound and gagged to chair by sexist colleagues\u0027 LOSES bullying and harassment caseDeeAnn Fitzpatrick claimed a racist and misogynistic culture within her office drove her to contemplate suicideShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByCharlie Gall06:41, 16 AUG 2018Updated07:30, 16 AUG 2018NewsDeeAnn Fitzpatrick says she was bound and gagged at work in 2010 (Image: BBC)Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA government worker who claims she was tied to a chair and gagged by colleagues who bullied and harassed her has had her case thrown out. DeeAnn Fitzpatrick, 49, accused fellow fisheries workers of mocking and targeting her in a campaign of sexist harassment. The Canadian woman claimed a racist and misogynistic culture within the Marine Scotland office in Scrabster drove her to contemplate suicide. But an employment tribunal has rejected her claims despite a photo showing her gagged and taped to a chair appeared to back up her claims, the Daily Record reports. That evidence was time-barred.  In an earlier hearing in Aberdeen in June, Ms Fitzpatrick alleged she was taped to a chair and gagged by colleagues in 2010. The tribunal heard how she was bombarded with fake Valentine\u0027s Day and birthday cards she believed came from male colleagues A message in one called her an “old troll” and another warned her about trying to “climb the ladder of success”. Ms Fitzpatrick told the tribunal the harassment was so bad she considered taking her own life and contacted an assisted suicide clinic. She told the tribunal: “When I first started getting the cards, it made me feel awful. But as they continued, yes it’s affected my self-esteem. “It’s actually made me become a recluse - I stay at home, I have gone more into myself. With everything going on, I contacted Dignitas in Switzerland. I had enough.” Ms Fitzpatrick, who has worked for Marine Scotland since 2006, was struggling to grasp the tribunal’s verdict.  She said on Wednesday night: “It is difficult when you spend your entire career fighting racism, misogyny and bullies. “Then to make matters worse when you report the incidents, you are the one that is being targeted by an ongoing campaign by senior management because you exposed what they have worked very hard to hide.” The Scottish Government put up one witness, Judith MacKinnon, its head of people advice, who has over 25 years experience in human resources. MacKinnon took up the job last year but said those who dealt with Ms Fitzpatrick’s complaints were too scared to appear because of the intense media interest.  But she backed the decisions taken by junior staff who found insufficient evidence to back up Ms Fitzpatrick’s suspicions about the letters. However First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told MSPs she was “absolutely horrified” when shown the photo of Ms Fitzpatrick allegedly taped to a chair and gagged. She has ordered a top civil servant to conduct a full review into the circumstances and report to her personally. Ms Fitzpatrick’s sister-in-law Sherry said: “The Fitzpatrick family are hugely disappointed with the result of the tribunal.

A poll of 2,000 adults who have experienced jet lag found more than eight in 10 have struggled with severe fatigue after a long-haul flight. Other methods employed include drinking lots of water, giving caffeine the heave-ho and sleeping on the plane as much as possible.  The study was conducted by Love Fresh Cherries , the industry body which supplies cherries to UK supermarkets - in association with NW Cherries .  Registered nutritionist, Anita Bean, said: “Jet lag occurs when your internal body clock becomes disrupted due to crossing time zones.  The main symptoms include fatigue, insomnia, digestive problems, appetite changes and concentration and memory problems. “There’s no cure for jet lag but there are steps you can take before, during and after the flight to help minimise the effects.” Other techniques to get body-clocks back on track include keeping watches set to the time back home and staying awake until pre-travel bedtime. It also emerged, 44 per cent have been unable to sleep the night after returning from a different time zone. On average it takes those polled more than three days to get back to equilibrium after flying long-haul. And it typically sets them back nine hours of sleep each time they suffer a case of dreaded jet lag.  Three in 10 Brits have struggled to concentrate when returning to work and a tenth have even suffered anxiety brought on by shifting time zones after travel. One in 10 have struggled with constipation and a third have suffered from a debilitating headache. A quarter of tired jet lag sufferers said the condition makes them feel frustrated and nearly four in 10 claimed it leaves them feeling totally unproductive. Nearly half admitted jet lag makes them more irritable and 20 per cent feel a general heightening of emotion - making them more prone to bursting into tears. A quarter of respondents have even fallen asleep somewhere unusual due to fatigue from jet lag. Three in 10 have nodded off at work, a fifth have felt their eyes droop while sitting on the loo and a quarter have even fallen asleep behind the wheel of their car.

In total, 26.4 per cent of UK entries were given one of the two top grades, according to data published by the Joint Council for Qualifications (JCQ). This is up 0.1 percentage points on last year. However, figures also show that the proportion of A-Levels handed the very top result has fallen to its lowest level since 2013. One in 12 (8.0%) entries scored an A* grade this year, down 0.3 percentage points on 2017, statistics published by the council show.  The overall A*-E pass rate has also fallen 0.3 percentage points to 97.6%. This is the lowest level since 2010.   A Level results day 2018: All you need to know when you get your grades and what to do next  But the percentage of A-Levels awarded an A or A* is the highest since 2012, according to a Press Association analysis. It is the second year in a row that the A*-A pass rate has risen. Boys continue to outperform girls at the highest grades, the figures show. While 26.6% of boys\u0027 entries were awarded at least an A grade this year, this was the case for 26.2% of girls\u0027 entries. The statistics also show that STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and maths) are continuing to rise in popularity. More than a third (36.2%) of all A-level entries were in these subjects, up from 34.5% last year, and 28% in 2009.  Male students are still more likely to study a STEM subject than females, but the balance is shifting, JCQ said. More girls take biology and chemistry than boys, while more boys take maths and physics. But the data also shows that girls are closing in on the boys, with a 3.1% increase in maths entries from female students (boys\u0027 entries for the subject have risen 2.1%) and a 6.9% rise in physics (2.4% for boys). More than half a million students in England, Wales and Northern Ireland are finding out their A-Level results today after an anxious wait. It comes in the wake of a major exams overhaul - with 24 A-level subjects now reformed. There has been a move away from coursework and modular exams, with sixth-formers instead sitting their exams at the end of two years of study. There have been major reforms to A-Level qualifications in England - with a move away from coursework and modular exams.  Instead, sixth formers sit their exams at the end of two years of study. A Department for Education spokeswoman said: We reformed A-levels after universities told us they were failing to prepare students for higher education. Reducing the number of exams students have to sit will give them more time for study and to gain a deeper understanding of the courses they are studying, an essential skill for undergraduate study. We know exam season can be a time of heightened emotions for pupils wanting to do their best but while testing has always been an important part of education, it should never be at the expense of a young person\u0027s wellbeing. That\u0027s why the Government is investing \u0026pound1.7 billion to promote, protect and improve young people\u0027s mental health. Grades have been awarded for the first time this summer for new A-levels in languages, geography, dance, drama and theatre, music, PE and religious studies. They join the 13 A-level subjects for which the first grades were handed out last summer. Maths is in the process of being reformed and a small number of grades were handed out for the new qualification this summer. Most students have been awarded grades after studying the old A-level course. Overall, the subject is still the most popular A-level, with 2,383 more entries this year compared to 2017. Michael Turner, JCQ director general, said: Students, and teachers, should be congratulated. They can be confident in their grades, knowing they have been achieved in a world-class system that is robust, challenging and fair.  It comes as early figures have showed there has been a fall in the number of students accepted on degree courses at UK universities. In total, 411,860 students - from the UK and overseas - have taken up places, according to initial data published by admissions service Ucas. This is down 1% compared with the same point last year A breakdown shows 353,960 UK students have been accepted on to undergraduate courses, down 2% on 2017. But there is an increase in international students, with 26,400 EU applicants accepted to study at UK universities - up 1% on last year. And a record 31,510 students from nations outside the EU have taken up places - a 4% increase. The figures are a snapshot taken by Ucas shortly after midnight.    The admissions service said that in England, a record 27.9% of the 18-year-old population has been accepted on to courses, with a record 26.3% in Wales. In Northern Ireland, the entry rate is 28.1%, while in Scotland - where results were published last week - 25.9% of 18-year-olds have been accepted. Clare Marchant, Ucas chief executive, said an increase in the proportion of youngsters from disadvantaged background was excellent news. Some 16.1% of those from the most disadvantaged backgrounds have been accepted - up 0.4 percentage points. She added: However, the continuing gap between the most and least advantaged is frustrating, and we\u0027ll keep on working with universities to help them evaluate their outreach activities to impact the most disadvantaged students. The encouraging growth in international students choosing to study in the UK is testament to the welcome of our world-class universities. Students need to get around 55% of the answers right in their Biology A-level in order to secure an A grade, grade boundaries for one exam board suggest. The A grade pass mark required for the reformed OCR advanced Biology A-level is 54.8%, the figures on its website show. Those wanting an A in the reformed maths exam would need to get 65.6% of the answers right. Meanwhile, students who sat the English language A-level would be looking for 77% of the marks in order to secure an A. I\u0027d advise anyone thinking about securing a place through clearing to take some time to visit universities and colleges in the next few days. This weekend\u0027s open days are listed on the Ucas website. Seeing everything in person can help you make the right decision. If you decide your next step isn\u0027t a degree though, information on apprenticeships, gap years and career options is also available on ucas. While many students hoping to go to a university or college of their choice will get the grades they need today, others will inevitably be left disappointed. But The Grand Tour presenter Jeremy Clarkson has told them not to worry. He tweeted: Don’t worry if your A level grades aren’t any good. I got a C and 2 Us. And I’m sitting here deciding which of my Range Rovers to use today. Earlier, Amanda Brown, deputy general secretary of the National Education Union, had argued that changes to A-Levels means that students are unable to fully demonstrate what they can do.

Coursework and other non-exam assessments are a better way for students to demonstrate their skills, are less of a memory test, and help lower attaining students and those with special educational needs and disabilities show their achievements. But Education Secretary Damian Hinds said the redesign of the qualifications would make them more appropriate, better (at) preparing young people for moving on to the next stage, including university. He told Today: Having exams at the end of the two years means that it is possible to consider the subject as a whole, to bring in all the different parts of it, to synthesise the different aspects of the subject in a way that is a little closer to undergraduate study.  A Department for Education spokeswoman said: We reformed A-levels after universities told us they were failing to prepare students for higher education. Reducing the number of exams students have to sit will give them more time for study and to gain a deeper understanding of the courses they are studying, an essential skill for undergraduate study. We know exam season can be a time of heightened emotions for pupils wanting to do their best but while testing has always been an important part of education, it should never be at the expense of a young person\u0027s wellbeing. That\u0027s why the Government is investing \u0026pound1.7 billion to promote, protect and improve young people\u0027s mental health.

The ex-Hollywood lighting director, 74, has told pals he expected Meghan , Samantha and Thomas Jr to help pay for his retirement but complained he had not received a “f***ing dime”. It comes after his ex-wife Doria Ragland was reportedly preparing to move to London to be close to her daughter, 37, and son-in-law Harry, 33. One source told the Daily Mirror: “While he was working, Tom supported all his children. He was generous.  “But he made no secret that he expected in his dotage the money he spent on them would be repaid. “He says they have not given him a f***ing dime back. He is growing increasingly bitter about it, and it has not been helped by how his ex-wife, Meghan’s mum, has been so welcomed into the royal fold. The fact she could be moving to England has not helped the situation while he is in a pokey home in Mexico.” Mr Markle has already revealed he had expected Meghan to look after him. He said: “I took care of my mother for the last five years of her life. “My daughter said she’d take care of me in my declining years. I’m not talking money, I’m talking about taking care of me. That’s important to me.”  However, the Duchess of Sussex and her dad have been estranged for three months. Matters came to a head when Mr Markle slammed the phone down on Harry during a heated phone call. The row came after Mr Markle was found to have lied to his soon-to-be \u0026shyson-in-law by denying colluding with a paparazzi to cash in on staged pictures days before the May 19 wedding. This was the latest in a stream of “dad disappointments” Meghan is said to have endured since she left home to go to university. However, we can reveal Mr Markle’s resentment over money is what initially drove a wedge between him and his children after he retired seven years ago. The Emmy winner, who worked on smash hit sitcom Married With Children, is said to have earned more than six figures each year during his career.  He also reportedly won $750,000 on the California State Lottery in 1990. Mr Markle gifted cash from the windfall to all his children while funding Meghan’s private education. After retiring, he moved from LA to Mexico, in part because of the cheaper lifestyle. Today he rents a $695-a-month – \u0026pound500 – home in Rosarito close to the US border. Despite cutting his costs, he declared himself bankrupt in California in 2016, with \u0026pound24,181 in credit card debts and savings of just \u0026pound160. Meanwhile, friends say Mr Markle is angry that Meghan’s mother has apparently been treated more favourably by the Royal Family than he has. Although the Prince has yet to meet his father-in-law, Doria has seen Harry on several occasions.  The 61-year-old yoga teacher has maintained a dignified silence since news of Meghan’s relationship with Harry emerged two years ago. Yet Mr Markle has publicly attacked his daughter and Doria is said to be furious his other children – Samantha, 53, and Thomas Jr, 51 – have “trashed” their half-sister. Sources say Meghan was also deeply hurt when she discovered her father had been cashing in on her \u0026shyrelationship by staging photos with paparazzi. That revelation was followed by Mr Markle pulling out of attending his daughter’s wedding, due to a heart attack.

Conor Ashton, who nicknamed himself \u0027The Stalking Ransacker,\u0027 targeted single women and held them at knife point while rifling through their underwear drawers. Most of the time, the victims were not at home. But on the last two occasions before he was arrested, he broke into the homes of two women while they were asleep. The dangerous 23-year-old stood over the victims as they slept before using plastic cable ties to bind them while he ransacked their homes, stealing debit cards and phones. He helped himself to hot chocolate and wine as he rooted through their underwear drawers and then laid out garments on beds. A court heard how in a number of disturbing raids, Ashton tagged the houses of his victims with bizarre graffiti which included insults directed at police officers, and pentagrams.  He even left a running total of the number of burglaries he said he had carried out across a four-year period in the Essex town. Chelmsford Crown Court heard how Ashton was obsessed with Satanic killer Richard Ramirez who murdered at least 14 people in attacks that terrorised California in 1985. Cold-blooded killer Ramirez, who started out with burglaries, also left occult symbols at his crime scenes. Ashton was finally arrested by cops with an expert linking his handwriting to the graffiti left behind at homes he’d raided. The former farm worker admitted six counts of burglary and two charges of aggravated burglary. Dressed in a green tracksuit top, white shirt and blue jeans, he cried during his sentencing hearing.  As he was jailed today Judge Christopher Morgan branded him a dangerous offender who had targeted young single women. Stephen Rose, prosecuting, revealed shocking details of the crimes which began in 2013. Ashton burgled a series of university student properties close to his Colchester home but by last year the raids became shockingly violent. On July 10 last year a woman woke to find Ashton next to her bed ‘pointing a blade in her direction’. Mr Rose said: ‘He told the victim not to scream. “He was wearing a black balaclava, black top, black trousers and wearing black gloves and a black rucksack.” Twisted Ashton told the woman to hand over her debit card and pin number, warning her that her housemate was being held by another man.  “He told the victim he would not hurt her, instructed her to lie back before producing two plastic ties and tied her hands and ankles,” Mr Rose said. Ashton then left and his victim waited 20 minutes before calling out to her housemate who was fine and had not seen another person in the house. Ashton, whose family were sat in the packed courtroom, used the debit card to take \u0026pound500 out in three separate withdrawals. Just a month later, on August 14, he broke into a home and tied up another woman with cable ties. She ran shouting and screaming from her home into the arms of her shocked neighbours.  The woman told police she had woken up to the sight of a man at the end of her bed. Balaclava-clad Ashton told her he would not harm her and asked for money before tying her wrists. Mr Rose said Ashton told the woman ‘tell the pigs I had fun on Avon Way [the scene of his earlier raid]. “I already know my next target. It will be next week sometime.” Detectives investigating the case located a laptop stolen in a burglary which they traced back to Ashton. Police arrested Ashton the following month and during a search of his house they found a backpack containing gloves, a balaclava and zip ties.  Officers noticed how Aston had drawn pentagrams on his walls. His computer was seized and it revealed a search for ‘the original night stalker’ as well as for British Army forensics. Mr Rose added: “Part of the Crown’s case is the defendant appears, to some extent, to have modelled himself on a serial offender in America.” The court heard how Ashton had left graffiti in the houses appearing to taunt police. In one case he wrote: \u0027The Stalking Ransacker’, \u002735th burglary\u0027. \u0027Police Suck’, ‘Media Attention’. Ashton’s handwriting from a college application was matched by an expert to the graffiti. He denied involvement at first before later changing his pleas and admitting the string of raids. Richard Conley, mitigating, said the offences were completely out of character for Ashton, suggesting they had in some part been due to him using drugs.

But she\u0027s not the first royal bride to have family troubles, and her late mother-in-law vowed never to speak to her mum again after a series of shocking conversations. Princess Diana\u0027s butler and close friend claims Frances Shand Kydd called her a whore and launched into a hate-filled personal attack on the men she was dating and their religious beliefs. During an interview with the Mirror several years ago, Paul Burrell revealed details of a particularly shocking conversation between the two women just months before Diana\u0027s death.  He revealed further details about their difficult relationship at Diana\u0027s inquest . The telephone conversation referred to Diana\u0027s relationships with heart surgeon Hasnat Khan and businessman Gulu Lalvani. Mr Burrell said: I heard her call, Paul, come quick. She was hanging over the banister shouting down. She waved me over with her hand. I joined her on the floor cross-legged and stuck close beside her. I leant my ear as near to the phone as possible and listened to the conversation - albeit one-way. It was the slurring voice of Mrs Frances Shand Kydd. What I heard was a torrent of abuse, swearing and upsetting innuendo towards the Princess and towards the male company she was keeping.  It was a hate-filled personal attack on the men and their religious beliefs. The conversation ended when Diana slammed the phone, and Mr Burrell later found her sitting on the lounge floor crying. He claims Diana vowed never to speak to her mother again - and she never did. He said: How prophetic and sad those words were - because she didn\u0027t. It is something her mother will have to live with for the rest of her life. At Diana\u0027s inquest, Mr Burrell was asked to speak about the phone conversations she had asked him to listen into. However he was hesitant, replying simply: Respectfully that\u0027s not very kind to a lady who\u0027s no longer here.

But while some did as well as you may think, others achieved just a handful of qualifications - and one particularly high profile royal achieved none. Despite having what has been described as an aptitude for learning, The Queen didn\u0027t have time for formal schooling, having to instead learn the constitutional monarchy ropes from a young age. In contrast, her children and grandchildren have enjoyed a more normal education - and varying degrees of success to show for it.   So how do the royals qualifications measure up? Prince William From 1990, William attended Ludgrove School in Berkshire for five years until he started at Eton College in 1995 where he took his GCSEs and A Levels. He left Eton in 2000 achieving an A in Geography B Art and C Biology. Like many students, The Duke of Cambridge chose to have a gap year before beginning his university course in order to travel and gain a variety of new experiences. He went on to gain a 2:1 degree in Geography at St Andrews University in Scotland, which is where he met his wife, while they were students in residence at St Salvator\u0027s Hall.   The Duke of Cambridge initially began a four-year History of Art degree in 2001 but changed his major to Geography after two years.  The Duchess of Cambridge Kate achieved 11 GCSEs at St. Andrew’s School in Pangbourne in 1995 and then went on to Marlborough College in Wiltshire, where she achieved As in Maths and Art, and a B in English. Leaving Marlborough College in July 2000, The Duchess of Cambridge undertook a gap year in which she studied at the British Institute in Florence, undertook a Raleigh International programme in Chile, and crewed on Round the World Challenge boats in the Solent. Kate graduated from St Andrews University in 2005 with a 2:1 in History of Art  Prince Harry Probably one of the least academic achievers is Prince Harry, who studied at Eton, gaining 11 GCSE\u0027s and a B in Art and D in Geography in his A Levels. On the royal\u0027s website it simply says: His Royal Highness went on to Eton College from September 1998 where he took his GCSEs and A Levels. On William\u0027s it outlines the three A Levels he took. Harry had plenty of successes though throughout his education and during his time at Eton, he was House Captain of Games and represented the school at rugby, cricket and polo, and was a member of the Combined Cadet Force.  He left in 2003 and joined the Army, but before doing so, he spent a year travelling to Australia, Argentina and Africa, where he made a documentary about the plight of orphans in Lesotho. The Duchess of Sussex, Meghan Markle Meghan began her secondary education at Immaculate Heart High School in 1992 where she was known as a hard working and focused student. During her high school years, The Duchess of Sussex performed in theatrical productions at both Immaculate Heart and Loyola High School. Her former drama teacher, Gigi Perreau, who directed Meghan in seven plays, remembered that her former student sparkled.  She said: You see someone nice to the other kids, who gets good grades, doesn\u0027t say anything bad about anybody. America does not test students using GCSEs or A Levels, and it has not been reported what Meghan got on her SATs (which is the test students take as an entry into university) but it is known that she got the grades she needed to get into university. She went on gain a double major in Theatre and International Relations at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois in 2003. During her time at university, The Duchess completed an internship at the US Embassy in Buenos Aires, Argentina, where she learned to speak Spanish. She also studied French for six years.  The Queen She\u0027s met politicians and film stars, speaks French fluently, loves to colour block and still rides a horse at 91 years of age, but the Queen has never sat an academic exam in her life meaning she hasn\u0027t a single GCSE or A Level (O Levels back then) to her name. In her early childhood, the Queen was taught by a governess from 9.30am until 11am. Following the abdication of her uncle Edward VIII in 1938, Elizabeth needed to prepare herself for her future role and received lessons on constitutional history from the vice provost of Eton, Henry Marten. The Queen’s father had disliked school and her mother thought it was more important to have fun,’ Professor Kate Williams, author of Young Elizabeth told Good Housekeeping . Unlike her father, the Queen was and is very bright and had an appetite for learning as well as a razor sharp memory. The lack of a formal education didn\u0027t harm her as she\u0027s naturally analytical and something of an autodidact, as well as being hard working - which we know now is just as important as raw brainpower.    Prince Charles Prince Charles was educated at Gordonstoun where he achieved five O-levels (GCSEs) and two A-levels - a B in History and a C in French. He then went on to Cambridge University where he achieved a 2:2 degree in History Legend has it his bodyguard who was present at all lectures with the young prince sat the exams too - and got a First. Princes Diana Princess Diana met with less success and failed all her O-levels, twice. However she apparently excelled in deportment, having attended finishing school in Switzerland.  Princess Anne, Prince Andrew and Prince Edward Princess Anne, the Princess Royal, attended Benenden school in Kent where she gained six O-levels, and three A-levels in English, History and Politics. While Prince Andrew attended Gordonstoun like his older brother, his academic choices were much like Anne\u0027s - six O-levels and A-levels in English, History and Politics. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Prince Edward also went to Gordonstoun and has nine O-levels, three A-levels in English, History and Politics. He then gained a 2:2 degree in History from Cambridge University.

Staff at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, US, desperately tried to keep Alyssa Gilderhus in the facility when her step-father came to help her \u0027escape\u0027. The Clinic have disputed the family\u0027s version of events in a statement provided to CNN.  However in a video Alyssa\u0027s step-father can be seen helping her out of a wheelchair and into the family car. Staff members come running toward him, yelling No! No!. One of them grabs the teenager\u0027s arm and her stepfather shouts Get your hands off my daughter!.  The car speeds away and soon Mayo security calls 911. We have had a patient abduction, the security officer tells police , according to a transcript of the call. CNN reports that Alyssa\u0027s leaving the hospital was not an abduction but an \u0027escape\u0027 because she and her family were unhappy with the care she was receiving. They had repeatedly asked for her to be transferred to another hospital but they say Mayo refused. The drama began just after Alyssa opened her first Christmas present at her home.  She went to the bathroom and her parents mum Amber Engebretson and stepfather Duane Engebretson heard her scream. The teenager was curled up on the bathroom floor and vomiting. At a nearby hospital, doctors determined she had a ruptured brain aneurysm and they drilled a hole into her skull to relieve the pressure on her brain. Later that day she was transferred to the world-renowned medical centre the Mayo Clinic, located 135 kilometres away. Doctors gave her a 2% chance of survival but after four brain surgeries in the next month Alyssa beat the odds and was transferred to a rehabilitation centre. This is when tensions between the family and the hospital began. On February 22 last year Alyssa\u0027s mum was kicked out of Mayo following a disagreement with staff and banned from stepping foot on the hospital property.  Despite repeated requests from both Alyssa and her mother to transfer her to a different hospital, Mayo refused to let her leave. In a Facebook post, Amber wrote that her daughter was “basically a prisoner of Mayo”. CNN reports that Alyssa was examined by a psychiatrist who found she “lacked the capacity to make her own medical decisions”.  Five days after her mother was banned, staff at Mayo discovered Alyssa had been recording a video for her mum and took away her phone, laptop and tablet. They then refused to let visitors bring similar devices into her room. Her stepfather had an idea to help Alyssa \u0027escape\u0027. They pretended an elderly relative was visiting to see the teenager but was unableto get to her room so Alyssa would have to come down and see her. With his nine-year-old daughter secretly filming, Duane wheeled Alyssa down to the hospital car park. The video showed Amber in the driver’s seat. Alyssa, we’re going to go home honey,” she said to her daughter. Once in the car, Duane yelled at his wife to drive: “Get out of here Amber. Go, go, go, go, go, go!”.

One of her first customers didn\u0027t seem to notice, simply thanking Shannon for her drink and carrying on the conservation. But unsurprisingly people started to clock what was happening, and it wasn\u0027t long before she was the centre of attention - and some of her customers\u0027 reactions were just hilarious.  Shannon\u0027s unusual look was the work of artist Jen Seidel , who is known as Jen the Body Painter , and her apprentice daughter Kennedy.

But the Kremlin attack came as Moscow is staging a significant naval show of strength in polar waters after dispatching warships on a summer patrol ostensibly to \u0027counter terrorism\u0027. A panel of MPs this week claimed Russia posed a serious threat to Britain and urged Ministers to show greater ambition and apply more resources to countering Putin’s alleged menace in the Arctic. It claimed Russia’s new military firepower in the region - including the reopening of old Soviet bases - went far beyond strictly defensive needs.  But Moscow claimed the report On thin ice: UK defence in the Arctic from the Commons’ Defence Sub-Committee was “sabre-rattling”. These speculations are yet another attempt to promote the idea of military build-up in the Arctic under imaginary pretexts,” said the Russian embassy in London. “They run counter to the existing international legal framework and completely undermine huge efforts undertaken in the Arctic Council, where the UK is an observer state.”  Moscow considers the Arctic to be an area for constructive dialogue and equal, conflict-free cooperation in the interests, a diplomatic source said. Britain should be aware of “impressive prospects for trade” and “economic and infrastructure cooperation in the Arctic”. It was time to stop “sabre-rattling in this part of the globe”. Coinciding with the MPs’ report Russia sent warships and supply vessels from the country’s Northern Fleet to the Arctic, sailing from naval base Severomorsk. It is expected to patrol across nine time zones, taking advantage of climate change which has left the polar waters largely free of thick ice this summer.  Among the vessels in the task force are large anti-submarine warfare ship Vice-Admiral Kulakov, major amphibious assault ships Alexander Otrakovsky and Kondopoga, ocean minesweeper Vladimir Gumanenko, and Ilya Muromets. The voyages purported aim is to ensure safe shipping and provide for Russia’s other maritime economic activity in the Arctic region - and to counter terrorist threats. A detachment of Northern fleet ships has carried out a number of manoeuvres designed to avert various types of terrorist threats,” said a Russian naval source.

We knew it would be a good game, we know what Hibs are about, they are a very good team.“I enjoyed the way we played, some of the stuff in the first half was excellent but we know they have quality and put us under pressure. I’m pleased we stuck to our guns and we got what we deserved.”There was plenty to be happy about including an impressive display from winger Cammy Dow.Jimmy said: “Sam Jackson did great, he’s a confident big boy and I thought Cammy Dow was excellent – he’s a massive Dundee fan as well, which is great.”The second-round draw is today at 1pm.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"csaba proud of his dundee united players for handling pressure at queen of the south","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United’s players might have been feeling the pressure according to boss Csaba Laszlo but he was proud they didn’t show it in their their 2-1 victory at Queen of the South.An impressive first-half display put the Tangerines in a winning position as Sam Stanton and debutant Pavol Safranko gave them a two-goal lead.The second period saw United have to defend their lead as the Doonhamers came at them with Stephen Dobbie knocking in after 67 minutes – Csaba’s men, though, held them at arms length for the rest of the contest and grabbed their first victory of the league season.The manager said: “I am proud of the boys because they did a good job.“We were under pressure because we knew against Dunfermline we lost an important game and now the second game of the season we had to perform and to win.“This was definitely a very good team performance and I am proud of the boys, they worked for each other.“We had a really bad start at home against Dunfermline and I think the players felt there was pressure.“We don’t want to disappoint our fans again and you saw there were a lot of our fans at the game and they celebrated also.“The fans made the noise against Dunfermline that it wasn’t good enough and we heard that.“I said after that Dundee United can play better football and our fans deserved more spirit, more fighting spirit and better results.“That pressure is always there if you have the jersey of Dundee United, if you are the manager of Dundee United, work for Dundee United you are the biggest club in the Championship and everybody wants to beat you.“People think it is easy to win a game, it is not easy – you have to respect the opponent, you have to know in this league it is not always nice football, it is more fighting and desire.“You could see Queen of the South didn’t give up, in the second half they put I don’t know how many balls up front.“I am really pleased with the first-half performance, I am a little bit angry we don’t close the game out but I’m happy with the three points and the performance from the team.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee boss neil rues missed chances in defeat by aberdeen","story":"\t\t\t\t\tNeil McCann has admitted a failure to even go close with clear-cut chances cost Dundee dearly as they went down narrowly to Aberdeen on Saturday.The Dark Blues lost out to a late Gary Mackay-Steven penalty at Dens Park and, while he had no complaints about the decision, Neil was left frustrated as he saw three clear-cut opportunities squandered at the other end.Twice Sofien Moussa blasted the ball well over when given a sight of goal, while strike partner Jean Mendy fired wide.And if the other areas of their game earned praised from the manager, he knows misses like that have cost the team dearly in two defeats so far.That’s why he’s looking to add another striker to his squad and Shrewsbury front man Sam Jones watched the game from the main stand.A five-figure deal has been agreed with the Shrews and the 26-year-old will be signed up this week if he can agree personal terms.Addressing those misses first, Neil admits his front two should have done better.“When you create three, I would call them 100% chances through on goal, and you don’t work the goalkeeper once, that’s where you fall down,” he said. “It’s sore because outside the chances they don’t take, I think the forward work was exceptional. Moussa got absolutely battered at times but his hold up play was great. Mendy worked his socks off up there.“But you have to work the keeper and they know that. It’s not that I’m having a go at them, they understand that.“I do think we need help in that department. There’s no guarantees I bring a striker in and he’s going to do better but we need to bring players in for those areas.“That being said we do work.

I went to Bobby to get his opinion on it at the end of the game and regardless of how close Gensi is, he felt it was a penalty.

It has been non-stop.“It was only five days and my first game so I need to know how my team-mates play.“I had four training sessions so it was a little bit crazy but it was good to help the team to win by scoring.“I’m happy with the start but the three points were the most important thing.“We have to start to win games but when I score it is always nice.“It was a good pass from Frederic Frans and I saw the goalkeeper went down so I just wanted to put it behind him and I think it was a good strike.“I think the first half was a good performance and we need to build on that.“The second half wasn’t perfect so we need to change something there.”Safranko joined the club on a year-long loan deal from Danish side Aalborg last week.He was well-known to manager Csaba Laszlo, though, as they worked together at Dunajska Streda (DAC) in Slovakia.There, Safranko knocked in six goals in 12 games after signing for the second half of the season as DAC went on an extended unbeaten run.And the chance to work with Csaba once more was a big draw for the striker once he heard Aalborg were happy to let him leave.He said: “I played under Csaba Laszlo in Slovakia at Dunajska Streda.“There we were unbeaten for 16 games in a row so I know what I can expect from him and I’m looking forward to playing for him again.“Csaba was the big part of why I joined Dundee United because I had a really good relationship with Csaba.

inaction","story":"\u0026nbspFED-UP community leaders say they can no longer tolerate the lack of action over the fire-ravaged Eastgate Hostel building in Inverness city centre.Members of Crown and City Centre Community Council fear the wrangle over the building \u0026ndash which went up in flames in 2013 \u0026ndash will be a repeat of the impasse at the nearby B-listed Viewhill House which remains a prominent blot on the city\u0027 landscape since fire also struck there 11 years ago.They are calling on Highland Council either to approve redevelopment plans for the former hostel in Stephens Brae, or to acquire the eyesore building.Community council leader Pat Hayden said lessons had to be learned from the case of Viewhill House in Old Edinburgh Road.Once the home of renowned 19th century engineer Joseph Mitchell and later a youth hostel, it has remained derelict since the fire amid a legal wrangle between the present and former owners and a lack of funding for renovations.\"The former youth hostel at Viewhill is in our Crown area and is truly a blight on the landscape,\" Mrs Hayden said.\"We cannot allow Eastgate Hostel to follow suit, particularly as it is situated in such a prime city centre location.\"Members of the community council can no longer tolerate the lack of action regarding Eastgate Hostel.\"An application was lodged by the owners earlier this year to remove the scaffolding from the building and demolish the remaining structure ahead of construction.But it still has to be determined after a council officer and Historic Environment Scotland voiced disquiet about proposals to rebuild the facade at a lower height.In its submission to council planners, the community council states: \"We urge the council to make every effort to resolve this situation, either by granting permission which might allow the applicants to proceed or alternatively, failing that, acquiring the building, presumably at a basic land value given its condition.\"James Maxwell, chairman of Inverness Civic Trust, said his organisation is also keen to see progress at the site,\"Our basic position was that we wanted to see the whole of the frontage of the Eastgate building restored to the original design,\" he said.\"But if finances prevented that, as a compromise we did not object to salvaging part of it, provided architectural connectivity between the ground and first floor was preserved.\"Meanwhile chiropodist James Crawford, whose practice is close to the site, was contacted by Inverness city manager David Haas after his calls for a public meeting on the building\u0027 future were reported in the Inverness Courier.Mr Crawford has declined the offer of a private meeting with Mr Haas and the owners\u0026rsquo agent.\"It has gone beyond that \u0026ndash there should be a public meeting,\" he said.\"It is ridiculous that the unresolved issues at Eastgate and Viewhill have gone on for this long.\"Mr Haas said any interested parties could contact him and the main focus was currently to get the scaffolding down.\"There is great pressure on the owners to come up with a scheme to do that,\" he said.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspA spokesman for the building\u0027 owners said: \"We are working very closely with Highland Council to move this forward as quickly as possible. Circumstances are changing to allow us to move a lot quicker.\"Thursday 16 Aug 2018 4:35 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117069.jpg","title":"Co op opens new distribution centre at Dalcross","story":"\u0026nbspA \u0026pound6 million distribution centre that will help the Co-op expand its presence across the north has officially opened for business.The 12,000 sq ft Dalcross Distribution Centre at Inverness Airport Business Park (IABP) will service the Co-op\u0027 network of stores in the region.It will also help service the convenience store operator\u0027 ongoing \u0026pound28 million expansion and renovation plans.These will see 18 new Co-op store open across Scotland by the end of the year, with a further 20 upgraded to take the total number of stores to 365 and the number of Co-op employees to almost 6000.The new Dalcross facility currently employs 50 staff.Andy Perry, logistics director of the Co-op, said: \"We\u0026rsquore thrilled to be able to launch our new site at Dalcross \u0026ndash it\u0027 a modern and future-proofed facility which is perfectly placed to support the Co-op\u0027 ever-growing operations in Scotland.

Homebase has been one of the most recognisable retail brands for almost 40 years, but the reality is we need to continue to take decisive action to address the under-performance of the business and deal with the burden of our cost base, as well as to protect thousands of jobs.\"The CVA is therefore an essential measure for the business to take and will enable us to refocus our operations and rebuild our offer for the years ahead.\"Retail workers trade union Usdaw says it is seeking \"urgent clarification\" from Homebase owner Hilco over its long-term plans for the firm.National officer Dave Gill said: \"All too often staff are excluded from the CVA process as the future of their jobs is being decided.\"Clearly there is a huge task ahead.

Olivia was really chuffed about it.“It did feel a little weird coming home, just because we know that everything is going to be different.”Olivia was reunited with her two sisters, Taylor and Billie, after five weeks apart.Senga said: “My other two girls were at home for five weeks, and we’re just trying to get back into the routine of spending time together as a family.“She’s really loved it, I can’t get peace and quiet now. But it’s been great for her to spend time with her little sister, and she’s happy to have them back.”The youngster was given the prognosis of spastic diplegic cerebral palsy at the age of 14 months – the neurological condition causes constant stiffness and tightness of leg and arm muscles, making mobility difficult.The family had previously thought treatment in the US was the only option and had set about raising £70,000 when they received the good news that Olivia had been deemed an ideal candidate for the operation in Bristol.Olivia is currently gearing up to go back to school next Tuesday.Senga hopes that she’ll be ready to go back with her classmates, and says they’ll “play it by ear” for the first few weeks.She said: “We’ll just need to see how she gets on, and if she needs to reduce her time at school then that’s what we’ll do.”Senga hopes that the surgery will now make Olivia able to do things that her friends and classmates can.She said: “So much has changed for her, she can sit on a bench now, she can sit crossed legged, it doesn’t sound like a big thing, but it is for her.“It’s little steps, and it’s good for her that she can be part of that.“I know that sitting on a bench isn’t a big thing, but her sitting with her classmates is a big thing for her.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/08/5b752334e0906-884x564.jpg ","title":"aberdeen sandwich shop cleans up with glowing report1","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAn Aberdeen sandwich shop that was criticised by inspectors earlier this year has now been given a glowing report.Aberdeen City Council sent an inspector for a routine check of Deja Vu food shop on Rose Street in March and their report said improvement was needed.The inspector expressed concern about the condition of some of the equipment and cleanliness.Several insects were spotted in the back kitchen area, which is not used for food preparation.The business’s owner, Roy Duncan, said he immediately called in pest controllers and the insects were removed within hours.He added that he spoke with the council inspectors in depth so he was able to attend to their concerns.According to the council, the premises was re-inspected on June 8 and they gave it a pass rating – meaning that all the original concerns had been dealt with.Mr Duncan, who has been in the food trade for 30 years, said: “It was quite a shock because, having been in the trade for so long, I had always passed these inspections and known exactly what gets you a pass and what doesn’t.

They are the tickets many of us have to buy in order to get to work.”Mr Chambers said: “We wrote to the prime minister in June outlining what passengers had been telling us about their nightmare journeys to work that were happening day after day.“The response we got in July suggests no end in sight to the reduced services on many lines subject to interim emergency timetables.“We’ve also learned further timetable improvements in December this year have been postponed indefinitely.”Transport Focus chief executive Anthony Smith said passengers would be “amazed” at the increase.He added: “A fares freeze would benefit all passengers, begin the process of re-building trust and start to bring passengers back to a railway they can rely on.“We know 30% of rail commuters are satisfied with the value for money of their ticket.“Despite substantial investment in new trains and track, many passengers have yet to experience a more reliable railway with accurate information, less disruption and better value for money.”ScotRail and GNER, which run rail services through Aberdeen and the north-east, are represented by the Rail Delivery Group, whose spokesman said most ticket income is spent on maintaining the rail network.“For every pound spent on fares, 98p goes back into running and improving the railway,” said the spokesman.“Thanks to income from fares, as well as the private sector and the taxpayer, the rail industry is seeing the highest level of investment in a generation, changing and improving the railway.“Seventy brand new ScotRail trains were introduced on key routes across Scotland in autumn 2017 with free wifi in all carriages.”A UK Department for Transport spokesman said: “This is the sixth year in a row where this government will cap regulated fares in line with inflation.”The Scottish Transport Secretary Michael Matheson said: “We recognise fares increases are unwelcome. That is why we have taken action to minimise these.“ScotRail’s price promise scheme also ensures passengers have access to information on best-value fares and refunds are issued where a cheaper alternative can be found.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/08/5b75231442bcc-940x528.jpg ","title":"opening door on creativity with new art for charitys half century","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA new piece of artwork has been created to mark an Aberdeen charity’s 50th birthday.Adelphys, part of Aberdeen Inspired’s Painted Doors, was designed by artist Kelly-Anne Cairns, in collaboration with some of Aberdeen Cyrenians’ female service users.A number of workshops were held over the summer to work on the Painted Door on Adelphi Lane.The group came together to explore painting techniques, create symbols, stencils and to build confidence in themselves while also unleashing their creativity.Adelphys shows a strong woman wearing a dress which features a tree and flowers, and is inspired by the four elements.Kelly-Anne Cairns, the artist behind the piece, said: “I’m so proud of Adelphys, how amazing the ladies group from the Cyrenians were, how the theme for Adelphys evolved and everything she stands for.“Adelphys displays an inner strength and resilience, she’s made of the four elements of life – earth, wind, fire and water.”Some of the service users used the stencils they had created as well as free-hand skills to decorate the branches of the tree in Adelphys’ dress, and to adorn her arms with henna-like designs.The work corresponds with Aberdeen Cyrenians’ 50th anniversary.The charity operates a number of services, and opened Aberdeen’s first women’s hostel, alongside emergency accommodation for young people, violence against women and domestic abuse services.The charity was chosen to highlight and raise awareness of the huge scope of services they provide for the community, and in particular, the work that it does for women.The first of its kind in Scotland, the Painted Doors initiative was originally launched in July 2016, as part of Aberdeen Inspired’s Summer of Art project.Due to popular demand, the project was brought back last year for the second time, and again this year.A number of doors continue to be painted in the city, with recent additions including Alison Chandler’s piece in the Bridge Street wildflower meadow, and David Iain Brown’s East Green piece.Adrian Watson, CEO of Aberdeen Inspired, said: “The painted Doors project is one that continues to build a significant presence in the city centre.

The Tories’ policy is set to cost around £4 million – yet boosting the wages of those receiving less than the real living wage would cost, at most, under £400,000.This smacks of utter hypocrisy from the Tories, after their comments of recent days regarding pay for forces personnel.What the Tories are choosing to overlook is the immense benefits service personnel have living in Scotland, like free prescriptions and university tuition fees for their children.  And it’s only those earning above £33k who pay a fraction more.If they are so concerned with equality – why aren’t they ensuring that all MoD staff are paid the living wage?Boosting the incomes of the lowest paid MoD staff could cost the Tories less than a tenth of what they are spending to top up higher incomes – yet once again, for people on lower incomes they are not prepared to lift a finger.The Tories’ double standards know no bounds – it’s one rule for the elite and another for the rest.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"the sands of time are running out","story":"\t\tDorothy H CrawfordUpdated: 02/08/18, 6:33 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowAncient sayings relating to sand generally highlight its abundance. In the Bible for example: ‘I will…make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.’ But despite estimates that Earth contains roughly seven quintillion, 500 quadrillion grains of sand, world stocks are running dangerously low.Chemically, sand is mostly silicon dioxide, and is non-renewable.  It is essential for manufacturing bricks, plaster, glass, microchips, and above all concrete the most popular and versatile modern building material.  Concrete accounts for 75 per cent of our demand for sand with around 20 billion tons produced globally each year.  Even so, surely there’s an almost infinite sand supply from deserts.Unfortunately not.  Sand grains come in different shapes and sizes, and while desert sand has small, smooth grains, concrete requires large, coarse-grained sand.  This is generally mined from rivers, beaches and the sea bed.  And because international control of sand mining is well-nigh impossible, sand piracy is rife, causing huge ecological damage.Recently, 24 Indonesian islands were mined to extinction, with most of the sand used for land reclamation in Singapore, the world’s largest sand importer.Our dependence on concrete is not just for new builds.  Concrete’s life expectancy is just 50-60 years, after which so-called ‘concrete creep’ allows water seepage that corrodes supporting metal structures. So more concrete is required to repair or replace old buildings.Now engineers are coming up with ingenious ideas for repairing cracked concrete, including using bacteria and fungi that produce calcium carbonate.This could heal micro-cracks but the process will be years in development, while right now the US spend around $79 billion annually on bridge and highway maintenance and there are an estimated 188 million daily trips across ‘at risk’ bridges.Many UK bridges are similarly at risk, so do we have a solution? The short answer is ‘no’, but right now the race is on to find new, more durable building materials to replace the need for sand and in so-doing preserve marine ecosystems.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures 4","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 02/08/18, 11:35 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowReader Fiona McCuish provides this week\u0026#8217s photograph, which features the Crinan Basin in colourful glory despite driecht overcast weather.

Fraser Watt gave them the lead on 17 minutes and Lewis Montgomery added a second on 33 minutes.A second from Fraser Watt five minutes later made it 3-0 at the break.James Cameron pulled a goal back for Inverness on 54 minutes but most of the pressure was around the Inverness goal. Inveraray had plenty shots but didn’t hit the target as often as they would have liked.They did get a fourth goal though when Allan MacDonald scored on 64 minutes.Bute 5 Kilmory 0Bute stay in the title race after they beat Kilmory 5-0 on the island.Bute attacked from the start and a combination of dogged Kilmory defending and wastefulness in front of goal meant the hosts only had a good Steven Dunn finish on 30 minutes to show for their first half efforts.When referee Des McNulty pointed to the penalty spot on 54 minutes, Iain McDonald stepped up to slam the ball home.Robert Walker scored on 63 and 85 minutes, either side of a 70th minute Craig MacKay goal, to complete the 5-0 victory.Aberdour 0 Inveraray 1Inveraray\u0026#8217s second team moved off the bottom of the table after a \u0026#8216smash and grab\u0026#8217 job on fourth-placed Aberdour.The Royal Burgh side travelled with only 12 players. Despite having a hand injury, 16-year-old Gregor Mather returned between the sticks after missing the previous week’s defeat to Col Glen and he would go on to turn in a man-of-the-match performance. Coll Mackay and Calum MacDonald, both aged 15, started up front.Aberdour started the brighter, creating many chances, but a combination of wasteful shooting and superb goalkeeping prevented Lisa MacColl’s side taking the lead.Inveraray’s centre line grabbed a hold of the game towards the end of the first half, with wingers Campbell Watt and Steven Cameron adapting well to their unaccustomed roles.Aberdour dominated large chunks of the second half but struggled to break down the visitors.Inveraray, though, have Gregor Mather to thank for some heroic saves to keep the scoreline blank.Aberdour goalkeeper Tom Bowerman had a quiet afternoon until 89 minutes when he picked the ball out of the net. Young Calum MacDonald, the smallest player on the park, ran through several challenges to push the ball into the back of the net and give Inveraray the lead.There wasn’t much time for referee David Mitchell to add and his final whistle signalled an Inveraray victory.Photo: Stephen Lawson\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters week 31","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 03/08/18, 11:38 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,On behalf of local walkers I would like to thank the Forestry Commission for mowing the path between the Mealdarroch water tank track and The Kintyre Way.It is a beautiful forest walk and one of the least muddy in the area during the wet weather.Ann Thomas, TarbertThanks to the separatist\u0026#8217s tax hikes, Scotland has seen a 12 per cent rise in personal insolvencies.There were 3,208 bankruptcies and protected trust deeds from April to June this year, up from 2,869 in the same period last year.More and more Scots are struggling with debt yet the SNP has chosen to hammer families with higher income taxes.While taxes continue to rise in Scotland the revenue generated is being wasted \u0026#8211 a recent bullying claim probe into a police chief has wasted almost £100,000 of public money. The Scottish Police Authority disclosed the money spent on lawyers during the probe.Taxpayers have footed the legal fees of investigating the claims against former police chief Phil Gormley, who quit earlier this year amid multiple bullying allegations.The public was angry enough at how this case has been handled by the SNP Government and SPA, so it is even more frustrating to find out that tens of thousands were wasted on this fruitless task.It seems that the separatist\u0026#8217s wastefulness and incompetence which we have seen so much of in their mishandling of our economy also extends to their mismanagement of Police Scotland matters.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,With the Edinburgh Festivals about to start, can I remind your readers to helpfully inform visitors to our city that, unlike the made-up and damaging \u0026#8216tradition\u0026#8217 of rubbing Greyfriars Bobby\u0026#8217s nose, it is a genuine Edinburgh tradition to pause for a moment in the Royal Mile beside St Giles to lick the Heart of Midlothian.John Hein, EdinburghSir,I am writing to invite your readers to join me in hosting a World Tea Party this summer in support of working animal charity SPANA.Holding a Moroccan, Indian, British, Kenyan, or another world-themed party, is the perfect way to get together with friends and try out exciting and exotic new recipes, while also raising vital funds to help the world’s most hardworking animals.In many developing countries, working animals transport food, water, goods and people, and make it possible for millions of the poorest families to earn a small income. However, they often endure short, painful lives without the most basic requirements.This is where SPANA makes such a huge difference, ensuring animals have access to the free veterinary treatment they urgently need when they are sick or injured.Actors Dame Judi Dench and Joanna Lumley are throwing their support behind this year’s event, and we hope your readers will be inspired to take part and help transform the lives of working animals around the world.The SPANA World Tea Party fundraising pack, full of free recipes, is available from www.spana.org/teaparty or by calling 020 7831 3999.SPANA World Tea Party Host, Tom HorsfieldSir,It only takes one person to put a stop to the accidental loss of life to drowning.With recent headlines being filled with tragic stories of people losing their lives to drowning, Lesley Laird, Shadow Scottish Secretary and the Royal Life Saving Society UK (RLSS UK) urge the public to be that \u0026#8216one person\u0026#8217: take some simple precautions and get \u0026#8216water smart\u0026#8217, before cooling off this summer.For more information on the issue, the statistics involved and interview opportunities, please contact Claire Huggins on 0300 323 0096 or email clairehuggins@rlss.org.ukSenior Communications Executive, Claire HugginsSir,There are more people using Instagram for interiors inspiration than ever before, but 70 percent of Scottish Instagram users feel dissatisfied with their homes after looking at images of other people’s houses on social media, a study has found.Researchers who polled 1,500 UK adults using social media for inspiration with their homes, found that a whopping 66 percent of those are displeased with their home. They admit to feeling this way once a month or more after scrolling through other properties on Instagram, with 25-34-year-olds feeling dissatisfied most frequently.The findings describe people having an unrealistic idea of what their home should look like, spending time worrying about flaws which would be unnoticeable to others, whilst feeling pressure to maintain a certain appearance in their home and being self-conscious of it in front of visitors. This mindset has been described by Chartered Psychologist, Dr David Lewis, as ‘Home Dysmorphic Disorder’ (HDD).energypr representative, Beth ReynoldsSir,Researchers at the University of St Andrews have shown for the first time that some of the standard measures of memory in rodents and humans are likely based on the same cognitive process which could have implications for development of treatments for memory disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease.One of the most widely used memory tests for rodents is the novel object recognition test, in which animals explore two objects one of which is new and the other they have seen before.The results of new research showed that their participants object recognition scores were far more associated with their memory abilities than their preferences for newness.One of the research team, Dr James Ainge, of the School of Psychology and Neuroscience at St Andrews said: \u0026#8216This is important as it provides some of the first evidence that the standard memory tests in humans and rats are testing the same cognitive process. If we want to find a treatment or cure for disorders of memory like Alzheimer’s disease then we need to have a test of memory in animals that is analogous to human memory tests.\u0026#8217Steve Bargeton, St Andrews\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"soccer centre scores with support from ardrishaig community trust","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 04/08/18, 5:52 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowIn a fantastic boost for youth football in Mid Argyll, the Ardrishaig Community Trust and Lochgilphead Soccer Centre have jointly announce that Ardrishaig Community Trust will be the main sponsor of Lochgilphead Soccer Centre for the next three years.The funding package, worth £5,000 for each of the next three years, will make a huge contribution to the centre’s ambitious development plans – it already has more than 120 members, including around 40 from Ardrishaig.The development plan will see the Soccer Centre invest in new equipment, quality coaching to help the youngsters develop their football skills, participation in football festivals, and attend Scotland games, among other things.The funding will meet the cost of around 100 new football strips, all branded with Ardrishaig Community Trust, and will help ensure all Lochgilphead Red Star YFC teams are kitted out the same, from primary one to sevens (including the girls’ teams).The cost of kit to keep the coaches – who contribute the equivalent of around £15,000 a year in time – warm and dry throughout the year, will be part funded by the sponsorship. The coach kit will also bear Ardrishaig Community Trust’s logo.The funding will also see more than £2,000 per annum set aside to allow teams to take part in football festivals throughout Argyll and further afield, and also to pay for festivals to be held locally.This will allow local youngsters to benefit from the experience of playing in festivals against a wide range of teams from all over Scotland, and help to tackle remoteness and exclusion.As part of the funding agreement, the Soccer Centre will display a banner recognising the role of Ardrishaig Community Trust as its main sponsor.The player of the year award for each age group at the annual awards evening will be dedicated to the Ardrishaig Community Trust.And, finally, the Soccer Centre will look to encourage, support and participate in the work of Ardrishaig Community Trust.

The ball made its way through to the unmarked Robert Walker who had the simple task of tapping the ball home to open the scoring with 15 minutes played.Bute’s centre line started to dominate play and John MacCallum set up Iain MacDonald who made it 2-0 five minutes before the break.Inveraray came out stronger in the second half, enjoying the bulk of play, but it was Bute who scored a third goal with Robert Walker netting with 15 minutes remaining.The goal seemed to spark life into the Inveraray team who went on to score two goals in a four-minute spell.Craig Taylor fired home an unstoppable shot on 79 minutes, and just a couple of minutes later captain John MacKenzie made it 3-2.The visitors almost snatched a draw at the death through a Steven Cameron shot which went just inches wide of goal.Taynuilt 2 Kilmory 3Alister MacArthur scored twice as Kilmory beat Taynuilt at the Taynuilt Sports Field.Taynuilt started strongly, but while they dominated play the Kilmory keeper didn’t have a save to make the home side missed chances.The second half was only three minutes old when Alister MacArthur, who individually has scored more goals than the whole Taynuilt team this season, showed the reason why by firing the ball past Reid in the Taynuilt goal.He repeated the feat five minutes later to give Kilmory a two goal cushion.This seemed to stir Taynuilt into action and David Campbell scored from the edge of the D on the hour to reduce the deficit.Taynuilt went all out for the equaliser but were caught out on 72 minutes when Sandy Leiper ran away from his marker and laid the ball off to Ally MacLennan to slip it passed Reid and restore Kilmory\u0026#8217s two-goal advantage.It was a crucial strike as the home side pulled a goal back just six minutes later after a well-worked corner between David Campbell and Jamie MacFarlane with the latter firing a shot passed the Kilmory keeper to make it 3-2.Taynuilt laid siege to the Kilmory goal for the remainder of the game but they lacked the composure to get an equaliser.Best for Kilmory were Jones, Cunningham, and MacArthur and man of the match, Leiper.Kilmory leapfrog Taynuilt in the league and unless Taynuilt can find someone to put the ball in the net, they are going to be in the relegation dog-fight.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"past times present fun in lochgilphead","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 10/08/18, 11:29 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowOrganisers reckon 450 people came along to enjoy a dip into the past.Lochgilphead Community Council\u0026#8217s annual Celtic and Pictish Festival is gathering momentum year on year as it grows into an event with a character all of its own.Morning shoppers on Argyll Street were treated to the unusual sight of Picts, Vikings and Romans parading to Lochgilphead front green to begin the festivities.

Saints had the majority of possession in the second 20 minutes but the Star back line of Kyle Selfridge, Andy Weir and Luke Naisby remained resolute along with Luke Kalache in goal.The other sides in group two were debutants Port Glasgow who ran out 2-0 winners against Neilston as two first half goals sealed the match in the Inverclyde men’s favour.Red Star’s next game against Neilston was an entertaining affair. After a goalless first half, Star took the lead through Ian McGuinness before an equaliser from Neilston after some sloppy defending. Innes Meikle restored the Red Star advantage with a long range effort which he curled away from the Neilston keeper for 2-1. Star were once again pegged back however as a free kick into the box bamboozled Kalache in the box and ended up in the back of the net. Just as it looked like the points would be shared Gregor Peacock got on the end of a Cammy MacDonald flick on and headed into the net to secure a 3-2 win for the hosts.Oban Saints and Port Glasgow took to the Astro next and the Oban side soon got into their stride and ran out comfortable 2-0 winners to move to the top of the section on goal difference.Saints stayed on to play their final group match against Neilston and they continued to play some excellent attacking football with Donald Campbell scoring the pick of the goals in a 3-0 win to secure top spot.This left Red Star and Port Glasgow to face each other in the final game to determine who would go through as runners up. Both sides were keen to secure the victory but the defences remained on top in a 0-0 draw and the Lochgilphead side made it through after picking up five points from their three matches with Port Glasgow finishing on four.Over at the Ropework, Campbeltown Pupils opened up their campaign with a 1-0 victory over local rivals Tarbert. Kilsyth, making their tournament debut, also got off to an excellent start with a 3-1 victory over Dunoon.Dunoon stayed on to play against old rivals Campbeltown Pupils in what turned out to be a feisty encounter with the Pupils running out 2-1 winners thanks to a Martin McCallum free kick in the final minute.Tarbert then took on Kilsyth in a 1-1 stalemate, with Nikki MacDougall scoring the equaliser, before fighting out another draw with Dunoon to end the campaign with two points.This left Kilsyth and Pupils fighting for the top two spots in the final match of the section and the North Lanarkshire side edged the tie 1-0 to secure top spot and a semi-final against Red Star.The first semi-final saw Oban Saints take on Campbeltown Pupils, with Saints taking the lead in the first half after Fraser McFarlane was felled in the box. Up stepped Lewis Cameron to make no mistake from the spot.Pupils weren’t lying down, however and got back into the game with a penalty of their own to equalise, and will be disappointed not to have forced a winner late on.The match was decided by a penalty shoot-out and Saints eventually came out in top on a contest that swung back and forward, providing some excellent entertainment for the crowd that had gathered.The second semi-final also proved to be an exciting affair as Red Star took on Kilsyth. The hosts fell behind early on when Kilsyth opened the scoring after their midfielder finished well from 20 yards to beat Kalache in the Star goal.Red Star equalised soon after with a Ben Forbes wonder strike from 30 yards which thundered past the Kilsyth keeper. Star took the lead when Gregor Peacock was barged in the box and Andy Weir stepped up to fire the penalty beyond the ‘keeper to give the hosts the lead. Kilsyth were causing Star plenty of problems however and were level again before the half-time whistle when a scramble in the box saw the ball deflect in off the unfortunate Luke Naisby.The winner came for Star early in the second half when Kilsyth couldn’t clear a free kick into the box and the ball broke kindly to John Kennedy, who volleyed home to secure the win and send Red Star into the final where for the second year in a row they would face Oban Saints.Into the final and the Red Star side were clearly feeling the effects of their exertions as they struggled to contain a fluid Oban Saints attack early on. Saints had a couple of good attempts saved by Luke Kalache before Matt Rippon opened the scoring after the ball broke kindly on the edge of the box.The Premier division side put themselves 2-0 up on the stroke of half time when more good play saw the ball fall to Shaun MacIver who bundled home.The second half saw Saints stretch their lead through James Ford before Cammy McDonald pulled a late consolation for Red Star but it was Oban Saints who ran out deserved 3-1 winners and won the tournament for the second year running.Saints also had the Player of the Tournament, which was awarded to Lewis Cameron who was excellent throughout the day.Red Star would like to thank all the teams and officials who took part in the competition, as well as the Stag Hotel for their excellent hospitality.Tomorrow Red Star round off their pre-season schedule with a home match against Helensburgh which will take place at the Ropework, with a 2pm kick-off.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 32","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 12/08/18, 6:15 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,At the latest Mid Argyll, Kintyre and Islands meeting I stated a large number of my younger constituents have been contacting me in regards to the availability of housing.While a greater number of affordable rental accommodation is more than welcome, a larger amount of affordable housing to buy needs to be built across Argyll.I was also very happy at a recent meeting with my fellow Conservative councillors to discuss the huge importance of having a more streamlined planning service that helps rather than hinders economic strength across Argyll and Bute.An effective planning system plays an important role in supporting growth – promoting and enabling the homes, jobs and services that communities need, creating a more competitive local economy and minimising uncertainty and delay for those proposing or affected by development.We in Argyll are seeing a tremendous increase in our industrial output and we as a council must not place barriers in the way of future growth in this area.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.Sir,I\u0026#8217m calling on Argyll and Bute\u0026#8217s small shopkeepers to enter the Best Small Shops competition, celebrating the creativity of small shops and the central role they play in their local community.Argyll and Bute is a hub of small local retailers, many of which are a lifeline.The Best Small Shops competition is open to any small shop operating in the UK. The competition is free to enter and all shops who enter will also be promoted to consumers through an online Indie Retail Directory.Shopkeepers can nominate their businesses until Sunday September 9 via bestsmallshops. A shortlist of 25 of the most impressive applications will be shortlisted by a panel made up of established representatives from the independent retail industry.The judges will be looking for evidence of a small shops\u0026#8217 entrepreneurial spirit, ways that they have been innovative in their business and what they have done to have a lasting positive impact on their community.The shortlisted small shops will be invited to a parliamentary reception on November 13 to meet their Member of Parliament and find out who will be crowned Best Small Shop 2018.Argyll and Bute has an amazing array of small shops which help support our rural economy and I would love to see them recognised.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,Since when is it okay for a man to stand in a layby and urinate in broad daylight?It has become more noticeable in recent years and is never a pleasant sight. It strikes me this sort of selfish attitude is something that may also be contributing to the growing problem of drivers throwing rubbish out their windows on Argyll\u0026#8217s road network.If you can\u0026#8217t find a public toilet, at least find a tree to hide behind when you\u0026#8217re caught short \u0026#8211 and a bin to chuck your rubbish in.Name and address supplied.Sir,At Royal Mail we never forget that we form an essential part of the UK’s social fabric.We know our postmen and postwomen are valued members of the local community as they deliver letters and parcels six days a week \u0026#8211 in all weathers.

Builder John MacDonald followed with colourful tales of Archie McVicar, with whom he worked as a young man.

We look forward to VisitScotland accepting our proposals and working with us to ensure a smooth transfer of the facility over the coming weeks.\u0026#8216A lot of work will need to be carried out before the transfer and anyone wishing to volunteer should get in touch through our website.\u0026#8217A VisitScotland spokesman said: \u0026#8216We are currently in discussions with Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust about proposals for future use of the property and have the support of the local community.\u0026#8217Tarbert businessman Ian Macintyre believes the transfer of the premises should be a formality. He told the Advertiser: \u0026#8216In the original constitution for the Mid Argyll, Kintyre and Islay tourist board, the last paragraph is that in the event of this situation, any assets should transferred to an appropriate local body. I think that should still hold.\u0026#8217The trust\u0026#8217s asset transfer plan is backed by Argyll and Bute MSP Michael Russell, who said: \u0026#8216I made it clear when this plan was first announced that there would have to be alternatives in place before any closure. That remains my position and I am concerned that, for example, there is still no fast mobile phone speeds and broadband in some parts of the area which are necessary to get information from the developing providers.\u0026#8216I have been supporting the proposal from the community trust for the Tarbert premises and I am hopeful that there can be an asset transfer, not least because it seems that the building was only given to VisitScotland on the understanding that if it stopped using it, it would revert to another body doing the same sort of work.\u0026#8217Councillor Alastair Redman added: \u0026#8216I would support the Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust in their talks to ask for an asset handover and take over the tourist centre building.\u0026#8217VisitScotland states that tourist information provision will continue across Argyll and Bute through a network of more than 130 VisitScotland Information Partners (VIPs) primarily based in hotels and guest houses, with three of these in Tarbert, four in Campbeltown and two in Inveraray, alongside \u0026#8216outreach\u0026#8217 staff attending events around the country.\u0026#8216It’s going to be a big miss in the village.

It\u0026#8217s mad even if it was just simply for the limited hours in October but we definitely need something in the summer months.\u0026#8216I\u0026#8217m not happy about it. They are a mine of information and when it closes I don’t know what we\u0026#8217ll do because our internet signal is so sketchy around here.\u0026#8217 Christine Entwistle, Harbour Gallery.\u0026#8216I think it’s a great pity.

The wealth of experience and knowledge of the staff cannot be replaced.I would certainly support a trust taking over the service, but firstly I would ask VisitScotland and Scottish Government to reconsider their closure plans.Councillor Robin Currie, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,I am extremely disappointed over the proposed closure of the VisitScotland iCentre in Tarbert.Michael Russel MSP, Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust and myself have had frequent discussions regarding the issue and I am hopeful that the interested parties will be able to offer a proposal that ensures continuity in the service, although perhaps in a different form.Councillor Anne Horn, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,Deputy First Minister John Swinney is now requiring local authorities to devolve powers and budgets to local schools. If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of diversity to suit individual communities. Local authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very significant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system. Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is, of course, partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We now have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew\u0026#8217s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will now play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus Tulloch, Longniddry, East LothianSir,Through your newspaper I would like to thank the staff Alex, Mark and Alex (number two) from the George Hotel in Inveraray.Two guests staying at my holiday cottage in Cairnbaan lost their car keys while on a day trip to Inveraray. They searched all the places they had visited, including the George, but the keys were not found, so they returned to Cairnbaan by taxi.Fortunately the hotel found the keys and managed to make contact with them, and they returned to Inveraray by taxi to collect the keys from the staff who had been kind enough to wait for them.Once again I would to thank you for your help in making my guests\u0026#8217 stay memorable.Pauline Houston, Crinan Canal CottageSir,I was very happy to attend this year\u0026#8217s Islay, Jura and Colonsay Agricultural Show.It was great to hear about the terrific work being done by the Islay Development Initiative with their Islay Pollinator Initiative which generates employment, including two Modern Apprentices in Beekeeping.I spoke to local farmers about single farm payment delays, feed prices, fuel prices, broadband speed and the poor quality of our infrastructure.

And he is well aware that Labour must recapture votes in places like the Doon Valley if it is to regain power at Holyrood and Westminster. “This is precisely the kind of constituency we need to win back,” admitted the Scottish Labour Party leader. He made a good impression on a whistle-stop tour of Dalmellington and Bellsbank. But time will tell whether or not this will bring voters back to the fold. Mr Leonard chatted amiably to lady volunteers at the Kirk Shop, in the middle of Dalmellington. There was clearly lots of goodwill for the Yorkshire-born politician. The affable Labour leader then moved on to Dalmellington Care Centre, where he planted a red rose to mark the 70th anniversary of the NHS. “My grandfather was a gardener, back in Leeds,” said Mr Leonard, as he wielded a spade. He heard about grassrooots co-operation in Dalmellinton among groups like The Zone and the care centre.  Mr Leonard said: “It’s the resilience of the people that’s keeping the Doon Valley going. “But it’s about time they were given a helping hand from government. “There are too many people living in poverty and on poverty pay. “We need investment in public services and we need to see communities having more control, with the possibility of community buy-outs.” Mr Leonard said only Labour is pledging a decade of investment. “We’re the only party opposing the austerity policies of the Tories, which are being passed on by the SNP.” He said the SNP’s own Growth Commission report revealed there would be even more austerity in an independent Scotland. And he was adamant: “The Labour Party is absolutely opposed to a second referendum on independence.”  Labour colleague Colin Smyth MSP said: “We’re seeing a growing frustration among voters on a debate focused on the constitution. “People want to see improvements in education and health.” Mr Leonard popped up to Bellsbank to see how streets are being transformed with ‘Balamory’ style painting of houses. In the afternoon, he visited the Sovereign Credit Union in Cumnock to hear about its services in the community. Then it was on to Tarbolton, to meet residents who are unhappy about their doctors’ surgery hours being cut, due to a shortage of GPs.

They resided in the old Tower on the hill, which is now in ruins. The Govans continued in possession of Cardrona until the latter end of the seventeenth century, when it was purchased by Mr Williamson, writer in Peebles, and Town Clerk of that burgh.

This was granted, and the work of demolition was soon begun. The roof was taken off and the chambers filled with earth, and in the course of a short time the effects of the weather made themselves apparent. The walls cracked in every direction, and large masses of the building fell.\nNext the crowbar was applied with great success and to make the appearance of an ancient ruin as near perfect as possible, a cartwheel was fixed in one of the largest rents, that the effect at a distance might be that of a venerable abbey.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.

Mr Ramsay, who is from West Yorkshire, told the Courier: \"I think it is a disgrace that East Lothian has no contingency plan for shipwrecks despite being a fishing community.  \"I have been threatened and abused while staying at the beach at Prestonpans with my boat and when I managed to float it and asked for permission to move to Cockenzie Harbour I was refused by the MCA.  \"I\u0027ve lost everything, this was my home and I invested everything in it.

He set up camp on the beach as he looked into repairing the vessel but, while he initially said he received support from the local community, he told the Courier it did not last.  He said: \"I\u0027ve been abused and threatened by locals for staying at the beach.  \"My camp has some furniture which was donated by locals when I first arrived but since then I have been confronted by others angry that I am there.  \"I think it is shameful how I have been treated by this fishing community after becoming shipwrecked on their beach.\"  Mr Ramsay began breaking up the vessel last week, burning timber on the beach."},{"url":null,"title":"in-pictures-musselburgh-festival-kirkin-sashing-and-crusaders-chase","story":"  Lots of events are still to come, including tomorrow\u0027s fancy dress parade and the Rideout on Saturday.

More than 620 entries were received from across the county, elsewhere in the UK and even as far afield as the USA and New Zealand.  Four flag designs\u0026nbsphave been shortlisted to go forward to a public vote.  The voting process is now open and runs until the end of this month, with final votes being accepted no later than 5pm on Friday, August 31.  The result will then be kept under wraps while the winning design is made into a flag, which will be launched around St Andrew\u0026rsquos Day.  Run jointly by East Lothian Council and the Scottish Flag Trust, in association with the Lord Lyon and the Courier, the competition was open to anyone and was free to enter.  The judging panel comprised the Lord Lieutenant of East Lothian, Michael Williams Lord Lyon Joseph Morrow East Lothian Council Provost John McMillan and chief executive Angela Leitch David Williamson, chairman of the Scottish Flag Trust and Courier editor Robbie Scott.  The four designs are below:  Design A    This saltire design on blue reflects the local birthplace of the\u0026nbspnational flag, with the cross in gold signifying the wealth of \u0026nbspEast Lothian\u0026rsquos farmlands and reputation as the granary of \u0026nbsp Scotland. The lion rampant is a traditional emblem of the county \u0026nbsp\u0026ndash it appears in many local coats of arms while King William the \u0026nbspLion was born in the royal palace in Haddington. The blue\u0026nbspstripes through the gold represent the rivers Esk and Tyne.  Design B    Using three horizontal bands in strong colours, this design\u0026nbsp depicts the key industries of the county \u0026ndash blue for the sea\u0026nbspand fishing, above yellow for the county\u0026rsquos beaches and\u0026nbsptourism, above green for the farming. And in the centre,\u0026nbspa fluttering saltire reflecting the birthplace of Scotland\u0026rsquos flag, within a map outline of East Lothian\u0026rsquos territory.  Design C    This design employs two distinctive curved bands of colour\u0026nbsp\u0026ndash the blue upper band representing the importance to East\u0026nbspLothian of the sea, and the lower green band representing\u0026nbspthe rolling countryside and the Lammermuirs. In the first quarter is a white saltire, one of which is like a beam of light,\u0026nbspto acknowledge the county being the birthplace of the national flag.  Design D    The centrepiece of this design is a gold lion rampant \u0026ndash a traditional emblem of East Lothian appearing on the council\u0026rsquos coat of arms and on the arms of many of the\u0026nbspcounty\u0026rsquos ancient families. It sits over a white saltire\u0026nbsprepresenting the local origins of Scotland\u0026rsquos flag. The field\u0026nbspof the flag comprises three horizontal bands \u0026ndash blue for the sea around the county\u0026rsquos coastline, yellow for its beaches, and green for its rich farmland.  Mr McMillan said: \u0026ldquoIt was a very difficult decision for the judges, having to choose four final designs from the huge number of high-quality submissions we received.  \u0026ldquoI hope that East Lothian residents will get involved again and let us know what their favourite design is.  \u0026ldquoHaving a distinctive new civic flag for East Lothian will allow individuals and groups across the county to express pride in their local community, to celebrate their heritage and help raise recognition and awareness of East Lothian nationwide.  \u0026ldquoI will be very excited to see the outcome of the public vote.  David Williamson, chairman of the Scottish Flag Trust, said: \u0026ldquoExperience elsewhere suggests that involving the public in choosing a civic flag is by far the best way to progress, and the hope is that the interest already shown in the East Lothian competition will continue into the voting stage.  \u0026ldquoVoting on the four shortlisted flag designs has been held back until after the main holiday period so that people don\u0026rsquot miss out on the chance to participate.  Lord Lyon Dr Joseph Morrow added: \u0026ldquoThere was a wealth of talent expressed in the entries which reflected very positively on the area.  \u0026ldquoI now look forward to the vote of the people and the taking of the ownership of a flag to be a symbol of pride in East Lothian.

A meeting of Cockenzie Community Forum yesterday evening (Wednesday), was told that the company was considering a number of sites with Prestonpans Community Councillor Calum Miller suggesting the former\u0026nbspCockenzie Power Station site could be\u0026nbspa possible home for it or\u0026nbsped that East Fortune Airfield could be a potential home for the company\u0026rsquos site.  Skyrora describes itself as a launch vehicle development company with aims to cater for the growing demand to send small satellites into space.  It is developing rockets which it hopes to launch from a UK spaceport.  The engine testing would not involve the launching of rockets but would require fuel to be stored on-site to fire up the engines.  The UK Space Agency announced it was investing millions of pounds in a site in Sutherland as the new home of the UK\u0026rsquos first spaceport for launching rockets.  Skyrora said it was looking for an engine test site within an hour of its Edinburgh offices to give it a local base.  Presenting the proposals to the forum yesterday evening, Prestonpans community councillor Calum Miller said that the engine testing would sound no louder than a jet engine to those within 500 metres and the benefits the site could bring would outweigh the \u0026ldquominor inconvenience.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe can bring top scientists and engineers into East Lothian, there is potential for localised manufacturing and supply of goods and services, to interest local schools in engineering, science and the next space race.  He added that the community council had not taken a view on the proposals and was looking for feedback.  Earlier this year it was revealed that Glasgow produced more space satellites than any other city outside of the USA.  Robin Hague, lead engineer with Skyrora, said that the company was designing a new Scottish launch vehicle and looking at a number of locations around Edinburgh, the Lothians and Fife to ground test its engines.  He said: \u0026ldquoEast Lothian has some excellent possibilities and we look forward to seeing if we can find a home there.

But it showed that residents who both live and work in East Lothian earn 15 per cent less each week, taking their pay packets well below the national average.  East Lothian Council says the gap in pay reflects the nature of the county\u0026rsquos economy, with many jobs traditionally low paid such as part-time or seasonal roles.  But one community councillor said the problem was \u0026ldquolow ambition and called for East Lothian to learn to compete with Edinburgh rather than providing employees for the Scottish capital.  Calum Miller, who supports the ambitions of Prestonpans Community Council \u0026ndash of which he is a member \u0026ndash for a cruise terminal to be built at the former Cockenzie Power Station site, said: \u0026ldquoIncreasingly, East Lothian sees itself as an appendage to Edinburgh rather than an independent entity.  \u0026ldquoGraduates are almost expected to leave once qualified for a better paid job in Edinburgh or elsewhere. Workers who can\u0026rsquot move have their horizons limited to jobs in the social care sector, manual labour and/or part-time.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian needs to learn how to compete again with Edinburgh and pull employers here rather than push employees into the city.  \u0026ldquoTo do that, the infrastructure needs to take a big leap forward housing needs to be cheaper and more accessible, fibre broadband needs to enter houses and businesses directly, and East Lothian Council needs to allocate land for enterprise plus foster a hunger for new business.  The community council has produced a brochure outlining its vision for a Port of Prestonpans which it says would bring in new income and employment.  Mr Miller said it was just one of the new ideas which could benefit the county.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe Port of Prestonpans would not only transform the tourist potential of East Lothian, it would bring in new local companies that we haven\u0026rsquot even imagined.  The latest report from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) found workers who lived and worked in East Lothian have gross weekly earnings of \u0026pound517 on average \u0026ndash well below the \u0026pound595 for residents working outwith the county.  The number of households in the county which are classed as \u0026ldquoeconomically active is also above the national average, with over 81 per cent of residents employed in some way.  The number of men of working age living in the county who were not employed was considered too low to count by ONS.  East Lothian Council said it was looking at ways to develop the local economy.  A spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThis is an indication of high commuting rates out of East Lothian and the nature of the East Lothian economy \u0026ndash eg. rural, hospitality, part-time/seasonal \u0026ndash that tend to pay lower rates. The refreshed East Lothian Economic Development Strategy will outline the context of such differences and consider means of appropriate support for the local economy and workforce.  The average UK gross weekly wage in 2017 was \u0026pound552 while the Scottish average was \u0026pound547."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8157352.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"work-taking-place-at-blindwells-ahead-of-houses-being-built-there","story":"  Planning permission for homes at Blindwells, which is sandwiched between the A1 north of Tranent and the A198 south of Cockenzie, was granted in spring last year.

It is one of the few islands on the West Coast I don\u0026rsquot know, and for sure I will be back. It is a less-known treasure, I think.  I was camping with my family so our accommodation was pretty basic, but the kids absolutely loved it. As I write, we have just returned and I am in recovery mode from five nights under canvas.  We could afford it because my wife and I were stewards, two shifts each then we were able to access the festival. My main responsibility was the \u0026lsquobeach gate\u0026rsquo, a quieter access point which allowed festival-goers to visit the beach and return without needing to go through the main gate.  And so there I was, with a high-visibility vest and a walkie-talkie, checking people\u0026rsquos wrist bands as they left and entered. I met lots of wonderful people, but most of the time I was sitting on a mound of sand by the gate, admiring the stunning view of Ettrick Bay and the mountains of Arran in the distance.  It was a rare and wonderful time for reflection. The rest of the family were nearby but having a ball inside, so I was free to enjoy my thoughts.  There was a prehistoric standing stone circle close to the site of the festival which gave the same view I was enjoying. It made me realise that although I had vague idea of the general history of the area, I did not know the tales steeped in the landscape.  Story anchors our relationship with the land, and sitting in that beautiful and wild place made me want to make that connection there as well. I can simply enjoy a view, of course, but perhaps a burden storytellers carry is the need to pick the wisps of stories from the land wherever we go.  I thought of a possible connection with East Lothian in the travels of St Kenneth. He was a monk from Ireland and an associate of St Columba. He must have known this shore, perhaps he walked the sand of Ettrick Bay itself.  His name is embedded in many place names, both in Ireland and Scotland, and one of them is Cockenzie. The legend states that this name comes from the Gaelic Cul Cionnich, meaning Kenneth\u0026rsquos Cove.  He is said to have arrived in the small picturesque natural harbour, now called the Boat Shore, in the sixth century, and thus baptised the community with his name. The Boat Shore was for many years the harbour of what was to become the village of Cockenzie. For sure it seems the saint\u0026rsquos travels took him to the Forth valley so the legend may be rooted in a real event.  I love the Boat Shore at Cockenzie. I played there in my childhood, as so many have. Both high and low tide has it different pleasures there.  I reflected on the fact that perhaps the main difference between the Boat Shore and Ettrick Bay on Bute is not their varying size but the fact that Cockenzie is now \u0026lsquobuilt up\u0026rsquo.  Yet when I walked the shore from Port Seton to Cockenzie recently, the sea was no less dominant on my senses. In fact the remains of old salt pans, the survival of a fishing community and its traditions, the gable ends of houses facing defiantly at the sea all added to the experience.  Cockenzie is a place where the tiny threads of personal memories entwine with ancient stories and history of fishwives and fishermen, salt makers and coal miners, where the tracks of the past run literally at your feet. Yet there is still a vibrant local community, a living connection to the ancestral past. That makes the place extra special.  My thoughts were interrupted by a comment from a festival-goer: \u0026ldquoLook! That\u0026rsquos the sea, I mean the real sea, so cool. He and his friends left through the beach gate and headed down to the beach to take photos.  The comment made me realise something obvious. A real connection is the sea, and it also made me feel lucky that I live next to it.  It was on the Saturday night that the sea brought me new thoughts. The blue sky turned grey, then a dark, brooding black. The calm water began to boil with rage as it brought warm air from the south which had turned into a storm. We managed to get into our tent just in time.  Howling winds and torrential rain swept through the festival campsite like a reaper, ripping up tents. I double-pegged our tent with the help of my friend Chris Yule, and then we huddled inside as the winds did their worst. The kids were both excited and a little scared by it, but mostly excited!  The family slept as the storm howled in anger outside, the canvas walls of the tent bending this way and that. If we needed to evacuate, Chris had kindly offered the floor of his caravan as a refuge.  I lay there listening to the storm and was glad I was not at sea. My home town, Prestonpans, was born of such a storm when a pirate, possibly a Viking, was shipwrecked on the shoreline a thousand years ago. He stayed and founded the village, his name still echoed in Aldhammer House.  I stayed awake until the worst was over, then fell into sleep. In the morning, birds were singing and the sun shining. The campsite looked like a battlefield site collapsed tents and stuff blown everywhere, including a small tent blown into the hedge by us. But the festival site was repaired and a great final day had.  We took the longer, scenic route home, via Argyll\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquosecret coast\u0026rsquo, a deeply wooded and beautifully quiet part of the West Coast.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos great to be home, said my four-year-old as we arrived. It was, not least to have a shower and to eat something that wasn\u0026rsquot from a tin!  \u0026ldquoCan we go for a walk by the sea? I was asked first thing this morning.  \u0026ldquoAfter I have written my story, I replied.  \u0026ldquoWhat are you going to write about this time?  \u0026ldquoNot sure, let\u0026rsquos see what comes to my mind, I said.  And so now we will head to the Boat Shore, and the walk by the coast there.  I love living by the sea."},{"url":null,"title":"day-centre-welcomes-zambian-visitors","story":"  The centre received a visit from the country\u0026rsquos social welfare minister Emerine Kabanshi and Julien Mwape, director general of Zambia Agency for People with Disabilities (ZAPD), who are in Scotland to see firsthand a range of health and social care facilities.

The move comes just 16 months after a public consultation on similar plans in which three quarters of those who took part objected to the change, leading the council to scrap the proposal.  The council said the move was part of a review of its service provision however, it has been criticised for not taking the plan back to the community before making the decision.  Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, said: \u0026ldquoIt is extremely disappointing that East Lothian Council are pressing ahead with service changes in Prestonpans that were rejected last year.  \u0026ldquoPrestonpans Community Council and other local community organisations should have been consulted on these changes rather than being presented with a fait accompli and we would ask that the council assure the local community that they will consult fully on the future proposals for Aldhammer House.  The proposal to turn the library, which was built in 1905 through funds from Scottish philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, into a shared facility and move council services from their offices in the town\u0026rsquos Aldhammer House, was first put to the public in June 2016.  At the time the community council raised concerns that merging the services would take away people\u0026rsquos views of the library as a safe and neutral area.  And at a public meeting in the town Manja Porteus, then six, whose dad Tim is a professional storyteller and Courier columnist, appealed to the council to rethink its proposals and leave the library alone.  Following a public consultation, the council announced it had scrapped the plans in March last year, stating that \u0026ldquothe majority of respondents said they wanted the two services to remain in separate buildings and did not want to see any changes to the library building.  However, last week they said that a wide range of services would move into the library from August 27.  Councillor Jim Goodfellow, cabinet spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: \u0026ldquoAs more of our customers make use of online services and library staff are readily available to help people to go online, the council has reviewed its service provision and Aldhammer House will be developed to provide complementary services which give more support to the local community.  \u0026ldquoMeanwhile, Prestonpans Library will be developed as a joint library/area office as has been done in Dunbar, North Berwick and Tranent.  \u0026ldquoThis builds on the council\u0026rsquos work to strengthen our communities and support town centres such as Prestonpans with easy access to high-quality local facilities and services.  Aldhammer House will continue to be staffed by housing service staff, as well as keeping The Pantry Foodbank, Citizens Advice Bureau and local politicians\u0026rsquo surgeries. Capital Credit Union will also continue to operate part-time there. All other services will move to the library.  The changes were welcomed by some on social media, who said it had worked in other communities.  One person said: \u0026ldquoDoes it really matter where you pay your rent or fill in forms? If the council can\u0026rsquot afford it then they can\u0026rsquot afford it.  However, there was an angry response from others.  One woman said: \u0026ldquoThis is an outrage, what can we do?

For some it was a practical way to live in the country they have chosen to call home for others it was a way to end anxiety over their future under Brexit.  Christa Gerdwilker, 51, has lived in Scotland for over 30 years. She and wife Susan live in East Saltoun but she said the uncertainty over what would happen when Britain leaves the European Union had prompted her to seek UK citizenship.  Christa said: \u0026ldquoBrexit is the reason I decided to apply for citizenship.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove lived here for 30 years and came with certain expectations thinking we were secure but it has pulled the rug from right under our feet and suddenly the future is uncertain.  \u0026ldquoIt has caused some sleepless nights and so it made sense to get permanent residency.  The ceremonies, which are held in East Lothian three or four times a year, are the final part of applying to become a British citizen.  Since April 2016, 103 people have taken part in a ceremony in East Lothian.  Each person who takes part is presented with a certificate confirming their residency status and a welcome pack. East Lothian Council also presents everyone who takes part in a ceremony in the county with a memento of the occasion.  The Lord Lieutenant said: \u0026ldquoFor the people here it is the end of a journey which for some has been a very long one. It can be an emotional moment for many and is important to them.  \u0026ldquoIt is extraordinary to see the range of places people are from who want to be UK citizens.  The ceremony was held in the Adam Room at John Muir House and overseen by registrar Janet Fairnie.  East Lothian Provost John McMillan and Angela Leitch, chief executive of East Lothian Council, joined the ceremony welcoming the new citizens, who were watched by family and friends invited along.  Mr McMillan told the new citizens: \u0026ldquoCitizenship brings certain privileges. You now live in a parliamentary democracy where everyone is equal in the eyes of the law. It brings with it a responsibility to treat fellow citizens with respect and be good neighbours, and to take an active part in society, which I hope you will.  Ms Leitch praised the East Lothian residents who had gained their new status.  She said: \u0026ldquoI know it has been quite a journey for some who have come through a process that many of us who have lived in this country all our lives do not have to go through.  The citizenship process involves a series of tests which those applying have to pass, quizzing them on all aspects of British life.  Mohamed Sherif, 31, an engineer from Musselburgh, has lived here for 10 years and is originally from Libya. He said: \u0026ldquoIt is a lot easier to have citizenship than have to spend a lot of money on renewing visas.  \u0026ldquoWe know we want to stay in this country so it made sense to apply.  The seven new citizens who attended were: Christa Gerdwilker (originally from Germany), East Saltoun Mohamed Sherif (Libya), Musselburgh Carmen King (Mexico), Ormiston Bernadette Fitzgerald (Australia), Tranent Diego Onate (Colombia), East Saltoun Gabriele Hegerl (Germany), East Linton John Crowley (USA), East Linton."},{"url":null,"title":"tims-tales-a-bath-in-butterdean-wood","story":"  BEING surrounded by trees, in a wood where the world outside cannot be seen, is a primeval experience. It connects us to our ancestral origins and reasserts our relationship with nature, of which we are also a part. There are few such important gifts that we can give our children, and ourselves, than a regular forest bath.  The term forest bathing of course comes from Japan, where it was first coined in the 1980s to describe the mental health benefits of regular meditative time spend in the woods. But the spiritual and mental uplift that nature provides has long been known, and here in Scotland the Celtic tradition in particular has a powerful relationship with trees and the nature.  But we are forgetting it all. We are forgetting who we are and from what we came. And we are suffering as a result.  Another recent term is nature deficit disorder, a phrase created by Richard Louv who wrote Last Child in the Woods in 2005. While it is not an actually recognised medical condition as such, putting a name on the effects of nature deprivation has made people more aware of it.  So for my final journey of discovery this summer, I took a friend who is unused to spending time in nature for a walk in Butterdean Wood. I cannot put into words how important this place is for my family and my soul. My children have grown up, and are growing up, in this wonderful wood. It\u0026rsquos a cradle of nature where you can feel simultaneously lost and found, for the trees envelop you, as if to say \u0026ldquowelcome back.  It\u0026rsquos horrific to think that a number of years ago there was a plan to cut the wood down, but thanks to Gregor Neil Robertson and others, a campaign to save the wood, supported by Friends of the Earth, was successful.  My friend suffers from depression and anxiety. When I told him I planned a walk in a wood he protested. He has weight issues as well, and going for a walk is something he knows he should do, but doesn\u0026rsquot enjoy.  \u0026ldquoYou will enjoy this walk, I reassured him.  \u0026ldquoDon\u0026rsquot think so, was his reply, but he nonetheless finally agreed to come along, after I\u0026rsquod promised it would only be a short one.  There are different options when you begin to explore the wood, but my family have a favourite part and so that\u0026rsquos where I took him. Trees have a way of bringing feelings to the surface and soon my friend was talking about stuff.  We first wandered through the pine wood. It\u0026rsquos planted with mainly non-native pine trees but has a wonderful atmosphere.  I told him of the story about the brownie who hides in the wood, because he is fearful of humans whom he believes to be cruel after witnessing a farmer\u0026rsquos son whip a horse.  The story took us to what my children call the \u0026lsquofaerie bridge\u0026rsquo. It is here that the wood changes in character. Once across the bridge the wood is more mixed, with mainly deciduous trees: oak, rowan, ash, sycamore, beech and hazel, but also the occasional Scots pine.  \u0026ldquoCheck for something metal on you, I told my friend. He looked at me funny. \u0026ldquoEh?  \u0026ldquoSomething made of iron or metal of some kind, I reiterated.  \u0026ldquoWhat for?  \u0026ldquoWell, because the faeries live in the part of the wood across the bridge, but iron undoes their magic. So you are safe if you are wearing something made of it, I explained.  \u0026ldquoSeriously?  I just smiled. He was lucky, he had a metal strap on his watch. And so we ventured over the bridge.  This part of Butterdean Wood is vivid green in high summer. We soon reached a junction in the path.  \u0026ldquoOK, this is the short way back, we\u0026rsquoll take that. I was keeping my promise that we\u0026rsquod only go on a short walk. But my friend protested.  \u0026ldquoOh naw, let\u0026rsquos go on for a bit more, I\u0026rsquom actually enjoying this.  And so we ventured further, past the tall beech tree which still has the rough end of a rope tied round one of its upper branches. It was here, in summers about 10 years ago, my now grown-up daughters would swing on the rope swing I made for them.  We sat here for a short while so my friend could take a breath. He noticed the silence, which was then softly broken by the swish of tree tops swaying in a breeze. We sat for perhaps two minutes, not looking at each other, but just being present under the canopy of nature.  \u0026ldquoOK, he said, \u0026ldquoyou\u0026rsquore right, it is magic.  I smiled and nodded.  We walked, at a guess, over three miles through Butterdean Wood on this day. I introduced him to different trees and we paused often, soaking in the power of it all. It\u0026rsquos a place of constant minor changes, as all woods are, and it\u0026rsquos only when you visit them regularly that you notice the changes.  As we left, my friend commented on how much better he felt, how his anxiety had eased and that he\u0026rsquod want to come back with his son.  \u0026ldquoButterdean Wood would be a gift for your son, I said, \u0026ldquolet him bathe in the forest too.  We all need this, and on a regular basis. We need to find time for it, find a wood we can reach and bathe in. It benefits our health in so many ways but it also helps us to connect and have a relationship with nature. It should be a birthright of our children to run free in the wood, to explore and become part of it.  Later in the week I returned with my children. We followed our trails of memory, my older daughters walking in their own footprints of younger years, which are now overlaid with the imprint of their younger siblings. I searched but saw no signs of autumn.  But soon the summer will end, and the heatwaves of 2018 will become part of our folk memory.  Autumn in Butterdean is nature\u0026rsquos show, but it\u0026rsquos not ready for that yet, it\u0026rsquos still fully clothed in summer\u0026rsquos colours."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8195899.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=128\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"disgraceful-state-of-north-berwick-toilets-slammed","story":"  The quality of the toilets on the town\u0026rsquos Quality Street has long been lauded by residents and visitors alike, but last week it drew criticism from one resident, who contacted the Courier to offer her concerns.  Helen Mulgray wrote: \u0026ldquoI was shocked to see how the cleanliness of the toilets had deteriorated.  \u0026ldquoThese once highly praised, award-winning toilets have been degraded to become offensive and at times a health hazard \u0026ndash no soap to wash hands and no toilet paper unless [it is] picked off the floor.  She described the condition of the toilets as a \u0026ldquodisgraceful memory of a visit to North Berwick for the thousands of visitors that flock to the town every summer.  East Lothian Council is currently proposing to cut the permanent toilet attendants at the county\u0026rsquos public loos and instead see them maintained by an extended team of mobile attendants.  Ms Mulgray slammed the council for the proposal, adding: \u0026ldquoImplementing the proposed plan to do away with full-time attendants means this mess will be a permanent sight for visitors to the toilets.  \u0026ldquoIt takes no account of the crowds coming from the beach until late, busloads stopping at the car park, and events like the Fringe [by the Sea] and the [Highland] Games.  \u0026ldquoIs saving money this way more important than the tourist image of North Berwick?  Ms Mulgray added that when she returned to the toilets last Monday, they were \u0026ldquospotless.  She put the improvements down to the fact that the usual full-time attendant had returned from annual leave.  Ms Mulgray wrote to the council to express her concerns about the toilets being allowed to deteriorate last week and, in a response seen by the Courier, Lorraine Faulds, senior officer of facilities management, wrote: \u0026ldquoLooking at your specific concerns with North Berwick toilets, it has been maintained by a combination of permanent and mobile attendants for more than six years.  \u0026ldquoThis pattern has ensured appropriate levels of cleanliness throughout the year and includes recognition of the busier summer months.  \u0026ldquoWe are aware that at any toilet, on any occasion, whether by intent or accident, toilets or sinks can be blocked by paper or left as debris.  \u0026ldquoFortunately these remain isolated incidents at our sites and North Berwick toilets actually have a more frequent attendance by the mobile attendants than some of our other sites.  She said the emptying of sanitary bins would increase from once a week to twice due to Ms Mulgray\u0026rsquos complaint of them \u0026ldquooverflowing.  The letter added: \u0026ldquoWe take our service provision extremely seriously and aim to maintain the very high standards of our public toilets.

It comes as the number of lairs at Deer Park Cemetery, opposite where the proposed new burial ground would be sited, reaches a dangerously low figure.  Ward councillor Norman Hampshire stressed the importance of new burial spaces being created in the town.  Mr Hampshire, chairman of the council planning committee, was unable to comment on the merits of any specific application because of his role on the committee.  But he said: \u0026ldquoI have been told by officers, early next year there will be no spaces available in the cemetery.  \u0026ldquoIt would mean people in the community would need to be buried outwith the town, which would not be acceptable to people. There is a desperate need for [a new] cemetery within Dunbar.  The proposed new cemetery comes as part of a controversial planning application approved by the planning committee last year.  More than 100 houses are set to be built on land at Newtonlees Farm, despite the site being outwith the sites identified at that stage by the council\u0026rsquos Local Development Plan and recommended for refusal by planning officers.  Mr Hampshire ultimately had the casting vote on the Gladman Developments scheme after the vote at the council meeting was tied at 4-4.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe original proposal had been to extend the existing cemetery.  \u0026ldquoHowever, when the consent was given for a housing development along with the golf course at Dunbar Golf Club, the land was not secured at that time by the council.  \u0026ldquoThere have now been more burials in the cemetery and the way the layout is the bit of land that was available to purchase would not have created the substantial extension that would have been viable for the future in Dunbar.  \u0026ldquoThat is why the council had to look at alternative sites to create a new cemetery.  \u0026ldquoThe two cemeteries are very close to each other.  \u0026ldquoThere will be parking still available in the old Deer Park site and some new parking created within the new cemetery.  \u0026ldquoI think the two will work well together and be a cemetery which is available for a long number of years and satisfy the needs of the Dunbar community.  Deer Park Cemetery opened in 1953 and is expected, according to East Lothian Council, to reach capacity by the summer of 2020.  There are a total of 1,300 lairs in Deer Park cemetery, which are expected to be full within 18-24 months.  A spokeswoman for the council said: \u0026ldquoThe size of the proposed cemetery is approximately 1.2 hectares offering 2,000 lairs, 700 ashes-only lairs and an area for woodland burial.

Jan Wilson, chairwoman of the community council, said: \u0026ldquoWhere the surgery is at the moment is central.  \u0026ldquoI think as far as I am led to believe there is supposed to be a doctors\u0026rsquo surgery in the Letham Main development.

He added: \u0026ldquoIt was never thought by people supporting it that it was a magic answer to all our speeding problems but a step in the right direction and people become accustomed to going at 20mph in the town.  \u0026ldquoThereby the safety of pedestrians \u0026ndash particularly children and elderly but people of any age \u0026ndash will be enhanced.  \u0026ldquoThat is the hope and hopefully people will observe it.  A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoThe order has been made and we are just awaiting the appropriate signage, which should be within the next month.  \u0026ldquoThe order will be for an 18-month period and is an experimental order.  If the order is deemed a success, steps will be taken to see the 20mph speed limit become a permanent fixture.  Feedback from members of the public could also help decide whether any roads become exempt from the 20mph speed limit in the future.  Currently there are no plans for traffic calming measures, such as speed humps or chicanes, on the streets affected by the new speed limit.  The 20mph speed limit starts to the west of Edinburgh Road\u0026rsquos junction with Shore Road and Beveridge Row.  To the east, it comes into force as drivers make their way along the A1087."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/4108040.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=12\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"your-chance-to-apply-for-thousands-of-pounds-of-support-for-your-charity","story":"  Last year, donations totalling almost \u0026pound300,000 were made up and down the country on behalf of Newsquest Media Group, one of the UK\u0027s largest publishers and owners of the East Lothian Courier.

The foundation supports charities with projects which take a creative approach to fundamental issues such as education and neighbourhood improvements, economic development, youth development, local problem-solving, assistance to the disadvantaged or disabled, environmental conservation and cultural enrichment.  And it values projects that bring lasting benefits to local communities.  A spokesman said: \"While preference may be given to ideas which create a durable legacy for the community, judges will consider single events or projects of limited duration that otherwise meet the criteria.\"  Typically grants are made for substantial projects which require and merit awards of between \u0026pound5,000 and \u0026pound10,000, although applications can be for any size of grant and level of ambition.

The abuse was said to have taken place between 2015 and 2017 while she was based in the government body\u0027s Scrabster office in the Highlands and continued after she was signed off.

Mr Ross, who suffers from eye condition Stargardt disease, was working in the company\u0026rsquos Aberdeenshire brewery when he told bosses his eyesight had deteriorated and he was awaiting tests.  Despite reports from the RNIB and a specialist in visual impairment saying the 47-year-old could continue to work if some adjustments were made, Brewdog took the decision to dismiss him.  Mr Ross, from Fraserburgh, has now won his case for unfair dismissal and disability discrimination at an employment tribunal.  Speaking to the Herald, he said: \u0026ldquoThe way they dealt with my condition was really poor for a company of their size. The management just didn\u0026rsquot seem to have a clue how to deal with it, they just wanted to end it.  \u0026ldquoThey weren\u0026rsquot interested in making any changes, they just wanted me out.  \u0026ldquoBrewdog try to claim they\u0026rsquore this top company to work for, but I took this tribunal to show what they really are.  The tribunal heard that Mr Ross told the firm about his sight problems when he first started working for them in July 2016.  However, in January 2017 he told his manager that his vision was deteriorating.  He later provided Brewdog with a copy of a medical report stating that further tests were needed which would likely result in him being declared blind.  The company\u0026rsquos Health and Safety manager, John Fairclough, was asked to complete a risk assessment on Mr Ross and he was given a high risk rating.  An occupational health report was also ordered, which found that Mr Ross was not fit for work, but the tribunal found that this was not carried out by a medic with any expertise in visual impairment.  RNIB employment adviser Ruth Morrell then visited the brewery and recommended a number of changes that could allow him to keep working.  Mobility Officer Jeff Bligdon also visited the site and found that Mr Ross was still able to carry out his work without any difficulty.  In his report, Mr Bligdon stated: \u0026ldquoI felt that if [Brewdog] could end James\u0026rsquo employment with them, they would have done it there and then.  \u0026ldquoThe health and safety person was particularly negative towards James and came across as not wanting to adapt or try anything that would assist James.  Mr Ross was later sacked at a meeting in May after he rejected a computing role because it was harder for him to do with his eyesight problems.  The tribunal heard that managers involved in his case had no knowledge of the need to make adjustments for disabled people under the Equality Act.  Employment Judge Nick Hosie described this as \u0026ldquoastonishing.  The judge said that only \u0026ldquolip-service was paid to the law, while bosses also made \u0026ldquoblanket assumptions.  Judge Hosie added that Brewdog \u0026ldquoshould feel more than discomfort at the lack of awareness evidenced of their legal obligations to consider reasonable adjustments for an employee they recognised as disabled.

Mr Mustafa as targeted by Muslims in Glasgow and had to seek police protection after he spoke out about the more restrictive practices of Islam being propagated by Mosques.  In response, he says that 15 imams issued the fatwa\u0026nbsp - or ruling - calling for other Muslims to take action against him.  He has since been threatened with beheading by extremists after he claimed fasting between dawn and sunset during the month of Ramadan is not a requirement in the Quran, and has sought the protection of the police.    Paigham Mustafa  The father of three, said that many Muslims were being taught \"cultural\" lessons which strayed from the true meaning of Islam.  He believes the community has allowed itself to become isolated and backwards-looking, and has called on his fellow Muslims to be more open to Western values.  Mr Mustafa who spent several years writing his book \u0027The Quran: God\u0026rsquos Message to Mankind\u0027, said: \u0026ldquoIt is high time that British Muslims become pro-active instead of reactive. The murders and mayhem perpetrated by misguided Muslim militants in the UK, and the continuing radicalisation of disaffected Muslim youth makes this a topmost priority.  \u0026ldquoLogic, rationalism and pluralism must become the true hallmarks of British Islam to replace blind ritualism, outdated tribalism and a religious zealotry that are all predicated upon a largely anachronistic foreign-infused belief system.  The new organisation, named the Oxford Institute for British Islam (OIBI) says that it will \"not be beholden\" to medieval theological interpretations, misogynistic patriarchal biases, archaic political baggage, outmoded cultural norms, irrelevant tribal customs or bygone practices from \"distant ancestral homelands\".

Work is being undertaken to secure funding from UK donors, and OIBI will officially launch in early 2019 from premises in Oxford.  It is intended to be an educational unit and research foundation which will address the secular needs and spiritual concerns of British Muslims, combining the worlds of religion, politics, society and philosophy.  OIBI\u0026rsquos goal is to become the chief catalyst for developing fresh intellectual rigour as well as championing positive socio-political and religious momentum within the British Muslim community.  The plan is to establish an independent publishing arm to distribute research output, and launch a new Journal of British Islam, which will print original articles and provocative submissions from across the religious, philosophical and political divide.    Mr Mustafa has criticised \"cultural\" practices for influencing Islam  \u0026ldquoMuslim social self-exclusion has become a largely voluntary phenomenon within the UK.

Under the plans, 16 and 17-year-olds would also be allowed to remain in licensed premises until 11pm, which could benefit teenagers attending gigs in the city centre and eating out with family.  Speaking about the plan, chairman of Glasgow Licensing Board Cllr Matt Kerr said: \u0026ldquoBy potentially granting licences until 4am while demanding the highest possible standards from licence holders we are striking the right balance between the licence trade and the needs of the wider community.  \u0026ldquoThere\u0026rsquos a strong view that a more European approach would avoid the rush to consume alcohol before closing time that then spills out on to our city centre streets.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos very important to stress that this is still a proposal and that in any event, 4am closing would still be the subject a pilot programme that will draw in evidence from the likes of the police and the health service.  Club owners insist current drinking hours are \u0026ldquorestrictive and, according to Garage boss Donald Macleod, Glasgow should be free to compete with other European cities.  \u0026ldquoI think this approach is very progressive,\" said Mr Macleod, who is also convenor of Glasgow Licensing Forum. \"It\u0026rsquos about getting a balance, to keep the city open for those who demonstrate the standards.  \u0026ldquoWhat\u0026rsquos the point of having platinum status for Best Bar None if you aren\u0026rsquot rewarded for it.  Stuart Patrick, chief executive of Glasgow Chamber of Commerce, said the city\u0027s night time economy \u0026ndash which already generates \u0026pound2.6 billion per year and supports some 16,600 jobs \u0026ndash would enjoy a shot in the arm if the plan is green lit.  \u0026ldquoOperating in a similar way to our European counterparts by adding an hour extra to opening times of pubs, bars and clubs across the city opens avenues for increased success within the industry,\" he said.  \u0026ldquoWe are fully in support of any developments that reiterates the overall aims of Glasgow\u0026rsquos economic strategy and we will work closely with our members within the sector to optimise the proposed new license within the city.  Under the plans, which have been put out for consultation, venues would be considered for the later hours if the licence holder can prove they have prioritised public safety, securing gold status or above in the Best Bar None scheme.  Paul Waterson, of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association said later opening hours was \"not the way to go\".  \u0026ldquoThere used to be three separate licenses, there was one for restaurants, one for pubs and one for clubs,\" he said.  \u0026ldquoUnder the new act there was just one licence and the differentials have been eroded. Consequently we have got ourselves into a right mess in terms of what a pub is and what\u0026rsquos a club. We don\u0026rsquot see why places should be open until 4am.

Wracked with dysentery and in the company of a wounded Australian photographer colleague whose radial nerve had been severed by shrapnel, we had lain on the floor of a battered bus crammed with dead and wounded Afghan guerrilla fighters for five days as it crawled across desert plains and hills towards the Pakistan frontier.  It was only near Ghazni that to our great relief, we at last managed to give our Russian pursuers the slip before making it out of Afghanistan.  Ghazni\u0026rsquos strategic position has always been important in Afghanistan\u0026rsquos seemingly interminable wars. Its proximity to Kabul and location on the major highway connecting the capital to the south makes it a vital lifeline.  It\u0026rsquos for precisely this reason that over the past week, this city of some 280,000 people has found itself at the centre of a fierce battle as Taliban insurgents sought to capture it.  It was last Friday when more than 1,000 Taliban fighters stormed the city in a predawn assault. Reports indicate that a number of foreign fighters aided the Taliban in their offensive, among them Pakistani and Chechen jihadists and even some al-Qaeda affiliates.  For a while it was touch and go with the Taliban gaining control of much of Ghazni before Afghan Army troops backed by US forces retook the embattled city on Tuesday. This though is far from being an isolated incident.  No sooner had the security forces reasserted their control over Ghazni, than the Taliban in the past few days have again attacked and seized large parts of an army base in the northern province of Faryab, killing at least 10 soldiers and capturing dozens of others.  The latest violence not only raises questions over much mooted peace talks with the Taliban but also casts a shadow over Afghanistan\u0026rsquos upcoming parliamentary elections scheduled for October 20.  It\u0026rsquos against this volatile backdrop too that Britain this week deployed another four hundred and forty troops, effectively almost doubling its \u0026lsquoboots on the ground\u0026rsquo to a total of 1,090 military personnel.  It\u0026rsquos now four years since British troops \u0026lsquodeparted\u0026rsquo from Afghanistan. During those 13 years of fighting hundreds of British lives were lost while some \u0026pound40bn was spent trying to tame the Taliban.  During my time embedded as a correspondent within both British and American units, I watched as the consummate professionalism of those troops on the ground was slowly eroded by the stark realisation that this was a war that was unwinnable.  The new plan now the politicians duly told us was that Nato would formally end its retaliation for Afghanistan harbouring Osama bin Laden. It would withdraw its forces and leave the Afghan government and its military along with continued \u0026lsquoadvisory\u0026rsquo support to deal with the Taliban itself. Cue the UK\u0026rsquos latest troop deployment which we are told, will involve little more than ferrying international advisors safely around the country\u0027s capital city, Kabul, in their Foxhound vehicles hence giving rise to them being dubbed \u0026ldquoArmoured Uber.  But all these \u0026lsquojolly japes\u0026rsquo aside, the reality remains that the Taliban is in the ascendancy, and any support role undertaken by UK troops still puts them in harms way. That we have all been here before and seemingly learned nothing beggars belief. As does the fact that the UK government\u0026rsquos agreement to deploy more troops is almost certainly done to assuage US President Donald Trump after his Nato visit last month.  Mr Trump, a president who promised to bring US troops home from foreign campaigns is now faced with the harsh reality of a re-galvanised Taliban, and is making sure his UK and Nato allies are not let of the hook when it comes to sharing the burden in the fight against them.  Not that all of this really matters in the military scheme of things, given that the Taliban is now said to be in control of 70 per cent of the country.  Yes, that\u0026rsquos the stark reality of where Afghanistan stands right now. Seventeen years on since a US and UK deployment that has cost tens of thousands of Afghan lives, thousands of American and British lives combined and swallowed up billions of dollars, we are right back where we started.  Only last month the New York Times highlighted how the newest US military strategy in Afghanistan \u0026ldquomirrors past plans for retreat. In other words it calls for American-backed Afghan troops to pull back from partially populated areas of the country.  This of course will ensure that the Taliban and other Islamist groups will effectively hold on to territory that they have already seized, leaving the government in Kabul to safeguard the capital and major cities such as Kandahar, Kunduz, Mazar-i-Sharif and Jalalabad. At least that\u0026rsquos how the thinking went until the Taliban this past week threw a spanner in the works with its assault on Ghazni.  What is this \u0026lsquoretreat to the city\u0026rsquo if not searing confirmation that the American installed government in Afghanistan remains unable to lead and protect the country\u0026rsquos sprawling rural population? Barely over one-quarter of Afghanistan\u0026rsquos population lives in urban areas.  If there\u0026rsquos a sense of deja vu about all of this, then it\u0026rsquos because those thirty or so years ago when I travelled with the Afghan guerrillas back in the 80\u0026rsquos, the Soviets then too in their own war had abandoned rural areas allowing opposition fighters to control most of the country.  We should have learned from the Russians own decade long experience then, but we didn\u0026rsquot. We should have learned too from our own more recent military campaign in the country, but it appears that we haven\u0026rsquot.  Unpalatable as it might be, the inescapable fact is that any chance of a political solution in Afghanistan right now is just as remote as a military one. Once again slowly but surely we are being drawn back into the Afghanistan quagmire, and it\u0026rsquos only a matter of time before it costs us dearly."},{"url":null,"title":"brian-may-my-quest-to-raise-profile-of-scottish-innovator-in-3d-photography","story":"  But while Queen\u0027s electric brand of arena-thrilling hits has stirred the souls of millions, the passions of the former PhD Astronomy student have turned out to be a little more niche.  Famously, he has been an unlikely champion of badgers and previously railed against the attempted cull of hedgehogs on Uist.  But (Dr) Brian May\u0027s current obsession germinates from a childhood devotion to collectable 3D cards handed out free in the 1950s inside boxes of Weetabix.  Now the Hall of Fame rock star is shining the spotlight on an almost forgotten photographic innovator who brought images of the Scottish landscape to life.  George Washington Wilson, based in Aberdeen, was appointed Photographer to the Queen in 1873 and is considered one of the greatest \u0027lensmen\u0027 of his generation.  Records of about his skill producing 3D images have now largely faded from history, but Wilson (1823 to 1893) is a personal hero to Brian May, who now owns one of the largest collections in the world of Victorian stereo photographs.  Brian May spoke to The Herald as he appeared at the Edinburgh International Book Festival discussing a \u0027labour of love\u0027 book about George Washington Wilson, by Prof Roger Taylor (who coincidentally shares the same name as the Queen drummer), for which May provided the introduction.  \"This is one of the reasons we got into this, is to try and put [George Washington Wilson] back in his place, where he should be,\" he said.  And May told an audience in the Main Theatre of the festival, at a sold out event,\u0026nbspthat his zeal for stereoscopic pictures sparked a curiosity to have a go himself, taking unique images of his family and bandmates.  One particularly intimate picture of Freddie Mercury, he finds particularly moving.  He said: \u0026ldquoMy favourite is one I had no knowledge of, which I did not remember, was one of Freddie backstage putting on make up.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos very intimate and very personal, it\u0026rsquos one the paparazzi would never get because he\u0026rsquod be so conscious of them.  \"But I was always there.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos something so precious to me, it\u0026rsquos not only candid and personal, but it is 3D as well, so it feels like you could walk into it and touch Freddie.  \u0026ldquoTo be honest, my team nursed me through it, because some of it was quite difficult for me, it can be a little bit too personal.  The latest George Washington Wilson book, published by May\u0027s London Stereoscopic Company (LSC) firm, follows a previous major work by Prof Taylor from1981 which fell out of print.  Speaking yesterday, Professor Taylor said: \"One of the reasons Wilson fell out of favour was because he was so prolific, he was everywhere and people couldn\u0027t make any sense of it.  \"But his real contribution to me is his 3D work, his stereoscopic work.\"  He added: \"I really hope this book will help put him back up there, because he really was important.  \"He was dismissed because he was commercial, but that reach and popularity and entrepreneurialism is something we celebrate.\"  George Washington Wilson, by Prof Roger Taylor, was published on 15 August"},{"url":null,"title":"yes-demo-at-snp-conference-to-urge-action-on-second-independence-referendum","story":"  In a further sign of division in the independence movement, scores of people are planning to demonstrate at the SNP conference in October to push for another vote.  They will urge the First Minister to \u0026ldquouse the mandate she sought and which, by her own benchmark, she secured at the general election for a new vote on the constitution.  Ms Sturgeon said last year that if the SNP won a majority of Scottish seats at Westminster it would convert her already \u0026ldquocast-iron mandate for a referendum into a \u0026ldquotriple lock one.  The other parts of the triple lock were the SNP win in the 2016 Holyrood election and a vote by a majority of MSPs for the transfer of referendum powers in March 2017.  However the First Minister \u0026ldquoreset her plans after the SNP lost a third of its MPs in the general election, and is due to update Holyrood on her new timetable in October.  Senior SNP figures such as MP Pete Wishart and MSP Alex Neil have urged caution, downplaying the prospect of another plebiscite in the near future.  Many in the Yes movement are frustrated at the lack of momentum on a new referendum and want Ms Sturgeon to use the mandate before it expires at the 2021 Holyrood election.  So far 70 people have said they will attend the \u0026lsquoUse The Mandate\u0026rsquo event at the SEC Centre in Glasgow, and 210 more have said they are interested.  The event is being organised by the Scotland Land of the Brave Saor Alba group, which has also helped organise recent marches calling for a second referendum.  Scottish Tory chief whip Maurice Golden said: \u0026ldquoThe SNP\u0026rsquos famous discipline is beginning to wilt, and it looks set to do so in spectacular style with a demo outside its own conference.  \u0026ldquoNicola Sturgeon has marched her independence diehards to the top of the hill and now they\u0026rsquore furious about being left in limbo.  \u0026ldquoShe should do what\u0026rsquos in Scotland\u0026rsquos best interests \u0026ndash march them back down and take another referendum off the table altogether.  Scottish LibDem MSP Tavish Scott added: \u0026ldquoScotland\u0026rsquos public services face a heap of imminent challenges. Surely there are better things the SNP could be doing to boost the country than standing outside a pro-independence conference bemoaning the fact it\u0026rsquos not pro-independence enough.  An SNP spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoAs the First Minister has made clear, she will provide an update this autumn. Given the Tories\u0026rsquo shambolic mishandling of things, the terms of Brexit are currently far from clear \u0026ndash but it is positive to see people from across the country continue to campaign passionately for independence.  Scotland Land of the Brave Saor Alba did not respond to requests for comment."},{"url":null,"title":"pressure-on-nicola-sturgeon-as-snp-voters-demand-say-on-brexit-deal","story":"  The largest poll of Scottish voters since the EU referendum found 65 per cent of those who backed the SNP last year want a public vote on the outcome of the Brexit negotiations.  Two-thirds of those who voted SNP at the general election also want Ms Sturgeon to campaign for a public vote, something she has so far refused to do.  Most Scottish LibDem and Labour voters also want a public vote, but are less enthusiastic (62 and 56 per cent respectively), while 63 per cent of Scottish Tory voters oppose one.  Overall, 48 per cent of Scots want a public vote, 31 per cent are opposed and 22 per cent don\u0026rsquot know, compared to 45, 34 and 22 per cent respectively for the UK as a whole.  The YouGov poll of 2000 Scottish adults also showed Scotland is now keener about staying in the European Union than ever, with 66 per cent of decided voters backing Remain and 34 backing Leave, compared to the 62-38 split two years ago.  SNP voters are the strongest Remain supporters, backing it 83-17, suggesting a recent swing against Brexit among many Nationalists, a third of whom voted Leave.  In the UK as a whole, sentiment has also shifted in favour of Remain, but only just.  Just 12 per cent of Scots expect the UK to get a \u0026ldquogood deal from the Brexit negotiations, in which Theresa May is pushing her soft Brexit Chequers plan, and 68 per cent a poor one.  The poll was commissioned by the People\u0026rsquos Vote campaign which is holding a rally in Edinburgh this Saturday in support of a public vote on the final outcome of the Brexit talks.  The survey found a remarkable 86 per cent of Scots (95 per cent of SNP voters), regarded the process of leaving the EU so far as \u0026ldquoa mess.  It also found 65 per cent of Scots felt the UK government was ignoring Scotland\u0026rsquos concerns on Brexit, 70 per cent did not trust Westminster on Brexit, and 80 per cent, including most Leavers thought the promises of Brexiter politicians would be broken.  Most SNP, LibDem and Labour voters said Brexit would weaken the economy, cost jobs, lower living standards, hurt the NHS, raise taxes and make today\u0026rsquos children worse off.  Most Scottish Tory voters said Brexit would improve the same things or have no impact.  Asked if Brexit would make Scottish independence more likely, 43 per cent said yes, 6 per cent said less likely, and 35 per cent said it would make no difference.  The People\u0026rsquos Vote campaign said the findings would \u0026ldquopile pressure on the SNP and Labour leaderships to support a vote on the Brexit outcome.  Former YouGov president Peter Kellner said: \u0026ldquoSupport for a public vote on the outcome is growing across the UK but is particularly strong in Scotland.  \u0026ldquoThere is deep pessimism about what Brexit will mean for Scotland and the next generation.  \u0026ldquoThe survey suggests the leaderships of both the SNP and the Labour Party are in the wrong place with most of their supporters.  \u0026ldquoThere may be an electoral dividend in Scotland for one of these parties if they strengthen their position. For instance, by a margin of three to one Labour supporters want Jeremy Corbyn to campaign for a public vote while Nicola Sturgeon may yet want to move faster than she has in backing such a route on Brexit.  The First Minister has said the SNP will not be a block to a vote on the Brexit deal, and said such a vote may be \u0026ldquoirresistible, but has never endorsed it.  Many Nationalists fear that if the SNP backed a second EU vote it would set a precedent that would be used against them in the event of a Yes to independence.  Former SNP minister Alex Neil, who backed Brexit, said: \u0026ldquoIf we supported a second Brexit referendum, when we win Indyref2, the Unionists would demand an Indyref3 to overturn it.  A separate poll for the Left Foot Forward website yesterday found most voters in the UK would blame Theresa May for a no-deal Brexit rather than the EU.  Scottish LibDem leader Willie Rennie warned Ms Sturgeon and Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard were \u0026ldquoout of step with the country.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe benefits of remaining in the EU are irreplaceable and the people can see quite clearly that whatever deal the Conservatives patch together will not be as good as the one we have now. But even as the Conservatives bumble towards a cliff edge, Scottish Labour and the SNP are still refusing to swing into action.  \"Every day that passes Nicola Sturgeon and Richard Leonard are looking more out of step with the people of Scotland. They need to end the ifs and buts and listen to the huge majority of Scots calling for a final say.\"  An SNP spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoIt is a democratic outrage that Scotland is being forced out of the EU against our will. People in Scotland voted overwhelmingly to remain in the EU and the SNP continues to believe this is the best option for Scotland\u0026rsquos future.  We will not be a block on a second EU referendum but the views of the people of Scotland must not be ignored all over again if there is to be another vote.  \"The Tories now think they can do anything they want to Scotland and get away with it. Their extreme Brexit is threatening jobs, livelihoods and the interests of ordinary people, as well as the powers of the Scottish Parliament.  Former Labour PM Gordon Brown yesterday told the Edinburgh Book Festival more than 1m Labour Leave voters across the UK had turned against Brexit.  A Scottish Labour spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoA second referendum is not Labour policy and wasn\u0026rsquot in our manifesto. Labour has always insisted that Parliament has a meaningful vote on the final Brexit deal.\""},{"url":null,"title":"coral-bleaching-dates-back-400-years","story":"  Researchers from the Universities of Glasgow and Edinburgh have dated the phenomenon back four centuries by examining cores extracted from old corals.  Large-scale coral bleaching has raised concern about the future of the ecosystems and the impact their loss could have on biodiversity.  The teams found the frequency of bleaching has increased since the 1800s and, despite corals\u0026rsquo ability to recover,\u0026nbspthere are fears they could now be approaching a \u0026ldquocritical threshold.  Dr Nick Kamenos from Glasgow\u0026rsquos School of Geographical and Earth Sciences said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos clear in the core data we examined that bleaching has been occurring on the Great Barrier Reef for at least 400 years, but the frequency of bleaching events has increased markedly since the early 1800s and those events have affected 10% more corals since the late 1700s.  \u0026ldquoWe can see that corals have been able to acclimate and recover from past bleaching events.  \u0026ldquoHowever, the increase in bleaching frequency and the numbers of corals affected since temperatures started consistently increasing in the modern era raises serious concerns about whether corals are approaching a critical threshold beyond which their long-term survival is uncertain.  Bleaching occurs when water temperatures rise too high and disrupt the relationship between the coral and the tiny algae living inside it.  When the algae are expelled, it leaves the coral a stark white. They\u0026nbspcan be reabsorbed when the water temperature drops again, but corals die if this separation is too long.  Dr Sebastian Hennige from Edinburgh\u0026rsquos School of Geosciences said: \u0026ldquoFor this study we used the most conservative methods we could in some of the toughest corals out there today.  \u0026ldquoThe fact that we are seeing an increase in bleaching even in these tough corals highlights just how serious the threat of coral bleaching is, and how important it is that we take action now to reduce this threat.  The paper, titled Reconstructing four centuries of temperature-induced coral bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef, is published in the journal Frontiers.  The study was supported by funding from the Natural Environment Research Council, the Royal Society of Edinburgh and the Scottish Government."},{"url":null,"title":"holy-grail-of-whisky-to-be-auctioned-for-up-to-900000","story":"  The 1926 Macallan Valerio Adami is due to be auctioned at Bonhams Whisky Sale in Edinburgh in October with an estimation of between \u0026pound700,000 and \u0026pound900,000.

A: Clearing is the annual process that allows students without a university place, or who want to switch to a different one, to search for and find a degree course with availability.  You can use Clearing if you are applying for the first time after June 30, if you did not receive any offers from any universities, or none you wanted to accept, or if you did not meet the required grades needed for your chosen university course.  Q: When does Clearing open and how long does it last?  A: Clearing opened on July 5 and closes on October 23.  Q: How do I apply for a university place through Clearing?  A: If you haven\u0026rsquot already applied for a university place through the main application scheme, you need to submit an application to Ucas. You will then be sent an email and have access to Ucas\u0026rsquos online system, Track. You\u0026rsquoll also be given a Clearing number.  Search for courses you are interested in, and when you have found one you want to study, call the university or college and ask them if they will accept you. You\u0026rsquoll need to give them your Clearing number.  Once you have found one you are happy with, and they have said they will take you, you can add the course through Track.  Q: How do I add a Clearing choice?  A: Once you\u0026rsquove chosen your course and the university or college has said they\u0026rsquoll accept you, click \u0026ldquoadd clearing choice on the Track system and fill in the course details.  The university will then confirm your place.  Filling in and submitting the course details means you have definitely accepted the offer, so if the university confirms it, it will show as an acceptance on your \u0026ldquochoices page in Track.  You can only add one choice at a time. You\u0026rsquoll be able to add a different one if the university or college does not confirm your place.  Q: How long does Clearing take?  A: How long it takes depends on how long you want to take to make a choice, and how long it takes for the university or college you choose to confirm your place.  Q: How does Clearing work in Scotland?  A: Clearing works the same way for all students, regardless of where they live in the UK.  Q: When do universities get A-level results?  A: Universities receive prospective students\u0026rsquo grades in the days before A-level results day under strict embargo to allow them to confirm whether applicants have gained the required results. Students can sign in to Track on ucas from 8am on August 16, where they will be able to see if they\u0026rsquove been accepted.  Q: Is it easy to get into university through Clearing?  A: There are around 30,000 courses available in Clearing, and each one will have different grade and qualification requirements.  You should think carefully about what you want to do and where you want to study, as well as whether you meet the requirements to be accepted on to the course.  There is now no cap on the number of students a university or college can admit, so many institutions will still be looking for good candidates for their degree courses through Clearing.

The posters, which are part of a drive to recruit younger people to sit on Scotland\u0027s lay tribunals assessing the needs of vulnerable children, show a bus driver, a catering manager, a leisure worker and a customer adviser with halos over their heads.  They also describe scenarios where the people pictured have helped a young person. One reads: \"I helped protect mummy\u0027s little punchbag from another beating\".  Critics include the heads of some of Scotland\u0027s major children\u0027s charities. Mary Glasgow, interrim head of Children 1st tweeted that she was \"stunned\" at the adverts\u0027 depiction of panel members as saints, adding: \"We need sensitive, informed panel members who understand it\u0026rsquos not about heroics or power but rather support, understanding and decisions made in the best interests of children and alongside parents whenever possible.\"  Sally Ann Kelly, chief executive of Aberlour tweeted of the poster with the \u0027mummy\u0027s little punchbag\u0027 line: \"Surely you need to reconsider this advert @chscotland?\"      Surely you need to reconsider this advert @CHScotland? pic.twitter/7YAjDOvnOi  Meanwhile, several board members and spokespeople at Who Cares? Scotland, the charity for care experienced young people, also voiced their dismay.  Kenny Murray said the adverts were \"dehumanising\" and misrepresented the problems faced by many young people attending children\u0027s hearings.  \"These adverts place societal stigma and judgement against parents who somehow find their family life in front of a children\u0026rsquos panel. When you come in front of a panel it might be because of abuse or neglect. It might not be.

But now one of Scotland\u0027s ancient seats of learning has launched evening classes in a language many of its scholars have derided: north-east Scots.  Aberdeen University\u0027s Elphinstone Institute has devised 10-week workshops in Doric, to help both locals and newcomers to the region learn to speak - and more importantly - write in the mither leid.  The Institute\u0027s Alistair Heather said: \u0026ldquoRecent figures show that the Scots language - which includes Doric - is spoken by around half of the entire population of the north-east and used by 1.5 million people across Scotland.  \"As the largest minority language in Europe, Scots is experiencing a real boost with so many new works and new translations into the tongue.  \"Whilst north-east Scots can be heard throughout the region, and can often been seen in signage or adverts, people seldom get the chance to learn it as a written language.\"  Mr Heather writes in north-east Scots himself including features for The Herald and a column for our sister paper The National. But he is still encountering some readers - including fluent or regular speakers of Scots - who find it strange to see what is normally a spoken dialect written down.  The workshops, which begin in September, are not just aimed to help people find ways to put their language down on paper. Mr Heather said the courses would also help speakers improve their fluency and range of expression and learn a little about history.  BACKGROUND: How Scots-speaking areas voted No  He said: \"The workshops will focus on how people can use the language in their daily lives, and by the end of the first block of workshops they will have sent a tweet, made a Facebook post, some verse and even a letter to the press in north-east Scots!  \"It will also invite newer arrivals to Scotland and the north-east to take a chance to learn and understand the speech and literary traditions of their new hame. Language can be the key to unlock the culture of the north-east and to help new arrivals settle in to the area.\"  Social media has thrust all the dialects of Scots in to the public sphere with people tweeting or Facebooking as they speak, rather than as they were taught to write at school. However, there is a large corpus of historic and modern literature in the language which can be studied too.  North-east Scots is routinely referred to as Doric - even by its speakers - despite the term\u0027s derogatory background.    Alistair Heather  Until last century all Scots dialects, including those of the central belt, and Northumbrian were called Doric in what was thought to be a joking reference to an ancient Greek language.  Athenians - or Attics - considered the speech or Dorians, Doric, to be rougher than their refined dialect.  Several parts of the North-East have the among the highest prevalence of Scots speakers, with 49 per cent of the population of Aberdeenshire saying they know the language. Knowledge of Scots falls in Edinburgh. The last census showed more than 311,000 of its 460,000 inhabitants of the Athens of the North could not understand, speak, read or write in Doric or any other Scots dialect.

For not only will it commemorate the centenary of the end of World War One, but it will also mark the centenary of the restoration of Poland’s sovereignty as the Second Polish Republic from the German, Austrian and Russian Empires.                                       \t      \t\tLabour of love...for Keith Burns, project manager from MAPA Scotland, the charity founded to restore the Great Polish Map of Scotland in 2010. Some eight years and \u0026#65533120,000 later, that goal has now been achieved.      \t                                                             The independence celebrations will be marked here in Scotland by Polish people across the country.                                                    And taking centre stage will be the Great Polish Map of Scotland.        In the summers of 1974 to 1979, this lasting legacy was created in the Borders to celebrate the links between Scotland and Poland.Although dating back to before 1576, it was in that year Royal Grants first recorded the relationship – with the King of Poland protecting the Scots “who supply us with all that is necessary”. Our friendship has remained firm ever since.The Great Polish Map of Scotland was mainly the work of a small group of Poles from the Jagiellonian University of Krakow, led by the map’s lead designer, Dr. Kazimierz Trafas.                                                                                                        But its creation was the brainchild of Krakow-born Jan Tomasik, a sergeant in the 1st (Polish) Armoured Division, who was stationed in Galashiels during the war and married a Scottish nurse in 1942 after being treated in the town’s Peel Hospital.He became a successful hotelier in Edinburgh after the war and added Barony Castle in Eddleston to his properties in 1968, where the map was conceived and created.He wanted to show hotel guests the landscape of Scotland and hoped the map would become a tourist magnet.Jan also wanted to show the coastline of the country Polish forces had been responsible for defending.                                                                                                        He is remembered as saying to hotel patrons: “I shall die but I shall leave my map as a gift to the Scottish people to thank them for the hospitality they showed the Poles when it was needed”.After the hotel closed in 1985 and ownership of Barony Castle passed from the Tomasik family, the map fell gradually into disrepair.But in 2010, Mapa Scotland was formed – a group of volunteers who were dedicated to restoring the map to its former gloryThanks to grants from the Heritage Lottery and European Leader Fund, along with fundraising, that goal has now been achieved.And it is hoped it will become both a visitor attraction and an educational resource for many generations to come.                                                                                                        With that in mind, a digital documentation team from Historic Environment Scotland spent five days on site, laser scanning the map to create a 3D model.The team then spent several months, working with Mapa Scotland and the Polish Cultural Festival Association, to create an interactive app highlighting Scotland’s Polish heritage.For Marta Pilarska, digital documentation intern with HES, the project proved to be a learning curve.She said: “I’m Polish and even I was discovering new connections between Poland and Scotland which I had never heard before. “It was a really interesting project to be involved with.“I knew the basics – the soldiers during the war years and that Bonnie Prince Charlie’s mother was Polish.“But I never knew that 40,000 Scots emigrated to Poland in the 1600s and that many towns and areas are still named after Scotland.“One of the quirkier facts we discovered was that a Polish folk dance, dating back to the 1600s, is actually based on a ceilidh dance.“I had no idea about any of that until this project.”Marta joined the HES team at an ideal time too – just one month before work started on the project.She added: “I was in the perfect place at the perfect time – a nice coincidence.“We hope people will enjoy finding out more about the two countries links and that teachers will also visit the map and use the digital app as a learning tool.”The Great Polish Map of Scotland measures some 50 metres by 40 metres and lies in an oval pit surrounded by a 142 metres long perimeter wall. Covering an area of 1590 square metres, it is understood to be the largest three-dimensional physical representation of a country and the largest outdoor relief map in the world.Visit https://sketchfab/HistoricEnvironment Scotland to explore the app.A labour of love for MAPA Scotland volunteers who restored landmarkA business meeting at Barony Castle Hotel in 1996 led Keith Burns to stumble across the Great Polish Map of Scotland, literally – it was so overgrown.But it wasn’t until 1999, when the engineer from East Linton retired, that the discovery started “nagging away” at him.In 2000, Keith and several friends started discussing what they could do to transform the landmark’s fortunes.And in 2010 they formed the charity MAPA Scotland, with the aim of raising enough funds to restore the map.Initially, they thought it would take two years and around £45,000 to rectify – but it proved a much larger undertaking.Keith, who was the project manager, explained: “We seriously understimated how long the work would take and how much it would all cost.“There were two reasons for that: firstly, we didn’t realise how much repair work the foundations of the map would require. They had been built with old tin cans from the hotel and they were crumbling away.“And secondly we had to get one or two specialist contractors to repair the pit wall and relay a lot of underground water supply pipes for the seabed.“The water supply had never worked it now does so we’ve actually upgraded the map.“But all of that took money and, to date, it has cost in excess of £120,000 to restore.”That funding was raised thanks to the Heritage Lottery and European Leader Funds, as well as major contributions from the Barony Castle Hotel, Borders Council, the Polish Consulate and the Scottish Polish Cultural Association, as well as generous public donations.However, 12 MAPA volunteers bore the brunt of the labour.Keith added: “We were all retired and could spend time on the project. It was hard work and involved a fair bit of travel but we’re delighted the map has now finally been restored.”Collection boxes around the site will help MAPA maintain the map for future generations.

The castle has been open to the public since then and attracts 25,000 visitors a year.After the Vyners sold their property it was run as a hotel from 1967 until 1974. When it then went on the market, the rock band Led Zeppelin looked at it with the aim of turning it into a recording studio although the plan did not come to fruition.Stuart \u0026ldquoWoody Wood from the Bay City Rollers also showed interest as a buyer but it was purchased by a clothes manufacturer before he sold it to the current owner\u0026rsquos family in the mid-1980s.The house \u0026ndash built between 1895 and 1908 \u0026ndash was also said to have been used as the backdrop for a horror film in the 1970s.The property is in need of refurbishment but could be developed as a hotel, as serviced apartments, as a bed-and-breakfast business or as a family home, according to the auctioneers.The 1800 acres of land is suitable \u0026ldquofor sport and grouse shooting, while the six lochs are said to be ideal for brown trout fishing.

People with physical, vision and intellectual disabilities are eligible to compete.\u0026ldquoThis is a golden opportunity for local groups, individuals and businesses to raise awareness to their cause and raise funds from their stalls on the day, he said. \u0026ldquoWe are hoping the event will showcase Caithness in a positive way for tourism, business and the community.Sixty para-athletes will travel from as far afield as America and Australia and all over the UK to take part in the milestone event. The Mey Games will be unique as it welcomes both para and Invictus athletes to compete in traditional Highland track-and-field competitions. This will be the first time that para-athletics has been included within a traditional Highland Games context in Scotland.America\u0026rsquos Alex \u0026ldquoThe Tank Armor, who holds the world record for wheelchair caber-tossing, as well as several top Australian para-athletes will be competing.Last year saw a revamped games event held at John O\u0026rsquoGroats, with Prince Charles \u0026ndash known as the Duke of Rothesay in Scotland \u0026ndash in attendance.The duke \u0026ndash whose late grandmother, the Queen Mother, regularly attended the games during her summer stays at the Castle of Mey \u0026ndash did an impromptu tour of the various marquees on the site to chat with local organisations and vendors.Capt Otley \u0026ndash who is also chairman of the Wick, Canisbay and Latheron branch of Royal British Legion Scotland (RBLS) \u0026ndash said that all proceeds from the games will be going towards supporting the veterans and their families within the branch area. There will be in the region of 15 marquees this year, including seven new ones as a result of successful applications to local community benefit funds.\u0026ldquoThe Mey Games is now a major annual event in Caithness, Capt Otley said.\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos organised by the Wick, Canisbay and Latheron branch of the RBLS who took on the running of the games when visitor numbers were dwindling to as low as just 30. Last year, we had 1500 visitors and this year we hope to welcome between 2500 and 3500 people.\u0026ldquoWe are all volunteers and work hard to ensure the event is a big success. It\u0026rsquos a community event and we want the local community to be part of it. We offer free stalls to local businesses as we want to encourage them to be involved.\u0026ldquoAt the RBLS we provide a lot of veteran support and our ethos is focused on military support and participation inclusion.\u0026ldquoWe are delighted to have so many para-athletes taking part this year from around the globe. A delegation from the RBLS Wick, Canisbay and Latheron branch visited Australia in April this year to mark Anzac Day so it\u0026rsquos fitting that we will have a number of Australian para-athletes taking part.\u0026ldquoWe want to make sure each of the para-athletes and everybody at the games has an enjoyable time.He stressed how the games have been \u0026ldquoramped up by comparing the number of marquees this year with the total put up two years ago, only three.\u0026ldquoThere has been a massive amount of work behind the scenes by a dedicated group of members to ensure the games not only takes place but grows to a more sustainable level.The build-up to the Mey Games will get under way with a North Coast 500 cycling challenge that will depart from Wick\u0026rsquos Market Square on July 28 and arrive back in the town on August 3, the day before the games.On the morning of the games, at 9.30am, there will be a rededication ceremony at the grave of General Lord Horne in Wick cemetery. \u0026ldquoWe shall honour Wick\u0026rsquos own hero of the Great War with a colour party and piper in attendance at this short but poignant event, Capt Otley said.Events kicks off at 11am and include Highland dancing competitions, pipe and drum bands, the tug of war, dog show and live music, as well as various exhibitions, local art, crafts and food stalls.The event will take place at John O\u0026rsquoGroats for the third time after travel company Natural Retreats stepped in after the previous games location, close to the Castle of Mey, became waterlogged.Since then the company has continued to provide ongoing complimentary use of the showground.Ewan Kearney, chief operating officer at Natural Retreats, said: \u0026ldquoWe are absolutely delighted to support the Mey Games again this year.For more information, visit the Mey Games Facebook page: https://www.facebook/MeyGames/Thursday 16 Aug 2018 4:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116890.jpg","title":"Prince Charles to launch Highland Games initiative","story":"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspHe decided to act after seeing a steady decline in athletes taking part in the Mey Games, which he has attended every year since 2002.The prince \u0026ndash known as the Duke of Rothesay when in Scotland \u0026ndash hopes the initiative will provide a more secure and better future for the games.Robert Lovie of The Prince\u0026rsquos Foundation, which is involved in the proposal, said the prince was aware of a lack of competition in the heavy and other traditional events at the Mey Games.\u0026ldquoHe was aware of it and wanted to do something about it, Mr Lovie, the foundation\u0026rsquos director of outreach, said.\u0026ldquoThe prince has had an interest in Highland Games since he was a little boy and attended the Braemar Gathering.

It may be possible at some point to have a junior games.The idea will be taken into secondary schools to start with, although in the longer term primaries would be included as well.

He will train youth leaders in the area to pass on the skills and techniques used in tossing the caber, tug-of-war and hammer-throwing.He said: \u0026ldquoThere are currently few routes into Highland Games for young people in Scotland.

This will also improve the availability of recycled material for use in the production of bottles and cans in future.“I would encourage everyone with an interest to provide their views on how this scheme can meet Scotland’s needs and help us tackle our throwaway culture.”Iain Gulland, Chief Executive, Zero Waste Scotland, said: “Scotland’s planned deposit return scheme is a landmark in the nation’s circular economy journey, with the potential to drive inward investment and create jobs in Scotland at the same time as improving recycling and reducing litter.\u0026#8221Consultation available to view.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

They were both originally earmarked for closure, but were later given temporary reprieves to see if customer numbers increase.The new report also warned that while \"online banking, Post Office banking and mobile bank vans go some way to providing alternatives\", there were concerns over cyber security, \"the fragile nature of Post Office contracts\", and accessibility of mobile banks.Zoe Laird, HIE\u0026rsquos regional head of communities infrastructure, said: \"Along with the findings of the Scottish Parliament Enquiry into bank closures this [study] will inform how public sector agencies and service providers respond.\"Thursday 16 Aug 2018 4:39 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Even non-dog owners have praised our initiative.\"She added: \"This is a disappointing thing to happen in our village where so many volunteers do their best to maintain the area to ensure this is a clean and safe place for residents and visitors and I am appalled that this vandalism was apparently carried out by a local resident.\"The community council and Men\u0026rsquos Shed group were put in touch via link man Roddie McPherson, who lives near the fishing village\u0026rsquos landmark harbour.The eco-friendly wooden dispensers can be found at the Avoch end of the railway line path, on Shore Walk by the industrial units, at the harbour green and at the start of the Shaltie Burn path.The move follows a recent initiative in the village to highlight the many paths which can be enjoyed by visitors to the village via a panel erected at a prominent spot near the Lazy Corner.A police spokesman said: \"Anyone with information is asked to call police on 101, quoting NE5003/18, or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.\"Thursday 16 Aug 2018 4:39 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The 3.6km section between Glendoe and Loch Tarff has been particularly challenging and would not have been possible without funding support from SSE, Highland Council and the Scottish Government and European Union totalling \u0026pound250,000, as well as the full support from Glendoe Estate over whose land the trail has been constructed. The opening of this section opens up the South Loch Ness Trail to more walkers, mountain bikers and horse riders and, particularly on this section of the trail, to those of limited mobility.\"Mr Ambrose added that the creation of the LochNess360\u0026deg trail will bring new opportunities for businesses, communities and deliver major economic benefit to the area in the long term.\"It will achieve this because it will attract visitors who may spend up to six to seven days completing the full circuit,\" he added. We know from feedback that there is already substantial interest from key European markets, particularly Germany, and VILN hope by spring 2019 to confidently go out to markets and promote it.

I said you can\u0026rsquot do that \u0026ndash no one has been notified about this. The guys just said they were acting on instructions.\"Hamish Mackenzie of Tarbat Community Council wrote to Highland Council chief executive Steve Barron back in June after receiving apologies in January from local authority community services staff for the lack of warning.They said the equipment was removed on health and safety grounds \u0026ndash a reason given in other similar instances across the region.However Mr Mackenzie says follow-up enquiries for details about land ownership and the legalities of the situation have not been responded to months later.\"The first choice is to get Highland Council to continue to maintain the park in accordance with the original agreement. People certainly feel short-changed by the council.\"People are also aware of things like threats to toilet provision and grass not being mowed. We seem to have an endless series of services being cut, often without any notice.\"He added: \"I understand budget pressures but we will fight when things are taken away without any warning, particularly when we see no justification for it.\"He said the developer of the Knockshortie Estate, Micky Austin was \"staggered\" to learn of the latest development having paid \u0026pound18,000 towards the cost of the playpark, which he had assumed would continue to be maintained and available to locals. He said: \"He is a public spirited person and has developed a nice estate. A play park lets children to get outside and away from gadgets and devices. It\u0026rsquos a great tragedy.\"\u0026nbspQuestion marks though remain for the community over the legality of the move. Many on the estate feel cheated that a facility which helped attract them in the first place has been stripped away \u0026ndash while others say Highland Council has \"played the health and safety card\" without justification.\u0026nbspThey are now left seeking answers and facing the prospect of potentially having to raise thousands to replace the facility.Tain and Easter Ross councillor Derek Loudon said: \"Highland Council officers have ordered a search of the Land Register and the Register of Sasines to clarify ownership. \"This will allow what is a very pro-active community to acquire or lease the land for a lottery or other funding bid. That is a prerequisite for any lottery bid. Let\u0026rsquos hope the community gets a quick turnaround and are able to buy the equipment needed and get it ready for next summer.\"Highland Council was approached for comment but had not responded as we went to press.Thursday 16 Aug 2018 4:39 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

All my sculptures contain a memory and I felt it apt that this particular work should be imbued with the feeling of being held in a loving embrace, feeling safe and secure enough to develop your potential.\"The Shelter of Your Arms is one of a collection of pieces created by Ann on display throughout the garden and in the Sawyer Gallery within Inverewe House.Operations manager Kevin Frediani said: \"As a result of the Gulf Stream meeting the Highlands, Inverewe Garden is a nirvana of unusual and wonderful plants and wildlife. Through our arts and exhibition programme we are providing visitors with another dimension to the garden and new way to enjoy Scotland\u0026rsquos national and natural treasures, as our reputation as a centre of arts and culture grows.\"The exhibition is open now and runs until August 30.Last month, NTS unveiled its vision of a proposed new 20m viewing tower within the garden.The plans, which have been submitted to Highland Council for consent, would see an observation tower overlooking Loch Ewe.If given the go-ahead, the tower would provide unique panoramic views for visitors with, according to the NTS, minimal impact on surroundings and could be used to host educational talks.A spring 2019 opening is planned if all goes according to plan.The attraction has enjoyed a surge in visitor numbers after recent investment including the renovation of Inverewe House, the development of the new Sawyer Gallery and Bothy Caf\u0026eacute and new glasshouses.Thursday 16 Aug 2018 4:39 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

We wanted to take positive action to help the red squirrel population spread into the local woodlands as safely as possible. The combination of bridge and road signs definitely appears to be working well, which is great news.\"It\u0026rsquos safer for reds to travel in the tree canopy rather than on the ground, so it\u0026rsquos likely that if they have the option of using a bridge rather than crossing the road, they will take it. We also installed feeders at each end of the bridge to encourage the squirrels to use it.\"Since the bridge and road signs were introduced, there has only been one known red squirrel road death locally, with none reported so far in 2018. The year before, there were three reported road deaths of reds in the immediate area and two others further away.The rope bridge is suspended over the A896 outside Shieldaig village, alongside the Ben Shieldaig woodland, one of Scotland\u0026rsquos few remaining fragments of ancient Caledonian forest.Local climber Chris Hingley worked with Becky to install the bridge last June 2017, with support from Highland Council.

She said: \"All the neighbours were out watching. The road was like a volcano.\"She said: \"If they patch this now, it\u0026rsquoll only burst another six weeks down the line further down.

We\u0026rsquore also a bit concerned about the asbestos in the pipe. There are also patches all the way down the road. One burst in May at 5am cut off half of Tain.\"Councillor Alasdair Rhind voiced frustration over the pace of the clean-up and wants Scottish Water to replace a substantive length of pipe to combat a repeat. He said: \"The most cost effective way would be to renew the pipe rather than having to call in squads of repairmen each time.\"A spokesman for Scottish Water apologised to customers affected and said the performance of mains is closely monitored \"to target investment where it is most needed, recognising that replacing water mains typically involves higher cost and further disruption for residents, whereas targeted repairs can often restore reliable service\".He said: \"Given the deteriorating performance of a section of the main serving customers in Knockbreck Avenue over recent months, this has now been identified as a priority and we will therefore be replacing the length of water main where bursts have occurred. We will keep residents informed once a proposed timescale for this work to take place has been identified in consultation with Highland Council.\"On health concerns, he said the water supply across Scotland is sampled, on average, once every two minutes and tested against strict quality standards to protect public health. Additional samples are routinely taken when a main is returned to service.He said the World Health Organisation has concluded there is no evidence of a health risk connected to drinking water from asbestos cement water mains.Thursday 16 Aug 2018 4:39 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Now locals on Tiree are looking for a new minister to lead the Church of Scotland congregation on the island, which covers an area of 30 square miles.            While one of the Kirk’s more remote postings, whoever takes up the job will be able to enjoy living in a manse just yards from the beach as well as performing a prominent role in the tight-knit community, which has a Christian tradition dating back to the sixth century.            Jo Bennett, clerk of the congregation’s nominating committee, said: “People talk about Iona as a thin place – a place where the distance between heaven and earth collapses.  “I think Tiree has that too, but it’s also very much a working community - you get both aspects here.“A minister here has the chance to see the impact of the work they do and be the focal point for the community.”READ MORE: Message in a bottle sent from Iceland washes up on Tiree after a yearMr Bennett said the congregation was regularly boosted in the summer months by visitors from around the world.             “In Summer we get visitors from around the world but in winter it may be much smaller,” he added.“It’s always a mixture of people who visit regularly and people visiting for the first time.”The manse is situated outside the village of Scarinish, just yards from the sea and with views to the Treshnish Isles, Mull and Iona across the passage of Tiree.Although the church building only dates to 1902, Tiree has a long Christian tradition going back to St Columba and his companion Beithene, who was the abbot on the island in the sixth century.            The local population boasts the highest proportion of Gaelic speakers in the Inner Hebrides.An advert for the position states: “We seek a minister who finds that their heart resonates with this island and this community who can meet us where we are and help guide us towards where we should be who can “be Christ” in this place to people who need His love.“Tiree is not a place that allows for anything other than going ‘all in’.“People will know when you leave the Manse they’ll know where you’ve been visiting what you’ve been buying in the Co-op and when your cooker has stopped working.“But they will also wave and stop for a chat when they see you notice the work you put in to visiting and come by with food or invite you round for dinner when your cooker isn’t working.” "},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4783471.1534192405!/image/image.jpg","title":"chris bambery how scotland s own occupy movement took over edinburgh 80 years ago","story":"        Frustration and anger at rising inequality is nothing new, as a largely forgotten chapter of Scotland\u0026#8217s history of protest shows, writes Chris Bambery                In June 1933, for three days and nights, jobless protesters occupied the centre of Edinburgh, sleeping out on Princes Street under the windows of the city elite’s gentlemen’s clubs.            An army of the unemployed descended on Edinburgh from all corners of Scotland. With them were bands, field kitchens and banners. Each marcher had a knapsack and blanket. The goal of the marchers was to meet with Sir Godfrey Collins, Secretary of State for Scotland, to demand the abolition of the means test, increased relief for men, women and children and for work schemes to provide jobs. The city authorities made it clear the marchers were not welcome and they would provide no accommodation or food.            The march was organised by the Communist-led National Unemployed Workers Movement (NUWM), whose Scottish organiser was the veteran agitator, Harry McShane, but it won support from the Independent Labour Party, the trade unions and Labour Party. The Aberdeen and Dundee contingents marched south to join with the Fife contingent in Kirkcaldy. The Ayrshire contingent joined with Lanarkshire marching via Shotts and East Calder. The Renfrewshire and Dunbartonshire contingents, including a women’s section marched via Glasgow, Coatbridge, Airdrie, Bathgate, and Broxburn. The main Glasgow contingent marched to Kilsyth and Falkirk, where they joined with Stirlingshire, and onto Edinburgh via Bo’ness.READ MORE: Video: Rare footage of Edinburgh in the 1930sOn Sunday 12 June, they joined up in Costorphine for their entry into the capital. The next day 20,000 people greeted them at the Mound. The first sign of a thaw on the part of the authorities was when the Ministries of Labour, Health and Education agreed to meet delegations of marchers. But there was still no reply from Collins. A second victory was when the police lifted a ban on street collections. But Collins refused to meet with them.The NUWM members paraded through the royal palace of Holyrood with their band playing ‘The Internationale’ and other socialist tunes, and when the city council refused to provide accommodation their leader, Harry McShane, said they’d sleep on the pavement of Princes Street, the city’s most prestigious thoroughfare, as marcher William McVicar recalled: “I think someone offered us somewhere [to sleep] like Waverley Market or somethin’. And McShane and them wouldn’t accept that, they says, ‘No, no, we’re not going there.’ So they says, ‘Oh well, we cannae give you anything else.’ And of course he says, ‘Right we’ll sleep in Princes Street.’” The Edinburgh Evening News reported McShane telling the marchers as they gathered on the south side of Princes Street: “So far here we are and here we stay until another decision is reached. We can breakfast, dinner or tea here, and the men require a rest. They can have that rest in Princes Street. We have decided to give them a long lie in ‘bed’ this morning.” The Edinburgh Dispatch caught the mood among the ordinary folk of Edinburgh as they made thier way along Princes Street on that first morning: “Walking along on the carriageway one heard snatches of conversation: ‘Slept well?’ ‘How did ye enjoy yer feather bed?’ ‘Did ye feel a draught coming in during the night?’”            On the first morning, women marchers blocked the tramway while men shaved using their reflections in the windows of the big department stores. Tom Ferns remembers: “And they couldnae ha’ picked a better spot than Princes Street. Under the Conservative Party headquarters, the Liberal Party headquarters and the big luxury hotels, here was hundreds and hundreds o’ angry unemployed. Obviously a sight like that is not seen every day, particularly in the capital city of Edinburgh.”READ MORE: Astonishing press photographs capture interwar-era EdinburghAnother marcher, James Allison, said, “the police were going mad”. Yet Edinburgh police were not keen on inciting a pitched battle as Hugh Sloan recalled: “At dinner time, our field-kitchen came along and the police chief told Harry McShane, ‘This is Princes Street, you can’t feed here.’ Harry told them, ‘It was good enough for us to sleep here, it’s good enough for us to feed here.’” The marchers then demanded free transport home. Eventually the city’s chief constable and deputy town clerk told them they would provide transport if McShane guaranteed there would be no more marches to Edinburgh. He refused and the chief constable, worried about disturbances on the capital’s streets, backed down. Transport was then provided to take the marchers home.            On the last night, the marchers and their supporters gathered to burn an effigy of Sir Godfrey Collins before boarding buses and a final meal paid for by the city council. The march organisers refused to give a guarantee that no further hunger marchers would defile the city!Throughout the 1930s, the unemployed protested but the NUWM also organised children’s parties in the summer and at Christmas. A number of the marchers would go on to fight in the Spanish Civil War, including the leader of the Aberdeen contingent, Bob Cooney.The inter-war period, not just the “Hungry Thirties”, was grim in Scotland. Prior to the First World War, it had been at the cutting edge of British industry. Within a few years of the wars end the traditional industries, coal, steel and shipbuilding were in trouble. Scottish banks and companies were bought up by their bigger English rivals. Unemployment was a permanent feature, peaking in the 1930s and only ending with the demands of the Second World War.The shale mining industry collapsed, for example, as cheap imported oil cut demand for paraffin. In December 1925, “The Scotsman” reported from Tarbrax, a shale mining village then in South Lanarkshire under the headline “Situation at Tarbrax: Faced With Starvation,” which reported: “Workers from Tarbrax, to the number of nearly 400, marched in procession to Carnwath, nearly ten miles distant, on Thursday night last for the purpose of asking poor relief. Relief under the emergency clause of the Poor Law Act, which enables people in a state of absolute destitution to get relief, has been given to a number of people in Tarbrax on the recommendation of the doctor there. A meeting of Carnwath Parish Council has been called for today to consider the whole situation.”  Starvation – it’s a strong word. My father was little over a year old when the mine at Tarbrax shut. His father would have been on that cold December march before briefly finding work at another pit nearby, then giving up and coming to Edinburgh in search of work. He was without a permanent job until the end of the 1930s.

The lack of a debate on Andrew Wilson\u0026#8217s Growth Commission at SNP conference is a startling omission, writes Tom Peterkin.                Councillor Christopher McEleny is fast emerging as one of the SNP’s more colourful characters. Twice he has stood to be SNP depute leader. Twice he has been defeated, firstly by Angus Robertson, and most recently by Keith Brown, the former Economy Secretary who is now Nicola Sturgeon’s right-hand man as far as the party is concerned.            Despite being on the receiving end of comprehensive defeats, the Inverclyde councillor refuses to slide back into the relative obscurity of local authority politics.            It was earlier this month that Mr McEleny found himself in the headlines when the judge in an employment tribunal ruled that his support for Scottish independence qualified as a “philosophical belief”. The conclusion was reached by judge Frances Eccles in a case that saw Mr McEleny pursue his former employer, the Ministry of Defence, claiming he had been unfairly targeted over his views.The background to the case was that around the time of his first unsuccessful attempt to become SNP depute leader in 2016, he was told that his security clearance had been revoked for his job as an electrician at the MoD munitions site in Beith, North Ayrshire.He said he was interviewed by national security officials on issues including his pro-independence views. After being suspended from his job, he left it, claiming he was unfairly targeted for his stance on leaving the UK and his support for the “social democratic values” of the SNP.READ MORE: SNP Growth Commission report: Five key points            In her judgment, Judge Eccles rather neatly summed up exactly how Mr McEleny felt about Scottish independence.“The claimant was clear in his evidence that he does not believe in Scottish independence because it will necessarily lead to improved economic and social conditions for people living in Scotland”, she said. “It is a fundamental belief in the right of Scotland to national sovereignty.”So there you have it. Mr McEleny’s belief in breaking up the UK runs through him like letters through a stick of rock. His desire for indep­endence is so strong that it trumps pro-indy arguments based on the notion that securing a Yes vote is the best way to improve Scotland economically and socially.Given that independence – come what may and damn the consequences – appears to be an existential part of the councillor’s being, it was perhaps somewhat surprising to see his most recent contribution to internal SNP politics.            Earlier this week Mr McEleny took to Twitter to reveal that the party’s latest independence blueprint will not be debated at its October conference. He said it was “absolutely astonishing” that the list of 32 motions for debate in Glasgow did not include any of Andrew Wilson’s much-vaunted Growth Commission or his proposal to stick with the pound for around a decade after independence. Even the man for whom independence is a “philosophical belief” is objecting to the party’s failure to take a long and hard look at the harsh economic reality at independence. A similar row erupted before the SNP’s most recent conference in June, which happened to take place shortly after Mr Wilson published his 354-page magnum opus.Despite the fact that the SNP document was the hot topic of the moment, there was no formal debate on its proposals, which are absolutely fundamental to the party’s next drive for independence. Instead, discussion of the document was relegated to a fringe meeting. That meeting offered some explanation as to why it might suit the SNP not to pore over the document in public. It was easily the stormiest session of the conference as the former SNP MP and economist George Kerevan criticised its contents. READ MORE: SNP Growth Commission strengthens case for union, claims pro-UK think tankThe future plotted by the commission would, said Mr Kerevan, leave Scotland “at the mercy” of the banks, because its plans to keep the pound without Bank of England protection for a decade would hinder the ability to grow the Scottish economy. This, he argued, would put the poor at risk.            The difficulty for the SNP is that Mr Kerevan’s views are shared by many who, like him, can be found on the left of the party. Mr Wilson won praise for constructing a more realistic case for independence than that made in Alex Salmond’s white paper published ahead of the 2014 referendum.But realism can have its drawbacks. Mr Wilson’s approach to cutting Scotland’s £13.3 billion deficit has seen the highly respected Institute for Fiscal Studies warn that Scotland would see a “continuation of austerity”.One can understand why the SNP leadership might be reluctant to air these points and internal divisions at their autumn shindig. Rather, the Growth Commission is to be discussed internally at a series of SNP National Assemblies. The outcome of these discussions are then scheduled to be brought before party conference in spring next year or the National Council this coming December. In the meantime, it feels strange to be heading to another SNP conference where the biggest elephant in the room will be Mr Wilson’s indy blueprint.Or as the Inverclyde councillor who is rapidly becoming the SNP’s best-known controversialist put it: “How can we not be debating the biggest contribution to the independence case since 2014?”That may not amount to a “philosophical belief” for Councillor McEleny, but it is still a pretty good point."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4784782.1534402548!/image/image.jpg","title":"poll nearly half of scots would support brexit deal referendum","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...

The YouGov poll, commissioned by the People’s Vote campaign calling for a public vote on Brexit negotiations outcome, found 48 per cent of respondents were in favour, with 31 per cent opposed.            This is greater than the UK wide-response of 45 per cent for and 34 per cent against.

Around two-thirds of Scots think the UK is ignoring their concerns and don’t trust Westminster to take these decisions.“But the survey suggests the leaderships of both the SNP and the Labour Party are in the wrong place with most of their supporters.“There may be an electoral dividend in Scotland for one of these parties if they strengthen their position.“For instance, by a margin of three to one Labour supporters want Jeremy Corbyn to campaign for a public vote while Nicola Sturgeon may yet want to move faster than she has in backing such a route on Brexit.”The campaign group has organised a rally in Edinburgh on Saturday calling for a referendum on the Brexit deal."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4784989.1534412695!/image/image.jpg","title":"latest calmac ferry now delayed by a year","story":"                The Glen Sannox was originally due to be delivered for the main Arran route this summer but may not be carrying passengers until autumn next year.            Completion of the £48 million ship was previously delayed until this winter because of technical difficulties, but it has now emerged it won\u0027t be delivered until next summer.            That means the vessel may not be in service until autumn next year because around two months will be needed for preparations.Cunninghame North SNP MSP Kenneth Gibson said the ship would be delivered next June, but sources have indicated that is likely to be over optimistic.Ferguson Marine in Port Glasgow is building the ferry for the Ardrossan-Brodick route - one of CalMac\u0027s busiest.It is one of two liquid natural gas-powered ferries being built for the west coast ferry operator.The further setback threatens another headache for CalMac, whose services were significantly disrupted this spring when one of its vessel was taken out of service for repair.            The operator has no spare ships amid rising passenger demand, fuelled by fares being cut to bring them into line with road transport.No reason for the further delay has been given.Scottish Conservatives transport spokesman Jamie Greene said: \u0026ldquoFar from disappointing, this is still a complete shambles.\"Numerous stakeholders have long been warning about a catalogue of issues with the build of the new ferries.            \"Only recently, the Scottish Government had to bail out Ferguson Marine with substantial money.\u0026ldquoThis is another entry in a catalogue of failures on Scotland\u0026rsquos ferry networks, once again letting island communities down and affecting tourism, businesses and connectivity.\"Scottish Liberal Democrat counterpart Mike Rumbles said: \u0026ldquoOur roads are crumbling, our trains are unreliable and now there are more delays to the delivery of new ships for Scotland\u0026rsquos ferry network.\"The SNP are offering absolutely nothing to people on the move.\u0026ldquoPassengers on the west coast will have a sinking feeling once again when they find out these ferries are delayed.

It has been a long journey for some and a hard fight to gain the ground and then keep it  for the new building.

It’s manufacture uses up valuable natural resources but this is a result of human exploitation. This begs the question, why are humans capable of natural behaviour and unnatural behaviour in what seems to be equal measure?  Is it normal and natural to drive cars, fly in ‘planes, build tower blocks, dig for coal, aim to fly to distant planet ? The list is endless. According to the experts, global warming and ice ages have occurred many times and certainly before life as we know it existed.  We are worried about what are threats to our welfare only because it is a seemingly an alien threat . Surely, if we are able to stand outside ourselves, we are now caught up in a “ normal” event. And in our short sighted stupidity we are adding to the dangers.

Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildlife centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildlife centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientific, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin (tin shed). Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions (£16?), Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder if takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , proliferate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my life involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain ( hoped for ) credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on if it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself (mainly in graphite but also in pastel and acrylic) doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildlife, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products difficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of life —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate  (John Tulloch) and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! (I use the scientific meaning of parasite here).\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists ( or any other activity) when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of life. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and if you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"rubber duck wins first bergen lerwick leg of shetland race ","story":"Espen Børresen (left) and Morten Offendal celebrate their victory.

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward. This has been going on for far too long in most levels of football, and thankfully the days of pundits uttering the words “part and parcel of the game” will now be over.\nGrabbing someone in a bear hug is not football – never has been and never will be. I recall a European match some years ago when Glasgow Celtic should have had about six penalties but the referee gave none.\nWhat this needs now is for officials to be in accordance with one another. But sadly, and I can envisage a few whistlers spluttering over their cornflakes at this, the words “consistent” and “referees” are an oxymoron as far as I\u0026#8217m concerned.\nOn the subject of the English progression in the tournament, it has once again thrown up the perennial question of whether Scottish people should support their oldest rivals.\nThere are no doubt many north of the border who would find the prospect of England winning the World Cup a terrifying one. They could even be in the majority. A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way. I have always supported them when Scotland are not involved, and in recent years that has become the norm.\nA few issues do bother me, such as the constant gormless look on Kane’s face and the insistence of manager Gareth Southgate on dressing as if he was taking part in the World Snooker Championships. Someone should tell him that waistcoats are the most pointless item of clothing known to man.\nBut hey, most of it is good. I particularly enjoy the ITV panel and even Ian Wright is growing on me!\n: : : : : : : :\nIt is just over a month since the tragic death of former Aberdeen footballer Neale Cooper and I would like to add my own tribute to the many which have been paid to such a popular man.\nThe late Neale Cooper made a memorable trip to Shetland.\nAt just 19 he was the youngest member of the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup side which defeated Real Madrid in the final at Gothenburg in Sweden.\nAlong with that memorable triumph he was in the team which won two Scottish league titles, four Scottish Cups, a league cup and the European Super Cup, all achieved before he was 24.\nHe later played for Aston Villa, Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline and Ross County, where he later became manager.\nIt was in the summer of 1999, when Ross County were invited to Shetland as guests for Scalloway’s centenary celebrations, that I had the privilege of meeting Cooper.\nThere was a gala dinner in the village hall after the friendly match where County defeated Scalloway 8-2, and he agreed to give me time for a short interview. But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words. Colleagues, writers and others have pointed out what a humble, friendly and likeable character he was.\nThey are absolutely correct. I’ve meet a few well-known footballers over the years but I have no difficulty in stating that Neil Cooper was the nicest one of them all.\n: : : : : : : :\nCyclist Chris Froome is now free to go for a record-equalling fifth Tour de France win after his anti-doping case was sensibly dropped.\nThe Team Sky rider had been under investigation by the sport’s world governing body Union Cycliste Internationale but proceedings were closed on Monday.\nFroome, who is bidding to move level with Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, Jacques Anquetil and Miguel Indurain as the only five-time winners of the tour, has been under intense pressure since an amount of the asthma treatment salbutamol was found in his system.\nGet off this guy’s back and give him a break, I say. Just because he’s the best cyclist in the world does not mean he’s benefiting from a performance-enhancing drug.\n: : : : : : : :\nWith all the buzz of the World Cup an annual competition in southwest London has almost been forgotten about.\nYes, Wimbledon is in full flow once again and the British competitors are as usual struggling to make it into the second week.\nAndy Murray was probably sensible to withdraw, citing that he was not quite ready for five-set matches after his hip operation. There were signs at Queens and Eastbourne, however, that he may be able to scale the heights once more.\nThere is of course a capable replacement in Kyle Edmund, who is seeded having reached the Australian Open semi-finals earlier this year.\nEdmund’s half of the draw looks fairly open, and he could well still be involved come Monday. But of course anything can happen, and by the time you read this he could be gone.

On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois (Belgium) Benjamin Pavard (France), Raphaël Varane (France), Diego Godín (Uruguay), Ivan Strinic (Croatia) Ivan Perisic (Croatia), Luka Modric (Croatia), Jordan Henderson (England), Eden Hazard (Belgium) Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal), Edinson Cavani (Uruguay).\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a difference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt if anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed, if anyone could hear what was being said, were on the lengthy side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory.

Some of these are the last banks in their communities.\nConsultants Indigo House Group said banking facilities need to be understood as core to community infrastructure.\nIt said access to cash remained fundamental to the viability of the small retail businesses that are prominent in rural areas. This is especially true in relation to tourism businesses where the loss of access to cash via local banks could have a detrimental effect on long term prospects.\nAlthough there are potential alternatives, including online or Post Office banking and mobile bank vans, the report warned that these options raised concerns over such issues as cybersecurity, the fragile nature of Post Office contracts and accessibility of mobile banks for less able people. Customers facing a shift from a local branch to a mobile bank also consider this a backward step.\nIn its recommendations, the report calls for a collaborative approach involving Scottish Government, HIE, local councils, community members and delivery partners, including the banks and Post Office.\nIt also wants recognition of the importance of cash to local economies and support over time for a sustainable transition to digitally based economies. This includes the creation of digital inclusion strategies to help businesses benefit fully from online banking.\nThe report also recommended a Post Office banking strategy that would include securing the long-term sustainability of contract Post Offices to support rural economies and infrastructure.\n\nThursday 16 Aug 2018 4:40 PM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116807.jpg","title":"Dont play mother to lost wildcat kittens","story":"Gavin Musgrove\n\u0026nbsp\nThe public is being urged to be hands off if they spot a possible Scottish Wildcat kitten in the wilds of Strathspey unless they are certain it is in immediate danger.\nExperts have issued the warning after a well-meaning member of the public removed possible kittens from the wild and their mother.\nRare wildcats \u0026ndash and other cats in the countryside \u0026ndash are now at an age when they are out and about, even without their mums.\nScottish Wildcat Action Project Officer Emma Rawling said: \"If anyone sees tabby kittens alone in a possible wildcat area and or if mother looks like a wildcat, the public should be cautious and assume they could be wildcat kittens.\n\"Wildcats are protected by law.

I am hoping that David Potter doesn\u0026#8217t get lost this week!\u0026#8221\n\nIt\u0026#8217s been a fantastic season so far for the Broadford-based side who are the current league leaders, joint top scorers, and have the meanest defence to boot.\nWith an average of 5.2 goals a game in the league, Sleat and Strath have developed a ruthlessness in front of goal and appeared to have a strong belief when they take to the pitch that they can beat any team whether it be at home or away. Their most recent win in which they turned a 3-0 lead at half-time into an emphatic 12-0 victory in last week\u0026#8217s quarter-final tie against much-improved Glenelg is evidence they have the weapons to transform a tight match into a comfortable victory.\nHaving put in impressive defensive displays against both Kyleakin and Portree Juniors in the league, DL MacKinnon\u0026#8217s team have proven they can stand firm when required against tough opponents. That said, he will still be mindful of his side\u0026#8217s loss in their last semi-final encounter against Mallaig \u0026#8211 in what has been their only defeat so far this season \u0026#8211  and will be keen to avoid missing out on a second final.\n\n \u0026#8220It\u0026#8217s going to be a battle at our tight pitch. Key to the result will be our ability to defend set plays, which is not our strong point as we are a very small team. If we can keep Gordy (Mccarroll) and Innis (Thompson) quiet we will hopefully cause them problems with our pace.\u0026#8221\n\u0026nbsp\nWith Sleat and Strath having burst out of the blocks in the league and new boys Mallaig also making their mark, it is perhaps easy to overlook the fact that Kyleakin is not only very much in contention for the league title but have already won a piece of silverware this season with a convincing victory over Mallaig in the GF MacRae Cup.\nWith 22 goals in their last three matches, which included their 10-2 quarter-final win over Kyle, the reigning league champions know how to win games, and ultimately trophies. As well as being well-deserved, their 4-1 victory in the GF MacRae Cup Final against Mallaig was a superb example of game-management against difficult opponents on a big occasion.\nAlthough Kyleakin have put themselves in a good position to challenge on all fronts, they will have to address their inconsistency this season which has seen them held to draws recently by Glenelg and GA United.\nWith back-to-back matches coming up against Sleat and Strath in the cup, then the league, the reigning champions will look to draw on their past successes in the big games.\nBy Adam Gordon\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Campbell-Stewart-MacLennan-Co.jpg","title":"recruitment highlighted as a priority at first emergency services","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\nRepresentatives of all the emergency services on Skye held their first ever partnership meeting in Broadford last week to discuss how they can support each other.\nPictured (left to right) are Dave Philips from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, Nick Mort from the British Red Cross, Station Manager Mike Colliar from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, Sgt Andrew Shaw from Police Scotland, Neil Urquhart from Skye Mountain Rescue, Inspector Lynda Allan from Police Scotland, Area Service Manager Alan Knox of Scottish Ambulance Service.

In addition, the physically demanding nature of the current availableapprenticeships has resulted in just 1.7% of total apprentices in 2016 beingpeople with disabilities.\n\nSinnFéin aims to increase investment in apprenticeships to over €350 million perannum within five years. \nTheLimerick City TD, Deputy Quinlivan has said that this will “fund the treblingof the number apprenticeship programmes and provide places for 60,000apprentices”.\nDeputy Quinlivan continued: “€5,166,000 of investment will be required overfive years for the development of 63 new apprenticeship programmes, bringingthe total number of craft and new courses to 100.\n“Ireland’sallocation from the EU for training and education of the young is €68 million.Fine Gael was forced to return €19.8 million of this allocation in 2016, asthey failed to submit a payment application.\n“SinnFéin will ensure all EU monies allocated to Ireland would be fully utilised, tobenefit the education and training of our young people. To date, none of thismoney has been drawn down from the EU.”\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27460  ","story":" Michael McMonagle\n\nLet\u0026#039s exceed those who turned out on the very first civil rights march in August 1968 and let\u0026#039s ensure that a very clear and committed demand is presented to the governments - the Irish government as much as the British government - to address those issues of a rights based society that are enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement. - Mitchel McLaughlin\nThis Saturday the 50th anniversary of the first organised civil rights march in the North will be marked with a commemoration march from Coalisland to Dungannon. \nThe original march, held on August 24, 1968, was the first to be organised by the Civil Rights Association in the north, which was founded the previous year to challenge the institutionalised discrimination and injustice of the Six County state. \nIt was stopped at an RUC cordon before it reached its destination at Market Square in Dungannon but the organisers went ahead with their protest and held speeches at sang the civil rights anthem, \u0027We Shall Overcome\u0027, at the police cordon. \nAn estimated 2,500 people took part in the original march fifty years ago. \nThe Coalisland to Dungannon march was followed by a march in Derry on October 5 1968 which was brutally attacked by the RUC. The attack on the marchers was carried out in front of the news cameras, brining global attention to the civil rights campaign and the the discrimination of the unionist regime at Stormont. \n\nThis Saturday\u0027s march, organised by Sinn Féin, is the first in a series of events planned to mark the 50th anniversary of the beginning of the civil rights campaign. \nMid Ulster Sinn Féin MP, Francie Molloy, who helped organise and took part in the original parade 50 years ago, said that the campaign for rights is as relevant now as it was in 1968 and encouraged people to take part in Saturday\u0027s march. \n\"Presently, with the deliberate denial of rights, a shortage of affordable housing and the ongoing issue of constituency boundary proposals, it is clear there is still a job of work to be done,\" he said. \nWith the DUP\u0027s denial of rights to the LGB\u0026ampT community, Irish language speakers and bereaved families awaiting inquests, it is clear the campaign for rights needs to continue in the north. The onset of the Tory Brexit, backed by the DUP, also represents an attack on the rights of people in the north. \nThe main speaker at the end of the commemoration at the Square in Dungannon will be former Sinn Féin MLA Mitchel McLaughlin. \nSpeaking ahead of Saturday\u0027s march, the former Northern Assembly Speaker called for a huge turnout. \"Let\u0027s exceed those who turned out on the very first civil rights march in August 1968 and let\u0027s ensure that a very clear and committed demand is presented to the governments - the Irish government as much as the British government - to address those issues of a rights based society that are enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement,\" he said. \nThe parade will begin in Coalisland at 3pm on Saturday and make its way to Dungannon. \n\n\ntest\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/a05f-jpg.jpg","title":"65470  ","story":"    \nNORTHERN Ireland have been crowned World Champions after the local sailors took on the best from around the world for the Atlantic Challenge and won.\nTeams of young people from around the globe converged on Lough Neagh for the toughest test of endurance, strength and skill.\nThe Northern Ireland crew had an outstanding week in Antrim, with big wins in the two Jackstay Transfer tasks, traditional rope work, man overboard and the rowing slalom races.

inspires local woman to take on berlin marathon","story":"  \nA Ballymena woman is taking on 26.2 miles at one of the world’s most famous marathons on September 16 to help raise money for the British Heart Foundation Northern Ireland (BHF NI).\n  \nMairead Agnew was inspired by her young neighbour Mark Lynn, who has complex congenital heart disease. At just 8 years old, he has undergone four open heart surgeries and numerous cardiac procedures. \n  \nIn 2015 Mark was diagnosed with heart failure but this still hasn’t stopped him and his parents Donna and Geoff supporting BHF NI and raising almost \u0026pound3,000 for the charity.\n  \nMairead explained: “My sister was born with congenital heart disease so this is a cause that has always been extremely close to mine and my family’s hearts. When I saw the wonderful fundraising that Mark and his family had raised, I wanted to do something to help. When I told Mark I was taking on the Berlin Marathon, he was sure he wanted us to support BHF NI once again.”\n  \nKaren McCammon, Health Services Engagement Lead for BHF NI explained: “When the BHF was founded in 1961, 8 out of every 10 babies born with congenital heart disease died before their first birthday. Our research has helped to turn this around, and now 8 out of 10 babies survive to adulthood. Breakthroughs such as these are only possible because of the support we receive from supporters like Mairead, Mark and his family. We are therefore extremely grateful for all their efforts.”\n  \nBHF have also developed pioneering surgical techniques to treat complex congenital defects.

I understand that the work is expected to last right up until Christmas.\n  \n“My issue is firstly there has been no consultation, I don\u0027t know exactly what they are planning to do. \n  \n“We are relying on hearsay at the minute and I have heard that there are plans to lay stone similar to the rest of the town.” \n  \nClaire said she had written a letter to Mid and East Antrim Borough Council about the issue.\n  \nShe continued: “It took ten days to get a reply which said there was “nothing concrete at the minute”.\n  \nClaire said that among her concerns was that the area has a very slopping street which raises issues around what type of paving is used.\n  \nShe added: “Also there are concerns around water flowing down the street due to the slope and the fact that if the paving used is light in colour chewing gum, which will eventually cover it, will turn black and soon make the street look grubby and shabby.”\n  \nClaire said she would like to see either the street remain the same and be “brought back to its former glory” or be consulted on any proposed plans.\n  \n“We want to have a debate about it, not have to rely on hearsay. I have a sizeable investment in this street and I feel as a business owner I should have a say,” she concluded.\n  \nA Mid and East Antrim Council spokesperson said: “Plans are being considered to extend the public realm scheme on this street, however, these are at a very early stage. \n  \n“We will be liaising with traders over the coming weeks in relation to initial consultation on concept designs.” \n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_921291.jpg--.jpg?1534232684000\n","title":"dungonnell dam features on ulster giants tv show","story":"  \nA reservoir in the hills between Ballymena and the glens features in the new series celebrating the achievements in Northern Ireland of the Institution of Civil Engineers on the occasion of their 200th anniversary. \n  \nThe fifth episode of ‘Ulster Giants’, which continues on Monday, August 20 at 8pm on UTV is all about water and the various ways in which it has been collected, stored and treated before being delivered to our homes and workplaces. \n  \nJoe Mahon’s first port of call is the now abandoned Hunt’s Park Water Tower in Donaghadee in Co. Down. \n  \nAnd of local interest, he also visits the water treatment works at Dungonnell Dam in the Antrim Hills. \n  \nJoe interviews Derek McKane of NI Water, who demonstrates the operation of the dam and takes him on a tour of the bewildering number of processes our modern water supply has to undergo before it is deemed fit for human consumption. \n  \n“After watching this you’ll never take tap water for granted again!” Joe promises.\n  \nCivil engineer Alan Cooper then directs our attention to the innovative construction of the actual dam itself – the first to be built using asphalt, and employing many of the same construction methods you would find in road-building! Alan rounds off with some insights into the general history of dam-building in this country and relates how civil engineering has developed its own code of ethics over the 200 years since the foundation of the Institution of Civil Engineers.\n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_921285.jpg--.jpg?1534232428000\n","title":"estelle in the frame for spectacle wearer of year win","story":"  \nA Ballymena woman has been chosen from thousands of proud glasses wearers as a finalist for Specsavers’ Spectacle Wearer of the Year.\n  \nEstelle Wallace, shortlisted in the 45 – 59 age category from Rasharkin could follow in the footsteps of last year’s Award winner, Love Island hunk Alex Miller, winning \u0026pound10,000 and the chance to mingle with the stars at the annual awards. \n  \nGlasses wearers across the UK and Republic of Ireland have been showing off their specs style by sharing their selfies online.\n  \nEstelle, who is a health and wellness coach, was invited to visit her local Specsavers store in Fairhill Shopping Centre to receive a bottle of champagne, a certificate and a \u0026pound125 glasses voucher.\n  \nEstelle said: “I was really delighted to be shortlisted as a regional finalist.

Universal Credit is definitely a part of that, I am in no doubt about that. We have been dealing with people who have said that they are in need of help because of Universal Credit. \nThe figures cover the six month period May to October 2017 and the period January to May 2018 with an average of 30 vouchers a month dealt with in the first period, jumping to 38 in the second.\nPeter acknowledges that these figures are from quite a small area over a limited time \u0027but something must have triggered it.\u0027 He said:There is an unmistakable trend, more people are needing help after Universal Credit.

We can\u0027t forget their big sister Kaia who has kept us all smiling.\nThe family\u0027s agony began on June 8 last year when Caden, a pupil at St Brigid\u0027s Primary School, was diagnosed with aplastic anemia, a rare blood disease where bone marrow fails to produce sufficient blood cells.\nSabrina, who has taken time off from her job at Limavady Grammar School to care for Caden, recalled: Bruises started appearing all over his body and Caden was tired, so we knew something wasn\u0027t right.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ?

They know the Cadet movement is as much committed to building confidence and friendships as it is to building skills.\n\n“Our Banbridge Cadets embraced every opportunity brought to them at this year’s Summer Camp, held at Strensall, near York, with great good humour and seemingly boundless energy. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“Now, following a Summer packed with challenge and achievement, they’ll be turning their attention to their annual new membership campaign and I am sure they will all become highly persuasive recruiters as they invite local teenagers to come along and see what Cadet life has to offer.”\n\nIf you would like to find out more about what membership of the Army, Sea or Air Cadets can offer you or your children, contact 0800 730 730 or visit www.reservesandcadetsni.org.uk.

This unique history project is being supported by Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council as part of the PEACE IV Shared Spaces and Services programme.\n\nUrsula Kearns from Mayfair Business Centre said: “We are really keen to speak to any women and men who worked in the factory during the 1960s and 1970s, including those who were made redundant when the factory closed. We want to hear and collect their experiences and memories and we want those stories to be recorded and shared. The intention would be for the former workers to meet together on a regular basis over coming months. It will be informal and will be a chance for old friends and acquaintances to meet up. We intend that the project will be led by those taking part, so we expect that it will touch upon other work-places as well as people’s social lives. It’s also intended that the project will result in a permanent exhibition within Mayfair.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nInterested?

She revisits the issue of housing discrimination and the ground breaking protests of the young mothers of the Homeless Citizens League, and learns first-hand about the organisation of the march from the so-called “Protestor Number One”. She hears from Bernadette McAliskey about how the march turned her into a lifelong campaigner, as well as from those who took part in a counter protest.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nUsing a blend of highly personal interviews and archive audio, Lynette asks what spurred them to take to the streets in pursuit of civil rights, whether or not they achieved their aims – and at what cost.

This is the biggest thing I’ve ever had to look forward to and hopefully something that will genuinely change my life, for the better, forever. I’m particularly excited to become a DWU Tiger and play for the school soccer team - I think that’ll be cool and something so different to teams at home.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n“I decided to apply for Study USA because I’d heard that it was an amazing experience and I know without a doubt the programme will have a positive impact on my future -  It’ll make me look more attractive to employers showing I took the chance to go and grow as person both independently and communicatively.\n\n“Hopefully it will also broaden my own personal network which in itself is an intangible asset to any business employing me as they gain potential connections in America, should they be necessary.”\n\nThe British Council, which is the UK’s international organisation for educational opportunities and cultural relations, manages Study USA on behalf of the Department for the Economy. Since its formation in 1994, the initiative has sent over 2000 students from Northern Ireland to all four corners of the United States where they have successfully completed a year studying\n\nJonathan Stewart, Director, British Council Northern Ireland, added: “I am confident that the students departing for the US this year will be great ambassadors for Northern Ireland and will help to further important long-term links and connections. A recent report published by the British Council has highlighted that the relationship between the US and the UK is driven as much by cultural factors, as political with programmes such as Study USA supporting these links and strengthening them for the future. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“Through Study USA, students will have the opportunity to not only enhance their employability skills but also develop intercultural skills, which will help them to prepare to work in a global economy. We wish them success, and trust that new connections and friendships will be developed in the year ahead.”\n\nStudy USA is just one of many international opportunities available through British Council Northern Ireland.

In addition, the company has faced an extremely challenging retail trading environment reflecting weak consumer confidence and reduced consumer spending. These factors have had a significant adverse impact on Homebase’s trading position.\n\n“After a comprehensive review, Homebase has concluded that its current store portfolio mix is no longer viable. Rental costs associated with stores are unsustainable and many stores are loss making.\n\n“The CVA enables Homebase to make essential changes to its store portfolio, reducing its cost base and providing a stable platform on which to continue its turnaround.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“Under the terms of the CVA proposal, all creditors receive a better outcome than any other likely alternative.\n\n“It is anticipated that 42 stores will close during late 2018 and early 2019.\n\n“The proposed changes to the store portfolio will regrettably mean redundancies from those stores earmarked for closure. The process is expected to lead to a reduction of up to 1,500 roles, although every effort will be made to redeploy team members within the business where possible.\n\n“All stores in the UK and the Republic of Ireland will remain open for business as usual and this process will have no impact on customer purchases, outstanding orders or any product or service guarantees.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“The creditors will vote on the CVA on 31 August 2018.”\n\nDamian McGloughlin, CEO of Homebase, said: “Launching a CVA has been a difficult decision and one that we have not taken lightly. Homebase has been one of the most recognisable retail brands for almost 40 years, but the reality is we need to continue to take decisive action to address the underperformance of the business and deal with the burden of our cost base, as well as to protect thousands of jobs. The CVA is therefore an essential measure for the business to take and will enable us to refocus our operations and rebuild our offer for the years ahead.”\n\nStephanie Pollitt, Assistant Director of Real Estate Policy, British Property Federation (BPF), said: “These situations are never easy as property owners need to take into consideration the impact on their investors, including those protecting their investors’ pensioners’ savings, as they vote on the CVA proposal. Homebase and Alvarez \u0026amp Marsal have, however, demonstrated best practice, engaging with the BPF in the process and therefore ensuring property owners’ interests have been properly taken into account. Ultimately, it will be for individual property owners to decide how they will vote on the CVA, but the proposal has sought to find a solution that provides a sustainable future for Homebase.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8478809.1533901811!/image/image.jpg","title":"was speeding in hurry to get to work","story":"\nIn a hurry to get to work a 49-year-old man broke the speed limit in his van, Craigavon Magistrates Court heard last Wednesday.\n\n                \nAsen Asenov, whose address was given as Flush Place, Lurgan, was fined £75 for excess speed on May 30 this year.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThree penalty points were also imposed and he was ordered to pay a £15 offender’s levy.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nFor having a defective light on his vehicle he was fined £50.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nThe court heard that at 11.30pm on the Portadown Road in Lurgan police saw a Mercedes Sprinter van with a Bulgarian registration travelling in excess of the 40mph speed limit.\n\nThey followed the van for a distance of over half a mile and to keep up they were doing between 60mph and 65mph.\n\nPolice also noticed that the right rear side light was not working.\n\nThrough an interpreter Asenov said he had been rushing that day.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nHe explained that he had already received a warning about his job and he didn’t want to be late.

As the years went on they became less and less involved, but they were still on our board of directors for a number of years.\n“As time went on we became more secular and we didn’t have that relationship with the Church anymore. But we’re still very grateful for them for setting it up and for identifying the huge need for counselling and support in this area, I suppose because Ardoyne was hit so hard by the conflict.\n“The Passionists worked tirelessly, and I remember sister Kathleen constantly bringing funders into a room and saying ‘You have got to fund this.’ Because there was very little funding in the early days she worked extremely hard to get us established, funded and working.\n“We have grown considerably, and we now deliver about 12,000 to 13,000 sessions a year to about 2,500 people. As well as operating from this site, we also work in a range of local schools and community venues. If someone wants to be seen or needs help somewhere else we can do that too.”\nNorma continued: “Our clinical practice is excellent. We have just been awarded BACP [British Association for Counselling and Psycho-therapy) accreditation for our services. Most counsellors are individually accredited by the BACP, but very few organisations carry the accreditation. We are one of only six in Northern Ireland to be accredited this year.”\nWith a degree in psychology and a professional background in both therapy and conflict resolution, Norma said that New Life felt like a place where she could make a difference.\nIn the past, she has worked at New Life as a sessional counsellor and her experience in play therapy has allowed her to help children and adults alike. New Life is one of the few organisations in the north that offers child and family therapy – services that Norma insists are vital for North Belfast.\n“I think in this area you are working with generations of people who have had things really difficult,” she said.\n“Personal safety was at risk throughout the Troubles and the area has grown up with generations and generations of high unemployment. Poverty, conflict and trauma have a huge impact, not just psychologically, but on a cellular level it impacts people physically.\n“Poverty also has a huge impact on children’s education and a number of different things, so we’re working with multiple issues for a lot of families and they are trying really hard to overcome those things. It has a massive impact on people’s self-esteem, so it’s almost a vicious cycle.”\nShe continued: “There is a lot of research that has come out recently into adverse experience in childhood and the impact that those have on physical health, mental health, and educational achievement. The aim is to try to tackle things early. I think that’s why we believe that child therapy is so important, because you’ve got to be working with children from an early age to begin to address their issues early on.\n“If you don’t catch certain things in childhood, sometimes you’re working with very difficult teenage years because it’s harder to intervene. Sometimes those teenagers will come back as adults and they will feel like they are ready to tackle the issue at that stage.\n“At any stage in life it’s encouraging to know that anything can be repaired. Our brains are wonderful organs and in many ways they have a great plasticity so you can address those issues, you just have to be motivated and have the right motivator to identify what that change might look like.\n“Not everybody needs counselling, sometimes a friend or a colleague or anyone you can connect with can transform things for you. Talking to anybody helps you and can help you, but counselling gives a framework and a focus for those who need it.\n“If you can catch people before they hit the crisis it’s much better. When you’re in a crisis your ability to think clearly, to support yourself or to act lessens, so it’s much harder to activate the changes you need. If you can get into counselling when you’re not in crisis then you’ll be able to change things more quickly, but counselling can really help. It helps you to clear your mind enough to realise what needs to happen next to take you out of crisis.”\nWhile New Life has come on leaps and bounds since it began, offering thousands of yearly counselling sessions, Norma admits that mental health charities, including New Life, need more support to effectively help those in need of support.\n“I think pre-Troubles we didn’t have nearly enough mental health services,” she said.\n“People were just in lockdown mode, they were just surviving. Since the peace process there has been a lot more services established. I think mental health services are still desperately underfunded in Northern Ireland given what we have come through.\n“For our service we have a six-month waiting list and sometimes it can go up to a year. If you need a counsellor it’s way too long to wait, but we don’t have the funding to deliver any more sessions than we currently do.\n“I think there needs to be more accessible services. People get fed up sitting on a waiting list and a lot can happen in that space of time.”\nShe concluded: “If you do need someone to talk to it’s important that you come forward. Young people, especially can access our services quite quickly so we would really encourage them to come forward.”\nIf you think you might benefit from talking to New Life, call 90 391630.\n"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37215278.ece/3d20d/AUTOCROP/w300square/img-2692_orig.jpg","title":"belfast pride parade","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

There will also be shops and food and drink options on the site, which has been renamed \u0027The Sixth\u0027 in a reference to Belfast\u0027s  evening edition, \"the sixth late Tele\".\n\nWork is due to begin by the end of the year if the plans get the go-ahead.\n\nStephen Surphlis of Bel Tel LLP said: \"Offices and workspace are evolving and UK and international companies are looking to Belfast and the wealth of talent we have on tap from our universities and within our professional, creative and technology sectors.\n\n\"These firms are placing a premium on employee satisfaction and are seeking working environments that facilitate team interaction, innovation and creativity. \n\n\"Our plans for The Sixth emphasise quality, heritage-led design that makes a contribution to both user wellbeing, and the fabric of our city.\"\n\nArchitecture firm Allford Hall Monaghan Morris (AHMM), winner of the 2015 RIBA Stirling Prize for its work on Burntwood School in London, has been enlisted to work on the scheme.\n\nPaul Monaghan, founding director of AHMM, said: \"The Sixth is a bold project, focused on the experience of its users and mindful of the site\u0027s landmark status and importance as part of Belfast\u0027s built heritage. We have taken cues from the surrounding buildings and the city\u0027s lost Victorian arcades, and will restore features removed or lost from the original listed building.\n\n\"For example, we\u0027re planning to reinstate the building\u0027s main access onto Royal Avenue and reintroduce dormer windows removed from the original roofline.\n\n\"New features such as the roof-top running track, roof-top terraces and break-out spaces complement the building\u0027s focus on the user.\n\n\"A new public atrium space serves as walkway through the building, which alongside a range of ground floor retail and food and beverage offers will enliven the street level space around Royal Avenue and Donegall Street.\n\n\"The Sixth will contribute to the rapid regeneration of the area and with its close proximity to Ulster University, it will be at the centre of an emerging creative district serving the education, culture, media and technology sectors.\"\n\nCouncillor Aileen Graham, deputy chair of Belfast City Council\u0027s City growth and regeneration committee, said: \"The partnership is pleased to have submitted its full planning application for The Sixth. \n\n\"We\u0027ve made a commitment in the Belfast Agenda to growing our city\u0027s economy and positioning the city to compete internationally. Quality, innovative workspaces like The Sixth will attract the high-value jobs necessary to grow our economy and help our people reach their full potential. \n\n\"Not only will The Sixth boost the city centre\u0027s vibrancy as part of an emerging creative district, it\u0027s going to breathe new life into one of Belfast\u0027s most loved and iconic buildings.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"a level results boys outperform girls for top grades for first time in northern ireland","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

However, in a second clip, taken outside the airport, Novo is seen approaching the man and asking him why he “disrespected” him, saying he had done nothing to deserve the abuse and that he “was not scared of him”.\n\nLast night the Celtic fan said he wanted to apologise unreservedly to Novo for his “indefensible behaviour”. He said: “I had been over to watch football and had returned on the same day and I was the worse for drink. That is not an excuse but it is true. I’ve let myself down.\n\n“Since the incident went viral, I’ve had an insight into the effects of abusive behaviour. Threats have been made online and I can appreciate how upsetting the original incident was.”      \n\nNovo, posting on social media later that evening, said: “Arrived at Belfast International Airport tonight to support the local community for all sides of the divide.\n\n“As soon as I walked out of the airport I was surrounded by Celtic supporters that hurled abuse and tried to attack myself. I would like thank genuine Celtic supporter.”\n\nNovo was left fighting for his life in January after suffering a heart attack while starring in a Rangers legends tournament in Germany.

So I am over the moon.”\n\nHazelwood\u0027s acting vice-principal Gary Brennan said: \"I was delighted with the result. You see the students this morning, you see how happy they are. That’s all down to the work of the students, their parents and carers, and the college and our teachers, that everybody has put in. It is days like today that you absolutely love.\"\n\nAt Ashfield Girls\u0027 High School, Emily Greer achieved three Bs and will be going to Queen\u0027s to study marine biology.\n\n\"All the diving stuff sounds quite cool, but I just want to work with animals.

Zeplin, Blaise, Maverick, Ace and Jupiter on the other hand, were some of the less common names given to baby boys in 2017.\n\nIn terms of girls’ names, Grace has once again taken second place in the top 10, whilst Olivia comes a close third. Roise climbed the greatest number of places to join the top 100 names for girls, moving from rank 151 in 2016 to rank 90 in 2017. Isla and Charlotte both joined the girl’s top 10 for the first time in 2017.\n\nCompared with boys, a greater number of girls’ names have held the top spot since the reporting of first names began in 1997.  Some of the less common names given to baby girls in 2017 were Lady, Divine, Rio, Star and Vogue.\n\nAlmost 1,000 new baby names were registered in 2017 that had not been registered since the reporting of baby names began in 1997. Blockbuster movies, popular television series, current celebrities and memorable places continue to appear to be influencing factors for some parents.\n\nOf those registrations containing details of the father, almost 500 boys were given their fathers’ name as a first or additional name.  However fewer than 100 girls were given their mothers’ name.\n\nMore generally, the statistics published today highlight that the popularity of baby names in 2017 (both boys and girls) varied, for example, by District Council, age of mother, country of birth of mother and month of registration.\n\nTop 10 baby names in Northern Ireland, 2017\n\n\nBoys:\n\n\nJames  – 243 Babies\n\nJack  – 226 Babies\n\nNoah  –  189 Babies\n\nCharlie  – 185 Babies\n\nJacob  – 180 Babies\n\nHarry  – 169 Babies\n\nThomas  – 158 Babies\n\nDaniel  – 147 Babies\n\nOliver  – 143 Babies\n\nLogan  – 125 Babies\n\nGirls:\n\nEmily  – 216 Babies\n\nGrace – 202 Babies\n\nOlivia  – 179 Babies\n\nIsla  – 153 Babies\n\nAnna  – 142 Babies\n\nSophie  – 132 Babies\n\nElla  – 128 Babies\n\nAmelia  – 127 Babies\n\nCharlotte  – 124 Babies\n\nSophia  – 121 Babies\n"},{"url":null,"title":"stormont department working to address belfast gridlock after bus lane changes","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

But outbreaks have occurred at Muslim, Christian and Hindu religious events, at sports events, and at large-scale open air festivals in the past. \n\n\"When they occur, they most commonly involve vaccine preventable diseases such as measles, influenza, mumps and hepatitis. \n\n\"Other reported outbreaks are mainly of gastrointestinal infections caused by a number of different pathogens,\" Dr O\u0027Riordan said. \n\n\"Given the nature of this historic papal visit, a large number of young children and elderly visitors are expected to attend the final mass, including many international visitors. \n\n\"In the current context of ongoing measles spread in Europe, it is highly advisable that all attendants, especially young children, ensure that they are up to date with their vaccinations,\" Dr O\u0027Riordan added.\n\nAccording to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the measles outbreak is continuing across Europe, with more than 30 deaths reported in 2018. \n\nThe Papal visit is expected to attract 15,000 overseas visitors and the final mass will draw a crowd of around 500,000 people. \n\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) defines a mass gathering as \"a planned or spontaneous event where the number of people attending is sufficient to strain the planning and response resources of the community, state or nation hosting the event\". \n\nDr Jack Lambert, specialist in infectious diseases at the Mater Hospital, Dublin, said the reality is people risk contracting diseases during mass gatherings.\n\n\"There are real outbreaks, as with the Hajj in Saudi Arabia in the past… but most of the population in Ireland are protected against diseases like measles,\" Dr Lambert said. \"But, in saying that, if one person with measles is walking around 15,000 people and coughs, some individuals might get it.\" \n\nHe cautioned, however, that while infectious disease spread is not impossible during the Papal visit, it is \"highly unlikely\" and the risk is \"minimal\". \n\nPope Francis will attend the \u0027Festival of Families\u0027 in Croke Park on August 25 and a final mass in Phoenix Park on August 26. A significant policing plan has been put in place, along with major traffic diversions.\n\nIrish Rail will provide capacity for up to 250,000 journeys for those travelling to the Papal Mass.

This harsh reality. \n\n\n\nDear students, your A-levels aren’t so important. What matters most is that your parents have a house in London or the south-east in which to put you up during internships and then to use as equity for you to buy your first home. Don’t change your grades! Change your parents.\n— Aditya Chakrabortty (@chakrabortty) \nAugust 16, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\n8.

I was just really excited as I have wanted a wooden rollercoaster at Alton Towers for a while. I was here on its opening day and one of the first people to ride it, and just loved every minute of the ride.”\n\nAlton Towers says a record for solving a Rubik’s cube in the quickest time on a rollercoaster doesn’t currently exist, but Jacob’s effort has been submitted to Guinness World Records for authentication.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"calls baby boxes given parents every new born derry","story":"\nBaby boxes containing all the infant essentials should be given to the parents of every new born, says a Derry MLA.\n\nSDLP MLA Mark H Durkan said it is one year since the Scottish Government started giving out the boxes, which double as a crib, and they have been heralded as a great success.\n\nThe idea was first introduced in Finland in the 1930s and is credited with significantly reducing infant mortality rates.\n\nThe initiative has also already been piloted in Wexford General Hospital and University Maternity Hospital Limerick.\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push(function () {            var mapMpu = googletag.sizeMapping()                .addSize([100, 100], [[320, 50], [300, 250]])                .addSize([980, 200], [[300, 250]])                .build()            slot = googletag.defineSlot(\u0027/29764278/derrynow_article_mpu\u0027, [1, 1], \u0027div-gpt-mid-article\u0027)                .defineSizeMapping(mapMpu)                                                            .setTargeting(\u0027section\u0027, \u0027news\u0027)                                            .setTargeting(\u0027page\u0027, \u0027article\u0027)                                            .setTargeting(\u0027id\u0027, \u0027242521\u0027)                                                    .addService(googletag.pubads())            googletag.display(\u0027div-gpt-mid-article\u0027)            googletag.pubads().refresh([slot])        })    \n\n\n\nThe starter kits for babies included babygrows, a blanket, outdoor clothing, bathing products, nappies and bedding.
