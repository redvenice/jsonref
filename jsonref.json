This culture of easy come, easy go is likely to end in tears and it\u0027s going to hurt ordinary people who are normally quite responsible but are being enticed into getting into debt.\u0027 The NatWest figures, which are based on internal research to help with setting up its new digital bank Bo, are echoed elsewhere.A study by debt charity Stepchange last week found that the number of middle-class families at risk of falling into debt is spiralling. It helped 9,510 people with net incomes above £40,000 last year, a rise of almost a fifth compared with three years ago.         The research into 750,000 NatWest customers reveals that the problem is not just confined to low-earning households who genuinely struggle to get by, but is also common among the better-off (file photo)Their average credit card debt was £21,091, while their average total outstanding debt, excluding mortgages, came to £38,164.And the Money Charity said the average credit card debt per UK household was £2,609 in July this year. Last year research from the charity found that almost ten million households have no savings at all and 19.3million (71 per cent) have less than £10,000 in savings.Sue Anderson, of Stepchange, said: \u0027The most common reason for problem debt is that people have experienced some kind of income shock – a sudden reduction in earnings, or reduced hours for example.\u0027At times like these, many people would expect savings to be a lifeline, but current economic pressures can make it difficult to save. Instead, iniduals have to live hand to mouth.\u0027She added that having even £1,000 of savings can almost halve the risk of experiencing problem debt. \u0027Our research shows that, if every household had £1,000 of accessible savings, 500,000 fewer households would face problem debt,\u0027 she said.\u0027The Government needs to do more to encourage iniduals to build up their financial resilience.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Exclusive new details Jennifer Lawrence Cooke Maroneys marathon wedding weekend","story":"Rule in red like Sienna wearing Johanna OrtizSold out!

One large crowd blocked a road close to the Spanish government headquarters in Catalonia, throwing dozens of sacks of rubbish in front of stationary police vans. Pictured: A Catalan independence flag rises above a crowd in Barcelona         Acting Interior Minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska told reporters earlier in the day that 288 police officers had been hurt in the clashes, 267 police vehicles damaged and 194 people arrested. Several hundred protesters were also hurt\u0027People can\u0027t take their children to school, they can\u0027t open their businesses,\u0027 Barcelona-born Rivera said. \u0027We need a Spanish government that protects the weak.\u0027City officials estimate that the rioting has caused 2.5 million euros (£2.2 million) worth of damage.\u0027There are more of us Catalan Spaniards than separatists.

People often laugh in awkwarduncomfortable situations. Aberdeen University do better.\u0027Speaking to student newspaper The Tab, a representative for CASE said: \u0027Our pamphlet on Sex and Support provides a list of various non-verbal and verbal signs of possible consent as well as a corresponding list of signs of no consent.         The leaflet (pictured) caused fury at Aberdeen University with its list of verbal and non-verbal signs of consent \u0027We are aware that some people have reacted to the inclusion of non-verbal signs of possible consent as it is not consent without verbal cues. \u0027We completely agree with this. The key word for this section of our pamphlet would be possible, as non-verbal signs in particular cannot be used to determine consent and are often misunderstood.\u0027Smiling and laughing are especially often seen as consent to proceed with various sexual activities without that being the case. However, listening only for verbal signs of possible consent without paying attention to a person\u0027s non-verbal cues is not a good way to determine consent either.\u0027For example, a person could say yes due to feeling pressured, and in a situation like that the verbal cue could be present alongside non-verbal signs of no consent, such as avoiding eye contact, withdrawing from touch etc.\u0027The purpose of having these lists included in the pamphlet was to alert people to these various signs so that they have a more thorough understanding of consent communication.\u0027We believed that the overall work of our group and the inclusion of the phrase silence is not consent elsewhere on the pamphlet was enough to ensure that our message was unambiguous.\u0027Evidently this was not the case and we regret to have made anyone think that non-verbal signs of possible consent can replace explicit verbal consent.\u0027We will be working on making this clear for future iterations of our pamphlet and will take the current one out of circulation.\u0027An Aberdeen University spokesman added: \u0027The leaflet referenced was produced by a student group and the University had no input into its content.\u0027We take the welfare of all our students and staff extremely seriously and the University constantly reviews and makes enhancements to its support services.\u0027The University hosted two sessions on sexual consent in conjunction with local group Choices Aberdeen as part of student orientation this September and we will look to enhance this next year.\u0027As part of our commitment to empowering our community and enhancing the wellbeing of our members on and off campus, we launched the Report Support service in February which provides a \u0027one-stop shop\u0027 that signposts users to all relevant support services and to report any incidents of sexual violence or harassment.\u0027 CASE Aberdeen say ‘smiling’ and ‘laughing’ are signs of possible sexual consent"},{"url":null,"title":"First pictures grid dad held six kids locked secluded Dutch farmhouse","story":"Share this article Van Dorsten, who once belonged to the Moonie cult, is accused of holding six of his children – two males and four females aged 18 to 25 – at the farmhouse in Ruinerwold, 80 miles north of Amsterdam, with no contact with the outside world for almost a decade.Their secret life was exposed last week when the oldest son Jan van Dorsten, 25, went in to Café De Kastelein ordered five pints of Amstel and told bar owner Chris Westerbeek the incredible story of how the family had been living.         Police were called when Jan Zon van Dorsten (above) told a bar owner how they were livingMr Westerbrook called the police and officers searching the property found five of Jan\u0027s siblings as well as his father in bed, having suffered a stroke.An Austrian carpenter called Josef Brunner, 58, who paid the rent for the property, has been charged in a Dutch court with illegal imprisonment.Gerrit van Dorsten has been detained on suspicion of deprivation of liberty, harming the health of others and money laundering after tens of thousands of euros in cash were discovered at the property.He appeared before an examining magistrate today, making his first court appearance. He was remanded in custody for 14 days and refused bail. Brunner and van Dorsten apparently met through the Unification Church – a bizarre South Korean sect whose members are called \u0027Moonies\u0027 – in the late 1990s.Brunner, a carpenter who lived in a caravan behind his workshop some four miles from the farmhouse, was regularly seen visiting the property in his Volvo where he dropped off groceries and supplies to the family, according to neighbours.          As well as videos of himself working out, van Dorsten, with a white beard, also rambled on about whether NASA had plans to build a farm on Mars and ranted about North Korea         Van Dorsten is being quizzed by police trying to piece together what happened to the family              Here is van Dorsten (left) tending to the garden at the farmhouse in Ruinerwold.

Police vans outside the property bring in equipment for their investigation         He wrote : \u0027Unless our spiritual self and physical self are united, we cannot relate well to the spirit world and we cannot help to unite the spiritual and the physical world.\u0027The self-proclaimed gardening expert, regularly slammed North Korea\u0027s leadership, its society and its food growing methods adding: \u0027Agriculture the North Korean way.

The majority of the 28 Tory \u0027Spartans\u0027 who rejected Theresa May\u0027s deal have come on board, but a hardcore of half a dozen have yet to declare. A significant number of Labour MPs have also backed the deal, with more expected to follow. Mr Johnson\u0027s former allies in the DUP are implacably opposed. But many of the 21 MPs who lost the Tory whip last month after voting to block a No Deal Brexit have suggested they will fall into line in a vote on the actual deal - including Sir Oliver. This is despite 10 of them voting for the former Cabinet minister\u0027s wrecking amendment on Saturday. It will be very tight.What if the vote fails?Downing Street has indicated the PM will press ahead with legislation tomorrow to pass his new deal into law via the WAB.In theory, the Government could then repeal the need for a \u0027Meaningful Vote\u0027, by overturning an amendment introduced by ex-attorney general Dominic Grieve earlier this year. But it is high risk because if the legislation is voted down then it cannot be brought back without starting a new session of Parliament.It is also open to attempts to amend it with various add-ons. Jeremy Corbyn and other opposition parties could yet join forces to wreck the process, with \u0027guerrilla warfare\u0027 plots to trigger votes on a second referendum and the whole UK staying in the EU customs union.Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth denied Labour is trying to \u0027wreck\u0027 the Prime Minister\u0027s Brexit deal.He accused the Government of taking an \u0027utterly irresponsible approach\u0027 by asking MPs to vote on legislation they are yet to see.He told Today: \u0027We are not attempting to wreck it, we are attempting to safeguard the British economy, safeguard jobs and safeguard public services.\u0027That is our responsible approach as an opposition.\u0027We believe that the responsible way in which to leave the European Union is in a customs union-arrangement and that in turn should be put to the British people so they can have a say on this.\u0027Trade Secretary Liz Truss today warned that undermining the painstakingly-assembled deal with Brussels would put the country \u0027back to square one\u0027.Can Johnson win in time for October 31?The PM has told EU leaders that the Withdrawal Agreement Bill, which ratifies the deal, could be passed in as little as six days. But opponents will try to amend the timetable tomorrow to delay final sign off until well after October 31 in the hope this persuades the EU to grant another delay.The Prime Minister will publish the WAB today under the assumption that the Commons starts voting on it tomorrow.The premier\u0027s chances of getting the implementation law through in time for the UK to leave the EU by his \u0027do or die\u0027 date of October 31 are likely to hang on whether he can get support for a \u0027programme motion\u0027 - which will dictate a tight schedule for the stages in Parliament.Usually it takes weeks for pieces of legislation to go through but ministers are desperate to get the deal into law ahead of a planned EU summit next Monday on whether to have another Brexit delay.Mr Johnson is planning late-night sittings in the Commons and a special weekend session in the Lords as he attempts to pass the Withdrawal Agreement Bill.Could MPs force a second referendum?Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer said it was \u0027inevitable\u0027 that Labour and others would try to force a vote this week to require the Government to call a referendum on the deal. The DUP has indicated it could now back a new referendum. But two dozen Labour MPs oppose the idea, meaning a vote would be tight. No 10 has said it will not hold a second referendum. If so, the stand-off could only be resolved in an election.If the PM\u0027s deal is voted down could No Deal still happen?If it lost the WAB vote the Government would focus on preparing for a No Deal Brexit on October 31. Remainers hope the EU leaders would act to prevent No Deal by offering a delay of at least three months. Mr Johnson would then push hard to force an election.Several EU leaders, including Emmanuel Macron and Leo Varadkar, are frustrated. The French President has even hinted he could veto another extension.If this happened, and MPs had rejected the PM\u0027s deal, then the UK would leave without a deal on October 31.   "},{"url":null,"title":"Free climber 20 locked six months scaling Shard","story":"Share this article Mr Forsdick submitted that King-Thompson \u0027knew of The Shard injunction\u0027 and \u0027consciously and deliberately did what he knew was a breach of it, knowing that that could result in imprisonment\u0027.In his written case, Mr Forsdick said that King-Thompson \u0027recognised that the climb was illegal\u0027 by using the hashtag \u0027rooftopillegal\u0027 when posting a video of the climb on Instagram.He added that the climb was a \u0027highly dangerous trespass, both to him and potentially to members of the emergency services and the public if he had fallen\u0027.

Disputes with Italian museums – and a general resistance to letting the gallery that happens to own the Mona Lisa appoint itself Leonardo Central – mean there are fewer paintings here than in the blockbuster show at the National Gallery in 2011. But you soon realise this is no mistake – or it’s a very happy one. This is the great Leonardo show of our time because it reveals his true identity as a scientist, inventor, engineer and infinitely curious observer of life. It’s a blockbuster with a brain that reveals why we will never tire of the genius who dreamed of our future, five centuries ago.The greatest Leonardo work that France owns is not the Mona Lisa. It’s a medium-sized notebook known as Manuscrit B that’s been lent by the Institut de France. It is displayed open on a double spread that had me inwardly whooping with delight. You go, Leonardo! On the left hand page, there’s a design for a helicopter that works like a giant screw drilling upward through the air, drawn precisely in firm ink lines. Above is a rapid sketch of what looks like a flying saucer but is an armoured car that he suggested might be fun for jousting.Leonardo’s windmill-punk visions get even bolder on the opposite page. A man is standing in the wooden cockpit of a flying machine as he uses his own physical strength to flap its wings up and down. While the chopper and the tank were daring fancies, this scheme for an ornithopter – a flying machine that imitates a bird – would obsess him all his life, becoming increasingly plausible as he improved it. That’s why this manuscript is more important than the Mona Lisa. It shows Leonardo, soon after he moved from his native Tuscany to the powerful military-industrial state Milan, turning from a painter into a polymath.This is the Leonardo da Vinci the Louvre lets you see in an exhibition that lays out exactly why it’s worth making a fuss over his quincentenary. Leonardo died in France in 1519, after being invited to spend his last years as court artist to King Francis I. His biographer Giorgio Vasari said Francis treasured him as a “philosopher” and loved to talk to him about ideas – in other words, Leonardo was valued for his mind. Yet half a millennium later, the art world promotes a much more conservative image of this “old master”. The Da Vinci story of our time is Salvator Mundi, a forgotten picture of Christ holding a translucent orb that was restored, reattributed to Leonardo and auctioned for £342,182,751, setting a record as the most expensive artwork auctioned. Is it the real thing? And is it in this exhibition, as planned? We’ll get to that. But one thing needs saying: it does an injustice to Leonardo to fetishise his paintings when he was the first conceptual artist.As I waited for the press view I visited the heart of darkness of today’s painterly Leonardo cult: the Louvre’s permanent display of the Mona Lisa in its glass-fronted case. The hubbub to see it is so unmanageable that you are allowed what feels like only 30 seconds before being moved on. This is not long enough for anyone to engage with art. It’s timed for selfies, not the brain. This madness is where a conservative reverence for Leonardo’s shiny, finished oil paintings has led us.The Louvre has redeemed itself with an exhibition that captures the real flow of Leonardo’s mind. Here are pages of the Codex Atlanticus from Milan’s Ambrosian Library that show him exploring geometry and optics, drawings of the moon and mountains, and always, his fascination with flight. Leonardo was convinced humans could learn how to fly like birds. Some of the most stunning drawings in the exhibition observe in astounding detail how birds use updrafts and prevailing winds to enhance their flight. His reasoning is that if a flying machine can work with air currents, it too might get the lift it needs.Leonardo is a movie camera, too. Drawings of babies playing with cats made in Florence around 1480 show motion as a blur of positions sketched as life happens – a multiple image unique to Leonardo. It also appears in his drawings of Saint Sebastian and a fight between a knight and dragon. These early sketches show him trying to draw as fast as life and somehow put the full complex flow of reality on paper. This becomes a delirious overload in his designs for The Adoration of the Magi, a painting he was never to finish. Here he tries to use vanishing-point perspective to contain an infinite vision of battles, buildings and nature receding into ambiguous chaos. It’s dazzling. This boy from the Tuscan countryside had a brain that couldn’t stop. He would spend the rest of his life applying it in a singlehanded attempt to understand nature and invent the technological age.Surrounded by images as exciting as these, it is hard to care about Salvator Mundi. The owner of the world’s most expensive painting has not lent it, after all – which can only add to growing speculation about its dodgy provenance. But there’s worse news: another version, credited to Leonardo’s studio, is here along with designs from the Royal Collection. They look so staid and rigid compared with the restless, dynamic images of laughing babies, flying birds and rearing horses that fill this show. You realise it doesn’t much matter how genuine Salvator Mundi is because it was his dullest design.These relics are shown in the same climactic space where the Louvre’s St John the Baptist looks out of the dark with a fleshy intensity that’s both spiritual and erotic. On the opposite wall hangs The Virgin and Child With Saint Anne, Leonardo’s last and greatest surviving painting. To add to this sublime gathering, the National Gallery has lent its full-size drawing of the Virgin and Saint Anne with Christ and Saint John the Baptist – known as The Burlington House Cartoon. These marvels push at the boundaries of the known. The Virgin and Saint Anne achieves what Leonardo tried to do when he was young: contain the world in a painting. In the foreground, rocks and strata reveal his interest in geology. In the distance, blue Alps melt into a crystal atmosphere. It’s like a model planet Earth. At the centre of it all are women and children – a mother, her son, his grandmother. Why are there two maternal presences? Freud observed that Leonardo had two mothers – his birth mother Caterina, a country girl his father never married, and his stepmother Albiera di Giovanni Amadori. Is Leonardo remembering his childhood in his last and most satisfying painting? In The Burlington House Cartoon, we see those two mothers but the older woman has a face as deathly as a hanged man’s. It is a vision of hope and despair.But the Louvre can’t completely ignore Lisa. You can put on a virtual reality headset to meet the “real” Lisa del Giocondo, the Florentine silk merchant’s wife who posed for Leonardo in 1503. It’s freaky to encounter in full VR an actor whose face has been digitally altered to give her the Mona Lisa’s long fine nose and deep-set eyes.What a gimmick – and how Leonardo da Vinci would have loved it. He’d probably prefer this techno Mona Lisa to his own painting. One thread that connects his experiments is the belief that the mathematics of perspective can mirror and make worlds. Virtual reality’s illusion of solidity is a Renaissance dream come true. It’s impossible to exhaust Leonardo’s science-fiction prophecies, and this exhibition joyously opens his notebooks to us all."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f993462b70f2b01c76d2ec963a973fd0046816af/0_249_3158_1894/master/3158.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=10de717b10286e41f14d988940a52245","title":"newly discovered rembrandt uk first time ashmolean exhibition","story":"Let the Little Children Come to Me will star in Ashmolean show on artist’s early yearsA newly discovered biblical painting by Rembrandt is to be shown in the UK for the first time as part of the largest ever exhibition exploring his early years.The Ashmolean Museum in Oxford said on Monday it had secured the loan of Let the Little Children Come to Me, which was offered at a German auction in 2014 listed as “Netherlandish School”.It was purchased for €1.5m by a Dutch art dealer, Jan Six, backed by an investor. Six was convinced it was genuine Rembrandt largely because the artist appeared to be there in plain sight.The lively young man included at the top of the picture, cheekily above everyone else including Christ, is a self-portrait familiar from a number of Rembrandt’s etchings and history paintings.Now properly attributed to Rembrandt, the painting will be shown at the Ashmolean next year as part of an exhibition examining the artist’s first decade, 1624-34.It charts a meteoric rise and will feature 34 paintings by Rembrandt, 10 by his most important contemporaries and around 90 drawings and prints.Christopher Brown, a former Ashmolean director and co-curator of the show, said the first 10 years were central to any understanding of Rembrandt’s career as a whole.“In his early paintings, prints and drawings we find a young artist exploring his own style, grappling with technical difficulties and making mistakes. But his progress is remarkable and the works in this exhibition demonstrate an amazing development from year to year,” Brown said.The show will include Rembrandt’s earliest known work, The Spectacles Seller (1624-25), which is crude, clumsy and garishly coloured and suggests an artist struggling with the medium.How is it, the exhibition will ask, that only six years later Rembrandt produced an acknowledged masterpiece, Jeremiah Lamenting the Destruction of Jerusalem (1630)?The Rembrandt show was announced on Monday as part of a 2020 exhibition programme that will also include a celebration of Tokyo and 400 years of Japanese art, photography and design, to coincide with the 2020 Olympics.• Young Rembrandt is at the Ashmolean from 27 February to 7 June."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/421269fdd65377816fad748cd67264f344742d91/361_0_5429_3259/master/5429.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3ea985b43d2bffb8ffc85867a962fb16","title":"halloween doggy style the tompkins square parade in pictures","story":"Canine companions in cute and creative costumes took part in the annual Halloween dog parade in Manhattan "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c961f1685747c05376d4ca2243a1343c30380aa/0_0_1000_1333/master/1000.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=398dc90076ac9674699491a9258b2932 720w","title":"silver skaters the rise of skateboarding in california in pictures","story":"Legendary skateboard photographer Hugh Holland has published a book of previously unseen images capturing the growth of the skateboarding craze in California.

This means that about one in every 14 adults in America is a millionaire.Anthony Shorrocks, an economist and author of the report, said: “With almost two decades of data at our disposal, we can see two distinct phases of wealth growth. The century began with a ‘golden age’ of robust and inclusive wealth creation. But wealth growth collapsed during the financial crisis and growth never recovered to the level experienced earlier. “There was a seismic change at the time of the financial crisis, when China and other emerging market economies took over as the engine of wealth creation. Meanwhile, the United States has maintained an astonishing 11 year spell of increasing wealth per adult.”The report found that millennials - those born between the early 1980s and the mid 1990s - are the least well off age group. The report says: “Not only were they hit at a vulnerable age by the global financial crisis, its associated recession and the poor job prospects that followed but they have also been disadvantaged in many countries by high house prices, low interest rates and low incomes, making it difficult for them to buy property or accumulate wealth. Studies in several countries have indicated that the millennials can expect to be worse off than their parents.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e03fd7a38d4b0626ed2f851da4a06c49635a3dcf/0_0_3455_2074/master/3455.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0614103cbfce6233c17d31593d9a3045","title":"noxious fumes force planes emergency landing in dublin","story":"Two staff members and a passenger taken to hospital after flight from London to Philadelphia was ertedA passenger plane flying from London to the US was forced to make an emergency landing in Dublin after noxious fumes left two crew members temporarily unconscious.Paramedics who met American Airlines flight 729 after it touched down in the Irish capital took the staff and a passenger to hospital for evaluation, according to the airline.The plane, flying from Heathrow to Philadelphia, landed safely at Dublin at 1.15pm local time after the incident, which was said to have been caused by a cleaning product left behind on the aircraft which had spilled.“We require paramedics to come onboard the airplane and render immediate assistance,” one of the plane’s pilots reportedly told Dublin air traffic control in a recording posted online by the Airport Webcams account on Twitter.“Two of our … cabin staff have actually lost consciousness, I think they’re back to consciousness now and there are general complaints about burning eyes and other problems with mucus in the nose, skin problems,” the pilot said.According to the pilot, the incident had been caused by “a cleaning product used at Heathrow” that had been left behind in a toilet, then spilled and seeped into the carpet. A statement by American Airlines said the spill had happened in the galley.One passenger aboard the flight said that some people were feeling unwell before the flight even departed Heathrow. He said the plane was delayed by an hour as a result.“The plane still took off and then an announcement later told us, about one hour into flying time, that some crew members are feeling ill along with a few passengers and we have to make an emergency landing in Dublin,” the passenger, who was not named, told Mail Online.Philip Ott posted a picture on Twitter of passengers from the flight standing around in Dublin airport after the flight landed.In a separate tweet he added: “I’m standing around with dozens of other people in Dublin’s airport because our flight from Heathrow to Philadelphia was forced to land because you all failed to clean up your cleaning chemicals and people were feeling ill.“Why are you so bad at this?”A Dublin airport spokesperson said: “As per standard operating procedures there was a full turnout of Dublin Airport’s emergency fire services.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b43a7d0fa640b3756d915d2c68c58e8298a2f417/0_138_4288_2573/master/4288.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0a19436fb58a872b1d91041ea32325f0","title":"no deal brexit food shortages are you a small business owner whos stockpiling","story":"We’d like to hear from small business owners about how they are preparing ahead of BrexitWith the cut-off date to secure a Brexit deal looming, the likely outcome of negotiations this week is still uncertain.

This little girl grew up thinking that, with passion and hard work, she could change the world. Then, one day, she met a prince and fell in love and everyone thought she would live happily ever after. Especially her.It was hard not to watch Sunday’s ITV interview with Meghan – or the Duchess of Sussex in our fairytale version – and not feel sympathy for a woman who has found herself alone with a new baby in an alien environment. After all, the year after having your first child is a challenge for most mothers: soreness, lack of sleep, the loss of self the list goes on. Most of us keep it together by bingeing on crap TV while reminding ourselves – as we slap frozen cabbage leaves on our boobs – just how lucky we are. And we are, of course, so, so lucky. Then a friend or colleague stops and asks how we are – you know, how we really are – and we have a bit of a weep and apologise for being self-pitying and ridiculous and carry on.It felt like that moment when Tom Bradby, the TV presenter and friend of the princes, asked Meghan how she was towards the end of a documentary about their royal tour of Africa and she welled up. “Thank you for asking. Not many people have asked if I’m OK, but it’s a very real thing to be going through behind the scenes.”Some people will sneer and suggest that a wealthy woman should not complain, especially when she is on tour in a continent where, in some areas, there is such poverty. But do we want to live in a world in which pain is a competition and the royal family is just a TV drama, not a group of real people?And for those who think her friends-with-the-Clooneys life must be perfect, she suggests few people can understand what it is really like “behind the scenes”.Whatever the rights and wrongs of the monarchy (as far as I am concerned, they could all move abroad and just leave us the Queen), it does occasionally highlight truths about the world.Most women who go through personal upheaval, family upset and childbirth are not followed by cameras and accused of jeopardising the future of the monarchy. Within hours of the interview airing, MailOnline had warned that Meghan was “damaging” the royal family. Some of the criticism of Meghan has been outright racist and sexist – smacking of distaste for the black woman who dares to email her highly paid staff out of hours.Told by “British friends” that the tabloids would “destroy her life”, Meghan blamed herself for being “naive” and “American” and not believing them. “I know that I never thought that this would be easy, but I thought it would be fair.”I have no sympathy for the view that a journalist should not be allowed to ask the royal family (or anyone else) whatever questions they like, as long as they are fair. But paying the person who walked her dog, pestering family members who didn’t bother coming to her wedding – is that fair?The issue of fairness has become a legal one. The couple have launched an unprecedented legal challenge against the three biggest British newspaper groups – DMG Media, News Group and the Mirror group – and Sunday night’s interview suggests this row will not end soon.Stretched across this cultural and social chasm, Meghan admitted that she “really tried to adopt this British sensibility of a stiff upper lip” but, deep down, she thinks that “what that does, internally, is probably really damaging”. She does not want to ignore the publication of a private letter. And, really, why should she?In his own interview, it was clearer than ever that Harry will not let this lie. In fact, he would rather take on his own family than let it do so.The relationship between the press and the royal family is often called a game, one that Harry’s mother, Diana, “knew how to play”. But it is not a game to him – he considers it the thing that killed his mother.No one ever gets a fairytale ending, but the tone of this story really needs to change."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/86cde60972ec27bbc9f8d7848a81ed1a00827a47/0_229_2752_1651/master/2752.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a88f323a96422b90626cb606762ef50e","title":"syria arab spring egypt sudan syria","story":"Dissent in the face of rampant corruption is no longer being dampened by pointing to the failures of the Arab springThere is a bogeyman that haunts the Arab world. Its spectre looms large and sinister over Arab politics. Its arrival is threatened, like a curse, as a warning by parents to precocious children when they misbehave. Its name is Syria. A suppurating wound that will not heal, the Syrian civil war continues to bleed lives, and draw in neighbours and allies involved in their own proxy battles.Just as it seems one front is closed, a twist restarts hostilities – the latest involving a capricious US president and an insecure Turkish one, with the Kurds in northern Syria bearing the brunt. An abrupt American withdrawal paved the way for yet another conflagration, yet another power calculus – as Bashar al-Assad extends support to the Kurds – and yet another lease of life for Islamic State. More than 100,000 people are on the move in northern Syria. And at least 750 people with suspected links to Isis have reportedly broken out of a camp in north-east Syria, raising the possibility of a new shot in the arm for the terror group. When, earlier this year, the Sudanese revolution began to gather steam, the Syria bogeyman was predictably summoned. It didn’t help that Sudan had received Syrian refugees. Their increasing number in Sudan – a country more accustomed to sending refugees than receiving them – was its own live warning. Is this what you want? The Syrian scenario was presented as an inevitability: this is what happens when people demand the overthrow of their leaders, when the natural order is challenged. Things certainly will fall apart.The supposed Syria menace is backed by a cast of similar characters in the region. Libya, riven by factional fighting and only last month the scene of US airstrikes against militants, is also often mentioned with a shudder, a “there but for the grace of God go we” if we continue challenging the status quo. Then there is Egypt, a country that, in its regression after the Arab spring, is now such a closely patrolled security state that the number of political prisoners in its jails is literally inestimable.Each day seems to bring a fresh hell across these three countries, a rebuke to all those who think that in the Arab world there is another way of politics that doesn’t involve strongmen. You hear this logic internalised and vocalised by Arabs themselves in a sort of exceptionalist self-flattery. It’s just our temperament, you see, we need leaders to manage our strong and stubborn character. It doesn’t seem to be working. This is the year that the spirit of protest in the region was proven to only have been dormant, rather than extinct. The Sudanese overthrew Omar al-Bashir in a grand majestic revolution, where a revolutionary body of thousands pitted itself against the formidable machinery of the state’s military dictatorship. Despite the country already suffering from ethnic and tribal ides so pronounced that an entire murderous paramilitary complex arose from its fissures, despite there being a history of bloody conflict that pointed more towards a Syria- or Libya-style disintegration, this was not enough to chill the need for change. Even after hundreds were slaughtered and the internet shut down, protesters still coordinated and found their way on to the streets of Sudanese cities.Not even in Egypt has the protest movement died. If there is any indication that scorched earth suppression is inevitably a short-term solution, it is that protests are happening again. In September the first significant protests since former army chief Abdel Fatah al-Sisi came to power. In this country a tweet or a Facebook post can result in a jail sentence and the security stakes are so high that a protester will leave home expecting not to return. Many did not. Estimates are that about 2,000 were detained.Last week it was Lebanon, where protests have erupted across several cities. There is now a similar kaleidoscope of images that plays out across Arab cities where lines have been drawn between the people and the government. Sometimes one has to squint to work out whether the throng of bodies and mobile phone screen constellations is in Beirut, Cairo or Khartoum. Both in Lebanon and in Sudan, one scene repeated itself with uncanny similarity protesters addressing the security forces, the army and the police, rebuking them for not crossing the lines to join their comrades. In Sudan many did cross those lines, joining the revolutionaries against their own employers.That defection, or demand for defection, lies at the heart of the resurgence of political protest. If the Arab revolutions that grew eight years ago were about removing lone dictators, the current wave is about removing an establishment that for too long has drained resources. Egypt’s protests were triggered by a former government contractor who exposed Sisi’s epic profligacy. In Sudan, food prices and a scarcity of basics pushed the middle class over the edge while those in power luxuriated in their spoils. In Lebanon, a tax on WhatsApp voice calls tipped those fed up with economic mismanagement over the edge. Last month it emerged that the prime minister, Saad Hariri, had gifted $16m of his own money to a South African model six years ago.Dissent will not be chilled by pointing to the failures of the Arab spring. Warnings to remain quiet, pointing to the pitfalls of taking action, are increasingly going unheeded. Arabs are beginning to realise that to excessively fear what may happen in the future is to be tricked into submitting to an unacceptable present."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/25a1647ae7fc8dbcdfa96692bac18cf4eadd1602/0_131_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7b9ffd8f34cad3c1e3fd9a2f43e8a051","title":"uk press brexit media","story":"A healthy democracy depends on an active citizenry which is able to make informed decisions. That is, in theory, the role of the fourth estate: to help the public understand their own society and the world around them, to hold the powerful to account and to challenge myths and expose uncomfortable truths. You do not need to be a long-time critic of the British media ecosystem to see those basic functions are not being satisfied when it comes to Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal. Rather than detailed scrutiny being applied to the most important single political event since the second world war, it has been reduced to a spectacle, a pantomime, all framed on the government’s own terms.Just as Theresa May’s “no deal is better than a bad deal” bluster collided with political reality, Johnson’s demagoguery was followed by his own capitulation to the EU’s red lines. Yet his embrace of a deal first offered by the EU 19 months ago – and rejected by May as something “no UK prime minister could ever agree to” – has been presented as an against-all-odds, critic-defying triumph. The consequences of a deal predicted to strip the country of £130bn worth of growth – making the average Briton £2,250 a year poorer over the next 15 years – should be front and centre in the debate. Yet they are not. Johnson declared he would rather “die in a ditch” than request an extension: but request one he did, and die in a ditch he did not. Yet most of the British press focused on the theatrics of the prime minister not signing a letter and sending a copy of the Benn act instead. This is, of course, exactly the framing the Tories desire.There are excellent, perceptive political reporters. But too much political reporting trivialises coverage of political events, reducing them to a crude soap opera, centred on personalities and tittle tattle, rather than explaining competing ideas or worldviews, or placing them in a broader social context. Drama takes priority over substance.It does help, of course, that the Tories have the active, partisan editorial support of most of the British press, while sympathisers with the main opposition party are a few isolated, mostly freelance iniduals within the media ecosystem. One independent-minded political reporter declared: “You have to give credit to No 10 for knowing exactly how to play the UK press.” But in truth, press outlets are not victims of their own gullibility, manipulated by clever mini-Machiavellis in No 10: they are willing and amenable. Their coverage is skewed to the political interests of the moguls who own the newspapers who – quite rationally – fear their economic position will be damaged by the far-reaching reforms that would be implemented after a Tory defeat.There is another factor that afflicts not just the print press, but the self-declared impartial broadcast media, too. Stenography – simply regurgitating the lines of the Tory political operation without analysis or context – is not political journalism. But Johnson’s operation is offering access in exchange for just such pliant reporting. Those reporters who have attempted to genuinely scrutinise Johnson have found themselves frozen out. There is nothing new about this: it’s how Alastair Campbell managed the media at New Labour’s peak.That’s not the end of the story, of course. While Labour’s ability to push back at a Tory-crafted narrative is made extremely difficult by a press overwhelmingly sympathetic to the government’s position – as the commentator Matt Zarb-Cousin puts it, being a Tory is playing politics on “easy” mode – Labour’s communication strategy is currently sorely lacking. The party has acted as though it was blindsided by Johnson’s assumption of power, and it still lacks clear messages that cut through.Yet Labour needing to swiftly get its act together does not absolve the media of its systemic failings. On the brink of the most dramatic political upheaval for generations, we deserve thorough, intense scrutiny and a government held mercilessly to account. We are being denied that and – with it – a properly functioning democracy, too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90865a23f80ffbb299caab1f179ee8860dea6efa/79_231_5063_3038/master/5063.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c904ff5d77f58719d1f222a8b7dd9ed7","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of trick","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘trick’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘trick’.Share your photos of what trick means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 23 October at 10am.

Following discussions among editors about how we could change the language we use in our coverage of environmental issues, our attention then turned to images. We have been working across the organisation to better understand how we aim to visually communicate the impact the climate emergency is having across the world.Our goal is to provide guidelines for anyone working with images at the . We are also asking the agencies and photographers we work with to provide images that are appropriate to the changing narrative.The concern over how best to depict the climate emergency led us to seek advice from the research organisation Climate Visuals, who have found that “images that define climate change shape the way it is understood and acted upon”.It was important to address our own use of images and understand the processes that lead to image selection for our environmental and weather stories. When given a story, a picture editor or subeditor may have a short time to choose an image from our database, which is why the availability and prominence of climate crisis photography is a key element in the process. It can also be difficult for photographers to capture images that reflect global heating, weather patterns and wildlife extinction, especially when trying to depict what cannot always be seen.We know, from years of experience, that people love polar bears and pandas, so it is easy to see how these appealing creatures have become the emblems for the topics of endangered species and what we previously termed as global warming. Often, when signalling environmental stories to our readers, selecting an image of a polar bear on melting ice has been the obvious – though not necessarily appropriate – choice. These images tell a certain story about the climate crisis but can seem remote and abstract – a problem that is not a human one, nor one that is particularly urgent.So it made sense when we heard that research conducted by the team at Climate Visuals has shown that people respond to human pictures and stories. Images that show emotion and pictures of real situations make the story relevant to the inidual. Rather than choosing, say, an image of a smoke stack pumping out pollution or a forest on fire, such as this: … we should consider showing the direct impact of environmental issues on people’s daily lives as well as trying to indicate the scale of the impact, such as these:In the UK, the weather is a national preoccupation and as such a subject of tradition for British newspapers. People enjoying a sunny holiday weekend, or a fresh fall of snow at home or abroad can deliver some delightful and beautiful images:But as we have reported, the science tells us a much more sinister story of regular heatwaves and unseasonal weather being a defining indicator of the climate crisis. So, although scenes of children playing in fountains and everyone racing to the beach can be uplifting and irresistible, we have to be mindful of the tone of our journalism. This summer, the British media published dramatic headlines issuing climate warnings and covered in detail the negative impact of the crisis, but the images were typically of people taking pleasure in the environment. The contradiction in messaging, between the headlines and imagery, can undermine the effect of the reporting and how we perceive the risks.In June this year we published a picture gallery on the heatwave across Europe. In its original form, this was of a lighter tone, but we felt on reflection this was wrong and disregarded the current context, so we amended the publication to include images that covered a range of human experience of the extraordinary temperatures.The photographer Brook Mitchell made an impactful series about the drought in Australia affecting families in New South Wales, which we published as a photo essay in July. The environmental scenes of the scorched landscape were striking, as were the suffering animals, but the portraits and stories of the people battling the catastrophe really anchored the piece and drove the level of engagement.It is an example of how, as picture editors and photographers, we are having to think again about finding the right focus. Many of the impacts to communities, bioersity, agriculture, water and food supply represent the escalating crisis our planet faces, yet visually they can be far more challenging to depict. We need new imagery for new narratives. This can be challenging in a fast-paced newsroom but it is important to be nuanced and creative with search terms to unearth photography beyond the usual keywords of climate change, heatwave and floods.As our stories make a journey from their initial point of publication through the various networks of social media we also have to be mindful of how the image is connected to the headline. We have to consider that the two must work together to allow the reader to make a broad sense of the article often simply at a glance. Relatable images that are not overly abstract have become a good choice.However, in its simplest form, getting the emotional tone of imagery in line with the issue is critical, rather than the visual overload of society universally having fun in the sun. We hope that if we keep having these conversations, we will be able to have even more of an impact with our climate coverage, and others will follow suit.If you are a journalist, a photographer or work with other news organisations depicting the climate crisis, please contact membershipeditorial@ to join our conversation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6aa18d2a32dce609d4eb036565424fe22b3b0a8f/0_78_4256_2553/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=75e821f5ce30ae6fcdc4646cb012cff8","title":"guardian climate pledge 2019 air travel advice","story":" travel editor Andy Pietrasik explains how a flexitarian approach can enable us to enjoy exploring the planet without increasing our carbon footprintWe recently published a guide to Helsinki in which we gave details of how to get there and back without flying. In the comments below the article, a reader wrote: “I think you have to concede that it’s a little disingenuous to pretend that people will be going to Helsinki by train and boat … very few will be willing to allocate six days of the holiday just for the journey. It’s simply not a practical suggestion.”The rise of low-cost flights over the past 20 or so years means we have become so accustomed to flying everywhere for our holidays and short breaks that the idea of taking so long over a journey has become unthinkable. We expect to maximise our time in a location and minimise our time in transit. But maybe that has to change.Another reader put this into context: “In the 70s it was customary to travel around Europe by train (or bus, or hitchhiking). I’ve travelled between Finland and the UK many times by train, and it is quite a pleasant experience.” Travel can have a magical transformation on iniduals and communities. We hope through our pages to encourage people to explore the world, to discover, first-hand, locations they may only have read about in history books or novels to open themselves up to new experiences and tastes to meet people with different ideas and perspectives to try out alternative lifestyles to immerse themselves in beautiful landscapes to have fun. Our writers tap into the joy of new experiences, whether it’s the exhilaration of swimming through a city, as our writer did in Basel, or the thrill of tackling Ireland’s Big Five adventures. And we know that our readers are adventurous and well-travelled because every week we feature their tips from around the world. But we also recognise the need to help tackle the climate emergency by reducing the number of flights we all take. Environment journalist, John Vidal explored the dilemma that “people like me, cursed with loving travel” now face, when he reported on the Swedish concept of “flygskam”, or fly shame. And he referred to people applying the idea of the “flexitarian” diet – where they cut back on their meat consumption dramatically but not completely – to flying.The majority of locations we feature in the ’s weekly travel section do not rely on flying to get there, with most easily accessible by train and public transport. These range from Greek island-hopping odysseys to cycling holidays through Europe and city breaks served by train or ferries.Our Local’s Guide series is one of the most popular and widely read features because each one is written by a local resident in the spirit of showing a visitor around their favourite affordable haunts, rather than the big-ticket attractions. Food and drink is probably the easiest way into another culture, and there can be no better recommendation for somewhere to eat and drink than from someone who lives there. We’ve been tapping in to local people’s tips since Twitter started more than 10 years ago, and have found bloggers all around Europe to compile lists of their favourite cheap places to eat and drink.On our website, we have a long list of guides to alternative cities – Łódź, Genoa and Utrecht, Berne, Burgos and Bristol, for example – rather than perennial hotspots affected by overtourism, such as Barcelona, Amsterdam and Venice.One of the benefits of flying less, of course, is the opportunity it affords to explore the rich and varied landscapes of our own islands. Over the summer, we ran a popular series of stories called car-free coast, in which the writer Phoebe Taplin explored the British seaside on foot and by bus. An avowed public transport enthusiast and non-flyer, Dixe Wills, shared 20 of his favourite campsites accessible by train and bus. And Kevin Rushby set out on a UK expedition to less-visited locations that would have been impossible or prohibitively expensive to get to by car.We still occasionally run stories on long-haul destinations when there is an important initiative or project that benefits the environment or local community, such as the development of community-led tourism startups in Chilean Patagonia following the launch of new national parks in the world’s most ambitious rewilding project.Tourism accounts for one in 10 of the world’s jobs and is vital to some destinations. Kevin Rushby, our principal travel writer, explains: “All around the world, people in disadvantaged communities have been working to set up projects that rely on tourism, and so flying. I’ve met hunters who’ve become wildlife guides, fishermen who are now ing instructors, farmers who get cash for showing visitors their land and life. In Kenya the great migration route has been saved by Maasai herders clubbing their land together as conservancies rather than selling to hoteliers and intensive farming interests. Those conservancies are reliant on overseas visitors who pay to see wildlife.”The Travel website now also features a carbon calculator, and we have written about various carbon offsetting schemes – which allow people to balance out their carbon footprints by investing in clean energy projects such as solar or windfarms. Our travel section is printed and distributed in the UK but our articles online are read by a worldwide audience, so in some instances readers do not need to fly to the places we are writing about.John Vidal’s article about reducing the number of flights we take quotes Kevin Anderson, professor of energy and climate change at the Tyndall centre in Manchester: “I don’t have a no-fly policy, but rather a fly-less one … If we are going to fly, it should be for truly extraordinary and important reasons. Otherwise we shouldn’t go, or we should take a slower form of travel and arrange for a longer visit.”Returning to that article on Helsinki, there’s another Scandinavian lifestyle trend that has emerged as a positive counterbalance to “flygskam”, and that is “tagskryt” (train brag). Another reader of the article captured its spirit perfectly in the comment: “The journey is the holiday. Just think of all the places you see along the way.”Because, of course, we’ve been doing long-distance slow travel since the 1970s, as was pointed out. That was the decade when the Interrail scheme was launched. And, as Wills said when he revisited the Interrail experience this summer after a 30-year gap: “How many of us have cherished memories of zipping inexpensively across Europe – delving into new and thrillingly esoteric cultures, befriending the locals, mangling their language beyond all comprehension, and enjoying all manner of mind-broadening episodes.”That is the spirit of adventure we hope you take away with you after reading the travel section."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/399dfc115cc0d5d9d9d140ac885cc05cfca93401/0_97_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=44fcc539d5e386fbff529197dec69b4c","title":"naming and shaming the polluters","story":"Global environment editor Jonathan Watts discusses the ’s investigation into the fossil fuel industry, and the structures that need to change to halt the climate emergency.

As the square piece of block pad glided to the floor like a dead moth, I recognised it as a recipe for a ring cake written out for me not long after coming to Italy, about 14 years ago. I remember making the recipe several times, before using it as a bookmark that was left at page 76. What I don’t remember or recognise is whose neat writing it is.My memory lapse is frustrating. Sharing a recipe is an open-handed act, one made even more tangible if the person sharing has taken the time physically to write it out, maybe with notes, which is a small labour in these copy-and-photograph times.Even if the recipe given is never made, I want to remember where the Post-It lemon pudding or back-of-envelope braised chicken came from. And if the recipe becomes part of my cooking life, it is no different from a recipe from a book or famous chef: it absolutely must have that person attached to it, like a name tag sewn into a collar. Then, every time the recipe is made, the person and your relationship to them, whatever it was, is remembered. Even if it means you have to relive a tired exchange about authenticity, or be reminded that Mario subsequently left his wife for his secretary, recipes have names: Mario’s red-wine risotto my elegant neighbour Vera’s creme caramel Lise from Bavaria’s liver and apple.Shared name-tagged recipes are also a way of marking time. Years ago, I organised my mum’s loose recipes, gluing the loose-leaf pages and lips of envelopes into a book and noting where and who they came from. The book is now a sort of collective biography of our family – a strained one.Freda Coleman was a neighbour in the late 1970s, and her marmalade cake marks the margarine years. It was, and is, an ideal cake for a family with congenital marmalade dependency: a rich pound batter into which you stir orange marmalade, which bakes into a bitter-sweet cake. The icing is as good as the cake, which you zig- zag over the top where it then sets into a hard lattice that can be pulled off, although hopefully not from the entire cake as once happened.Part of the pleasure of a cake is the smell as it bakes: marmalade bakes into an almost toffee-like sweetness, and hopefully a bit of peel at the bottom of the cake catches and the smell of that, like dark treacle, assaults your senses.This is a cake of four equal parts, plus marmalade (thick-cut or thin, you decide). It is a preference based on habit, but a loaf tin (lined with parchment) seems the best tin for this cake.110g margarine or butter, at room temp110g sugar2 medium eggs110g self-raising flour4 heaped tbsp marmalade50g icing sugarHot waterBeat together the butter and sugar until soft and creamy. Beat in the eggs, followed by the flour, before stirring in three tablespoons of marmalade.Scape the mixture into a loaf tin lined with parchment. Bake at 170C (150C)335Fgas 3 for 35 to 40 minutes, or until the top of the cake is puffed up and cracked, and a strand of spaghetti comes out clean.Leave to cool for 30 minutes, then lift the cake from the tin.To make the glaze, loosen the remaining tablespoon of marmalade with a little hot water, then brush the cake.Make a thick icing by mixing the icing sugar with just a little water, and zig-zag it over the cake, letting it dribble down the sides."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/76b4ca24a8ad97f332e3e09a6b015d7e74409079/0_139_4158_2495/master/4158.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0b2b51c2cedeb37527ccc0ca864b487e","title":"womens football have you tried to set up a grassroots team","story":"We want to hear from those who have struggled to set up women’s football teams Women’s football has seen a score of successes in recent months: England’s top league went professional, the World Cup was watched by record-breaking audiences and crowds during the current FA cup are growing.The number of girls and women taking up the sport has also skyrocketed, with 605 new girls youth teams and 260 new adult female clubs registered to play this season.But some women have experienced difficulties in accessing facilities, such as pitches.

However the Football Association, which helped fund the research, said it would be setting up a task force to examine the potential causes more deeply.The family of Jeff Astle, who died in 2002 of what a coroner later said was an “industrial disease” partly caused by heading heavy footballs during his career, said they were stunned by the scale of the problem.“My overall feeling is that I am staggered even though my own research and instinct was always that there was a serious problem,” said Dawn Astle, Jeff’s daughter, who has been contacted by more than 400 families of players with dementia. “There will be no celebrations. We knew dad could not be the only one. We just wanted that question answered. We just wanted to see that football cared enough to find out the scale of the problem, to do the right thing and be there for these people when they need them most.“Whatever they do next, it must be across all parts of the game. And these players who have suffered dementia must not be a statistic – they must never be forgotten.”The FA confirmed that despite the groundbreaking study – which used recently digitised NHS Scotland data to compare the causes of death of 7,676 former male professional players who were born between 1900 and 1976 against those of more than 23,000 people from the general population -–there was not yet enough evidence to change any aspect of the game.“Our research shows that the number of arial challenges has already been reduced significantly over the years as we have changed to smaller pitches and possession-based football,” the FA’s chief executive Marc Bullingham explained. “However, as new evidence comes to light, we will continue to monitor and reassess all aspects of the game.”Data from Opta backs up Bullingham’s assessment, with high crosses in the Premier League having declined from a high of 38.2 in 2008-09 since Opta records began in 2006, to a low of 24.2 last season. However, the research is still bound to increase the pressure on the International Football Association board, which meets in Zurich on Wednesday, to consider implementing new rules that allow ‘concussion substitutes’ if a player gets assessed for a head injury during a match.Many former players and doctors have been critical of the slow response of the Professional Football Association to the problem of dementia over the past decade. However the PFA’s deputy chief executive Bobby Barnes said that the organisation now better understood the scale of the problem. He added that five members of the PFA had also agreed to donate their brains to medical science after they die.The Glasgow University study also found that former footballers were less likely to die of other common diseases, such as heart disease and some cancers, and lived on average 3 14 years longer. And Dr Carol Routledge, the director of research of the Alzheimer’s UK, said that the benefits of playing football outweighed the disadvantages.“Dementia is caused by complex brain diseases and our risk is influenced by our genes, lifestyle and health,” she added. “The best evidence suggests that good heart health is the best way to keep the brain healthy, so when played safely, a kick around with friends is still a great way to stay mentally and physically active.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2316c374cbb0d060bd2f18c20f048a442ff99e06/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=77e929d4a806b58127f2e606a8372c0a","title":"ligue 1 clubs experienced french managers nantes saint etienne toulouse lyon","story":"Claude Puel, Antoine Kombouaré, Rudi Garcia and Christian Gourcuff are all enjoying positive starts at their new clubsBy Adam White and Eric Devin for Get French Football NewsFour Ligue 1 clubs have changed managers since the start of August and all four of their appointments speak volumes about the emphasis being placed on veteran managers in France. Christian Gourcuff arrived at Nantes on the eve of the season and has guided them to second place in the table Claude Puel replaced Ghislain Printant at Saint-Étienne earlier this month Antoine Kombouaré took over from Alain Casanova at Toulouse during the international break and Rudi Garcia came in for Sylvinho at Lyon last week after the Brazilian went seven league games without a win.Results this weekend – although small in sample size – suggest that Saint-Étienne, Toulouse and Lyon may be rewarded for their decision to follow Nantes’ lead and prioritise experience in a league so noted for its young talents.Puel has rejigged Saint-Étienne’s tactics in his two league games so far – both of which have been won 1-0. Puel is playing three at the back he has brought young Arsenal loanee William Saliba back into the fold and he has dropped established players such as Mathieu Debuchy. The team has far more natural width and Denis Bouanga finally looks like he will live up to the potential he showed at Lorient three seasons ago. The wing-back has never been noted for his defensive discipline, but he has put in determined performances under Puel and he scored the only goal of the game – a 93rd-minute penalty – in a 1-0 win over Bordeaux on Sunday afternoon. Charles Abi’s pace in attack has also been key to Puel’s approach. As a whole, the team looks sound in defence and threatening on the counterattack – like they did under Gasset.Toulouse have also enjoyed a positive start under their new manager. Kombouaré made his name by achieving impressive results with clubs who had tight budgets – such as at Valenciennes, where he earned promotion and then improved the club’s position in all three of his seasons in Ligue 1. After being dismissed unfairly by PSG in 2011 – they were top of the table at the time but the new Qatari owners wanted a different approach – he has enjoyed some success and endured some disappointment. Things did not work out for him at Guingamp, but they are now on their third manager in four months, which suggests there was little he could have done there.Kombouaré began his new job at Toulouse with an impressive 2-1 win over Lille on Saturday. He set out the team in a 4-4-2 formation, with Max-Alain Gradel as a centre-forward and Mathieu Dossevi reinstalled on the right. Toulouse missed a penalty, struck the woodwork twice and were a force of nature on the flanks, overwhelming Lille’s full-backs and seemingly creating chances at will. This energy may not be sustainable, but Kombouaré’s willingness to attack opponents will go down well with fans who have not seen their team play on the front foot for some time.Unlike Puel and Kombouaré, Garcia did not kickstart his tenure at Lyon with a victory. His teams’s failure to score at home to Dijon – perhaps the poorest team in the league – will do little to win over critics of the appointment, but Lyon played well in the goalless draw. Houssem Aouar sparkled, playing with far more freedom than he had demonstrated under Sylvinho and looking more like the player who scored for France’s Under-21s against both Azerbaijan and Slovakia last week. Aouar’s display was a potent reminder that he – and not the injured Memphis Depay – should be the focal point for Lyon, something Sylvinho was slow to recognise.Had Dijon goalkeeper Alfred Gomis not been in such inspired form, Lyon would have found a winner – particularly in the second half. As this rate, they look likely to rise up the table under Garcia’s stewardship. The manager brought Maxwel Cornet in from the cold and he offered a reminder of his qualities – pace and an eagerness to involve his teammates. The young wide player offered the team more than Bertrand Traoré, who had been consistently preferred by Sylvinho.Cornet is inconsistent and he may not be the best option every week, but he looked motivated and eager to please. It seems as if Garcia will select players on merit and hunger, not only on their price tags and reputations, something that stymied his predecessor – another feather in the cap of the league’s clutch of veteran managers.• Reims look likely to challenge for Europe. The club pushed for a place in the top six last season only to fall short in the final weeks of the campaign, finishing four points off sixth-place Montpellier. They have produced more of the same this season, with the league’s best defence propelling David Guion’s side into the top three. Yunis Abdelhamid – who scored the only goal of the game as they beat Montpellier this weekend – remains a rock in defence and his young centre-back partner Axel Disasi has been equally impressive. The pair of them, as well as right-back Thomas Foket, have played every minute so far for Reims, allowing new goalkeeper Predrag Rajkovic the necessary time to adapt to Ligue 1.• Monaco were once again the entertainers in Sunday’s early evening match, with Wissam Ben Yedder’s brace and another goal and assist from Islam Slimani propelling the hosts to a 3-2 home win against Rennes. Kamil Glik was poor again for Monaco at the back, but Slimani and Ben Yedder are one of the best strikeforces in Europe. Ben Yedder is averaging a goal every 71 minutes. His brace against Rennes took him to eight league goals this season. Only Ciro Immobile (who has scored nine times for Lazio in Serie A this season) and Robert Lewandowksi (12 for Bayern Munich in the Bundesliga) have scored more in Europe’s top five leagues.• Finally, Ligue 1 again emphasised that – away from the title race – it may be Europe’s most competitive league. Eight sides in the bottom half recorded points this weekend, with Toulouse, Metz, Monaco and Saint-Étienne all beating teams who are above them in the table. Add to this a gritty victory for Brest at Angers and it’s clear that (almost) anything can happen on any given weekend in France.• This is an article from Get French Football News• Follow Eric Devin, Adam White and GFFN on Twitter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8afe98ad28de5be54f575158a66626a136e030a4/0_258_3872_2323/master/3872.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d5e024c3049d6aea705105a78eb6b9e3","title":"were not that sort of club yeovil in shock over racism claims","story":"Supporters back players’ decision to walk off and say they hope there are no long-term repercussionsLen Harrison, resplendent in a green and yellow Yeovil Town fleece and woolly hat, summed up his impression of the mood in the Somerset town: horrible. “We’re not that sort of football club,” said Harrison, who was born in Yeovil and moved back after some years away so he could live near the ground, Huish Park.He attends every game, home and away. “I’m disgusted by what happened and fear for the impact on the club and the town. It feels horrible.”Yeovil’s FA Cup qualifying round tie at Haringey Borough in north London on Saturday was abandoned in the 64th minute after home players were allegedly racially abused by travelling supporters. It is thought to be the first time a match at such a senior level has been abandoned in such circumstances. The FA has ordered the tie to be replayed on 29 October.Harrison, who was at the game, said he did not hear racist abuse and he still hopes it may be some sort of terrible misunderstanding. “I follow Yeovil all over the country,” he said. “It has been getting a bit hairy scary at games sometimes but racism is not acceptable. If anyone is found guilty they should be banned from football for life.”He backed the players for coming off the pitch. “They did the right thing. I just hope we get to replay the game. It’s a tiny, tiny minority of people who let everyone else down.”Gordon Spearing, 70, has been supporting Yeovil all his life and goes to all the home games. He had hoped Yeovil were embarking on another great run in the FA Cup, a competition they have graced over the years. Now it doesn’t feel quite as important.“I don’t know what’s going to happen to us. Yeovil is a family club. Everyone knows everybody else,” said Spearing. “I can’t believe this is happening to us.”“It’s a great shame,” said Pauline Lock, a town councillor and another loyal Yeovil Town fan. “Yeovil is a great football club. We can only hope there are no really long-term repercussions for the football club because a couple of people may or may not have said something inappropriate.”The abandonment came five days after England’s Euro 2020 qualifier in Bulgaria was marred by racist chanting by some home supporters. The Yeovil incident is a vivid reminder, if any were needed, that racism remains a live issue in the UK. The England players Raheem Sterling and Tyrone Mings both publicly backed the decision by the Haringey and Yeovil players to walk off.Speaking on the pitch after the game was called off, the Yeovil manager, Darren Sarll, explained why his players had supported the Haringey players when they made it clear they did not wish to play on.“No one should feel discriminated against when they come to play football,” he said. “The players and I decided we would make a stand together rather than apart and make that moment a bit stronger.”In Yeovil many people also supported the players. “There seems to have been some sort of solidarity. That’s something,” said Dave Jones, a shop worker and “part-time” Yeovil fan. “Maybe some good will come out of it.”But on Monday morning the mood around the club was sombre. A couple of players trotted out on to the artificial training pitch and went through stretching exercises. The sign on the club shop read “Open” but the door was locked. The club said in a statement that it would not comment further on the events of the weekend until the investigations were complete.John Clark, a Liberal Democrat councillor who represents the Yeovil Summerlands ward and has been a season ticket holder at Yeovil for 25 years, said he believed the club had worked hard to tackle racism. “I’m very surprised. It’s a good club – a friendly sort of place,” he said.Clark said he thought tension over Brexit could be having an impact. “I think you can detect a general deterioration in racist behaviour with Brexit nationally. Yeovil is no different to anywhere else.”On Monday two men aged 23 and 26 were arrested, one in Yeovil and the other in Chard, Somerset, on suspicion of racially aggravated common assault.

Across the city they knew that could mean only one thing: Real Sociedad had won again. A tradition from la Real’s old Atotxa ground, momentarily lost after they left in 1993 but recovered at Anoeta in 2009, a single firework is set off every time the visitors score and two are lit when la Real do. That way, the theory goes, in the boats on the Bay of Biscay they always knew how their team were getting on. And although moving to a ground on the other end of town means news no longer travels so far out to sea, and while one of these days VAR is going to ruin everything, Juan Iturralde still greets every goal by dashing through the gates and down the stairs rockets in hand, ready to tell the world.This Sunday, he made the run from stadium to forecourt four times in less than an hour, heading out into the rain. A single rocket alerted to Betis’s opening goal, scored by Loren Moron after 12 minutes before two announced the equaliser 10 minutes later, an own goal from Javi García – a moment’s doubt introduced, as always, by the brief gap between bangs. Then came four more, two marking Willian José’s thumping finish to put la Real into the lead on 38 and two more following Cristián Portu’s neat finish to a lovely move on 58. Outside, they might not have been able to see the game, but they knew: after losing at Sevilla and against Getafe, a 3-1 win had taken la Real into a Champions League place ahead of Atlético Madrid and Sevilla on goal difference, just two points behind Madrid and three below Barcelona.Only it’s not really enough just to know. It never is. As the former Real Sociedad manager Juanma Lillo, born and raised in Guipúzcoa, insists: “What enriches you is the game, not the result: the result is a piece of data. The birth rate goes up. Is that enriching? No. But the process that leads to that? Now, that’s enriching. Do you go unto a football stadium, in the last minute, look at the scoreboard and leave?” He’s right of course, and this time especially: it’s not enough just to know where la Real are, to ask if they can stay there, although they’re certainly good enough, or to note that seven of the men who played on Sunday came through the youth system and the entire starting XI cost less than Madrid spent buying Álvaro Odriozola off them the really good part is seeing them get there.Because here’s the thing: Real Sociedad are the best team in Spain right now. The best to watch, anyway. Maybe even the best-best. Sunday showed that.So, in fact, might their previous two games, despite losing: defeat in Sevilla was the most enjoyable match of the season so far, and even after going down to 10 men and letting in a last-minute winner against Getafe fans went home “moderately happy”, coach Imanol Alguacil said: there were, he insisted, “good vibrations”. The forward Portu said: “It’s hard to have no doubts when you lose, but we were the opposite: we didn’t have the slightest doubt,” and nor did supporters. They would be straight back for the next game a fortnight later, even on a day so miserable that the hilltop church at the Fundación Zorroaga that looks down on the ground couldn’t see it through the rain.“Everyone goes at full pelt,” Portu said. But it’s more than pace it’s precision too, the clarity of roles, the commitment to attack. “We all have a specific function and we all have to do something special to hurt the opponents,” Portu said. “And we have a lot of freedom to express ourselves.”This was an expression of who they are. To take just two players, the men in the middle: Mikel Merino produced a performance that was startlingly complete while just ahead of him – well, everywhere really – Martin Odegaard has probably been La Liga’s best midfielder. He loves a scooped pass, a little dink, and from one of the three he played, Oyarzabal cleverly laid it off to Portu for an impeccable third goal that was Portu’s first here.“It doesn’t get any better,” Portu said. But while this might have been la Real’s best performance, it wasn’t an isolated one. Sure, they lost against Athletic, but this is the team who took Atlético apart, took on Sevilla, the two trading blows, and were unlucky to lose against Getafe. A team who know exactly what they’re doing.“After Getafe people said that maybe if we had been more conservative we might have got the points but no, not here: you have to go for them. And we win a lot of games because of that ambition to get goals,” Portu said.Alguacil said: “The idea is clear: we will not wait, we won’t hedge our bets, we will always go for them, try to score as many goals as we can – and as long as I am sitting here, that will be the case.” And as long as he is sitting there, fans will sit in the stands.“Fun,” El País called them this morning. It’s a simple word, but it might be the most important, the one that best defines them. Maybe it’s because this is a young team – Merino and Le Normand were born in 1996 Zubeldía, Guevara and Oyarzabal in 97 Odegaard in 98 – but there’s something about the way they play that’s contagious. There’s dynamism, determination. “You should see us training if you did, you’d understand a lot,” Portu said. “Everyone’s full on. No one relaxes ever, not even on a Monday, when it’s our day off.”That’s not just duty. There has to be enjoyment and that relentlessness speaks of an enthusiasm, an urgency that’s clear in Real Sociedad’s play. Every time they’re knocked down, they’re up again taking the free-kick immediately every throw-in is taken fast, rushing to get every ball even the ball-boys move quick. It’s part of a plan of course, but it feels like at some level it’s simpler than that: as if they just want a game, like they can’t bare the idea of wasting a moment. If there’s one thing more fun than watching la Real, it’s playing for them – and that’s precisely what makes them so good to watch.“Being on the pitch is a joy,” Portu said. Being at the ground is a joy too, down where goals go in and fireworks go off. • There was no Bale, no Modric, no Kroos, and no Hazard, €268m worth of players missing, but the team Madrid put out there still cost €463.4m. The team playing against them cost €3m. Madrid’s players had 150 winner’s medals from major trophies between them Mallorca’s total amounted to one Turkish league and one Polish league. Only four of the 13 players who made an appearance had played in the first ision before. Six of them were playing in Spain’s regionalised, 80-team, anything-from-third-to-seventh-tier Second Division B 16 months ago. On the same day that Madrid were winning a third European Cup in a row. Their coach was there with them, just as Madrid’s was there with his team. You can see where this is going can’t you? At the start of the weekend, Real Madrid were top and Mallorca were in the relegation zone. By Saturday night, they weren’t. Mallorca, the first ision’s newcomers, and a team still based on the team that were in the Second Division B two years ago and the Second Division last year, with the same manager and the same players, only went and beat Real Madrid 1-0. Lago Junior got the goal.• Maybe it can work, after all? Maybe Barcelona do have a tridente after all? Griezmann, Messi and Suarez all scored in a 3-0 win at Eibar. Better still, they were all involved in the second and third goals together.• “What do you want me to do, throw myself off a 20-storey building? If they said me going would make the team win, I would be gone in a minute,” manager Mauricio Pellegrino said after his Leganés team lost the derby against Getafe, leaving them stuck on the bottom of the table without a win all season and him on the edge.• Atlético drew again and it’s not looking good. Especially up front, where Diego Costa and Álvaro Morata are the worst partnership since (inset your own punchline here). Simeone says that for all the excitement, he always knew this year would be hard, while others always doubted whether they would really be able to evolve into something a little more expansive. He thinks it’s simpler than that, and he’s not happy. After the 1-1 draw with Valencia, in which yet again they took a lead and then tried to hold on to it, Simeone warned that anyone who thinks it is easy, anyone who makes excuses, will fall out with him. “If you’re prepared to work, we’ll get along,” he said.• Hallelujah! And yes, the radio here really did play that when Luuk de Jong finally got his first Sevilla goal – in the 88th minute against Levante."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7b3c362fcdc574bb339b3cab41635c678aea29e/0_262_3744_2246/master/3744.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=33d73388359c6ea883930b7c92aa2937","title":"colleagues pay tribute to journalist and lioness deborah orr","story":"Columnist, editor and author hailed as ‘fearless’, after her death at the age of 57Friends and colleagues have responded to the death of the journalist and author Deborah Orr with a flood of tributes, describing the longtime  columnist as fearless, hilarious, and “a lioness in a world full of mogs”.Orr, who died from cancer at the age of 57, had a long and varied journalistic career at the , the Independent, and the i newspaper, among others. Her memoir about her upbringing in Scotland, Motherwell: a Girlhood, is due to be published next year.After the news of her death emerged, Jenny Lord, Orr’s publisher at W\u0026ampN, said in a statement: “To say we are devastated by the loss of this most remarkable of women – an intellectual force, a writer whose life and career has most certainly been cut short far too soon – is the wildest understatement.“Deborah was a writer we had all admired long before we became her publisher. With her unrivalled ability to stare at something (sometimes someone) right in the eye, she was an inspiration as well as an exceptional writer.”Lord said her editorial input on Orr’s forthcoming memoir centred largely around “asking her for more and more and more” and said it became clear that the work should be the first book of many.“Her voice, so sharp, deliciously spiky, crystalline and true. Her dialogue, so precise yet so easy,” said Lord. “If she was born to write this incredible memoir, this reckoning that it turned out was bubbling away under the surface for so long, she was surely also born to write fiction. It is grossly unfair for all of us that those future books will have to remain unwritten.”Suzanne Moore, Orr’s close friend and a  columnist, responded to expressions of sympathy about her death on Twitter by writing: “Thank you for the many kind messages and thoughts about my brilliant friend Deborah Orr. Never could get that woman off the dance floor … so many tales to tell. One day. Gather close, raise a glass and live and love as fiercely as she did. I loved her.”’s editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner, described her as “a brilliant, clever, funny journalist whose work was an important part of the  for many years”.“ Weekend magazine she edited in the 1990s was the home of brilliant writing and many of Britain’s best writers loved working for her,” she said.“As a columnist Deborah was knowledgable, insightful and uncompromising. She was greatly respected by many people, who will mourn her death, especially at such a young age.”Hadley Freeman, a  columnist and feature writer, said Orr was a “fearless and thoughtful, cutting and compassionate” writer. “As a friend, she was loyal, loving, fun, hilarious and kind,” she said.“The saddest news. Formidable, magnificent and funny as hell,” tweeted the journalist and broadcaster Mariella Frostrup. “She was a lioness in a world full of mogs.”Orr’s literary agent, Clare Conville, described her as a brilliantly acute journalist and a groundbreaking magazine editor. “When I first suggested she write a book 12 years ago she roared with laughter and replied, ‘I have nothing to say.’ Unusually for Deborah she proved herself wrong,” she said.“Her memoir when it finally came was astonishing. Painful and revealing in parts, joyful in others. A tour de force of the form itself. Even when mortally ill we discussed her next book, a novel. ‘It’s writing itself in my head.’”Conville added: “Her loss to her children Ivan and Luther, her stepchildren Alexis and Madeleine and her many friends who adored her is incalculable.”Simon Kelner, her editor at the Independent, remembered that Orr had once stunned the rightwing columnist Bruce Anderson by throwing a glass of red wine over him in retaliation after he proffered “some pretty extreme views” at a dinner.“We were all either outraged or embarrassed, but only Debs had the courage of her convictions,” he wrote.And he said: “Of the many adjectives that will be used about her, the one that most accurately describes her is fearless.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b68033b1576797acf24ba261d813679f171158d0/101_1298_3536_2122/master/3536.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0625ac80d34eca7f3979abe93e5c1007","title":"britten and russia review snape maltings aldeburgh shostakovich","story":"Snape Maltings, AldeburghBritten’s partnership with Shostakovich formed the backbone of the weekend, with solo cello suites played with almost casual brilliance by Alban Gerhardt In 1960, Benjamin Britten attended a concert in London given by the Leningrad Philharmonic, which included the UK premiere of Shostakovich’s First Cello Concerto, played by Mstislav Rostropovich.Shostakovich was there too, starting a friendship with Britten that lasted until his death, while the British composer went on to write five works for the cellist. Those pieces were the backbone of Aldeburgh Music’s Britten and Russia weekend, which ended with a re-creation of the historic 1960 concert, for which Jac van Steen conducted the BBC National Orchestra of Wales (BBCNOW).The most substantial of Britten’s pieces for Rostropovich was the Cello Symphony of 1964 and, with Alban Gerhardt as the soloist, it formed the centrepiece of the previous day’s programme from van Steen and BBCNOW, which also included Shostakovich’s 10th Symphony. If all Britten’s cello works are elusive in one way or another, then the Symphony seems the most mysterious of them – a concerto in all but name, in which the soloist seems engaged in a constant battle to establish his iniduality. It suits Gerhardt’s unshowy mastery perfectly.Earlier the same day, in a recital he’d shared with the impressive soprano Julia Sitkovetsky, who sang Prokofiev and Rachmaninov with pianist Roger Vignoles, Gerhardt had played the first and third of Britten’s solo cello Suites. If the first suite is quite clearly modelled on Bach’s six examples, then the third seems formally as original as the Cello Symphony, a series of nine movements that are effectively a giant set of variations on a collection of Russian themes. Gerhardt played both of them with an almost casual brilliance, wearing his virtuosity as lightly as anyone could it’s hard to think of a better cellist around today."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/358115b4caa3cc437a87d58f1ca1a3ff29a3a59b/1794_235_4127_2476/master/4127.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7fbfac40902f9475c275ec8c8cac5ec0","title":"cher o2 arena london review","story":"O2 Arena, LondonWith mechanical elephants, afro wigs and Elvis costumes, the glitz is dialled to Vegas proportions – and Cher is in superb voice throughoutFrom the stage of the O2 Arena, Cher is giving a speech. It started out as an anecdote about her 40th birthday, but that was quite a long time ago. Since then, it has deviated from its initial topic to encompass everything from Madonna to former chatshow host David Letterman, to the fact that American schools no longer teach pupils to write in cursive script, to Donald Trump (“an asshole”) and Boris Johnson (“not much better”), before reaching the subject of Cher’s age. “People applaud when I say I’m 73,” she notes, “and I wonder if it’s because I’m still alive. Anyway,” she concludes with a smile, “what’s your granny doing tonight?”To which the inevitable answer is: I’m not sure, but probably not standing on top of a giant mechanical elephant with illuminated tusks and eyes, singing a kind of AOR funk version of the ancient Sanskrit hymn the Gayatri Mantra, which is what Cher does next. The audience seems less startled by this turn of events than you might expect, but, in fairness, Cher has pulled the whole mechanical elephant with illuminated tusksAOR funk version of the Gayatri Mantra trick before, during what was supposed to be her farewell tour, 14 years ago, and something about the sheer force of the crowd’s devotion makes you suspect they were probably there then, too.Reprise or not, it constitutes one of the more baffling interludes in a show whose title gamely alludes to her now outdated retirement by borrowing a line from Abba: Here We Go Again. Abba feature heavily tonight: three covers that bump any number of her own hits from the setlist, not least Gypsies, Tramps and Thieves, testament to the critical and commercial success of her 2018 album Dancing Queen. In fact, it’s big on latter-day, knowingly camp Cher full stop. You get a lot more Abba and Euro-disco oompah in the vein of her 1998 smash Believe than you do of anything else, including 80s power-ballad-on-a-battleship Cher – her guitarist, who appears to have arrived direct from the American Rock’n’Roll Guitarist department of central casting, only really gets to let rip on the home run of If I Could Turn Back Time and I Found Someone – and 60s pop-harbinger-of-the-counterculture Cher, although she sings I Got You Babe and The Beat Goes On as duets with her late ex-husband Sonny Bono, his voice coming out of the PA and his face in black and white on the video screens.The setlist allows the glitzy spectacle to be turned up to Vegas show proportions. As you might expect, given the giant mechanical elephant with illuminated tusks, this is not a gig that prizes subtlety above all else: it’s the kind of gig during which music from the 70s is accompanied by dancers in afro wigs and satin flares, and music from the 60s is accompanied by ladies in black and white chequerboard mini-dresses, dancing in the way that ladies in black and white chequerboard minidresses always dance when required to signify the 60s.If you were minded to pick holes in the enterprise, you might alight on the fact that there are a lot of interludes when Cher isn’t on stage at all – whole songs, including Bang Bang, are shown on the video screens rather than performed live – although, in fairness, there’s always something to keep your eyes occupied when she isn’t, from aerialists doing their vertiginous thing to footage of Cher performing Heartbreak Hotel dressed as 1968 Comeback Elvis, complete with stick-on sideburns.And besides, it’s not the kind of enterprise you’re minded to pick holes in. When she is there, her voice sounds fantastic and she looks extraordinary the visual bombardment is relentless and wilfully, stupidly, charmingly OTT. She mentions she had doubts about touring again, before deciding, “Bitch, you’re 500. Do it now.” A conclusion only a curmudgeon would say was wrong."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d8242fcbc1eaa8162aafe43a01284fe38a98fc7d/0_585_1312_787/master/1312.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=906935dcd5d1b464ec90e3ada47918ae","title":"nick tosches the writer who made his prose rocknroll","story":"Tosches, who has died aged 69, wrote about everything from drugs to modern art – and his punkish music writing pricked the pretensions of his peersThe late Nick Tosches would doubtless have been furious to be described as a music journalist. He wrote far more about other subjects than he ever did about rock and pop: biographies of sportsmen and mafia-linked Italian bankers, books about drugs, books inspired by modern art, a slew of novels and poetry collections. Even when he reprinted his early work as a rock critic in the 2000 collection The Nick Tosches Reader, he was inclined to dismiss it as “making a mess on the page”.Indeed, there was a grain of truth in that description. Like the other pioneering rock critics who earned the soubriquet the Noise Boys – Richard Metzger and Lester Bangs – Tosches was clearly a lavishly gifted writer from the off, but his early work had as much to do with a particularly rabid form of iconoclasm as it did prose. Not for Tosches et al the scholarly approach of contemporaries Greil Marcus or the self-appointed “Dean of American Rock Critics” Robert Christgau (“a pompous asshole,” according to a drunken Bangs). The Noise Boys arrived during an era, not wildly unlike our own, where certain artists had become so revered as to be untouchable, apparently beyond criticism: never a healthy state of affairs, and one they set about trying to dismantle. For Lester Bangs, rock music had lost its way since the mid-60s: what was needed was a return to the basic values that informed garage rock. Tosches went even further. His real passion was 50s rock’n’roll, or better yet, the music that immediately pre-dated it, the stuff he covered in his books Country: The Twisted Roots of Rock’n’Roll, and Unsung Heroes of Rock’n’Roll: The Birth of Rock in the Wild Years Before Elvis. It was, he later said, an era of “freedom … it wasn’t only a free market, it was blind. They didn’t know what they were selling or to whom. These small record companies would put out polar opposite product in one breath … a lot of amazing stuff emerged in the process.”Another way of pricking their own era’s pomposity was to refuse to take their job seriously: “The premise that pranks ’n’ antics were the basic, irreducible nub of any true rock experience,” as Metzger put it, a thought compounded by the fact that music journalism was still in its infancy. The magazines they wrote for were more or less making it up as they went along, the pay was paltry – “less than the price of a carton of cigarettes,” Tosches subsequently protested – and you survived by blagging free albums and meals from record companies: you might as well have fun.Bangs wrote features inventing entire careers for mid-60s one-hit wonders he’d taken a shine to and wrote features calling for singer-songwriter James Taylor to be murdered Metzger was as offensive as possible Tosches was wont to review albums without actually mentioning the music, or in some cases, even listening to the music. He reviewed Black Sabbath’s Paranoid under the misapprehension that he was listening to an entirely different band called Black Widow and was fired by Rolling Stone for colluding with Metzger to write reviews then publish them under the other critic’s name.Perhaps understandably, the results were variable. At its worst, it was as self-indulgent as the artists they affected to despise, filled with attitudes and language that simply wouldn’t fly today. But when Tosches or Bangs hit a seam of inspiration, their writing was thrilling – a chaotic, pugilistic blend of New Journalism, Hunter S Thompson’s gonzo approach and street-smart wise-assery. It could be extremely prescient: stories vary but there’s a compelling argument that Tosches was the first person to use the word “punk” to apply to a rock aesthetic, in a July 1970 feature that claimed “poetry is puked, not plotted”. It could be insightful: Tosches famously dismissed George Harrison’s 1971 Concert for Bangladesh in a piece he headlined The Heartbeats Never Did Benefits, an obscure 50s doo-wop quartet from Queens having more value in his world-view than a former Beatle’s well-meaning, but ill-considered philanthropic efforts. He thought the end result was pompous, noting that the audience “didn’t give a fuck about Bangladesh”, bemoaning that rock’n’roll should not “adopt pretensions of meaningfulness outside of that of a self-contained expression, matrical and flashing”, which is pretty much the debate that still rages every time a grand charity gig – in the Concert for Bangladesh’s image – is announced.Tosches professed to loathe the increasing respectability of music journalism as the 70s progressed – “the vital part of rock writing died when these legitimate straight magazines started covering rock’n’roll on a regular basis … places like People and Time, and then the writing in Rolling Stone became more like that.” Uniquely, among his Noise Boy peers, however, Tosches proved equipped to transition from the world of what he called “spontaneous, natural fun” to something more mainstream.The joy of books such as Country, The Unsung Heroes of Rock’n’Roll and, especially, Hellfire, the 1982 biography of Jerry Lee Lewis that was subsequently called the greatest music book of all time by both Rolling Stone and the , was Tosches’ ability to marry the two-fisted vitality of his best early 70s writing with things that he once would have scoffed at. For a man who boasted about reviewing albums without taking the shrink-wrap off them, these were clearly the products of meticulous research into everything from Lewis’s ancestral history to country’s forgotten roots in the blackface minstrel tradition.But Hellfire’s real power is in Tosches’ prose: quite aside from the fact that he had alighted on a genuinely insane story of wildness and excess, Tosches truly believed that Jerry Lee Lewis was a greater talent than Elvis Presley, and his passion ignited his writing. He wrote about Lewis’s career as if he was writing a Great American Novel, imagining events in Lewis’s life as a gritty novelist would, his style inspired in equal parts, he claimed, by the Old Testament and William Faulkner.It’s hugely informative, but never dry: the book grips you from its astonishing opening – a drunk Lewis paying an unscheduled visit to Graceland with a loaded gun in 1976 – and never lets go for 300 pages. Reading it, it’s hard not to wish that Tosches had written more long-form books about rock’n’roll, but he didn’t. Lewis was, he said, “one of the very, very few living characters who intrigued me”, and after telling his story, he moved on: to Sonny Liston, Dean Martin, blackface minstrel Emmett Miller, Arnold Rothstein.In his later years, he professed himself no longer interested in rock music, although perhaps that wasn’t entirely true. A journalist who met him in the early noughties found him raving about a wildly obscure doo-wop single by the Rocketeers he’d unearthed that delighted in the title I’m Gonna Feed My Baby Poison. On the quiet, he was clearly still digging out forgotten music that he thought got to the root of what rock’n’roll was really about, that didn’t adopt pretensions of meaningfulness outside of that of a self-contained expression."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/12031bb0ac340bb6b15ad0e26d500370dcd128dc/0_301_4500_2701/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b9b652da5e87f12ff265af6c0750b503","title":"how did a town in west virginia become the opioid capital of the us","story":"Chris McGreal reports on the web of doctors, pharmacists and drug companies that made rural Mingo county, West Virginia, the opioid capital of America.

I have repeatedly said as my own opinion I am not ideologically opposed to extending again a few days or a few weeks if you then get a good solution that excludes a hard Brexit,” Altmaier said.“If the British are to opt for one of the longer-term options, that is new elections or a new referendum, then it goes without saying that the European Union should do it, for me anyway.”The likelihood of an extension beyond 31 October increased after the European parliament’s Brexit steering group recommended that a vote on the deal, scheduled for Thursday, should be ditched in light of developments in the Commons. The parliament has a veto on any agreement.Guy Verhofstadt, the EU parliament’s Brexit coordinator, said there needed to be “full ratification in Britain before we do our final vote”. Sources said the Commons would need to complete its third reading of the withdrawal agreement bill before the European parliament would hold its crucial vote to allow the UK to leave with an agreement.After this week, the next scheduled sitting of the European parliament is 14 November but parliamentary sources said an extraordinary session could still be held as late as 31 October if necessary. “It is not on the agenda for this week – and it is not going to be added,” the EU source said.It is understood the European parliament’s leading MEPs had been heavily lobbied by the UK government to hold their vote this week as Downing Street seeks to keep hope alive of leaving by Halloween.France’s EU affairs minister, Amélie de Montchalin, expressed Paris’s frustration but also its willingness to again extend the UK’s membership of the EU. She said: “What is certain is that we need a yes or a no before October 31. We need clarity. There cannot be a new delay without it being justified.”On Saturday, the Commons voted to withhold its approval until all the legislation relating to the withdrawal agreement bill has been passed. The prime minister subsequently complied with the Benn act by sending three letters on Saturday evening to ask the EU to provide for a delay beyond 31 October.Alongside an unsigned photocopy of the request he was obliged to send under the act, there was an explanatory letter from the UK’s ambassador to the EU, Sir Tim Barrow, and a personal letter from Boris Johnson explaining why Downing Street thought a further delay would be corrosive.A spokeswoman for the European commission said the request had been formally received, despite its unconventional “form”.The spokeswoman added the EU’s ratification processes had been launched in preparation for approval by the Commons but that it was up to London to take the next steps.“The request to extend article 50 was made by the UK’s permanent representative to the EU,” the spokeswoman said. “President Tusk acknowledged receipt of the request on Saturday and stated that he was now consulting with the EU27, so this form does not change anything.”Speaking to the German radio station Deutschlandfunk, Altmaier said the onus was on Downing Street to provide clarity on the next steps as soon as possible for Brexit to be possible on 31 October.“What we need is clarity and we need it quickly,” Altmaier said. “In recent months we have repeatedly taken into account the difficult situation in the UK. At the moment, the hardest part is that we do not know who actually speaks for this country: is it the government or is it the elected parliament? Both represent different positions.“The government would like to quit on 31 October parliament has requested a delay. This is a very difficult topic now. We will talk about this with our European partners.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/844f2b93886946d1f635562283e15bf3f3fc3a48/60_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b33ec4d5f88fb66976f98f99132bac3c","title":"how the numbers add up on brexit deal and possible amendments","story":"Could the Commons back PM’s deal, an all-UK customs union or a second referendum?As the longstanding political maxim goes, the first rule of being a party whip is knowing how to count. There will be a lot of totting-up of votes this week as MPs consider Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal and a series of possible amendments to it.There are 650 MPs in the Commons, but with the seven non-sitting Sinn Féin representatives, as well as the Speaker, John Bercow, and his two deputies not taking part in votes, the magic number for any victory is 320.After byelection losses, expulsions and resignations, Johnson’s Conservatives hold 288 seats, meaning that even with the 10 Democratic Unionist party (DUP) members backing the government – which they are not doing on the deal – he is some way short. However, Labour is also ided and there are now 35 independent MPs, making the situation very fluid.Here’s how the numbers might look for various options.Ministers are hopeful that if they are given a free run at pushing through Johnson’s plan – when they tried to do so on Saturday, it was amended to delay the moment of truth – the numbers will be there.Current projections put the vote at a dead heat. Johnson’s side is boosted by 20 former Tories who now sit as independents but are supportive, and various other independents including Brexit-minded former Labour MPs such as Ian Austin and Frank Field.The key will be how many current Labour MPs the government can tempt over. On Saturday, six voted with the government against Oliver Letwin’s amendment to delay approval of Johnson’s deal – Kevin Barron, Ronnie Campbell, Jim Fitzpatrick, Caroline Flint, Kate Hoey and John Mann. They could all be expected to back the deal.The question is whether any more Labour MPs, particularly from leave-backing constituencies, could follow. The signs are mixed. One possibility, Gloria de Piero, has said she will instead work to support a customs union amendment.This appears to be the favoured option of Labour, whose hope would be to attach an amendment on it to the Brexit deal legislation. However, the government is vehemently opposed to a customs union and would not accept a deal so amended.The numbers could be similarly close now. The combined total of Labour’s 245 MPs, 35 from the SNP, 19 Lib Dems plus 10 from Plaid Cymru, the Independent Group of Change and the Greens gets to 309, short of the magic number. It is by no means certain the SNP and Lib Dems would support the amendment. Both parties – which actively oppose Brexit – abstained in the indicative votes, and are understood to be waiting to see the specifics of an amendment before they decide this time. Some of the 20 ex-Tory independents have been sympathetic to a customs union before (the indicative vote on a customs union was instigated by Ken Clarke), but some could be receptive to the government urging to eschew the plan now.Labour’s big hope had been to get the DUP onside after the party was cut adrift by Johnson with his deal, which leaves Northern Ireland subject to an EU-style customs regime. But on Monday one DUP MP, Jim Shannon, said the party would not back such a move.The idea of an amendment making any Brexit deal conditional on a second referendum to approve or reject it has been mooted for many months. However, MPs supporting the People’s Vote campaign have repeatedly declined to push the matter, mindful that it probably does not have the required support.A second referendum proposal during April’s indicative votes lost by 292 votes to 280, and it is uncertain how much more support such a plan could pick up beyond the same MPs who seem likely to support a customs union. In this instance the ex-Tory rebels are notably less sympathetic for the most part.However, it seems such an amendment will be tabled. Rather than being put forward by the Labour frontbench, the most likely version is one proposed by Peter Kyle and Phil Wilson, two Labour MPs who have repeatedly pushed the idea of any Brexit deal being contingent on a confirmatory referendum."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/53bf1d82c3959cd0e66414fda00db5d809335e31/0_164_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca8939d1a35749dfc529e7d600467474","title":"sadiq khan on collision course with government over environment","story":"Exclusive: mayor to reject changes to his London Plan which aims to protect green belt and stop Heathrow expansionThe mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, is on a collision course with the government over proposals to water down his green plan for the capital, which involves stopping the expansion of Heathrow and protecting the green belt.Planning inspectors want Khan to withdraw his objections to Heathrow’s expansion, permit fracking in London, and loosen his commitment to the green belt by allowing building in “very special circumstances”.Khan is expected to write formally to the secretary of state for housing, communities and local government, Robert Jenrick, to reject these proposed changes to the “London Plan” policy. Ministers will then have six weeks to choose whether to force through the changes by legal means.The brewing row highlights the tensions between local governments, which in some areas are taking a tough stance on climate change and environmental issues such as air pollution, and central government, which is accused of lagging behind on concrete actions to fulfil the UK’s national goals on the climate emergency and environmental protections.Jules Pipe, deputy mayor for planning, regeneration and skills, said: “Tackling London’s filthy air and the climate emergency are among the mayor’s top priorities. London has declared a climate emergency and it’s critical we move towards renewable energy to improve the capital’s toxic air quality, protect the health of Londoners, and keep the city on course to being a net zero-carbon city by 2050.”Khan’s plan would ban fracking in London, prevent the massive expansion of Heathrow backed by the government, and enshrine stronger protections for the green belt and metropolitan open land.A report by the Planning Inspectorate, a quasi-independent government agency, suggested changes to the London Plan that would allow for fracking in London, and for development in the green belt “in very special circumstances”, with alterations to the boundary of the green belt in “exceptional circumstances”.The inspectors want the changes in order to bring the London Plan into line with national policies, set by central government, and the great majority of the measures in the London Plan received their approval. Their recommendations are non-binding – however, to ignore them, the mayor must write to the secretary of state explaining why he is doing so.A spokesperson for the Planning Inspectorate said: “The London Plan has been examined by an independent panel of three inspectors. The panel’s role in the examination is now complete. The report sets out any recommended changes, as well as the reasoning behind those changes, following the examination in public. It is for the Greater London Authority to consider the changes and publish the report at a timing of their choice.”The effects of the changes proposed by the inspectors are likely to be minor in practice. For instance, there are no current plans to frack in London, and none are likely to be brought forward. Fracking has in effect stalled across the UK.Allowing for building on the green belt in “very special circumstances” would be open to challenge and require explanations of what made circumstances so special that the presumption against building should be breached.Fossil fuel companies have been aware of their impact on the planet since at least the 1950sLyndon Johnson’s President’s Science Advisory Committee states that “pollutants have altered on a global scale the carbon dioxide content of the air”, with effects that “could be deleterious from the point of view of human beings”. Summarising the findings, the head of the API\u0026nbspwarned\u0026nbspthe industry: “Time is running out.”Shell and BP begin funding scientific research in Britain this decade to examine climate impacts from greenhouse gases.A recently filed lawsuit claims Exxon scientists told management in 1977 there was an “overwhelming” consensus that fossil fuels were responsible for atmospheric carbon dioxide increases.An internal Exxon memo warns “it is distinctly possible” that CO2 emissions from the company’s 50-year plan “will later produce effects which will indeed be catastrophic (at least for a substantial fraction of the Earth’s population)”.The Nasa scientist\u0026nbspJames Hansen testifies to the US Senate\u0026nbspthat “the greenhouse effect has been detected, and it is changing our climate now”. In the US presidential campaign, George Bush Sr says: “Those who think we are powerless to do anything about the greenhouse effect forget about the White House effect … As president, I intend to do something about it.”A\u0026nbspconfidential report\u0026nbspprepared for Shell’s environmental conservation committee finds CO2 could raise temperatures by 1C to 2C over the next 40 years with changes that may be “the greatest in recorded history”. It urges rapid action by the energy industry. “By the time the global warming becomes detectable it could be too late to take effective countermeasures to reduce the effects or even stabilise the situation,” it states.Exxon, Shell, BP and other fossil fuel companies\u0026nbspestablish\u0026nbspthe Global Climate Coalition (GCC), a lobbying group that challenges the science on global warming and delays action to reduce emissions.Exxon funds two researchers, Dr Fred Seitz and Dr Fred Singer, who dispute the mainstream consensus on climate science. Seitz and Singer were previously paid by the tobacco industry and questioned the hazards of smoking. Singer, who has denied being on the payroll of the tobacco or energy industry, has said his financial relationships do not influence his research.Shell’s public information film Climate of Concern acknowledges there is a “possibility of change faster than at any time since the end of the ice age, change too fast, perhaps, for life to adapt without severe dislocation”.At the Rio Earth summit, countries sign up to the world’s first international agreement to stabilise greenhouse gases and prevent dangerous manmade interference with the climate system. This establishes the UN framework convention on climate change. Bush Sr says: “The US fully intends to be the pre-eminent world leader in protecting the global environment.”Two month’s before the Kyoto climate conference, Mobil (later merged with Exxon) takes out\u0026nbspan ad in The New York Times\u0026nbsptitled Reset the Alarm, which says: “Let’s face it: the science of climate change is too uncertain to mandate a plan of action that could plunge economies into turmoil.”The US refuses to ratify the Kyoto protocol after intense opposition from oil companies and the GCC.The US senator Jim Inhofe, whose\u0026nbspmain donors\u0026nbspare in the oil and gas industry,\u0026nbspleads\u0026nbspthe “Climategate” misinformation attack on scientists on the opening day of the crucial UN climate conference in Copenhagen, which\u0026nbspends in disarray.A study by Richard Heede, published in the journal Climatic Change, reveals\u0026nbsp90 companies\u0026nbspare responsible for producing two-thirds of the carbon that has entered the atmosphere since the start of the industrial age in the mid-18th century.The API removes a claim on its website that the human contribution to climate change is “uncertain”, after an outcry.Exxon, Chevron and BP each\u0026nbspdonate at least $500,000\u0026nbspfor the inauguration of Donald Trump as president.Mohammed Barkindo, secretary general of Opec, which represents Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Algeria, Iran and several other oil states, says climate campaigners are the\u0026nbspbiggest threat\u0026nbspto the industry and claims they are misleading the public with unscientific warnings about global warming.On Heathrow, the London Plan will in effect be subordinate to the decisions of the courts, where attempts to stop the airport expansion by legal means are already well under way. Last week, a new legal front opened up in the ongoing battle, when WWF was granted permission to make arguments against expansion based on the rights of children.Khan’s objections to Heathrow expansion are nuanced, moreover, by his backing for increased capacity at Gatwick.The row over the London Plan is significant as it highlights the gap between local and national government on green issues. Local mayors and council leaders wishing to implement environmental improvements, whether on air pollution or measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, sometimes lack the powers to do so.Even where they are given power, for instance in setting up clean air zones, they may be frustrated in raising funding for their plans, when local authorities are facing cuts, large deficits or even bankruptcy.Khan will write to the secretary of state before the end of the year, and the government will have six weeks in which to respond.A spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: “It is for the mayor of London to take forward the planning inspector’s comments on the London Plan. The secretary of state will respond to any letter from the mayor of London in due course.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a1fd8a3a8a4a03c5ab25f04ff07a2e045eddf8a2/0_0_1989_1193/master/1989.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1762b79d6b365b9024d8a0f677729419","title":"new gene editing tool could fix most harmful dna mutations","story":"‘Prime editing’ more precise than Crispr-Cas9, but still needs time before use on humansScientists have raised fresh hopes for treating people with genetic disorders by inventing a powerful new molecular tool that, in principle, can correct the vast majority of mutations that cause human genetic diseases.The landmark work opens the door to a new era of genome editing, but scientists caution that more research is needed before it can be safely used in humans. Beyond proving its safety, another major hurdle is how to deliver the molecular machinery to cells that need it in sufficient amounts to treat a disorder.“This first report of prime editing is the beginning rather than the end of a longstanding aspiration in the life sciences to be able to make any DNA change in any position of a living cell or organism, including potentially human patients with genetic diseases,” said David Liu at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard in Cambridge, Massachusetts.The ability to rewrite the genetic code is one of the most striking scientific advances of recent years. The most common approach, known as Crispr-Cas9, has been likened to “molecular scissors” which home in on a particular DNA sequence and then cut it in two. The procedure allows scientists to disable specific genes and even correct harmful mutations by providing cells with fresh strands of DNA with which to repair the cut.Crispr-Cas9 is not perfect, however. Often, it leads to cells with a haphazard mix of edits, including extra chunks of DNA called insertions, or missing chunks of genetic code called deletions. These are less of a problem when scientists are working on cells in a dish, because those that are affected can be thrown away. But when genome editing is used to rewrite faulty genes in people’s lungs, hearts and other tissues, far more precision is needed.Andrew Anzalone, also at the Broad Institute, created prime editing with Liu by giving Crispr-Cas9 an overhaul. The new system homes in on its target as before, but instead of chopping the DNA in half, it nicks it, and then writes a new section of DNA into the specified position.Writing in the journal Nature, the scientists describe how they made 175 different DNA edits to human cells with impressive precision. In one demonstration, they corrected mutations that cause the inherited blood disorder, sickle cell anaemia. In another, they removed the four extra DNA letters in a particular gene that cause Tay-Sachs disease, a rare condition that destroys children’s nerves and usually proves fatal by five years old.Before prime editing, it was impossible to make such a range of DNA changes in so many different cell types without leaving behind insertions, deletions and other genetic detritus that can interfere with the workings of the edited cell.“You can think of prime editors as being like word processors capable of searching for target DNA sequences and precisely replacing them with edited DNA sequences,” Liu said. “Potential impacts include being able to directly correct a much larger fraction of the mutations that cause genetic diseases, and being able to introduce DNA changes into crops that result in healthier or more sustainable foods.”Robin Lovell-Badge, a geneticist at the Francis Crick Institute in London, said prime editing looked “very exciting” and would be useful for exploring what genes do, making animal models of human genetic disorders, and improving animal and plant agriculture. Because the procedure can make changes that occur naturally in plants, at least some prime-edited crops should not be regulated as “genetically modified”, he added.But much more work needs to be done before prime editing can be used in humans, Lovell-Badge stressed. “As the authors themselves point out, these are new methods and effort will be needed to develop them to show that they are sufficiently safe and efficient. So far the authors have conducted experiments on just a few human cell types, which is far from being enough.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0039084a6ac6bc4fd8d21cc576ad913df13316a7/0_99_4152_2491/master/4152.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4387fe7927edbd330916df7cfefdf9ce","title":"andy murray named great britain davis cup squad tennis","story":"Andy Murray will make his return to the Davis Cup for the first time since 2016 at the finals in Madrid in November.Leon Smith has announced four of his five-man team – the singles players Murray and Dan Evans, alongside the doubles pairing of Jamie Murray and Neal Skupski. The GB captain will chose between Cameron Norrie and Kyle Edmund, who is on a seven-match losing streak and has fallen from No 14 to No 75 in the world, for the fifth spot.Murray had already stated his intention to play in the finals and his soaring form, topped off by Sunday’s stunning victory over Stan Wawrinka to win the European Open in Antwerp, ensured his place in the team only seven singles tournaments into his comeback from hip surgery.GB, who were given a wildcard for the revamped finals, face the Netherlands and Kazakhstan in the group stage on 20 and 21 November. The finals will have 18 nations competing across six groups on a hard court at the Caja Mágica in Madrid.The group winners – as well as the two second-placed teams with the best records – progress to the quarter-finals, with the semi-finals and final on 23 and 24 November.Murray continues to be surprised at his rapid improvement. His goals were considerably less when sat down with his team to plan for a four-week run of tournaments in Zhuhai, Beijing, Shanghai and Antwerp.“I just want to try to be competitive. I want to feel like when I’m on the court I’m not getting smashed, that I’m making it difficult for them and competing as best I could,” Murray said. “I wasn’t thinking I’m going to win tournaments or I’m going to be beating guys like Stan Wawrinka and Matteo Berrettini and pushing guys like Fabio Fognini close. This has come as a surprise to me and my team.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/49c259eee0b35f5599fb969fcc514e11327136b4/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3d566400a42e94921efdf44af5832a2b","title":"england wales final jones gatland rugby world cup","story":"Some Rugby World Cup semi-finals stay longer in the memory than others. For every stunning sporting spectacle – Sydney 1987, Dublin 1991, Cape Town 1995 and Twickenham 1999 – a good number have been unable to match the hype. Often they are not even close: in no fewer than nine of the 16 semi-final contests to date there has been a double-figure margin of victory.Major surprises, historically, have also been relatively sparse. Of those 16 games, a mere three were won against the head, so to speak. France, both in 1987 and 1999, totally confounded expectations but, otherwise, probably the biggest shock was New Zealand’s decisive 22-10 loss at the hands of Australia in 2003.That latter fixture, as it happens, is as relevant as any previous last-four game before the weekend’s double bill of England v New Zealand and Wales v South Africa. Tempting as it is to dwell on Jonah Lomu’s four-try trampling of England at Newlands or even the Scotland v England showdown of 1991 – the only previous time that two British sides have made the last four – there are two good reasons why England, in particular, may be keen to dwell on the last occasion the All Blacks lost a World Cup semi-final.Because both the coaches that day are now to be found in England tracksuits. Eddie Jones was in Australia’s corner in 2003, responsible for devising the plan that stopped a rampant All Blacks side dead in their tracks, reducing their counterattacking opportunities and heaping pressure on their brilliant but mercurial fly-half Carlos Spencer. And the coach outwitted on that occasion? None other than Jones’s assistant, John Mitchell, who went on to lose his job as the New Zealand coach as a direct result.Between them Jones and Mitchell know how important it is to have the right tactical plan for the right occasion. Only last weekend there was a perfect example of how not to do it: Australia’s profligate game management and “what will be will be” mentality playing directly into red-rose hands. England will be smarter, not least because Jones and Mitchell have been down this particular dark alleyway before and know precisely where to look for Kiwi insecurities.Perhaps the best way to imagine them is as two old-school detectives, Twickenham’s answer to the Sweeny’s Regan and Carter, sat in a car across the street staking out a dimly-lit target. Jones will have been looking less at the shellacking New Zealand gave Ireland last Saturday and more at precisely how they engineered their victory. As South Africa found on the tournament’s opening weekend, simply putting pressure on their half-backs via line speed is not enough. Unless all their key supply lines – lineout, aerial dominance, breakdown – are shut down, the All Blacks will always find a way to hurt you.To that end the England v Australia game was an extremely useful reconnaissance exercise: southern-hemisphere opposition, dangerous on the counter, a proper defensive test. Assuming Jonny May is fit, England also possess the kind of flying pace they will need to try to turn the tables. Above all, though, they will need to win plenty of collisions and extend their reputation as the World Cup’s tightest defensive unit. The collective confidence of Tom Curry, Sam Underhill and Billy Vunipola is growing by the game and, should it all come down to goal-kicking, Owen Farrell is right back in the groove.A similar muscular chess match awaits when South Africa face Wales, who can surely not play as flatly again as they did against France. When Warren Gatland talked about the better team having lost he was simply speaking the unvarnished truth. Gatland, though, has not arrived at his lofty coaching perch simply by assuming that last week’s form will endlessly repeat itself. If ever there was a game that underlined the steadying influence of Jonathan Davies it was Sunday’s quarter-final and should the centre be back fit to face the Springboks it will make a significant difference.There is also the crucial matter of preparation: Wales’s heavy recent schedule appeared to leave them heavier-legged than France, who, following the cancellation of the previous weekend’s England game, looked far sharper. Given Wales have also beaten South Africa in five of their past six meetings, Gatland can give it to his players straight this week: if they hang tough, keep calm, make inroads with their aerial game and avoid the Boks’ more obvious strengths, it is not totally inconceivable two Six Nations sides could contest the final.In that event, though, southern-hemisphere coaches would still very much retain the balance of power. Jones has won 38 of 48 Tests as the England coach Hansen and Gatland have been picking off less wily coaches for more than two decades and Rassie Erasmus has done a remarkable job of resurrecting a South Africa team who, as recently as 2017, could barely win a game. The Springboks and the All Blacks remain narrow favourites to contest the final in Yokohama on 2 November but if anyone can wrongfoot them it is Gatland and Jones."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/72aef5be8a7fdcfd8333c3877c6f6ab7e80a5f78/154_254_6531_3918/master/6531.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8f678c74adb297e4ce1eb5543be994fc","title":"josh taylor boxing interview","story":"“It’s hard to say this without sounding vicious, but you want to hurt him,” Josh Taylor suggests quietly on an otherwise ordinary Tuesday morning. “You want to go in there and do as much damage as possible. But, having said that, you hope you don’t do any real damage after the fight is over. You’re just there to do a job. You’re going to hit him as hard, as fast and as often as you can. In boxing you don’t get paid overtime. So you want to get him out of there as soon as possible. You’re not going in there just to tap and move. When you hit him, you want to hit him hard. And you want to hurt him.”The seriousness of Taylor’s compelling and dangerous world title unification fight against Regis Prograis at the O2 in London on Saturday night is obvious. The two world super-lightweight champions are both unbeaten and driven by a conviction they have the beating of each other in the most interesting fight to be staged in Britain this year. It is also the final of the World Boxing Super Series – a tournament which has featured eight of the best super-lightweights in the world. Prograis and Taylor have each won two fights in dominant style.Taylor is an engaging 28-year-old Scot. His name is not as widely known as it should be but the IBF champion is arguably the most skilful boxer in Britain. He also has a ruthless streak, and the calm way in which he speaks about hurting Prograis sounds ominous.Yet there is no doubting the compassion Taylor feels for Patrick Day. The young American fighter still lay in a coma, after a brutal bout in Chicago, when Taylor and I met. He died a day after this interview, in another upsetting reminder that boxers really do risk their lives inside the ring. Taylor’s sympathy for Day and his family is profound and, as he tells me a few days later, “I’m so sad that Patrick lost his life. He was just a year younger than me. It puts into perspective how dangerous our sport can be. I want to send my deepest sympathies to his family.”“He’s definitely a good fighter,” Taylor agrees. “We are the best two in the world in our ision. But I’m better than Prograis. I’m going to prove that on Saturday night.”This week will be testing. They have to meet each other twice more, at the press conference and the weigh-in, and there has been an edge to their previous encounters. Taylor shrugs it off. “I’m not bothered. He’s not getting in my head. The only thing is that I’m not very good in situations where you have to listen to a guy who talks about beating you up. The way I was brought up, if you have a problem with somebody you fight him there and then.Barry McGuigan and his son Shane, Taylor’s manager and trainer respectively, will use all their experience to calm him. Taylor also insists he has seen chinks in Prograis’s cool persona – despite his obvious respect.“Of course we respect him. He’s a world champion. But there’s definitely no friendship. If anything, there’s a bit of needle. He may be OK with me after the fight. But until then he’s my arch enemy. He’s not pissed me off. It’s just annoying, because he’s so cocky and arrogant. He thinks he’s better than what he is because he’s got a big entourage, telling him how great he is all the time. To me that shows a little insecurity. I don’t need that.”There is little to separate the two champions in their ring intelligence and will to win but Taylor points out: “I’m bigger than him. I’m taller and with a longer reach. He’s shorter and stockier than me. He might be a bit physically stronger than me. But I can handle that. I’ve got speed and boxing ability over him. I’ve got the reach. I’ve got good timing and footwork. I’ve fought better opponents. I just feel I’ve got the beating of him.”Taylor’s face only clouds with sadness when he remembers that, in July, Danika McGuigan died from cancer. The daughter of Barry and Sandra, and sister to Shane, Blain and Jake McGuigan, Danika was a gifted actor and only 33. “It was a real shock,” Taylor says. “Danika was a lovely girl. She was larger than life. She was real happy and positive about everything all the time.“She was always in a good mood, and she would talk to you and make you feel special. I couldn’t imagine how it has been for Barry and Sandra having to bury a child. It’s such a terrible loss.“I hope that, for Barry and Shane, the boxing helps take their mind off it for a little while. In the gym with the lads, talking about boxing and working so hard, gives them a break from their loss. But we’ll always remember Danika.”We turn back to boxing and I ask Taylor what he expects of Anthony Joshua, a team-mate at the London 2012 Olympics, when the former world heavyweight champion tries to win three belts back from Andy Ruiz Jr in December – after the chubby 6ft 2in American, of Mexican heritage, shocked him in June.“I’m leaning toward Ruiz again, purely because the way it went in the first fight,” Taylor says. “Joshua couldn’t deal with it. He couldn’t adjust to Ruiz’s fast hands.”“I’ve known Joshua many years, being on the same GB team, and he’s always struggled with shorter, more compact opponents, especially guys quicker than him. And punching down the way he does, he always seemed to struggle with his distance control. He never really looked able to adjust to smaller, quicker guys. I know Anthony pretty well, and I like him, but I think the rematch may go the same way.”Prograis loves books but Taylor, in contrast, reveres motorbikes. “My dream career was racing motorbikes. I was good at motocross. I was real competitive – getting top-threes in a field of 40 – and had one full season. But my parents couldn’t afford it any more so I found boxing. I still love riding but I haven’t been on a bike for two years because it’s safer to put them away until after the boxing is over.”“But the best of them all, Michael Dunlop, was the sanest one. I was really surprised by how approachable Michael was. He comes across as a bit grumpy in the media. But he was real nice to me. He was actually in the middle of fixing his own bike when we went into his tent. He took a good half-hour away from his bike to talk to us. He was asking me about my boxing and all I wanted to ask about was his bike. He was real cool.”Dunlop lost his father (Robert), his renowned uncle Joey and, more recently, his brother William to racing accidents. The TT might be even more dangerous than boxing – but being in the ring is more demanding than riding a bike.“You don’t put your body through quite as much torture on a day-to-day basis on a bike,” Taylor agrees. “You can come off your bike every single day and it could be over. But, as a boxer, you’re punishing your body all the time. You feel it most during fight week. It doesn’t help that you’re cutting weight. We do it right but your body’s still dry. You don’t eat much. So the night before the weigh-in’s always the longest and toughest. You’re crabby with people. But as soon as you’ve weighed in, you’re rehydrated and got good food back in, you start to relax. It’s time to have fun.“That’s why I can’t wait for Progais. It’s been a long camp gearing towards this point. This is the big one, the one that we want to win most. It’s not going to be easy and there will be plenty of hurt – but I’m looking forward to fighting, and winning.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/39603f7396cfe8d6305d13a7386bf0ce67b40336/0_161_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c2c98a08521d5efa57de162343c2dce8","title":"talking horses magical key to continued success of champions day","story":"The popularity of Champions Day is not purely down to the likes of Frankel after Ascott enjoys another packed houseA standing-room-only train journey down to Ascot on Saturday afforded plenty of time to consider both the continuing popularity of British Champions Day eight years after its arrival in the calendar, and the woeful inability of South West Trains to offer an adequate service on a day that has drawn a bigger crowd than the King George in July every year since 2014. The final attendance figure of 29,029 - a fair proportion of whom seemed to be in my carriage – was a few hundred down on 2018, but still impressive given a very mixed weather forecast for the afternoon and, if we’re honest, a slight lack of “star” names in the Group One events when compared to some previous years.In the end, this made no difference to anyone, just as the decision to switch three races to the hurdles went unnoticed as soon as Kew Gardens and Straarius settled down to battle it out in the Long Distance Cup. Never mind the weather or the cast list, a crowd of around 30,000 for Champions Day is now apparently guaranteed - a huge increase on the 12,500 who saw the last Champion Stakes at Newmarket in 2010.Just over 32,000 were at Ascot to see Frankel conclude his flawless career in the same race two years later, a Champions Day record that is unlikely to be beaten any time soon. But at the same time, this could be seen as evidence that the old argument that “horses like Frankel are the lifeblood of the sport” is slightly wide of the mark. They make a difference, for sure, but perhaps not quite as big a difference as some might suggest.Champions Day has built up a loyal, reliable attendance of around 30,000 people from pretty much a standing start, and done it less than 10 years. And while Frankel was undoubtedly a big draw in the early years, the success of subsequent seasons is down to a major investment in branding and marketing which has built on Ascot’s status as the top Flat track in the country.There was a strong sense on that overcrowded train on Saturday that most of the people on it were not just going to the races. They were going to Ascot races, because the name comes with something close to a guarantee of exciting, competitive action in a historic venue. The Ascot brand sells the day as much as the promise of “Champions”.On that basis, a horse like Magical, the Champion Stakes winner, is as important for the event as a freakish once-in-a-lifetime superstar like Frankel.Champions Day is the third of four big end-of-season events in the northern hemisphere in the space of eight weeks, starting with Champions Weekend in Ireland and moving on to Ascot via Arc day in Paris before the Breeders’ Cup (which returns this year to Santa Anita in California, always a big favourite with owners and trainers alike).Few horses are sufficiently robust and reliable to run up to their best at all four – Found, like Magical a filly from the Aidan O’Brien stable, is the only recent example that springs to mind. And Magical could well prove to be another, with the Filly \u0026amp Mare Turf pencilled in for her final start of the season if she comes out of Saturday’s race as fresh and keen as she has after her previous eight outings this year.With Champions Day falling between the Arc and the Breeders’ Cup and ground on the softer side of good likely if the first nine seasons are any guide, owners and trainers are always likely to feel that if it is a choice of two from three, France and then America gives their horses more time to recover.Horses that are able to take their races as Magical does are invaluable in terms of maintaining the quality of the big autumn meetings, and while, unlike Frankel, she will never get a statue at Ascot, she did just as he did on Saturday to maintain the success of Britain’s richest day at the races.Windsor closes its doors for another winter after its seven-race card this afternoon, and its balmy midsummer Monday evenings will feel like a very distant memory as the runners slosh round on rain-softened ground. The conditions may detract somewhat from the spectacle, but Field Of Vision (2.00) should appreciate the test having put up his best run for a while on heavy ground at Leicester last time out.Prince Of Harts (4.00) also ran well on soft at Nottingham back in May and could reward an interest at around 9-2 later on the card, while Milan Reef (5.00) is another who should relish the conditions if handicaps for gentleman amateur riders’ are your thing.The curtain is coming down at Pontefract too, where Glasses Up (3.20) should go well at around 8-1 as he steps back up to a mile-and-a-quarter after a promising run over a mile at Musselburgh last time. King Carney (3.50) improved markedly to get off the mark on soft ground at Nottingham earlier this month and registered a decent time in the process, so 8-1 could be a price worth taking for the card’s feature race, while Magen’s Moon (3.10) can follow up her surprise win over course and distance last time out in the handicap hurdle at Plumpton.

Ireland were not able to do that in the first half and New Zealand had a field day. The game was in effect over by half-time because the All Blacks bossed the breakdown.We always tend to see three seconds as the benchmark. Anything faster than that is quick ball but as Australia ran out of steam against England that would have been up around four. The difference between that and how quickly New Zealand were recycling was marked and that meant forwards such as Brodie Retallick and Joe Moody were running on to the ball and winning collisions. Ireland, on the other hand, had to check their runs and often received the ball when stationary.I was also very impressed with New Zealand’s defence. It isn’t talked about all that much most people concentrate on their attack, their ability to create things, to be ruthless from opponents’ mistakes, but their defence was first-class against Ireland. I saw an extra edge to their line speed. There was not a lot of creativity from Ireland which made it easier, but New Zealand’s tight five – notably Retallick, Sam Whitelock, Moody – put a lot of pressure on their attack and they lost all their go-forward. We’re going to see two extremely well-organised defences and it will be fascinating to watch both of them try to nullify each other’s attack.I can’t see England changing their ways for one moment. This is knockout rugby and because of that it is hard to argue with Eddie Jones moving Owen Farrell back to fly-half, particularly with the benefit of hindsight considering how well he played. England will kick accurately, put pressure on New Zealand’s wings and Beauden Barrett at full-back and they will look to squeeze, suffocate and strangle. I imagine their line speed will go up another notch – they’ve been flirting with the offside line but they are not getting called up on it so of course they should keep doing it until they are pinged and then adjust.England will also target the set piece. New Zealand’s scrum has been rock-solid but I do believe the lineout is an area where England will think they can have some joy. I would not be surprised in the slightest to see George Kruis come back into the side because he is their top lineout caller. They will look to control territory and keep the ball in the right areas of the field, so being able to disrupt New Zealand’s lineout could be very significant.New Zealand, on the other hand, will be waiting for the game to become unstructured. They will have to be patient but their ability to do that against Ireland impressed me. They did not force things they realised when the momentum had been lost and they just needed to keep chipping away until it built back up again and then strike.The decisive factor will be whether New Zealand can stop England’s power game and what happens if they do. Looking back at the first Test of the British \u0026amp Irish Lions tour two years ago, all the talk was that the Lions had the edge up front but that is where the All Blacks took them on and why they won the game. If England cannot get their power game going, get their big carriers over the gain line and get the ball wide after two or three phases, then I wonder how they will react. Only George Ford has the creativity and the ability to up the tempo from the bench, so there will be a huge onus on him if that does happen.What New Zealand cannot allow to happen is for England to start building a lead. As Farrell alluded to after the Australia match, England did what they needed to do once they had got themselves in front. It is not always pretty but it works, especially in a World Cup semi-final.As a result I expect New Zealand to have a massive focus on slowing down England’s power game. They’ll be getting off the line and trying to spook the distributors and ensuring that the ball does not get to the outside channels. They will in effect try to say to England: ‘That isn’t working, so what else have you got? How can you cope if the game becomes unstructured?’ England do have players who can cope well – I think of Jonny May and Anthony Watson – but I just wonder whether they have enough experience of knowing exactly how to handle it on this kind of stage.I’m backing the boys in black but if I’m being honest it’s the toss of a coin. It’s such an evenly matched semi-final – a classic North versus South battle – and whichever team are able to impose their style of how they want the game to be played will end up in the final.

Anyone who says otherwise is deluded.Without those chunky, super-fast prototype Nike alphaFLYs – the ones with platforms to make Ziggy Stardust swoon – Eliud Kipchoge does not shatter the two-hour marathon-distance barrier in Vienna.And without the key-lime-pie-coloured consumer version, £239.99 from your nearest Nike store, legions of club runners are not lopping chunks off their personal bests either.But I have news for the athletes and agents who have approached the IAAF, athletics’ governing body, urging it to ban the shoes. It is not going to happen. In fact do not be surprised if the arms race in shoe technology soon goes nuclear.Why? Well, on Monday the IAAF’s technological committee – which has been studying Nike’s Vaporfly shoes since 2017 – will hold an important conference call involving scientists from the University of Queensland and legal experts. While its thinking is a closely guarded secret, there is no hint the Vaporflys will be banned. Instead, I understand it is considering making a proposal to the IAAF council in the next two to three weeks that a running shoe should be regarded as legal providing it gives no “motor assistance” to an athlete. In other words, if the only power source remains the person running in the shoes, they would be legally compliant.Some will shrug their shoulders. Sport and technology have, after all, always gone hand in hand. A friend of mine in cycling points out that Ineos are using wheels from Germany, costing £6,000 a pair, that are lighter and stiffer than those used by other teams. That is an undoubted advantage. My friend also suggests modern bicycle tyres are worth 40 seconds on Alpe d’Huez over those from 20 years ago, another sign of how technology inevitably rewrites the rules and the record books.But athletics is supposed to be different. With the odd exception – such as the switch away from cinder tracks – technological innovation tends to be subtle and incremental. Tell someone you are a three-hour marathon runner and that means much the same whether you did it in 1985 or 2015. But remarkable as Kipchoge’s run in Vienna undoubtedly was we have no way of knowing how much was down to him – and how much was the impact of his shoes.We know the Vaporflys may have producing sliding-doors moments in major races. In the 2016 US Olympic marathon trials the Nike athletes Amy Cragg and Shalane Flanagan came first and third wearing early prototypes of the Vaporflys while Kara Goucher, who was not, missed out by one place. The gap between Flanagan and Goucher? Sixty five seconds.True, other brands like Saucony and New Balance are rumoured to be close to unveiling similar shoes. But Nike has been so far ahead for the past three years you wonder how much the gap will really close.And it is not just on the road. At the recent world championships in Doha, Sifan Hassan and Laura Muir were among a number of athletes who ran startling times wearing prototype Nike spikes – though the heat of competition, the lack of wind and a lightning-quick track helped too.So what should be done? Clearly it would be legally tricky to ban the Vaporflys given they have been so widely used for nearly three years. So instead the question will become how to find the sweet spot between encouraging innovation without destroying the time-worn characteristics of track and field: universality and fairness.One reasonable suggestion, made in the British Journal of Sports Medicine by Geoffrey T Burns and Nicholas Tam, is to introduce rules to regulate the thickness of the midsole of a shoe. “If set at 31mm current competition footwear would remain eligible and advances would take place within this geometry, ensuring footwear remains an accessory to physiological competition,” they argue.As Burns and Tam also point out, similar rules regarding heel thickness for shoes are already used in high jump and long jump competitions. And by adopting a similar approach for running shoes it would “provide a transparent standard that supersedes the band-aid approach of litigating every new development”.But whatever the IAAF does next, it must more closely observe its own rule 143.2, which states shoes “must not be constructed so as to give athletes any unfair assistance or advantage”.Yes, the playing field in sport is never going to be truly level but it cannot remain obviously lopsided either."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64024ea7539837e82f4fa00f57b3b41adc20e6ea/313_360_3603_2163/master/3603.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1fed98b2066b50eb9a2b16aeb3991fbc","title":"russell maliphant dance company silent lines review sadlers wells london","story":"Sadler’s Wells, LondonLighting patterns sweep across Russell Maliphant’s dancers, who move with seamless fluidityYou won’t find steps in Russell Maliphant’s choreography, so much as one seamless swirling and spooling flow, one impulse morphing into another, all in fusion with dramatic light. Greek video designer Panagiotis Tomaras offers rippling projections cast across five dancers’ bodies, emulating close-ups of cells and muscle fibres connecting to the choreographer’s theme, the inner workings of the body – something that Maliphant, trained in anatomy and body work techniques as well as classical ballet, is deeply involved with.What emerges is a slow and concentrated Zen-like energy, like the brain’s alpha waves made flesh, across a succession of lighting states. Some of them are transfixing: a molten solo for Grace Jabbari is lit by flickers like neural networks, synapses firing or pulses through veins. The deft young dancers move with ninja stealth. Even an athletic barrel turn or flying kick is silently blended into the thread. It’s as if the dancers are absorbed by the movement rather than it being something they project. And anonymity reigns this is dance about bodies, not people.There’s shifting complexity within the repetitive currents of choreography, but it can very easily all look the same, underlined by the unimaginative looping of some of the score (there’s a distinct 90s trip-hop vibe going on). Silent Lines is less a journey somewhere, more a study of stasis, moving yet staying in place, like the vibrating matter of the universe – you can get a bit cosmic with this stuff, there’s even a swirling Milky Way at one point. If you can catch a ride on Maliphant’s flow, you’ll find this a sublime and trancelike hour, otherwise things could get painfully samey."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/052ba41b6e01156ff428ff25244b07c564d12f35/0_178_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=34155cda1c2ed13c11de9870ed53cb7a","title":"google eye detection pixel 4 smartphone unlock","story":"Update will prevent new smartphone being unlocked using owner’s sleeping faceGoogle has said it will update its new Pixel 4 phones to prevent them being unlocked using the sleeping faces of their owners.The phones, which are not yet in shops, are the first from Google to include a secure face unlock feature, in place of the fingerprint sensor used on previous iterations.

It’s not about getting super fit – just taking the stairs rather than the lift in the weeks leading up to your break will work wonders. Walking downstairs is the perfect pre-ski exercise!”Pre-trip training is something Simon Cook also advises. “Spending a few hours at an indoor snow centre before your trip is essential for all occasional skiers, and beginners in particular,” he says. “It means you can get used to walking in your boots and crack the basics of turning and stopping in a safe environment and ultimately get better value out of your time on holiday.”Well accustomed to the ebb and flow of guests to their resorts, Fleming and Cook have some handy tips for those who can’t avoid travelling during peak times. “It’s easy to be attracted to big-name resorts but lesser-known destinations, like Soldeu, are much quieter during school holidays, meaning you won’t waste precious time in lift queues,” says Fleming. “Also, because Spanish and Catalan guests typically eat lunch quite late, you can enjoy a peaceful lunch around midday before lapping up deserted pistes for a couple of hours.”Cook urges people hoping to enjoy some ski lessons to book well ahead if heading to the Alps during peak periods. “Guests who have enjoyed my complimentary Neilson Mountain Expert guiding and coaching sessions often want to book further private lessons, but are disappointed when they discover the ski school is already booked up,” he says. “You really do have to book early to secure your lessons.”Perhaps because they’ve offered to carry their clients’ skis home one too many times, both experts suggest finding accommodation that’s as close as possible to the pistes. “It doesn’t matter how long you’ve been skiing or snowboarding,” says Cook, “dragging your kit around is always annoying so finding a hotel or chalet close to the lifts, or even near a bus stop that will take you there is a gamechanger.”During the first couple of days of a ski holiday, it can be hard enough remembering how to ski, let alone figuring out the lay of the pistes, particularly if you’re visiting a resort for the first time. A day or two riding with a local, gleaning tips on the best cruiser blues and secret off-piste stashes, will make a world of difference to your enjoyment of the entire week.As Fleming explains, this is where Neilson Mountain Collection guests can capitalise on the guiding sessions included in their holiday: “These informal group sessions are well worth the investment of your time – you can brush up on your skills, provide a point of focus in a fun, relaxed environment and build a great sense of camaraderie. You don’t have to join all the sessions, use them entirely as you want, but just an hour or so out of your day will make a huge difference to your holiday.“Ski instruction has developed in leaps and bounds in recent years – here in Andorra, our philosophy is about self-discovery through activity-based teaching, not barking out orders and doing repetitive drills,” he says. “We’re here to inspire you, to encourage you to push your own boundaries while also enjoying some social skiing.”What really shines through while talking with both Mountain Experts is their passion for the towns they’ve chosen to make their home. “This isn’t just where I teach, it’s where I live,” says Fleming of Soldeu. “It’s so beautiful here and the mountains are much bigger than people expect. For skiers familiar with the Alps and looking for a change, Andorra is their ticket to a fascinating new culture, erse skiing for all levels, zero queues and even the option to go heli-skiing.”In France, Cook says he has skied every big resort in the Alps at some point over the past 20 years, but Alpe d’Huez is where he has chosen to settle. “The mountains around the resort are shaped like a big bowl with super mellow greens and blues at the bottom and steeper runs towards the top,” he says. “Because you basically ski through the town, there’s ski-inski-out access for most hotels and chalets, and there’s a huge choice of places to eat, drink and party.”So do things a little differently this year. Don’t jump on the ski lift and hope you’re in good enough shape for the week ahead. Do your homework before you leave – which includes thinking about extra lessons you might want while on the slopes.

But that should be cause for celebration according to Catherine Cooper as it means the slopes are calling once againIt’s September – the children are back at school, the leaves on the trees are starting to turn from green to inviting shades of auburn, and the need for a pumpkin spiced latte is overwhelming. For many people, their summer holiday is already starting to feel like a distant memory, with their next major trip some way off.But rather than feeling glum as I pack away my summer dresses and pull out my jumpers and boots, I feel a jolt of excitement. Because winter is just around the corner and for me, winter means just one thing – skiing.Since I learned to ski as a teenager, as soon as the days start getting shorter and the nights start drawing in, I can think of little else but the forthcoming snow. I’ll be reading the long-range weather forecasts, wondering how much snow there will be this year, when would be the best time to go, and which resorts I should head for.If I had the choice, I would always choose a winter day in the mountains over a hot summer’s day on the beach. Nothing beats the gentle bite of the cold air against your face on a crisp morning, bright white snow on the ground, with ice-crystals glistening in the sun against a backdrop of a clear blue sky. Or even on the days when the conditions aren’t so perfect, a hearty, cheese-based lunch or a glass of hot vin chaud after you’ve negotiated your way down some slopes to a cosy mountain restaurant rarely feels so well-deserved.But a snowsports holiday isn’t just about the skiing or snowboarding. It’s also about the mountain views, the resort’s atmosphere, the delight of seeing your child master their first nursery slope, or the precious time spent with family or friends in a spectacular setting. It’s also about fun evenings in après-ski bars, being out building snowmen or sledging, or perhaps about snowshoeing, relaxing in a spa, trying something new and adventurous such as paragliding, or indeed almost anything you want it to be.Mountain holidays bring people together – almost anyone can enjoy them. Whether you are a new skier who wants to potter around on the easy slopes, or an expert powder hound who wants to spend most of their time off-piste, as long as you choose your resort carefully, chances are both will be possible. A ski suit-clad toddler can ski with their grandad, teenagers and their parents can spend time together in an activity that they can all enjoy, friends or family can bond over a shared experience.Discovering a new resort is always exciting – trying out unfamiliar slopes, searching for the best restaurants for a lunch stop, and finding the optimum place for that perfect selfie or the most amazing panoramic mountain view.But your winter holiday is precious, and you don’t want to take all week to discover your favourite pistes, only to realise that you have to go home the next day. And while having a rep show you around the mountain was once offered as standard by most tour operators, rule changes have meant that this service is now rare.However, Neilson Mountain Experts can help you make the most of your holiday. Neilson is now the only ski holiday company to offer free, professional ski guiding throughout the season in selected resorts across France, Austria, Italy and Andorra.The advantages are obvious – the experts already know the resort well. They can show you the best slopes to head for to avoid the crowds, the more sheltered or tree-lined slopes that offer better visibility in bad weather, and the sunny bowl you’ll want to play in when skies are blue. They can also give you tips on your technique and posture, as well as introduce you to some of the best mountain restaurants.The two-hour long Mountain Expert sessions are open to anyone over 18 (12 in school holidays) who can already ski confidently on blue or red runs, for each guest in a Mountain Collection hotel or ski chalet and other selected accommodation – with at least two sessions a week guaranteed. You’ll also get to jump the lift queues when skiing with a Neilson Mountain Expert – who are all qualified ski and board instructors.So as the sun gets lower in the sky, the heating goes on and you perhaps start thinking about preparations for Christmas, don’t look back at the summer with regret. Look forward to crisp mountain days out in the fresh air, cosy nights in bars with open fires, hearty dishes shared with friends, the delicious nip of crisp alpine air and the satisfied buzz in your muscles of a day spent out in the open, doing what you love. I absolutely cannot wait.Enjoy the crisp mountain air this winter in style.

Sixty Walmart-owned outlets were vandalised, and the company said many stores did not open during the day. Five more people were later found dead in the basement of a burned warehouse and were not employees, authorities said.At least two airlines cancelled or rescheduled flights into the capital, affecting more than 1,400 passengers Sunday and Monday.“We are at war with a powerful, relentless enemy that respects nothing or anyone and is willing to use violence and crime without any limits,” the president, Sebastián Piñera, said on Sunday in an unscheduled speech from the military headquarters.Piñera, a billionaire conservative who served as president between 2010 and 2014 before taking office again in March 2018, is facing the worst crisis of his second term.On Saturday night, he announced he was cancelling a subway fare rise imposed two weeks ago. The fare increase led to major protests that included rioting that caused millions of dollars in damage to buses, subway stops, office buildings and stores.After meeting the heads of the legislature and judicial system earlier on Sunday, Piñera said they discussed solutions to the crisis and that he aimed “to reduce excessive inequalities, inequities abuses, that persist in our society”.Jaime Quintana, the president of the senate, said “the political world must take responsibility for how we have come to this situation”.Authorities said 10,500 soldiers and police officers were patrolling the streets in Santiago as state of emergency and curfew remained in effect for six Chilean cities, but protests continued during the day on Sunday. Security forces used teargas and jets of water to try disperse crowds.The interior minister, Andrés Chadwick, reported that 62 police officers and 11 civilians were injured in the latest disturbances and prosecutors said nearly 1,500 people had been arrested. He said late on Sunday there had been more than 70 “serious events” during the day, including more than 40 looting incidents.With transportation frozen, Cynthia Cordero said she had walked 20 blocks to reach a pharmacy to buy nappies, only to find it had been burned down. “They don’t have the right to do this,” she said, adding it was right to protest “against the abuses, the increases in fares, against bad education and an undignified pension, but not to destroy”.Long queues formed at petrol stations as people tried to fill up for a coming workweek with a public transport system disrupted by the destructive protests. Santiago’s subway, which carries an average of 2.4 million passengers on a weekday, had been shut down since Friday.The Subway system chief, Louis de Grange, said workers would try to have at least one line running on Monday, but he said it could take weeks or months to have the four others back in service. He said 85 stations and more than three-quarters of the system had been severely damaged."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/355d4109f3ce0529dac375be13879893e2421f3f/0_0_4894_2937/master/4894.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=47da89aaf86441eaaee84fc599a48315","title":"kosovo likely new leader albin kurti condemns eu balkans policy","story":"In exclusive interview, leftwinger Albin Kurti condemns bloc’s decision to halt Balkan enlargement talksThe leftwinger set to become Kosovo’s surprise new prime minister has condemned the EU’s decision to halt further Balkans enlargement, saying it showed western leaders had forgotten the lessons of two world wars and instead were in retreat in the face of fascism and populism.Albin Kurti said the stance could damage the chances of Kovoso reaching a deal with Serbia, which has refused to recognise it as independent since the end of the 1998-99 war, as Belgrade has less incentive to act without the prospect of EU membership.France caused dismay in the region at an EU summit last week by blocking Northern Macedonia and Albania from starting accession talks, so destroying Serbia’s chances of reaching the EU in the foreseeable future. French president Emmanuel Macron insisted that Europe needed to focus on its internal reforms.“The EU was formed as a response to fascism, but is now running scared in the face of populists and fascism,” Kurti told the .“Yes, the EU is important for the Balkans, but the Balkans is very important for the EU. Berlin and Paris should know this well, and it is really sad, for all of us, that they forget this. In a couple of decades, historians will write there were not two world wars, but just one world war with two episodes, and it all started in Sarajevo.”Kurti’s leftist Albanian nationalist movement Vetëvendosje (Self-determination) emerged as the strongest party following snap elections last month. Imprisoned for 18 months by Serbian police during the height of its military conflict with Kosovo in 1999, Kurti, 44, finds himself on the verge of power, promising to end Kosovo’s two decades of neoliberalism.After years of failed prosecutions against corruption, he promised to end what he considered the judiciary’s capture by the state.He said he was interested in UK-style unexplained wealth orders and a new vetting process led by a dynamic chief prosecutor. “We need to produce our own homegrown Eliot Ness, and he must become the most famous person in the country,” he said. “We have almost 200 prosecutors, but some lack knowledge and some lack courage, and some lack both. They have to be liberated from the state.”Facing mounting debt and emigration, Kurti said he was also determined to end the huge skills gap in the labour force, focus on technical education and reducing industry’s dependence on the crippling interest rates of foreign-owned banks: “We must make our country liveable and persuade more people to stay in our country.”But Kurti will be under international pressure to reach an agreement with Serbia. The US has just appointed a new special envoy to revive the dialogue between the two countries..Serbia, for instance, has opposed Kosovo’s membership of Interpol, Unesco and the Council of Europe. “Serbia should face its own past, instead of looking at Kosovo and Albania through military binoculars. Serbia needs some introspection.”Kurti said his three-stage programme will start within a bottom-up dialogue with Serbs in Kosovo on practical cooperation, for example in agriculture, followed by a review of the real-life impact of the 33 agreements signed with Serbia under EU auspices from 2012, and finally a meeting with Josep Borrell, the incoming EU foreign policy chief. “We cannot afford another failed dialogue. It must have clear principles,” Kurti said. Borrell has promised to go to Kosovo as his first overseas visit.Kurti said he was totally opposed to land swaps with Serbia, an idea pursued this year by Serbian president Aleksandar Vucic and Hashim Thaci, the president of Kosovo. “Whatever new border you form, there will be Serbs or Albanians on the other side, and they pretend you can do it peacefully.”Serbs fear that his true agenda will be to seek some kind of confederation with Albania, so marginalising the Serb minority in northern Kosovo.Serbia has already condemned as provocative his decision to meet foreign diplomats at his party headquarters with an Albanian flag behind him. He said Kosovo’s official flag was imposed on the country with a ruling that it contain no red, no black and no eagle, “as if we were declaring independence from Albania, and not Serbia”.But he vowed in his official capacity as prime minister that he will retain and respect the official flag of Kosovo: “I have more important tasks than rearranging the furniture in the prime minister’s office.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7641fc2fcb5d1201216ce06f16885e47486fe7cb/0_11_2316_1390/master/2316.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6555066b06de9a8fe1d620a51f14a6f5","title":"residents of syrian city pelt retreating us troops with potatoes","story":"Angry scenes demonstrate sense of betrayal amid rushed US withdrawalPelted with fruit and hounded by insults, the American military’s exit from Syria was very different from its time on the ground. The remnants of the US presence in the north-east of the country made an ignominious departure on Monday, driving through towns that had welcomed them for the past four years.The regional capital of Qamishli, a hub of cooperation between US officers and Kurdish officials throughout the war against Islamic State, was among the least hospitable spots on the road out. As US battle trucks, sporting large American flags, made their way through town and headed towards Iraq, groups of locals threw rotting fruit and vegetables at them, cursing soldiers that only two weeks ago many in the region had considered to be their protectors.The US convoy of roughly 100 armoured vehicles and lorries competed with a new wave of refugees as it made its way to the border, passing cars full of families crammed with their possessions. They too were leaving for Iraq, where the uncertainty of exile awaited.The departing Americans, on the other hand, are set to regroup in Iraq’s Kurdistan region before returning home – their mission to safeguard a still-volatile region dramatically cut short by their commander-in-chief, who abruptly decided earlier this month to abandon allies who had been at the vanguard of the fight against Isis ahead of a Turkish assault. Trump said in the White House on Monday that the US had never given a commitment to the Kurds to stay in the region “400 years” to protect them.“People are angry, and they have every right to be angry with the way Americans left them on the battlefield,” said Khalil Omar, 56, a shopkeeper, in Qamishli. “They are angry because they feel like they are tricked and taken for a fool for these past years.“We sent our children with them to fight Isis, and they abandoned us. Betrayal is hard to get over, and I hope we’ll remember this for the future. America knows the people who are murdering people on the roads very well, but they chose to turn a blind eye, and now they are walking away from all of it. True friends don’t walk away in hard times.”Until Turkey launched its offensive\u0026nbspthere on 9 October, the region was controlled by the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which comprises militia groups representing a range of ethnicities, though its backbone is Kurdish.\u0026nbspSince the Turkish incursion, the SDF has lost much of its territory and appears to be losing its grip on key cities. On 13 October, Kurdish leaders agreed to allow Syrian regime forces to enter some cities to protect them from being captured by\u0026nbspTurkey\u0026nbspand its allies. The deal effectively hands over control of huge swathes of the region to Damascus.That leaves north-eastern\u0026nbspSyria\u0026nbspided between Syrian regime forces, Syrian opposition militia and their Turkish allies, and areas still held by the SDF – for now.On 17 October Turkish president,\u0026nbspRecep Tayyip Erdoğan, agreed with US vice-president Mike Pence, to suspend Ankara’s operation for\u0026nbsp five days in order to allow Kurdish troops to withdraw.Before the SDF was formed in 2015, the Kurds had created their own militias who mobilised during the Syrian civil war to defend Kurdish cities and villages and carve out what they hoped would eventually at least become a semi-autonomous province.\u0026nbspIn late 2014, the\u0026nbspKurds were struggling\u0026nbspto fend off an Islamic State siege of Kobane, a major city under their control. With US support, including arms and airstrikes, the Kurds managed to beat back Isis and went on to win a string of victories against the radical militant group. Along the way the fighters absorbed non-Kurdish groups, changed their name to the SDF and grew to include 60,000 soldiers.For years, Turkey has watched the growing ties between the US and SDF with alarm. Significant numbers of the Kurds in the SDF were also members of the People’s Protection Units (YPG), an offshoot of the Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK) that has fought an insurgency against the Turkish state for more than 35 years in which as many as 40,000 people have died. The PKK initially called for independence and now demands greater autonomy for Kurds inside\u0026nbspTurkey.Turkey claims the PKK has continued to wage war on the Turkish state, even as it has assisted in the fight against Isis. The PKK is listed as a terrorist group by Turkey, the US, the UK, Nato and others and this has proved awkward for the US and its allies, who have chosen to downplay the SDF’s links to the PKK, preferring to focus on their shared objective of defeating Isis.Turkey aims firstly to push the SDF away from its border, creating a 20-mile (32km) buffer zone that would have been jointly patrolled by Turkish and US troops until Trump’s\u0026nbsprecent announcement\u0026nbspthat American soldiers would withdraw from the region.Erdoğan has also said he would seek to relocate more than 1 million Syrian refugees in this “safe zone”, both removing them from his country (where their presence has started to create a backlash) and complicating the demographic mix in what he fears could become an autonomous Kurdish state on his border.Nearly 11,000 Isis fighters, including almost 2,000 foreigners, and tens of thousands of their wives and children, are being held in detention camps and hastily fortified prisons across north-eastern Syria.SDF leaders have warned they cannot guarantee the security of these prisoners if they are forced to redeploy their forces to the frontlines of a war against Turkey. They also fear Isis could use the chaos of war to mount attacks to free their fighters or reclaim territory.On 11 October, it was reported that at least five detained Isis fighters had escaped a prison in the region. Two days later, 750 foreign women affiliated to Isis and their children managed to break out of a secure annex in the Ain Issa camp for displaced people, according to SDF officials.It is unclear which detention sites the SDF still controls and the status of the prisoners inside.Two weeks after Donald Trump’s decision the impact continues to ricochet across the battlefields of the Kurdish north and into the region beyond.Kurdish forces attacked by the Turkish military said they had completed a withdrawal from a “safe zone” near the Turkish border. Meanwhile, Turkey, which had declared a ceasefire that is set to expire on Tuesday night, said it was setting up observation posts in a swathe of Syria it has commandeered in a short intensive fight to oust Kurdish militias from the frontier area.The Turkish move drew the ire of Iran, an ally of the Syrian leader, Bashar al-Assad, whose forces are slowly returning to the region, as part of a deal brokered to slow the Turkish push.“We are against Ankara’s establishing of military posts in Syria,” the Iranian foreign ministry spokesman, Abbas Mousavi, said. “The issues should be resolved by diplomatic means.”The sudden departure of the Americans, the retreat of the Kurds and the advance of Turkey and its Arab proxies have made for a heady two weeks in one of the Middle East’s most volatile corners.Washington’s departure from north-eastern Syria leaves only a small contingent of US forces in the country – all based in a desert outpost in the country’s south-east, where their focus has increasingly turned away from Isis to Iran. In the vacuum created by the Isis rampage across both sides of the Iraq-Syria border, Iran has emerged as a prominent actor, shoring up supply lines into Syria and Lebanon, which have helped secure Assad in power.“With these events today, we are just hopelessly exposed,” said a senior US diplomat, who declined to be named. “Everyone knows what this represents to our enemies – and that is a historical capitulation.”In Iraq’s Kurdish north, where its leaders have remained allies of the US throughout the post-Saddam years, what to make of Washington’s new footing and how to deal with the aftermath is a pressing concern. In the Kurdish capital, Erbil, people are wondering whether they too could be cast aside.“We can’t do it to them too,” said the US diplomat. “Not even the current administration would go for that. Surely.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4052663.1571235523!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"customers at their wits end over eir","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIn her interactions with Eir, a reader, Fidelma, dealt with “many rude reps and two nice ones”. Photograph: Alan BetsonRegular readers will know that Eir has featured on this page quite a bit over the last year and although the company has promised a dramatic overhaul of its customer service department, the complaints are still coming in and we have two this week. “I am really sorry that I am asking of your time to help me with this,” starts a mail from a reader called Fidelma.“I wish I could take care of the matter myself but I am at my wits’ end. I recently moved home to take care of my mum (widow), who shattered her pelvis in a fall. I am a single mum of three and having broadband is a luxury item for us,” she continues.“At my previous address we had Sky and there was never an issue. When I moved, Sky couldn’t provide a service due to the rural setting. I contacted Eir on July 19th and spoke to a rep who assured me once I gave my bank details that no money would be taken out of my account until they could assure me of a service.”On that call Fidelma was told to wait until she received a text from the company and when she did she was told she would then have to follow up with a call five working days later. “Needless to say I received no text or anything further. On August 11th €59.15 was removed from my account. On the 12th and 15th of August I spent two solid days on the phone to Eir and also emailing them contacting them on Facebook Messenger and web chat.”She says she dealt with “many rude reps and two nice ones”.Each time she spoke to Eir she was assured that “I had no account and everything was cancelled and I would be issued a refund in 60 days.” That did not happen.“I have now received another email from them with a new invoice. As it is the weekend the customer care is not open. Due to previous interactions after relaying my situations multiple times on the web chat and Facebook Messenger, I have been told my issue can be only dealt with over the phone.”She says the customer care line is open between 8am and 6pm from Monday to Friday when she is at work and she says she would expect to be “held in a queue for over an hour”.She says she really believed that after spending “two whole days” previously on the phone “that last time that it would sort it. The stress this is causing me is unfair and unnecessary. I am trying to work, take care of my mother and my daughters and cannot see how I can resolve this. If I cancel the direct debit (which I never authorised to be used as such) will they hand it over to a debt collector? All for a service I never received. I am still without broadband as I am terrified that I cannot escape Eir.”She says reps have hung up the phone on her and another asked her: “What do you want me to do about it?” She says she has been promised that people would return her calls but “nothing and no help has come”.Her mail concludes with a plaintive “Please, please help – it may not seem like much money but to me it is a lot and I am worried it will continue. I don’t know what else to do and the stress and the lack of any progress is like a nightmare.”Phone cut offAnd then there was this one.“One year ago in June 2018 Eir cut off my contract phone and I lost my number,” writes Maxine. The company was supposed to cancel her broadband and her TV but she wanted to keep her mobile phone. Instead “everything was cancelled”.She says this caused her a lot of distress as she was moving country and while she was going to be overseas – in Lebanon – she needed an Irish phone as she has a serious medical condition which was being treated in Ireland.To replace her old number she got a pay-as-you-go phone also with Eir and passed the details to her medical team in Ireland.Maxine has a brain tumour “and had surgery before I left Ireland in June. My bloods were not correct this summer and I am awaiting a call from my team,” she writes.She lost her phone service at the end of September and has tried to resolve the issue using Eir’s web chat but every time she has tried it has been unsuccessful. “Even today my chat was dropped three times and have been told different stories as to why my service is not working.”She has been told there is not enough credit on her account . She says there is €20 on the account and she has been told her phone package does not allow to have the phone as it is set up.She says the problems have been compounded as she accesses her Irish bank accounts using her Irish mobile phone.On the day she wrote to us - last Monday - she said she had spent two hours on webchat with Eir and was then told she would have to wait another 48 hours to be contacted by technical support. “I was reduced to tears in front of my 11- and eight-year-old sons. I am really distressed over this and at my wits’ end. I really hope your influence will help.”We contacted the company and asked not only about these problems but about how improvements in its customer care offering were coming along.“A year ago we began the process to bring all customer care roles back in-house, a huge programme of work which included the building of a new centre in Sligo, on a green field site and the upgrading and expansion of two more new care centres in Cork and Limerick. Some 1,200 employees have been hired and trained across care, retail and sales. Those people are now established in their roles and some have been promoted to team lead and trainer positions in recent months,” a spokeswoman said. \u0026nbsp“We are proud of all that has been achieved so far but this programme is by no means complete. We will continue to invest to meet our goal of a best in class care service for our customers. We have seen huge improvements in the quality of care our customers are receiving, but of course not every interaction is perfect. We have reached out to the customers you have highlighted to us, to apologise that they did not receive the standard of care they should expect. We have resolved those issues and will continue to work to ensure the betterment of our care service.”\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspShopping online from ChinaNext up there is a reader called Bryan who is dismayed at the quality of some clothes he bought from China and with the aftercare he received.Bryan says that when the clothes arrived “they were the wrong size, bad quality, had defects, did not match the description, etc”.So he immediately wrote to the company seeking a return address and a refund “which they have not given me. One item never arrived and they will not refund me for the item. Instead they are insisting they will resend the item which I have refused but to no avail.”Bryan wonders if he has any rights when it comes to getting his money back. “I am not entirely sure the company are Chinese as the website doesn’t say this, but the goods arrived from China. I had a look at their refund policy and it contained gems like ‘Note that we can accept goods only in case it is hanging by the wall.’”None of that sounds great. But it does serve as a timely reminder that when it comes to shopping online you need to have your wits about you.When you buy from a website based in the European Union you have many rights thanks to a consumer rights directive which came into force across in 2014.If you buy something online and it is faulty, you have exactly the same rights as if you bought it in a shop and you are entitled to a repair, a refund or a replacement. Under the directive, an online seller must give you specific information, including the price, any taxes that may apply, delivery costs and details of what to do if you change your mind. You also have a cooling-off period of at least 14 days, starting from the date you receive the order. Before the end of the 14 days, an order can be cancelled and the item returned.You also have extra rights if your goods are not delivered on time. Generally speaking, online retailers have 30 days to get your stuff to you unless you agree otherwise.However all of these rights apply only to transactions that happen within the EU. So if you buy clothes from Dave’s Dodgy Deals in Doha you can expect your rights to be significantly diminished.And that is what is happening here.More and more people are buying direct from Chinese sites, lured by the promise of dramatic discounts but – as in so many areas – if something seems too good to be true then it is too good to be true.When shopping in sites outside the EU – either those based in Beijing or (soon) Bristol, you will need to be wary of unexpected charges such as increased taxes and inflated delivery charges. There may also be safety concerns about some products as something sold from outside the EU does not have to meet certain standards.And when you buy from outside the EU you don’t automatically have rights enshrined in law to return an item even if it is faulty or not as described.Bryan has fought a good fight but he could still end up on the losing side. He can’t even arrange for a chargeback on the items which have already been delivered because his bank is unlikely to entertain him, although be might be able to convince his bank to give him money back for the items which never arrived.All of this is not to say that people should never buy from China or other countries that offer little by way of protection but it is always going to be a gamble, so you might be well advised to keep your spending under a certain limit and spend only as much as you are willing to lose should everything go pear-shaped.It is also worth bearing in mind when buying clothes that sizes in different parts of the world can vary and a large in one country can be a medium in another one. If you are buying from far-flung places, check the feedback and reviews of the seller and their products and if you can’t find contact details before you buy then maybe you shouldn’t be buying there at all, no matter how good the deal seems.Good-news storiesWe like to feature good-news stories on the page and would do so more frequently it we could. We got two in the space of two days last week that we are delighted to highlight.“I would like to commend the National Concert Hall for their resolution of an issue I had with a considerably out-of-date voucher,” starts a mail from a reader by the name of Richie Ryan.“Their IT system didn’t allow the voucher to be processed but the manager issued me two complimentary tickets for the concert I wished to attend,” he says. “I suspect the two tickets may have cost slightly more than my voucher. Either way I feel like a winner. That’s not something I often feel when using vouchers.”And then there is Brittany Ferries, which another reader, Eddie Duggan, says provided him and his family with some “outstanding service”.“My family of three travelled the RoscoffCork route on October 12th,” he writes. “Shortly before boarding, my daughter was taken severely ill. We informed the check-in staff and they provided a wheelchair to help her board, they upgraded us to a vastly superior cabin at no extra charge, and provided a crew member to take my daughter to her cabin.”He says the ferry company also provided him and his family with a disembarkation assistance.“We can only try to express our gratitude to the check-in staff and crew members for their assistance and for their cheerful , helpful and friendly manners. Can you please pass on our thanks to all your staff involved?”Yes. Yes, we can."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Des Long, who faces allegations of 1,139 unpaid M50 trips, claims he had reached eFlow dealWoman seen passing bag of drugs worth \u0026euro470,000 over railing, court toldEuropean Parliament\u0026rsquos steering group meets to plan approach to new Withdrawal AgreementMichael D Higgins proposes matching migrants to countries that need their skillsWebsite receives nomination for news websiteapp of the yearEmergency services alerted after smoke seen coming from a bin by the Cathedral\u0026rsquos railingsVote on new Assembly speaker fails to take place after Sinn F\u0026eacutein and SDLP boycott voteFour bank accounts containing more than \u0026euro250,000 to be taken over by the liquidatorAmerican Airlines flight to Philadelphia is forced to make emergency landing in DublinGirl aged six when Thomas Mullarney (61) began attacks including molestation while watching pornAssembly sits for first time in over 2 years as campaigners gather outsideChild was eight when he alleges his front wheel hit a pot hole in Dublin housing estateNew group will consider proposals and revisions to existing programmesPrivate, reclusive, religious woman had moved to Knock to be near shrine, inquest heardMinister says \u0026lsquoI believe we are really striking at the heart of our democratic system here\u0026rsquoJudge tells former sex-worker not to post similar statements online againActivists gather outside Assembly as rival MLAs call symbolic sitting a meaningless stunt\u0026lsquoI felt terrorised in my childhood bedroom, in ways I cannot describe,\u0026rsquo victim saysTwo incidents brought by same garda go before District Court in Dublin"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4057998.1571674594!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"the irish times most nominated in newsbrands shortlist 2019","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tRosita Boland with her trophy at the 2018 Newsbrands Ireland journalism awards Photograph: Simon CarswellThe  has received 32 nominations in the shortlist for the NewsBrands Journalism Awards 2019 – the highest number for a publication in this year’s competition.The NewsBrands Journalism Awards are open to any work published in print, website, online, mobile, video, audio or any other news delivery format from any NewsBrands Ireland member title.Five of the six journalists shortlisted in the Foreign Coverage category write for The : Sally Hayden Derek Scally Suzanne Lynch Lara Marlowe and Patrick Freyne.The  received four of the six nominations for Best Use of Video, citing the work of Simon Carswell, Kathleen Harris, Enda O’Dowd and Bryan O’Brien.Jack Power of The  was nominated in three categories Business Journalist of the Year Investigative Journalism and Young Journalist of the Year.  reporter Sarah Burns was also shortlisted as Young Journalist of the Year as was current  reporter Shauna Bowers for her past work at The Times, Ireland edition.Markets Correspondent Joe Brennan is shortlisted for Business Journalist of the Year.In the Campaigning Journalism category, The ’ No Child campaign has been shortlisted.Fintan O’Toole and Hilary Fannin are both nominated in the Broadsheet Columnist category, while in the Critic of the Year category The  has four writers shortlisted: Catherine Cleary Patrick Freyne Niamh Donnelly and Fintan O’Toole.Three  writers are shortlisted in the Features Broadsheet Writer of the Year: Rosita Boland, Conor Gallagher and Conor Pope.Carl O’Brien is nominated, along with Power, in the Investigative Journalism category.Among the Podcast of the Year contenders are The ’ Atlantic, Inside Politics and The Women’s Podcast.

Photograph: Niklas Halle’n AFPGetty Images.The European Parliament is unlikely to vote on the new Withdrawal Agreement until the British parliament has decided whether or not to ratify the deal.The parliament’s Brexit Steering Group met this afternoon and decided to advise the leaders of the main groupings in Strasbourg to wait until Westminster had decided on the new deal before putting it to a vote.If the European Parliament does not ratify the deal this week, it is not scheduled to meet in plenary session again until November. However, EU sources said a special plenary session could be convened next week to ratify the deal before the October 31st deadline if Westminster approves the agreement in the coming days. For now, however, sources in Brussels say that the EU is adopting - once again - a wait-and-see attitude.Government sources here say the attitude in Dublin is the same. Informal contacts with the British government suggest there is some confidence in Downing Street that Boris Johnson can secure parliamentary approval for the agreement, despite the defeat on a related amendment last Saturday. “All eyes on Westminster,” said one Government source, before adding: “again.”Mr Johnson plans to present the Withdrawal Agreement Bill to the House of Commons, though opposition MPs and Tory rebels are likely to table amendments, including one calling for a second referendum and another for the UK to remain in the EU customs union.Ministers are likely to be briefed by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney when they meet for the weekly Cabinet meeting tomorrow morning. The Taoiseach is also expected to speak to the head of the European Council, Donald Tusk, who is conducting a round of consultations with EU leaders after Mr Johnson formally requested an extension of the Brexit deadline in a letter sent on Saturday night. Mr Johnson also sent a letter advising against granting an exemption, but the EU regards the first letter as having legitimately requested an extension.EU leaders declined to rule out an extension at last week’s Brussels summit in the event that Mr Johnson fails to get the deal passed at Westminster. While the EU’s position has been that an extension should only be passed if there is a clear purpose for it - such as a general election in the UK or a second referendum - privately Irish Government sources admit that in a choice between a no-deal exit and extension, for any reason, Dublin would back an extension. It is thought that a short extension could be granted without the need for an summit of EU leaders, but a longer extension - as favoured by some in the UK - would require EU leaders to meet and the debate the issue before the end of the month.

Photograph: Michael TeweldeAFP via Getty ImagesAbiy Ahmed’s motorcade left the Imperial Palace in Addis Ababa on a recent Thursday night after a long day during which the Ethiopian prime minister played host to various heads of east African states and other dignitaries.The day had seen the inaugural opening of Unity Park, a €140 million revamping of a section of the 40-acre grounds that have housed Ethiopia’s rulers since Emperor Menelik II, which Abiy has now opened to the Ethiopian people for the first time.As well as giving the concrete jungle that is Addis Ababa a much-needed new green space, unveiling this once hermetically sealed compound is meant to serve as a symbol of a government moving away from authoritarian ways to democratic values.It’s an example of the willingness of Ethiopia’s young and dynamic PM to think outside the box and the bold style of leadership that has garnered him so much international attention and praise.That reached its zenith on the morning after the event at the Imperial Palace, with the news Abiy had been awarded the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize, in recognition of his “efforts to achieve peace and international co-operation, and in particular his decisive initiative to resolve the border conflict with neighbouring Eritrea”.The Norwegian Nobel committee also cited the efforts of Abiy and other stakeholders “working for peace and reconciliation in Ethiopia and in the east and northeast African regions”.Locals I spoke to on the day the award was announced said Abiy deserved it for his mediating around the Horn of Africa region, and that they were happy for him personally and for what it meant for Ethiopia on the world stage.In a bar that evening, a man showed me a Facebook post on his phone with Abiy in front of the Ethiopian flag and a message in Amharic reading “Congratulations to our Abiy”.But, at the same time, Twitter carried many posts from Ethiopians – both home and abroad – criticising the committee’s choice. “The mystical Ethio-Eritrean deal continues to win awards and make headlines without actually making any differences on the ground,” tweeted one user, Selan Kidane. “I think it should become the ninth wonder of the world.”Checkpoints closedSince jubilant scenes of relatives from either side of the border embracing for the first time in decades, Eritrea has closed its checkpoints, and there appears little dialogue now between the two countries.At the same time, recognition of Abiy as a peacemaker in Ethiopia is being called out. After winning plaudits in early 2018 for rapid-fire reforms, including releasing political prisoners and lifting bans on opposition parties, Abiy is now accused of sanctioning increasing repression to contain dissenting voices.Locals are also increasingly questioning his ability to tackle domestic policies. “His focus is on the international level,” says Jerusalem Mebat, a 25-year-old doctor. “He should start small with the things in Ethiopia that need addressing.”Both Jerusalem and her twin sister, Bethlehem, another doctor, said that while they are pleased Abiy won the Nobel, they can’t forget his reaction to a doctors’ strike over poor pay and long hours that they participated in earlier this year. “He met with the strike leaders and was insulting, saying we should just be glad to serve the public,” Bethlehem says. “About 98 per cent of doctors here are not happy and want to leave the country.”Over coffee with the chairman of an opposition political party, I hear concerns that Abiy doesn’t have a strategic roadmap for implementing his reformist agenda, and how his approach is erratic and detached from reality. Hence the criticism from some that Unity Park, a personal initiative of Abiy’s, illustrates his propensity for style over substance, and that the money would have been better spent elsewhere.Less comfortableAt the Imperial Palace Abiy exuded energy as he showed those heads of states around the smart grounds, landscaped with funding from the United Arab Emirates. But later during a silver service dinner, occasionally during a lull in the conversation at the head table I thought his eyes had the look of a less comfortable man.Bodyguards with hefty rifles stood outside each entrance to the banqueting hall. Abiy has already survived one assassination attempt.A day after the Nobel announcement, talk in Addis about Abiy’s award was eclipsed by discussions about whether a protest rally about city governance would happen the next day in Meskal Square, a large open area at the heart of the city.The authorities refused permission for the rally and a clampdown ensued. Traffic was held up at checkpoints around the city and along major roads to the capital, leaving some buses full of travellers reportedly held up for two days.A day later again, a Sunday morning, only pedestrians, bystanders and joggers, as well as some playing games of soccer, populated the square. By mid-morning, Addis Ababa police sergeants were congregating at cafes while their charges remained in the back of pickup trucks.“People will be pleased about the Nobel but disappointed about the protest being banned,” Beles Yohannes (64) says outside a cafe near the square. “I understand why it wasn’t allowed with all the current problems, but others will be annoyed.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4057222.1571641765!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"uk government says it can secure commons backing for brexit deal","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish prime minister Boris Johnson  in the House of Commons on Saturday. Photograph: Jessica TaylorUK parliamentAFP via Getty ImagesBoris Johnson will try to push his Brexit deal through parliament in just over a week, despite sending a letter to the European Union requesting a three-month extension to Britain’s membership.His government will today attempt to put the deal to a “meaningful vote” in the House of Commons but Speaker John Bercow is expected to rule the move out of order.The prime minister will on Tuesday introduce the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Bill (WAB), the legislation required to implement the deal.Foreign secretary Dominic Raab said the government believed it could win a majority for the deal, either in a meaningful vote or when the Bill is put to its second reading on Tuesday.“We appear to have the numbers to get it through,” he told the BBC.Q\u0026ampA What happens next?When will agreement be debated? House of Commons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg said the government planned to put exit deal to vote today, but House speaker John Bercow is yet to rule if that is allowed and will report to the house today.How long will Brexit legislation take to pass? The first main stage of debate is expected on Tuesday. Senior minister Michael Gove said government will push to get deal through parliament by October 31st. MPs will have opportunity to bring changes to legislation.Has the EU accepted request to delay Brexit? EU leaders are unlikely to deny request but diplomats have said bloc would not rush to decide on request.LettersMr Johnson sent a letter to European Council president Donald Tusk on Saturday requesting an extension under article 50 until January 31st. He was legally obliged to do so under the so-called Benn Act after MPs voted earlier that day by 322 to 306 for an amendment deferring approval of the deal until after its implementation legislation is passed.The prime minister accompanied the letter required by the Benn Act with another saying he opposed any further delay to Brexit.“While it is open to the European Council to accede to the request mandated by parliament or to offer an alternative extension period, I have made clear since becoming prime minister, and made clear to parliament again today, my view, and the government’s position, that a further extension would damage the interests of the UK and our EU partners, and the relationship between us,” he said.Mr Tusk said he would consult with EU capitals but no response to the extension request is likely until later this week.Labour’s shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer said Labour would back an amendment to the WAB that would put Mr Johnson’s deal to a confirmatory referendum with an option to remain in the EU. The DUP, which voted for Saturday’s amendment in defiance of the government, said it was not seeking a second referendum but would exploit other opportunities to address its concerns about the deal.‘Relatively low’ riskTaoiseach Leo Varadkar said he believed it was “more likely than unlikely” that the House of Commons would pass a Brexit deal and that the risk of a no-deal Brexit now was “relatively low”.Speaking in Dublin yesterday, Mr Varadkar said EU member states were “reasonably asking” what the purpose of another extension would be.“Obviously the Government is disappointed that there wasn’t a vote in the House of Commons on the Brexit deal at the weekend,” he told RTÉ.“The UK has now requested an extension and of course, an extension would be preferable to no-deal if it comes to it. However, to grant an extension we need unanimity of the 27 member states. And member states are reasonably asking: what is the purpose of this extension?

This afternoon, the Speaker, John Bercow, has rejected the Government\u0027s bid to hold a meaningful vote on the Prime Minister\u0027s Brexit deal in the House of Commons today. He said it would be repetitive and disorderly to do so, after Parliament supported Sir Oliver Letwin\u0027s amendment on Saturday. That forced Boris Johnson to halt his meaningful vote until all Brexit legislation had passed and instead seek an Article 50 extension from the EU. With Mr Johnson still hoping to get his deal through Parliament in the next few days, Asa Bennett sets out the obstacles which may leave him with no option but to delay Brexit. For a complete nuts-and-bolts summary of how all of the Parliamentary shenanigans affects Britain\u0027s EU departure, Tony Diver has the piece which answers all your questions. And Daniel Capurro outlines the major political events due to take place in the coming days. All of this has a knock-on effect for proceedings across Europe, where the European Parliament has this afternoon said it will not vote on ratifying the Brexit deal on Thursday in Strasbourg as planned. Europe Editor Peter Fosterhas written this excellent summary of what the EU is really thinking about the Brexit extension and MPs\u0027 actions in Parliament. Increasingly frustrated, Emmanuel Macron, once the blue-eyed boy of Brussels, is looking more and more like the EU\u0027s bad pupil. Brussels Correspondent James Crisp reveals how Brexit has exposed an EU power struggle, with French President Mr Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel pulling in opposite directions.Ex-professional footballers are 3.5 times more likely to suffer with dementia and other serious neurological diseases, according to landmark new research that was funded by the Football Association and the Professional Footballers\u0027 Association. The 22-month study by the Glasgow Brain Injury Research Group followed The ’s successful campaign for research into the prevalence of dementia among former players. It confirms the fears of families who have long suspected a link between devastating brain injury and football, whether through repetitive heading or collisions. Read on for the details.It was described by staff as dank and often smelly. Yet today the pivotal role in the Cuban missile crisis played by a secret outpost of GCHQ in Scarborough has been revealed. The task of the tiny bunker on the North Yorkshire coast had been to monitor the Soviet Baltic fleet and merchant shipping in the northern hemisphere. In 1962 this somewhat unglamorous job for Britain\u0027s cyber spy agency was thrust into the centre of world affairs as tensions between the West and the Soviet Union threatened to escalate into nuclear war.

The bank heist is a tired dramatic trope these days, but don’t let that, or the show’s bland English-language title, put you off – creator Álex Pina has made something special. The heist here, led by a mysterious man known only as The Professor, involves breaking into the Royal Mint of Spain and printing off €2.4 billion. There are even more twists in the show’s 15 episodes than there are hostages. 220 American Vandal (TV series, two seasons, 2017–2018)Part satire of true crime documentaries such as Making a Murderer, part carefully observed portrayal of teenage life, American Vandal was criminally underappreciated during its two season run. It’s been cancelled now, but that doesn’t mean you can’t catch up with it, and then write Netflix a strongly worded email.320 One Day at a Time (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)In stark contrast to the off-beat, low-key comedy that currently rules TV – the kind that provokes a wry smirk rather than a hearty laugh – One Day at a Time is a big, bright sitcom filmed in front of an interminably enthusiastic studio audience. You wouldn’t have thought that the story of a Cuban-American army veteran  nurse  single mother – who suffers from PTSD and depression – would fit into this format, but it does so beautifully, tackling issues of sexuality, racism and sexism in the process.  Based on writer  director Tamara Jenkins’s own fertility struggles, Private Life stars Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti (both giving brilliant performances) as a spiky, loving middle-aged couple desperate to have a baby. They even rope their enthusiastic but irresponsible niece Sadie (Kayli Carter) into the mix, much to the horror of Sadie’s mother (Molly Shannon, turning a potentially repellent character into one worthy of empathy). It’s subtle, restrained and beautifully realised.520 Big Mouth (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Crude, rude, and rife with surprise emissions and bodily functions, animated sitcom Big Mouth is also a sensitive, nuanced deep e into the various horrors of teenagehood. When 12-year-old Andrew Glouberman (John Mulaney) is visited by the hormone monster (Nick Kroll, who voices many of the show’s best characters), he finds his life irreversibly – and seemingly disastrously – changed. Unlike many other puberty-centred comedies, Big Mouth makes as much time for its confused female protagonists as its male ones Maya Rudolph is a delight as the female hormone monster, and look out for Kristen Wiig’s wonderful turn as a talking vagina.  620 Easy (TV series, two seasons, 2016–)Joe Swanberg’s style of defiantly undramatic mumblecore isn’t for everyone, but if you enjoyed his earlier films, Drinking Buddies and Happy Christmas, you’ll find plenty to admire in this anthology comedy-drama series. Big-name stars such as Orlando Bloom and Aubrey Plaza crop up, but Jane Adams – who you might remember from Todd Solondz’s chronically depressing 1998 film Happiness – is the show’s heart, and Marc Maron is its jaded soul.Community’s Gillian Jacobs is brilliant as the prickly, magnetic recovering addict Mickey, who forms an unlikely – and arguably deeply unwise – relationship with her nerdy neighbour Gus (Paul Rust). Despite Gus’s pathological need to be the nice guy, we’re never quite sure who or what we’re rooting for – which is what makes Love such complex, compelling viewing.  In 2016, comedian Patton Oswalt’s wife, the true crime writer Michelle McNamara, died suddenly in her sleep. That subject matter doesn’t exactly scream “stand-up special”, but out of his devastating loss, Oswalt managed to craft something funny and profound. Over the course of an hour, he processes his grief onstage, managing to find humour in the struggle to raise his grieving six-year-old daughter alone.920 Santa Clarita Diet (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Granted, this horror-comedy – which stars Drew Barrymore as a neurotic real estate agent who suddenly develops a taste for human flesh – is really silly, and really, really disgusting. But it’s also strangely charming, and funny. Timothy Olyphant is excellent as Sheila’s frazzled husband Joel, and the pair’s idiosyncratic but respectful relationship with their smart teenage daughter Abby (Liv Hewson) isn’t quite like anything else on TV right now.1020 Dark Tourist (TV series, one season, 2018–)New Zealand journalist David Farrier is an unlikely TV presenter in the same way that Louis Theroux is – in just about every scenario in which he finds himself, he’s a little bit awkward. But as with Theroux, Farrier’s weakness is actually his strength, allowing him to endear himself to the many unusual people he meets on his journey through the world’s most questionable tourist destinations. Farrier’s stops include the site of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the road where JFK was assassinated, and the Milwaukee suburbs where serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer murdered his victims.1120 Sacred Games (TV series, one season, 2018–)Based on Vikram Chandra’s epic 2006 novel, Netflix’s first Indian original series is a slowly unfolding gem. The first season of Sacred Games – which follows a troubled police officer (Saif Ali Khan) who has 25 days to save his city thanks to a tip-off from a presumed dead gangster – only covered one quarter of Chandra’s 1,000-page novel. As the show itself declared when it announced the forthcoming second season, “the worst is yet to come”.When the trailer for Dumplin’ first landed, it seemed all the ingredients were in place for a film that was at worst tone-deaf, and at best vaguely patronising. Thank heavens, then, that the trailer did Dumplin’ such a disservice. Starring Danielle Macdonald (who broke out in the excellent 2017 film Patti Cake$) as Willowdean, a self-described “fat girl” who enters a local pageant to annoy her former beauty queen mother (Jennifer Aniston), Dumplin’ is as funny, warm and sensitive as its protagonist – and with a killer Dolly Parton-laden soundtrack to boot.1320 Dark (TV series, one season, 2017–)This sci-fi thriller – which features disappearing children, a mysterious local power plant, and scenes set in the Eighties – has, for obvious reasons, drawn comparisons to Stranger Things. But Dark is even more beguiling and (true to its name) less family-friendly than Stranger Things.1420 The Death and Life of Marsha P Johnson (Film, 2017)Though it’s been somewhat tarnished by claims that director David France appropriated the work and research of trans film-maker Reina Gossett, this documentary is nonetheless a loving, respectful tribute to gay rights activist Marsha P Johnson. One of the key figures in the Stonewall uprising (though her involvement was almost entirely eradicated in 2015’s critically hated Stonewall), Johnson modelled for Andy Warhol, performed onstage with drag group Hot Peaches, helped found the Gay Liberation Front, and then died under suspicious circumstances in 1992.1520 On My Block (TV series, one season, 2018–)This coming-of-age series might not have found as many eyeballs as it deserved last year, but those it did find were glued to the screen. In fact, it was the most-binged show of 2018 – meaning that it had the highest watch-time-per-viewing session of any Netflix original. Created by Awkward’s Lauren Iungerich, On My Block follows a group of Los Angeles teens as they navigate both the drama of high school and the danger of inner-city life.Two beleaguered assistants (Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell) conspire to get their over-demanding bosses (Taye Diggs and Lucy Liu) together in order to get their lives back in this winning romantic comedy. Set It Up is responsible not only for coining the term “over-dicking” (it’s much more innocent than it sounds), but for rejuvenating a tired genre.Martin Freeman stars as the father struggling to protect his young daughter from a zombie epidemic spreading across Australia. So far, so overdone. But this drama thriller, directed by Ben Howling and Yolanda Ramke and based on their 2013 short of the same name, throws a handful of unpredictable ners in the works.    1920 Godless (TV series, one season, 2017–)With shades of John Ford\u0027s The Searchers, this languorous western was critically acclaimed but swiftly forgotten after it landed on Netflix in 2016. Set in 1884, it\u0027s about Frank Griffin (Jeff Daniels) and his notoriously ruthless gang of outlaws’ pursuit of their injured former ally Roy Goode (Jack O’Connell), who is hiding out in a small town populated solely by women after a mining accident killed off all its men. A gun-toting Michelle Dockery, clearly relishing the change of scenery after years of Downton Abbey, and a taciturn Jack O’Connell, are on brilliant form.2020 Atypical (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)This coming-of-age series about a teenage boy with autism was sweet and well-intentioned from the start, but its first season was criticised for a handful of inaccuracies, and for its lack of autistic actors. Rather than drowning in a sea of defensiveness – as too many shows tend to do – it listened, and brought in autistic actors and writers for its excellent second season.120 Money Heist (TV series, one season, 2017–)Known as La Casa de Papel (House of Paper) in its native Spanish, Money Heist is Netflix’s most streamed non-English language show. The bank heist is a tired dramatic trope these days, but don’t let that, or the show’s bland English-language title, put you off – creator Álex Pina has made something special.

Ethnic minority workers also tend to have higher qualifications than their white counterparts.The findings, laid out in a speech by Bank of England chief economist Andy Haldane on Monday, reveal a wider ethnicity pay gap than raw statistics suggest. It is also a “strikingly” persistent gap, having narrowed less over the past quarter-century than the pay disparity between genders. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“The ethnicity pay gap problem in the UK is every bit as acute as the gender pay gap problem,” Mr Haldane said.Minority academics less likely to become professors than whitesOne in four BAME workers experience bullying and harassmentHe went on to argue for compulsory reporting of ethnicity pay gaps, drawing a parallel with the existing obligation on UK companies with 250 employees or more to reveal their gender pay gap. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe adjusted data also points to large variations between different ethnic groups. While mixed race workers earn 2 per cent more than their white peers, all other ethnic minorities earn less, ranging from 20 per cent less for people of Bangladeshi origin to 6 per cent less for workers of a Chinese background.The analysis emphasises the importance of looking at each group separately, rather than necessarily treating ethnic minorities as a single cohort, Mr Haldane said.While adjusting the raw data for the various characteristics helps explain a large part of the pay gap, it does not mean that part of the gap is justified, he noted.“In other cases the choice of an occupation or sector may be a personal decision, reflecting lifestyle and values, and less obviously a market failure or policy concern.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

generation from renewable sources is set to jump 50 per cent over the next five years, helped by a sharp increase in the number of solar panels on buildings, according to a report.The International Energy Agency (IEA) forecasts that an extra 1,200 gigawatts of\u0026nbsprenewable energy will be added globally by 2024 – equivalent to the current total power-generating capacity of the United States.However, it warned that the expansion remains well below what is needed to meet global sustainable energy targets.\u0026nbspThe report predicts that cost reductions and “concerted government efforts” will drive the increase in solar photovoltaic (PV) systems, which will account for 60 per cent of additional renewable capacity.“Renewables are already the world\u0027s second-largest source of electricity, but their deployment still needs to accelerate if we are to achieve long-term climate, air quality and energy access goals,” said Dr Fatih Birol, the IEA’s executive director.Created

continue to fall, we have a growing incentive to ramp up the deployment of solar PV.”The IEA’s study focuses on so-called distributed PV – solar panels placed on homes, offices and other buildings rather than in large-scale, purpose-built sites.This will account for half of additional solar capacity created in the next five years, the IEA said.Three-quarters of new distributed PV is to come from installations on industrial buildings, in part because economies of scale allow for bigger savings on electricity bills than homeowners can expect when they install a small number of solar panels.The cost of generating electricity from distributed solar PV systems is already below retail electricity prices in most countries and the IEA forecasts a further 15 per cent to 35 per cent drop by 2024.However, the report’s authors warned policymakers that retail electricity tariffs must be reformed to attract more investment in distributed PV while sharing costs fairly among consumers. \u0026nbsp“Distributed PV’s potential is breathtaking, but its development needs to be well-managed to balance the different interests of PV system owners, other consumers and energy and distribution companies,” Dr Birol said.\u0026nbsp“The IEA is ready to advise governments on what is needed to take full advantage of this rapidly emerging technology without jeopardising electricity security.”Only

It found that eventual costs were 20 per cent – or £14.3bn – higher, as the government had to cover delays and unplanned expenses, and missed out on income and profit from certain schemes.\u0026nbsp“Our public services cannot function without outsourcing. But when it goes wrong, it’s taxpayers who end up footing the bill,” said Dr Joshua Pritchard, senior researcher at Reform.“The £14.3bn wasted as a result of poorly drawn up and managed government contracts is inexcusable.”The biggest example of overspending is Crossrail, according to Reform’s report published on Monday.

The third contract – with Seaborne Freight, which infamously had no ships – was cancelled earlier after a big shipping firm withdrew its support for the company.The procurement, described as “rushed and risky” by parliament’s Public Accounts Committee, also opened the department to a court challenge from Eurotunnel, which had been excluded from the process, culminating in a £33m out-of-court settlement.The total £84.4m in extra expenses amounted to 82 per cent of the original value of the contracts, almost doubling their cost.The Reform think tank argues for the creation of an independent regulator for outsourcing, which makes up a third of total public spending and amounts to £4,227 per British citizen a\u0026nbspyear.It points out that organisations such as the National Audit Office and parliamentary select committees, which carry out the bulk of outsourcing investigations, lack the power to enforce change or sanction those responsible for overspending.“We need a new regulator with the power to prevent public money being squandered because of totally avoidable mistakes,” said Dr Pritchard.A Cabinet Office spokesman said: “This government will always champion the private sector\u0027s vital role in delivering our public services. But we have recognised that reform is needed - that is why over the past year we have made great strides in improving how we work with the private sector with the introduction of the outsourcing playbook, which sets out new policies to ensure contracts are always set up for success and services are protected in the event of a corporate failure.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Ethnic minority workers also tend to have higher qualifications than their white counterparts.The findings, laid out in a speech by Bank of England chief economist Andy Haldane on Monday, reveal a wider ethnicity pay gap than raw statistics suggest. It is also a “strikingly” persistent gap, having narrowed less over the past quarter-century than the pay disparity between genders. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“The ethnicity pay gap problem in the UK is every bit as acute as the gender pay gap problem,” Mr Haldane said.Minority academics less likely to become professors than whitesOne in four BAME workers experience bullying and harassmentHe went on to argue for compulsory reporting of ethnicity pay gaps, drawing a parallel with the existing obligation on UK companies with 250 employees or more to reveal their gender pay gap. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe adjusted data also points to large variations between different ethnic groups. While mixed race workers earn 2 per cent more than their white peers, all other ethnic minorities earn less, ranging from 20 per cent less for people of Bangladeshi origin to 6 per cent less for workers of a Chinese background.The analysis emphasises the importance of looking at each group separately, rather than necessarily treating ethnic minorities as a single cohort, Mr Haldane said.While adjusting the raw data for the various characteristics helps explain a large part of the pay gap, it does not mean that part of the gap is justified, he noted.“In other cases the choice of an occupation or sector may be a personal decision, reflecting lifestyle and values, and less obviously a market failure or policy concern.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Sebastian Smee looks back at the work of Gordon ParksFive months after the inauguration of president John Kennedy, Gordon Parks, the famous photographer for Life magazine, found himself on a plane to Rio de Janeiro. As he cruised along at 30,000 feet, an immense thought pressed in: I am about to save a boy’s life.His name was Flavio da Silva, and he lived in a favela called Catacumba on the steep hillsides of Rio. Days earlier, the boy had written: “This is a dream, and I shall end by awakening.”\u0026nbspBut it wasn’t. It wasn’t a dream. It was his life.Though neither he nor Parks could have foreseen it, Flavio was about to become a pawn in a battle between two media titans: one in the United States, the other in Brazil.

Life’s circulation at the time was around 7 million copies, the highest in the land, and its Republican-leaning editors weren’t shy about using that influence.\u0026nbspIt was the height of the Cold War. Fidel Castro’s grip on Cuba had tightened after the Bay of Pigs fiasco. Latin America looked vulnerable to a communist takeover. Life decided to launch a five-part series titled “Crisis in Latin America”. Parks, the first African American to work as a staff photographer at the magazine, was assigned to the second part.Brazil, like the US, had a new president, Jânio Quadros. Quadros inherited an economy in crisis. He implemented an austerity programme, of which the US approved. But when the United States offered $300m\u0026nbsp(£234m) in foreign aid in return for cooperating with US\u0026nbspopposition to Castro’s Cuba, Quadros rejected it. The offer, he felt, was an insult to Brazil’s autonomy. It was tantamount to a bribe.Life editors liked to script photo assignments in advance. Parks was told to go to the Rio favelas, “find an impoverished father with a family of eight to 10 children. Show how he earns a living. Explore his political leanings. Is he a communist, or about to become one?”They wanted Parks to round out the family shots with images providing some social context: ideally, a political rally in the favelas.Parks had been uneasy about the assignment from the beginning. He had his own ideas. But an ally at Life urged him to accept, saying: “Rio de Janeiro is a long, long way from Rockefeller Plaza. Who knows, you might just misinterpret your instructions?”The first thing was to find a suitable family. Parks went to the favelas on a steaming hot day in March 1961. He was accompanied by José Gallo, who managed the local bureau of Time Inc, Life’s owner. As they climbed up a “tangled maze of shacks”, Parks saw Flavio, who was carrying a 40-pound tin of water on his head and who – he would soon discover – suffered from severe asthma.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

His legs looked like sticks covered with skin and screwed into two dirty feet. He stopped for breath, coughing, his chest heaving as the water slopped over his shoulder and distended belly.”Parks had his subject. He met Flavio’s seven siblings in their home, high up the Catacumba hillside, and, that evening, his parents. Flavio’s mother, Nair, worked as a washerwoman. She was 35, and pregnant with their ninth child. His father, José Manuel, was 42. He had a kiosk selling kerosene and detergent.\u0026nbspMunizThe J Paul Getty Museum)Parks had travelled widely – including an earlier trip to Rio – but never had he seen such destitution. He and Gallo explained themselves and asked for permission to carry out their assignment. “You can photograph us,” José replied, eventually, “but you must show us in a good light.”“Just doing my job,” we journalists tell ourselves. The lives we affect, and sometimes rearrange, are rarely changed intentionally. We maintain this stance even when it feels suspiciously convenient, discharging us from the obligation to anticipate consequences.\u0026nbspThen again, some consequences are hard to anticipate.\u0026nbspParks finished his assignment, largely ignoring the instruction to focus on the father and his political leanings. Instead, he focused on Flavio and on Flavio’s brothers and sisters. He kept a diary of his days in the favela. He was there when the children woke up. He photographed them in the rudimentary kitchen. He even took them by car to Copacabana. The famous beach was just 15 minutes away, but they had never seen it, and Parks recorded their euphoric responses.\u0026nbspEach night he left the favela and returned, uneasy, to his room in Copacabana’s upscale Hotel Excelsior. Parks had grown up the youngest of 15 children and the victim of racist bullying. Now a parent himself, he couldn’t help but empathise with Flavio. He wrote of being “filled with confusion and guilt during my final days in Catacumba. Flavio, like thousands of other children, would die\u0026nbsp... I could not help compare the good fortune of my own children with the fate of these others”.But it wasn’t a lie.\u0026nbspPark’s photos appeared in the 16 June 1961, issue of Life under the heading, “Freedom’s Fearful Foe: Poverty.” You can see them in the first room of “Gordon Parks: The Flavio Story”, a riveting show at the Getty Museum in Los Angeles. The second, third and fourth rooms uncover the bewildering events that the photo essay set in motion.\u0026nbspParks belonged to a generation of photojournalists whose work could get massive exposure. He said he wanted his work “to draw people’s attention to the problems they show” and to play a role in effecting change. An admirer of President Kennedy, he hoped that the new president’s youth and progressive policies would have positive results. But he had seen firsthand, too, that the United States lacked credibility in Latin America. If it wanted to solve problems there, he realised, the United States needed first to “clean up its own yard”.Intimate, observant, poetically suggestive, Parks’s photos of Flavio and his family were the work of an artist. “Far from condescending, they utterly personalised ... and made intimate the tragedy of poverty,” Paul Roth wrote in the show’s terrific catalogue. (Roth’s essay is the source of much of the information in this story). They “punctured”, he said, Life magazine’s “conception of indigence as an abstract lure to an ideological foe” – communism.\u0026nbspParks’s photo essay was one of the most influential Life ever published. It provoked an enormous response from readers, who sent thousands of letters and unsolicited donations. When Life published excerpts from the letters in a subsequent issue, under the headline “A Great Urge to Help Flavio”, it included an appeal for more donations, which Life said it would use to move the Da\u0026nbspSilvas\u0026nbspto a modest new home and to seek medical treatment for Flavio.\u0026nbspParks flew back to Rio on 28 June to deliver the message. To his relief, Flavio’s parents needed no persuading to release Flavio to the care of a hospital in Denver. “Keep him in hospital as long as necessary but please bring him back cured and well,” his father said.\u0026nbspAt Parks’s hotel, Flavio had his first-ever bath (“The water was black,” Parks noted) and donned new clothes that Parks had bought for him. A team of people worked on getting Flavio a visa and on finding a suitable home for his family.The day came for the family to move out of Catacumba. Their story had spread, and a crowd gathered to watch. Parks, who was there to document the day, remembered a woman grabbing his shoulder and saying: “What about us? All the rest of us stay here to die!”\u0026nbspThat same night, Parks and Gallo drove Flavio to the airport,\u0026nbspand all three flew to the United States.In Denver, Flavio was treated at the Children’s Asthma Research Institute and Hospital. Life photographer Carl Iwasaki documented the first days of his life in Denver, including visits to the hospital, first days at school and a visit to an amusement park. The photographs of Flavio 2.0 – designed above all, it can seem, to make America feel good about itself – were published in the magazine’s 21 July issue.\u0026nbspThe repercussions of this intervention went beyond Flavio and his family. Editors at O Cruzeiro, an illustrated weekly in Brazil, took umbrage at Parks’s photo essay (which had appeared in a Spanish-language version of Life, distributed throughout South America).\u0026nbspO Cruzeiro had Brazilian nationalist leanings. Its editors objected to a high-circulation US\u0026nbspmagazine with an explicit political agenda coming to Brazil to point out problems that had not been solved in its own country.\u0026nbspTheir response was impudent, blunt and charged with chutzpah. They sent a photographer of their own, Henri Ballot, to New York City. After photographing the streets of impoverished communities in Spanish Harlem and on the Lower East Side, Ballot homed in on Puerto Rican immigrants Felix and Esther Gonzalez. They lived with their six children in a dilapidated, rat- and cockroach-infested tenement building on Rivington Street.\u0026nbspBallot’s photographs were published in the 7 October 1961 issue of O Cruzeiro. They revealed living conditions every bit as desperate as those of the Da Silvas. One photograph shows a child sleeping with three enormous cockroaches on his bare skin. Another shows a child with a bandage covering a rat bite on his forehead. O Cruzeiro rammed home its point by publishing some of Ballot’s New York images with insets showing Park’s original Rio images.\u0026nbspThe two magazines went to war, each accusing the other of staging its photographs – of, effectively, manufacturing “fake news”. And, as happens routinely in any polarised media environment, real people enduring real predicaments were reduced to pawns in a propaganda war.The ultimate guide to Rio de JaneiroHighway 61: Jessica Lange’s photography explores her midwestern rootsMeanwhile, in Denver, the transition proved tricky for Flavio. He struggled at school. But things slowly settled down. He learned English, adapted his behaviour and spent weekends with a Portuguese-speaking family, the Gonçalves. Over time, he had less and less contact with his family back in Rio. And when the treatment neared its conclusion after two full years, he was desperate to remain.\u0026nbspHe begged Parks and the Gonçalves to adopt him. Instead, in July 1963, Flavio returned to Rio, where he stayed briefly with his family before being sent to a boarding school in São Paulo. The schooling was arranged and paid for by Life.\u0026nbspParks maintained contact with Flavio after the boy’s return to Brazil, and in 1978, he published a book (Flavio) about the experience, which brought him back to Rio to gather material. Parks also visited in 1999 to film a documentary (Gordon Parks – Half Past Autumn). In each of those trips, the journalist saw that his subject’s struggles with poverty had never really abated.\u0026nbsp“As a photojournalist,” Parks wrote, with more than a tinge of melancholy, “I have occasionally done stories that have seriously altered human lives. In hindsight, I often wonder if it might not have been wiser to have left those lives untouched, to have let them grind out their time as fate intended.”Flavio himself, now retired from his job as a security guard, later reflected on the fact that, thanks to Parks, “people know more about my life than I do. I’m glad that I’m alive as a result ... (But) this story never made me feel either better or worse than anyone else.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The suits are then assembled – usually four months prior to flight.While there are no differences between a male and female spacesuit, female astronauts usually wear a smaller size.\u0026nbspBoth Ms Koch and Ms Meir are wearing medium-size suits, with Ms Koch’s spacesuit featuring red stripes.In a recent interview, Ms Koch spoke about the significance of this spacewalk, saying: “I think it’s important because of the historical nature of what we’re doing.“In the past women haven’t always been at the table.“It’s wonderful to be contributing to the space programme at a time when all contributions are being accepted, when everyone has a role.“That can lead in turn to increased chance for success. There are a lot of people who derive motivation from inspiring stories of people who look like them, and I think it’s an important story to tell.”Ms Koch, an electrical engineer, has been living in space since March while Ms Meir, a marine biologist, joined the ISS crew in September.Both are members of Nasa’s Astronaut Class of 2013.Ms Koch is more than 200 days into her mission and is slated to set a record for the longest single spaceflight by a woman – with an expected total of 328 days in space.Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

to jump 50 per cent over the next five years, helped by a sharp increase in the number of solar panels on buildings, according to a report.The International Energy Agency (IEA) forecasts that an extra 1,200 gigawatts of\u0026nbsprenewable energy will be added globally by 2024 – equivalent to the current total power-generating capacity of the United States.However, it warned that the expansion remains well below what is needed to meet global sustainable energy targets.\u0026nbspThe report predicts that cost reductions and “concerted government efforts” will drive the increase in solar photovoltaic (PV) systems, which will account for 60 per cent of additional renewable capacity.“Renewables are already the world\u0027s second-largest source of electricity, but their deployment still needs to accelerate if we are to achieve long-term climate, air quality and energy access goals,” said Dr Fatih Birol, the IEA’s executive director.Created with Sketch.Environment news in pictures

the three largest wildlife trafficking gangs operating at the height of Africa’s elephant poaching epidemic.“As costs continue to fall, we have a growing incentive to ramp up the deployment of solar PV.”The IEA’s study focuses on so-called distributed PV – solar panels placed on homes, offices and other buildings rather than in large-scale, purpose-built sites.This will account for half of additional solar capacity created in the next five years, the IEA said.Three-quarters of new distributed PV is to come from installations on industrial buildings, in part because economies of scale allow for bigger savings on electricity bills than homeowners can expect when they install a small number of solar panels.The cost of generating electricity from distributed solar PV systems is already below retail electricity prices in most countries and the IEA forecasts a further 15 per cent to 35 per cent drop by 2024.However, the report’s authors warned policymakers that retail electricity tariffs must be reformed to attract more investment in distributed PV while sharing costs fairly among consumers. \u0026nbsp“Distributed PV’s potential is breathtaking, but its development needs to be well-managed to balance the different interests of PV system owners, other consumers and energy and distribution companies,” Dr Birol said.\u0026nbsp“The IEA is ready to advise governments on what is needed to take full advantage of this rapidly emerging technology without jeopardising electricity security.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail

The prototypes we developed propose a possible future with anthropomorphic devices.”While the concept of artificial skin has been explored in the field of robotics as scientists attempt to develop robots that look and act like humans, the researchers said they were more interested in working with everyday devices.Dr Roudaut added: “We have seen many works trying to augment humans with parts of machines, here we look at the other way around and try to make the devices we use every day more like us, ie, human-like.”Additional reporting by Press AssociationShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The facts about this are clear and indisputable.“We believe the Labour Party made a terrible mistake when Salma Yaqoob was given her membership card and a terrible error of judgement in waiving the very sensible rule of requiring someone to have been a member for a significant period of time before being allowed to stand for public office.“We urge the Labour Party’s Regional Office and NEC to revisit and reverse these decisions immediately.”Ms Yaqoob has denied Ms Shah’s claims\u0026nbspbut accepted\u0026nbspher decision to stand against her was “ill-judged” and called for a “constructive resolution” that would allow them both to move on.She rejected claims she had described homosexuality as a “choice of lifestyle”, insisting\u0026nbspshe had in fact been referring in the BBC broadcast to religious communities whose faith was a matter of choice.“I was interrupted at that point and told being LGBT is not a lifestyle choice – a claim I had not made and do not believe,” she said. “I tried to clarify but was not given an opportunity to do so.”Ms Yaqoob added: “My support and defence of LGBTQ+ rights and equality is consistent and long-standing. Whilst I am not surprised, given the smears I have already been subjected to since standing for selection in the mayoral race, I am saddened at attempts to misportray my record of solidarity.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It found that eventual costs were 20 per cent – or £14.3bn – higher, as the government had to cover delays and unplanned expenses, and missed out on income and profit from certain schemes.\u0026nbsp“Our public services cannot function without outsourcing. But when it goes wrong, it’s taxpayers who end up footing the bill,” said Dr Joshua Pritchard, senior researcher at Reform.“The £14.3bn wasted as a result of poorly drawn up and managed government contracts is inexcusable.”The biggest example of overspending is Crossrail, according to Reform’s report published on Monday. Overruns and unexpected costs have cost the government an extra £2.8bn, while another £600m has been lost in\u0026nbspincome from passengers due to delays in opening the line.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Wales players celebrate after beating France in their Rugby World Cup quarter-final in Japan.

The third contract – with Seaborne Freight, which infamously had no ships – was cancelled earlier after a big shipping firm withdrew its support for the company.The procurement, described as “rushed and risky” by parliament’s Public Accounts Committee, also opened the department to a court challenge from Eurotunnel, which had been excluded from the process, culminating in a £33m out-of-court settlement.The total £84.4m in extra expenses amounted to 82 per cent of the original value of the contracts, almost doubling their cost.The Reform think tank argues for the creation of an independent regulator for outsourcing, which makes up a third of total public spending and amounts to £4,227 per British citizen a\u0026nbspyear.It points out that organisations such as the National Audit Office and parliamentary select committees, which carry out the bulk of outsourcing investigations, lack the power to enforce change or sanction those responsible for overspending.“We need a new regulator with the power to prevent public money being squandered because of totally avoidable mistakes,” said Dr Pritchard.A Cabinet Office spokesman said: “This government will always champion the private sector\u0027s vital role in delivering our public services. But we have recognised that reform is needed - that is why over the past year we have made great strides in improving how we work with the private sector with the introduction of the outsourcing playbook, which sets out new policies to ensure contracts are always set up for success and services are protected in the event of a corporate failure.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

His 2015 victory reasserted liberalism in Canada after almost 10 years of Conservative government and his presidency has been viewed as a beacon for liberals in the era of Donald Trump.However, political scandals involving attempted interference in the justice system and the resurfacing of old photos of Mr Trudeau in blackface and brownface have cast doubt on his judgement.In the interference scandal, Mr Trudeau’s former attorney general said he pressured her to halt the prosecution of a Quebec company, causing the Conservatives to call for the prime minister’s resignation.On Wednesday, Barack Obama made an intervention unprecedented\u0026nbspby a former US president when he urged Canadians to re-elect Mr Trudeau.“The world needs his progressive leadership now, and I hope our neighbours to the north support him for another term,” Mr Obama wrote.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He is MP\u0026nbspRegina - Qu\u0027Appelle in Southern Canada and is another young candidate at only 40 years old.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe father-of-five has not been without his own controversies. Scheer has been criticised\u0026nbspfor his opposition to abortion and refusal\u0026nbspto say whether he supports same-sex marriage.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspEarlier this month he admitted\u0026nbspthat he holds both Canadian and American citizenship after the information was revealed by Toronto newspaper\u0026nbspThe Globe and Mail.\u0026nbspScheer says he is renouncing his American citizenship, which he acquired because of his US-born father.It\u0027s not just the blackface scandal that\u0027s had a damaging impact on Justin Trudeau. The 47-year-old prime minister has disappointed some voters with his failure to overhaul Canada\u0027s electoral system, as he promised in his 2015 campaign.

They say the sector is making progress cutting greenhouse gas output.Workers’ rights groups have previously called for mass retraining in renewables to ensure former oil and gas employees are not left behind in the ongoing transition.

The finding provides strong evidence that the street was commissioned by Pontius Pilate, the Roman governor of the province of Judaea, best known for being the official who presided over the trial of Jesus and ordered his crucifixion.After six years of extensive archaeological excavations, a team\u0026nbspfrom the Israel Antiquities Authority and Tel Aviv University have uncovered a 220m section of\u0026nbspthe ancient street.The road ascends from the Pool of Siloam in the south to the Temple Mount.

From the mid-19th century, iron mining fundamentally altered Western Cumbria and the Furness peninsular, making a significant contribution to the national economy. However, site clearances following industrial decline in the second half of the 20th century, has left few surviving remains of the industry. Florence Mine is believed to have been the last iron mine to close in Europe and was last worked in 2007. Hematite iron ore from the mine is used for the pigment Egremont Red, still found in some lipsticks today.234 University of York, Campus West designed landscape. Heslington, YorkThe University of York Campus West designed landscape was laid out from 1963-1980 It is a high-quality post-war university landscape that fulfils the architects’ masterplan vision of creating a town in miniature with a pedestrianised environment. One of the key features of the landscape is the lake, which has two small islands, a courtyard pool and a fountain which form a central focal point at the heart of the campus. Offering bursts of green against the surrounding concrete structures are the lake features, reed beds and lily pads, which were introduced to improve water purity. The landscape is relatively unaltered since it was laid out and the design successfully integrates the new landscape with the historic Heslington Hall gardens. It was designed by distinguished mid-20th century architects Andrew Derbyshire and Maurice Lee of RMJM with Frank Clark, the co-founders of the Garden History Society (now The Garden Trust).334 University of York, Campus West designed landscape.

It is here that they made 17 gallon galvanised iron containers, designed for transporting milk by rail. The company was heavily associated with George Barnham, who invented the containers and went on to become chair of the British Dairy Farmers Association, Mayor of Hampstead and High Sheriff of Middlesex and was knighted in 1904.Travellers on the East Coast Main Line north of York typically pass the former Otterington Railway Station at over 100 miles per hour. This station building with its signal box was built by the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) in 1932 as a replacement for the Victorian station that had been cleared away to allow the expansion of the line to four tracks. 634 University of York, Central Hall. Heslington, YorkThe University of York was one of seven new universities founded in England between 1958 and 1961. Central Hall is the centrepiece of the University’s western campus and has a striking and bold design. The exceptionally detailed development plan behind the campus was heralded as the beginning of contemporary university planning in Britain. The building is a concrete structure with a suspended mild steel tubular roof clad in aluminium, with the upper floors, where the auditorium is located, cantilevered out on the lake sides. It continues a historic tradition established by late 19th century and early 20th century ‘red brick’ universities in featuring a great hall for special events.734 Pedestrian Subway, Vestibule, Terrace and Stairs beneath Crystal Palace Parade. South LondonThe Crystal Palace subway, vestibule, terrace and stairs provide an elaborate pedestrian passageway, with finely-crafted Byzantine-style vaulting in red and cream brick and chequered floors in alternating stone. The structure dates from 1865 and was built to link a new train station directly to the entrance of the Crystal Palace. Designed by highly-accomplished architect Charles Barry Junior, the quality of construction is excellent. It is an architecturally imaginative solution to the problem of transporting visitors beneath Crystal Palace Parade and providing a dramatic introduction to the palace itself. 834 Pedestrian Subway, Vestibule, Terrace and Stairs beneath Crystal Palace Parade.

The thatched memorial bus shelter at Osmington in West Dorset is located on the south side of the A353 and is an important landmark in the village. It dates to around the 1940s and was built by Harry and Ethel Parry-Jones in memory of their son, David, a lieutenant in the 1st Battalion of The Rifle Brigade who died at the age of 20 on 3 August 1944 during the Battle of Normandy. Local materials were used including Purbeck stone and thatch which complements the bus shelter’s surroundings. Despite its vulnerability as a piece of street furniture, the bus shelter has not been significantly altered since it was first built. It demonstrates that even modest and functional structures can form eloquent and valuable memorials for their local communities.Although modest in scale, the Assembly Rooms building has great presence with its bright, red brick exterior. This charming community hall boasts an exuberant design with its late-19th century, Jacobean Revival style, terracotta tiles and stone detailing.

Pendeen, CornwallThe parish of Pendeen in Cornwall was established in 1846, and its first vicar, Reverend Robert Aitken, was tasked to provide a church for the community. Aitken was renowned for his unusual preaching style and this was deemed to be well-suited to pull people away from the dominance of Methodism in the county’s mining communities. Aitken took it upon himself to design the church, the neighbouring vicarage and school, using local materials. Many of the fixtures and fittings were also made by local craftspeople, and Aitken donated his own collection of 16th century and 17th century Flemish and German glass roundels to enhance the windows. 1334 St John the Baptist Church, boundary walls, vicarage and school.

Traditionally, in Northern England, Iron Age and Romano-British native settlements take a variety of forms, with enclosures being defined by a bank and a ditch. Higher status enclosures, however, were formed of stone and have now been reduced to stony earthworks, as at East Mellwaters. The site is adjacent to other prehistoric settlement remains, which are thought to represent a succession of settlement sites established over the centuries. Architects Michael and Patty Hopkins built the house as a family home in 1975-1976, which also served as their office until the early 1980s. The couple designed and constructed the house as a study in making use of the maximum, flexible space of the site and were influenced by the Eames Case Study House of 1949. The house is notable for its energy efficiency, which includes the low thermal demands of the house, sparing use of materials and Venetian blinds. The highly elegant and economic lightweight steel frame and glass building made in the High-Tech tradition, is particularly eye-catching amongst the Victorian mansions typical of Hampstead and the Regency villas that make Downshire Hill distinctive from the rest of the village. The house won an RIBA award in 1977 and a Civic Trust Award in 1979. The couple jointly won the RIBA Gold Medal in 1994 and Michael Hopkins went on to receive a knighthood for his achievements in 1995.The former office of the Wiltshire and Gloucestershire Standard. The Wiltshire and Gloucestershire Standard was founded in Malmesbury in 1837 and its production moved to Cirencester in 1840. It has continued to bring local news to the people of the two counties ever since. In 1904 the paper’s owner, George Henry Harmer, who had worked his way up through the firm from reporter to proprietor, sought to unite the printing and publishing arms of the paper on the same site for the first time, and commissioned local architect VA Lawson to design a new publishing office on a narrow site in Dyer Street, retaining the existing printing sheds to the rear. The resulting three-storey building has an imposing presence in a street of otherwise modest Cotswold buildings. It is in an Arts and Crafts style, taller than its neighbours, with jetties which project the elaborate timber-framed upper floors out over the street.In 1934, Rolls Royce leased two hangars at the Hucknall airfield, which was established in 1917, and created a testing programme there for aero engines and equipment. The building is largely intact and features many surviving fixtures dating back to the mid-20th century, including an engine-testing control panel, observation windows, wing spar mount assembly, roller doors, pierced metal sheet lining, as well as fittings and support for a de-tuner.  The site saw many world-leading developments such as the Merlin Engine, which was tested, developed and adapted for the American Mustang fighter aircraft there. The world’s first flight of a commercial jet aircraft flew from Hucknall to the Paris Air show in the late 1940s, using Frank Whittle’s jet engine which had been developed on site.

Newcastle on Clun, ShropshireThe lych gate to the east of Church of St John the Evangelist in Newcastle on Clun dates from 1880 and forms a picturesque entrance to St John’s churchyard. The design follows the Arts and Crafts traditions, bringing together joinery, ironmongery and slate work and is inspired by medieval predecessors. The roof mimics that of the lych gate claimed to be the oldest in the country, at the Church of St George in Beckenham, Kent, originally constructed in the 13th century. Within the timber-framed passageway of the lych gate is a revolving gate, which is an unusual feature and one of only a handful in existence in England. ‘Lych’ derives from the Anglo-Saxon or German word for corpse, and is named after the structure’s primary function of storing the coffin before burial. Lych gates also serve as a meeting point and shelter for funeral parties before they are met by the priest.The fishing industry in Newlyn on the south coast of Cornwall expanded in the 1880s, resulting in the construction of a new harbour and two piers. In the early 20th century, the south pier was extended to give better protection to the harbour and a tidal observatory was built at its north end. The observatory was one of three constructed at the request of Ordnance Survey to establish Mean Sea Level.The former lifeboat house, built in 1884, was designed by CH Cooke and represents the crucial role played by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) in saving lives at sea since the 19th century. Its wide gabled structure and ornamental treatment, made up of fish-scale tiling, decorative moulded brick, and a beautifully incorporated bay window, create a finely detailed and strikingly composed building.2634 Cattle Trough and Drinking Fountain. Spaniards Road, HampsteadCattle troughs were once commonplace in Britain, with the politan Drinking Fountain and Cattle Trough Association (MDFCTA) responsible for over 1000 of them. Around 500 of these were located in London, however a large number have now been lost. The trough in Spaniards Road was believed to have been erected in 1916, making it a particularly late example of its type. Although the pump and spout mechanism are missing, the cattle trough is an important reminder that horse-drawn transport was commonplace in the early 20th century, despite the increasing use of motorised transport. In providing free drinking water for horses, charities like the MDFCTA also played an important role in raising standards in animal welfare.This early 17th century gatehouse to the former Caynton Manor is a remarkable survival, previously undiscovered. Originally a formal gateway to a wealthy country house, it has been used for agricultural purposes since the 18th century. While very little is known about the house which the gatehouse served, the quality of the gatehouse signifies a substantial building of high status. It is a well-proportioned building with a red sandstone base, a tiled roof and good quality detailing, characteristic of this building type at the time it was built, around 1635. Of particular interest is the carved detailing around the archways and the elaborate plasterwork in the principal rooms inside the gatehouse. This listing means that it can now be assessed for inclusion on Historic England’s Heritage at Risk Register, which would enable Historic England to offer specialist technical advice to help secure its future.This early 17th century gatehouse to the former Caynton Manor is a remarkable survival, previously undiscovered.

Chipping Camden, Gloucestershire The garden at Kingcombe complements Grade II listed Kingcombe House. It is an increasingly rare survival of an Arts and Crafts garden laid out in the 1930s. The pre-war garden is well-preserved and is an impressive and thoughtful design which includes Italian influences in the terraced garden including Italian steps to ide it from the more functional parts of the garden and to provide a vertical link from the top of the terraces to the meadow beyond the garden. Intact gardens dating from the 1930s are rare in England. It was designed initially by Sir Geoffrey Jellicoe and Russell Page with Sir Gordon Russell between 1927 and 1936 with later additions by Sir Gordon Russell from the 1940s through to the 1970s. During the Second World War and the austerity years that followed, few private houses were built so commissions for new gardens were few and far between.3034 Garden at Kingcombe.

Cappleside Barn in Ribblesdale, North Yorkshire was built in 1714. It is a large barn with a remarkable ornamental roof structure with carefully shaped timbers that also include carved motifs such as ‘daisy-wheels’. At first, Historic England thought that these roof timbers had been reused from a high-status medieval house, but dendrochronology has shown that the timbers came from trees felled shortly before the construction of the barn.

Florence Mine in West Cumbria is one of the best-surviving mining sites of any type nationally and is the best-surviving example of an iron mining pit head in England: it retains a full suite of buildings complete with nearly all of its machinery and equipment. From the mid-19th century, iron mining fundamentally altered Western Cumbria and the Furness peninsular, making a significant contribution to the national economy. However, site clearances following industrial decline in the second half of the 20th century, has left few surviving remains of the industry. Florence Mine is believed to have been the last iron mine to close in Europe and was last worked in 2007. Hematite iron ore from the mine is used for the pigment Egremont Red, still found in some lipsticks today.234 University of York, Campus West designed landscape. Heslington, YorkThe University of York Campus West designed landscape was laid out from 1963-1980 It is a high-quality post-war university landscape that fulfils the architects’ masterplan vision of creating a town in miniature with a pedestrianised environment. One of the key features of the landscape is the lake, which has two small islands, a courtyard pool and a fountain which form a central focal point at the heart of the campus. Offering bursts of green against the surrounding concrete structures are the lake features, reed beds and lily pads, which were introduced to improve water purity. The landscape is relatively unaltered since it was laid out and the design successfully integrates the new landscape with the historic Heslington Hall gardens. It was designed by distinguished mid-20th century architects Andrew Derbyshire and Maurice Lee of RMJM with Frank Clark, the co-founders of the Garden History Society (now The Garden Trust).334 University of York, Campus West designed landscape.

It is here that they made 17 gallon galvanised iron containers, designed for transporting milk by rail. The company was heavily associated with George Barnham, who invented the containers and went on to become chair of the British Dairy Farmers Association, Mayor of Hampstead and High Sheriff of Middlesex and was knighted in 1904.Travellers on the East Coast Main Line north of York typically pass the former Otterington Railway Station at over 100 miles per hour. This station building with its signal box was built by the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) in 1932 as a replacement for the Victorian station that had been cleared away to allow the expansion of the line to four tracks. 634 University of York, Central Hall. Heslington, YorkThe University of York was one of seven new universities founded in England between 1958 and 1961. Central Hall is the centrepiece of the University’s western campus and has a striking and bold design. The exceptionally detailed development plan behind the campus was heralded as the beginning of contemporary university planning in Britain. The building is a concrete structure with a suspended mild steel tubular roof clad in aluminium, with the upper floors, where the auditorium is located, cantilevered out on the lake sides. It continues a historic tradition established by late 19th century and early 20th century ‘red brick’ universities in featuring a great hall for special events.734 Pedestrian Subway, Vestibule, Terrace and Stairs beneath Crystal Palace Parade.

The pre-war garden is well-preserved and is an impressive and thoughtful design which includes Italian influences in the terraced garden including Italian steps to ide it from the more functional parts of the garden and to provide a vertical link from the top of the terraces to the meadow beyond the garden. Intact gardens dating from the 1930s are rare in England. It was designed initially by Sir Geoffrey Jellicoe and Russell Page with Sir Gordon Russell between 1927 and 1936 with later additions by Sir Gordon Russell from the 1940s through to the 1970s. During the Second World War and the austerity years that followed, few private houses were built so commissions for new gardens were few and far between.3134 Robin Hood and his Merry Men.

Cappleside Barn in Ribblesdale, North Yorkshire was built in 1714. It is a large barn with a remarkable ornamental roof structure with carefully shaped timbers that also include carved motifs such as ‘daisy-wheels’. At first, Historic England thought that these roof timbers had been reused from a high-status medieval house, but dendrochronology has shown that the timbers came from trees felled shortly before the construction of the barn.

The Temple Mount, located within the Old City of Jerusalem, has been venerated as a holy site for thousands of years. It is where Jesus is said to have cured a man’s blindness by sending him to wash in the Siloam Pool.The excavation revealed more than 100 coins trapped beneath paving stones. The latest coins were dated between 17AD and 31AD, which provides firm evidence that work began and was completed during the time that Pilate governed Judea.Study co-author Dr Donald Ariel, an archaeologist and coin expert with the Israel Antiquities Authority, said: “Dating using coins is very exact.SWNS)“As some coins have the year in which they were minted on them, what that means is that if a coin with the date on it is found beneath the street, the street had to be built in the same year or after that coin had been minted, so any time after.“However, our study goes further, because statistically, coins minted some 10 years later are the most common coins in Jerusalem, so not having them beneath the street means the street was built before their appearance, in other words only in the time of Pilate.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The researchers estimate that some 10,000 tons of quarried limestone rock was used in its construction, which the research team say would have required considerable skill.The opulent and grand nature of the street coupled with the fact that it links two of the most important spots in Jerusalem – the Siloam Pool and Temple Mount – is strong evidence that the street acted as a pilgrim’s route.Co-author Dr Joe Uziel, of the Israel Antiquities Authority, said: “If this was a simple walkway connecting point A to point B, there would be no need to build such a grand street.“At its minimum it is eight metres wide. This, coupled with its finely carved stone and ornate ‘furnishings’ like a stepped podium along the street, all indicate that this was a special street.”Study author Nahshon Szanton added: “Part of it may have been to appease the residents of Jerusalem, part of it may have been about the way Jerusalem would fit in the Roman world, and part of it may have been to aggrandise his name through major building projects.”The paving stones of the street were found hidden beneath layers of rubble, thought to be from when the Romans captured and destroyed the city in 70AD. The rubble contained weapons, including arrowheads and sling stones, remains of burnt trees, and collapsed stones from the buildings along its edge.The researchers say it is possible that Pilate had the street built to reduce tensions with the Jewish population.Dr Ariel added:“We can’t know for sure, although all these reasons do find support in the historical documents.”The study was published in the Journal of the Institute of Archaeology of Tel Aviv University.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The numbers will be tight today.One minister believes things are so close that the Speaker John Bercow may end up having to break a tied vote. It is remarkable that Boris Johnson is so close to winning this vote.When the Chief Whip Mark Spencer went through the numbers with the Cabinet on Wednesday, he had the Government succeeding by one vote with the support of the DUP’s ten MPs. But they are now voting against the deal.When Cabinet met again yesterday afternoon, Spencer “scrupulously avoided giving any numbers”, according to one of those present.Transport Secretary Grant Shapps, who did the numbers for Boris’s leadership bid, said the Government couldn’t afford to lose more than two or three of its own Brexiteers. But with them on board, victory was possible.Without the DUP’s support, which is gone despite Boris Johnson’s belief that they can still be won round, the Government will need the backing of  MPs who were elected as Labour in .Cabinet opinion is split on whether they can get this number. One Cabinet minister intimately involved in the bid to woo Labour MPs thinks they are going to get there.“We’re going to win”, this Secretary of State declares. Others in Cabinet are more sceptical though.One tells me: “I’ll believe it when I see it”, pointing out that Theresa May thought she would do better with Labour MPs on every meaningful vote than she actually did. This minister’s view: “We’re going to fall just short.”Another group whose position is key is the  MPs who lost the Tory whip for voting for the Benn Act, which forces the Government to ask for a Brexit extensionMPs don’t back this deal. Downing Street calculate that  of this group will vote for the deal.Three Cabinet ministers — Nicky Morgan, Michael Gove and Robert Buckland — met with a chunk of the  on Thursday afternoon. One of those present tells me: “It wasn’t great. Hammond was particularly dficult.”This source says that watching Hammond, he thought that the former Chancellor “can’t see past that hatred” he has for Boris Johnson.I suspect that most of the  will back the Government, most of them want a deal and many of them want the whip back so they can stand at the next election.As one senior Cabinet minister tells me: “Voting for us is the way back in. We need to be able to count on them for the WAB”, the Withdrawal Agreement Bill.Then, there are those so-called Spartans — the Tory Brexiteers who wouldn’t vote for May’s deal even at the third time of asking. Downing Street is confident that pretty much all of them will back the deal.I understand that David Trimble, the former Northern Ireland First Minister who won the Nobel Peace Prize for the Good Friday Agreement, will attend this morning’s meeting of the hardcore Brexiteer European Research Group to explain why the deal is in line with the Good Friday Agreement, contrary to what the DUP say.Today, MPs have a chance to honour the referendum result. To vote for a deal that will deliver a smooth, orderly and amicable departure from the EU.If they vote to block it, then they will have shown that they are just determined to stop Brexit and that all those promises to respect the referendum result were made with their fingers crossed behind their backs.THERE’S always a twist with Brexit and today’s is something called the Letwin amendment.If it passes, it would prevent a clean up or down vote on the deal. That would have to wait until a second reading on Tuesday.Instead, the Letwin amendment would force Boris Johnson to request an extension regardless and the Commons would only vote on his deal once all the relevant legislation is through.As one exasperated ally of the PM puts it, the vote on the Letwin amendment is “almost as signicant as the vote itself”. The Letwin amendment is just a preview of the parliamentary mischief to come.As the Government tries to get the Withdrawal Agreement Bill through, MPs will try to add all sorts of things to it.Expect amendments trying to compel the Government to negotiate a customs union with the EU or follow EU rules on things even after Brexit.In a way, these amendments won’t matter. They won’t change the content of the treaty the UK has signed with the EU.But they will impose legal obligations on the Government. Now,Boris won a majority in an election, he could override these changes.But the danger for him is that Nigel Farage and the Brexit Party could attack him in the campaign for having passed a deal that has had all these horrors added to it.WE may have a sensible chief medical officer at last.After Sally Davies – who wanted a ban on eating and drinking anything other than water on public transport – we have Chris Whitty.In his first public outing this week, he argued that people should exercise more, stop smoking and keep talking to slow the aging process. Sensible, commonsense advice.Whitty, who was the force behind tackling the  Ebola outbreak, is a pleasant change from the lecturing of the past few years.NUMBER  are oddly relaxed about whether the deal passes today or not. One of the Prime Minister’s most trusted confidants describes it as, “an each-way bet for Boris”.Why, because – in his words –voters, “learn on Saturday that the deal has been voted down, who are they going to blame: Boris or the MPs They’ll blame the MPs”. Inside Number , they think thatBrexiteer MPs back the deal and Remain MPs block it, they can have A CAKE AND EAT IT election strategy.In Labour Leave-supporting seats in Wales, the West Midlands and the North East, they can say: “Your MP is blocking Brexit, vote for us to get it done.”While in the seats they are defending against the Liberal Democrats that are more nervous about Brexit, they can say: “Back us and the UK will leave in a smooth and orderly fashion:This two-pronged message would be electorally potent. It would give the Tories a chance of winning their biggest majority in more than  years.Number  are determined to keep trying for an election despite the Commons blocking it. One source jokes that MPs will be “voting on an election every day until they crack”.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That’s not an easy tightrope to negotiate, and this wasn’t a simple tour for Kate or William for so many reasons.Obviously, security has had to be incredibly tight, far more so than even they are used to, and both of them will have had a full, and possibly rather alarming, briefing from British security services.Then there’s the bittersweet emotional impact on William, who has been retracing his mother’s footsteps during this trip.Diana visited Pakistan several times as a guest of the now Prime Minister Imran Khan and his then we Jemima Goldsmith. She also fell deeply in love with Pakistani-born surgeon Hasnat Khan, and the country and its people always held a special place in her heart.William would have felt very close to his mum as he reconnected with Imran Khan and then went to the same cancer hospital in Lahore that Diana visited just a year before her death.Kate paid her own tribute with a series of stunning outfits subtly taking inspiration from Diana. It’s at times like these that William must miss his mum, and all credit to him for being able to remember her with love and affection, rather than sorrow and trauma.The show-stopping moment for me was when the royal couple emerged from a highly decorated tuk tuk for a glittering reception in Islamabad.Kate was wearing the most stunning emerald gown I think I have ever seen.It was Oscar red carpet-worthy, andthere aren’t copies on the high street for our Christmas parties very soon I will not be best pleased.She looked equally gorgeous a couple of days later playing cricket while wearing a cream shalwar kameez and white trainers.Kate has quietly and effectively emerged as the Queen’s top asset in the Royal Family.Camilla will obviously never have anything like the same respect and affection as Her Majesty, but skipping a generation, Kate has all the attributes to be a very effective Monarch one day at William’s side. She’s bright, beautul and has a big big heart.Since becoming a mum of three, Kate is a much more confident charity ambassador and public speaker, and she’s developed a real connection with all of the children she meets, putting them at ease and making them smile.If the Royal Family is to survive it will all be down to this quiet but determined woman. It’s a heavy burden to place on such slim shoulders, but Kate is more than up to it.THE late Leah Bracknell might have had terminal cancer, but she lived le to the full.The Emmerdale star, who played Zoe Tate for  years and whose death was announced this week, laughed, loved and seized the day.She didn’t do many interviews, but came in to talk to me on my show a couple of years ago after her diagnosis.Leah was funny, brave and determined not to be defined by her illness. She described herself as a “cancer rebel” and we were overwhelmed with ­messages of support and respect for this remarkable woman.She lived and died on her own terms and will be sadly missed.It will be incredible to have the teeniest, tiniest idea of what incredible people such as Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and our own Helen Sharman and Tim Peake experienced.For a lelong space geek like me, who watched the moon landings and wanted to be part of the crew of Star Trekthis is the trip of a letime.Will tell you all about it when I’m back.WHAT the hell do these clowns calling themselves environmental “warriors” hope to achieve by targeting hard-working people trying to get to work in the morning Scenes on the London Tube this week were deeply disturbing and frightening, andExtinction Rebellion don’t get a grip, someone is going to get seriously hurt – or even killed.At least they have admitted it was a spectacular own goal to pick on the eco-friendly electric underground, especially during rush hour.They know full well such stupidity has alienated many potential sympathisers.Violence can never be condoned, but I completely understand the sheer frustration of men and women who just wanted to get to their jobs on time, and who took action by pulling a demonstrator off the roof of a train as he kicked out.At one point it was like a chilling scene from a horror film.Most of us agree we need to take action to reverse the effects of climate change before it’s too late, but these sorts of daft demos are not the way to win hearts and minds.As well as being disruptive for the sake of it, such inflammatory actions are potentially extremely dangerous.Believe me, there IS such a thing as bad publicity and although we might be talking about Extinction Rebellion, we aren’t discussing the importance and far bigger picture of global warming.I just don’t expect to see such toxic scenes in the UK, and far from being “warriors”, these idiots are best described as another word beginning with W. And I think we all know which one that is.There are many twists and turns, but suffice to say Arnie is back with some hilariously deadpan zingers, the special effects are in a league of their own, andyou don’t shed a tear at the end you are an unfeeling terminator machine.SCOTT MITCHELL is one of the loveliest men in all of the world. He is having to watch his beloved we Barbara Windsor slowly dissolve in front of his eyes due to the s****y disease that is Alzheimer’s.He has been by her side every step of the way and is now full-time carer for a woman who was once the epitome of independence and the le and soul of the party. This week Scott confessed that he feels “racked with guilt”he leaves his beloved Barbara alone even for a few hours.Scott is fiercely protective of the woman he adores and so patient when the illness has her confused and endlessly repeating herself. He and Barbara have raised thousands of pounds for Alzheimer’s charities as well as vital awareness of the disease.I really just want to give Scott a massive hug, tell him he’s doing a brilliant job and he has absolutely nothing to feel guilty about. Obviously It’s desperately sad that our Barbara is going through such a hellish time, but she struck gold when she met and married her Scott.Vile trolls sending death threats to head judge Shirley Ballas after Radio  DJ Dev was booted off the show last weekend really need to take a long, hard look at themselves.You might have vehemently disagreed with their decision and thrown your popcorn, crisps and prosecco at the TV – or was that just me  – when Dianne and Dev danced their last, but can we just hold on and try to put it all into perspective  It’s a wonderful, warm, fuzzy show that is supposed to be pure entertainment.What in the name of Len Goodman is going on when a couple being voted off a TV show ends up causing such pain and distress to a lovely woman like Shirley Strictly stupid, silly and sad.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is desperate stuff. Those rights would be set by any Government voters elect. And there are no votes in tearing up rights.Other Labour MPs contort logic by claiming Boris’s deal is a “Trojan Horse to No Deal”. It is just dishonest.They claimed their only fear was No Deal. Now a deal is here, they oppose it.At least the DUP has a solid objection. But they should rethink. We believe they are making a historic mistake. So does ex-First Minister David Trimble, Nobel Prize-winning author of the Good Friday Agreement. He backs the deal.All MPs must put aside self-interest now. This deal is a clever compromise they can unite around. Labour moderates in Leave seats fear reprisals from Corbyn’s mob — but they need the same courage a few have already shown.They will be heroes to their constituentsthey make the right call.Since  pompous Remainer pundits have loved to declare Brexit “undeliverable”. It was always nonsense. Boris and the EU will deliver it. Only Remainers’ intransigence stands in the way.They should know this: Voters won’t blame Boris nowBrexit isn’t done. Those days are over. They will blame those who snatched it away and put their own tribal interests first. MPs must instead do the right thing today:Defeat Letwin’s ill-disguised vandalism.

And I think I really tried to adopt the British sensibility of a stf upper lip.“I’ve tried but I think that what that does internally is probably really damaging.“I never thought this would be easy. But I thought it would be fair and that’s the part that’s really hard to reconcile.“But I do just take each day as it comes.”Royal fans were distracted by a reflection of Prince Harry cradling baby Archie in the background while his we was being interviewed during the documentary.Meghan was discussing how successful she thought the trip had been so far when eagle eyed fans were distracted by a reflection of Harry and his son.The new dad can be seen cradling his son and rocking him from side to side while he thinks no one can see him.Harry admitted he and brother Wills have grown apart — saying: “We’re certainly on dferent paths.”He added: “As brothers, you have good days, you have bad days.”Harry said the pressure on the royals means “inevitably stuff happens”.He continued: “But look, we’re brothers, we’ll always be brothers — and we’re certainly on dferent paths at the moment.But I’ll certainly always be there for him as I know he’ll always be there for me.Harry was askedhe worried whether Meghan may face the same pressures as his mum, the late Princess Diana, who died in  in a car crash in Paris.He said: I will always protect my family, and now I have a family to protect.So everything that she [Diana] went through, and what happened to her, is incredibly important every single day, and that is not me being paranoid, that is just me not wanting a repeat of the past.He said: I thought I was out of the woods and then suddenly it all came back, and this is something that I have to manage.Part of this job is putting on a brave face but, for me and my we, there is a lot of stuff that hurts, especially when the majority of it is untrue.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Almost every day. I could feel him watching me. It made me feel incredibly uncomfortable.“Up until that point I had never felt unsafe or uneasy at my own house. I’d never encountered this kind of behaviour before.”Harry, who upgraded security at the North London house and had a “panic lock” fitted on his bedroom door, said feelings of dread and anxiety remained even after he was arrested.He added: “I have had to employ a night guard. I continue to lock my bedroom during the night.“I find myself assessing my residence and weak spots in it. I worry about it. If I see people on multiple occasions I view them dferently than I would before.”His rise to fame was sparked by him auditioning alone for the X Factor back in April .He was put together with Niall Horan, Liam Payne, Louis Tomlinson, and Zayn Malik as a group to huge acclaim on the show.One Direction were born and although they only finished third it soon became clear they would make it big.Simon Cowell signed them to Syco Records in January  on a £million deal and their first single What Makes You Beautul rocketed to Number One in the charts.But after enormous success, Zayn split from the lads in early  and in August that year the group went on an extended hiatus and have never reformed since.Harry scored a Number One hit with his own solo offering Sign of the Times in April  and his acting role in Dunkirk earned him praise.He has previously admitted struggling with some aspects of fame.In May  he said: “It’s really hard to go from doing a show with thousands of people there to your hotel room — from being around people to nothing.“After five years of doing that, I learnt a lot about myself. There’s no textbook telling you how to go through that stuff.”During the one-day trial Tarazaga-Orero lied that Harry, worth an estimated £million, had suggested they went back to a hotel for fun.But he was found guilty of stalking Harry, who this month released new solo single Lights Up, from April to June this year.Today Tarazaga-Orero carried a copy of the Gita - a Hindi holy book adopted by the Hare Krishna movement - and wore a necklace of paper flowers in the dock.District Judge Nigel Dean rubbished Tarazaga’s claims over the hotel room and said he had targeted Harry for his money.He said: “The defendant is neither a credible witness or a reliable one.“He was interviewed at somein July. He was asked by police.“He told them he had been there in December and he tried to ask Mr Styles for help.“He said he has lots of money and he though he was kind and that he could help.“Mr Styles felt sorry for a young man he saw to be living without a home in winters when it was raining heavily.“He was trying to help another for who he felt sorry and was down on their luck.“He knew perfectly well what he was doing amounted to harassment of Mr Styles.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

More than  per cent of voters in my mining villages voted Leave in .”She concluded rightly that the public “feel MPs should work together to resolve Brexit” instead of “slugging it out.”Her attacks at the weekend on the anti-Brexit brigade are part of a consistent pattern since , driven by her belief that the will of the British people must be fulfilled.Her approach is all the more potent because she actually voted Remain in the referendum.But, unlike too many other Remainers in Parliament, she accepted the verdict and has battled to make Brexit work.In that quest, she has had no time for the Parliamentary shenanigans and legalistic manoeuvres that have dominated the withdrawal process, with MPs always “kicking the issue down the road.”Nor, in contrast to most of Labour, does she favour membership of the Single Market and Customs Union, which she said in  would represent “staying in the EU in all but name.”For her principled stand, she has been viciously condemned by others on the left, who have called her a Tory, a turncoat and a traitor.With typical fortitude she has shown no signs of buckling.“I was not elected to Parliament to bow to threats and intimidation. I won’t now,” she says.The charge of treachery is absurd, given that she is abiding by Labour’s  manesto.Moreover, she has devoted most of her adult le to the party.Caroline Flint in  - shes been a Labour MP for  yearsHer warm but steely confidence is a reflection of her tough working-class upbringing.Her deprived background is very dferent from the worlds of privilege inhabited by so many of the affluent liberal Remainers.She was born in  in a home for unmarried mothers in London, the daughter of a -year-old typist Wendy Beasley who later died of alcohol-related liver problems.Flint never knew her biological father.At the age of two, she was adopted by a couple who lived in a one bedroom flat.“My sister and I slept on one side and my parents on the other,” she later recalled of her childhood.Her adoptive parents split up when she was .Her dficulties continued into her young adulthood.Though she was the first member of her family to go to university, she embarked in  on a disastrous marriage to Saief Zammel, a Tunisian stockbroker, by whom she had two children.The marriage fell apart after a series of incidents, including Zammel’s arrest on charges of violent disorder.He was eventually deported from Britain, and Flint was left to bring up their children alone.These were hard times, during which she was turned down for a job at Woolworth’s.But she turned her le around, partly through her involvement with the Labour movement.An MP for  years, she has been a card-carrying Labour member for  years, since she first joined when she was just .Before she was elected to the Commons, she worked as an official for the GMB trade union.“She has more integrity in her little finger than many in that place,” says her fellow Labour MP Laura Smith, referring to the barrage of criticism Flint has endured in Parliament.Despite the fury from the pro-EU mob, she seems to have her Don Valley constituency behind her, precisely because she represents its views.“I think she’s wonderful, absolutely wonderful. She has listened to her constituents, it’s as simple as that,” said Bob Davis, an engineer.Flint was reelected by her constituency Labour party last week, after a petition to throw her out got just  signatures.Part of the admiration for her stems from her capacity – as she has shown over Brexit – to speak her own mind, instead of meekly following the trendy left-wing orthodoxy.So while others in her party wailed about Tory benefit cuts, she attacked the culture of welfare dependency, where claimants expected something for nothing.Given her experience, it is a travesty to pretend she is some kind of anti-Labour hack.With her roots in the working-class, she is far more in touch with ordinary people that most posturing, preening Remainers.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Northern Ireland has until the stroke of midnight to restore its power-sharing executive - otherwise decriminalisation will take effect. Today anti-abortion members ed to the Stormont chamber for the first time in two-and-a-half years in a desperate last-ditch bid to block the law. But their attempt to rush through the move fell apart as it became clear a new Speaker could not be elected with both unionist and nationalist support. Sinn Fein refused to turn up to the sitting at all - branding it a circus. SDLP leader Colum Eastwood turned up, but slammed anti-abortion members for using and abusing peopleaposs emotions and sensitivities in a way that would undermine Northern Ireland peace. He then stood up and walked out - taking other SDLP members with him.  That left anti-abortion DUP leader Arlene Foster in  the chamber to denounce the scene as a shameful day that would give Northern Ireland the most liberal abortion regime anywhere in Europe. She fumed this is not a day of celebration for the unborn and said her party would explore every possible legal option to oppose it. She then also walked out. It left a bizarre scene where the Speaker proposed to an empty chamber that the Assembly adjourned - and no one was left to answer him. Northern Ireland has been the only part of the United Kingdom that does not allow same-sex marriage. And unlike the rest of the UK Northern Ireland has a ban on abortions in almost all cases, even rape or incest, except where a motheraposs le is at risk. That has forced desperate mums to cross the Irish Sea for terminations and left Northern Ireland law stricter in both cases than the Republic. Campaigners who fought for decades to end both restrictions have already started celebrating the momentous change.  So MPs in London voted overwhelmingly in July to overhaul both lawsBelfastaposs devolved executive - long dormant thanks to splits between unionists and nationalists - had still not been restored by October . Once the th-century laws that criminalise abortion lapse at midnight, the Government will assume responsibility for introducing new regulations to provide greater access to terminations in the region by next April. In the interim period, women will be offered free transport to access abortion services in England. Under the Act, same sex marriage will become legal in Northern Ireland in January, with the first wedding expected the following month.

The House of Commons Speaker trashed the Prime Ministeraposs attempt to re-run a vote that ended in him being forced to delay Brexit on Saturday. Itaposs a humiliating blow for Boris Johnson, who keeps getting knocked back with just  days left until the Brexit deadline. Yet it was widely expected, isnapost actually that shocking - and crucially, doesnapost actually make any dference to the Brexit deal. So what on earth has happened, what is Erskine May, what happens now and will we leave the EU by October   Hereaposs everything you need to know.  Boris Johnson tried to put his Brexit deal to a aposcleanapos yes or no vote - for a second time in three days - but was blocked in a ruling by the House of Commons Speaker. The Prime Minister wanted a fresh start after the first vote, on Saturday, ended in him being voted down and forced to ask for a Brexit delay instead. But John Bercow scuppered the PMaposs plans by saying having a new vote would go against Commons procedure. That is because Parliamentaposs rules clearly says MPs canapost be given a two votes on the same matter in the same Parliamentary session, unless circumstances change. Speaker Bercow said since thereaposs been little change since  hours ago, the motion will not be debated today as it would be repetitive and disorderly to do so. Remind me, what happened on Saturday again   Boris Johnson put forward a motion to give a green or red light to his Brexit deal. But MPs voted to amend his motion, to withhold approval for the Brexit deal unless and until every part of it has been passed into UK law. The amended motion passed without a formal vote because Boris Johnson refused to take part. Tory ministers claimed that rendered the vote on Saturday meaningless. This is simply untrue. MPs stated their view - and refused to back the PMaposs deal as it is now. What is Erskine May and how is it relevant   Parliamentaposs enormous, baffling rule book - which John Bercow is meant to follow. It says on page : “A motion or an amendment which is the same, in substance, as a question which has been decided during a session may not be brought forward again during that same session.” Effectively that means Boris Johnson couldnapost hold two votes in the same year on the same issue unless the circumstances changed. Speaker Bercow said the government had offered no explanation of how the circumstances had changed since Saturday.Eventhe dference was asking for a delay, this is not persuasive, the Speaker said. He added: Today’s motion is in substance the same as Saturday’s motion and the House has decided the matter”. How signicant or shocking is Speaker Bercowaposs ruling   Not very signicant and not very shocking - despite what Brexiteers might claim. First of all, Speaker Bercow was widely expected to make todayaposs ruling because the PMaposs behaviour was seen by many as being outside the rules.Secondly, it doesnapost actually make any meaningful dference to whether Brexit will pass - more of this below. Despite this, Brexiteers voiced fury at the Speaker - who they believe is biased - as Tory Bernard Jenkin sniped: It’s remarkable how often you please one lot and not the other lot”.And David T C Davies fumed: “[Your rulings] always seem to favour one side of the argument and never the government. Critics suggested Boris Johnson - who shamefully dodged the Commons session altogether - only tried for todayaposs vote in the first place so he could cynically accuse Parliament of thwarting Brexit. Does this mean the Brexit deal is dead   No. Whatever happened, the PMaposs Brexit deal still would still have to be agreed by Parliament through a law called the Withdrawal Agreement Bill . Onlythe bill passes will it complete the legal process of Brexit - allowing Mr Johnson to retract or cut short his reluctant request to the EU for an extension.  Late tonight the Government will publish the Withdrawal Agreement BIll ahead of its first debate in the House of Commons tomorrow. Afterit is passed on Tuesday, Tory Jacob Rees-Mogg will introduce the aposprogramme motionapos - the governmentaposs proposed order of business for week. It could spell out late night and weekend sittings in a bid to get the WAB passed. This is a risky moment - as MPs can vote to take control of the agenda, denying the government the opportunity to bring the WAB to its next stage.Eventhey manage to keep control of the agenda in the Commons MPs will then propose amendments to the WAB, likely on Wednesday. More of this below. If the government wants to avoid a delay it must ensure that the WAB is passed by the end of the week. Any later and the delay becomes more likely as the European Parliament has indicated it will not have the time to scrutinise the deal ahead of Halloween.Will the Brexit deal get through Parliament   The first big vote on Tuesdaywill be on a kne edge. Downing Street believes it has the numbers, with many of  ousted Tories - plus  to  Labour backbenchers - in favour even though Labour and the DUP are against. Former Tory cabinet minister Amber Rudd has indicated she would support Mr Johnsonaposs deal and thought there was a coalition for getting the Prime Ministeraposs deal through. Meanwhile Labour MP Caroline Flint has already said she will back the deal - and she may carry some of the Labour ‘MPs for a Deal’ with her. But thereaposs a massive spanner in the works to come. As part of the process MPs have the opportunity to debate possible amendments. These are likely to be on whether to add a customs union, a second referendum and to extend transitional arrangements with the EU to prevent the UK crashing out in . This could radically change the shape of the deal that was negotiated with the EU - possibly prompting No to pull the deal altogether, plunging Britain into limbo or no-deal and pushing for an election. MPs like Lisa Nandy have said they would not back the whole deal as it stands, but seek to amend it. Various groups in parliament are hurriedly planning to put forward amendments which could complicate things. Will Brexit still happen on October    It is possible. Mr Johnson might still get his deal through Parliament in time for the deadline, wiping out the need for delay. And secondly, a final decision on whether to delay Brexit hasnapost been made yet - itaposs in  EU leadersapos hands. The Prime Minister and his ally  Michael Gove  have insisted they can still get Brexit through by October , and even claim no-deal is still possible. Mr Gove chaired a meeting of the no-deal planning committee on Sunday and triggered emergency plan Operation Yellowhammer, moving hundreds of civil servants off their day jobs into full-time operation centres. If MPs agree the deal before the end of the week then it possible that the European Parliament can complete its votes in time for Halloween. But every day makes it less likely that deal will be approved in Westminster, and Brussels before the end of the month.  They will almost certainly grant an extension - despite making noises to the contrary. But they could turn down the three-month suggested period to suggest a dferent one instead. Today the European Parliament shelved their own vote on the deal because they want to wait for the UK parliament to pass the Withdrawal Agreement Bill. They want an extension - but the EU is very keen not to be held responsible for any delay so would seek an extra EU Parliament session to vote on the deal next week. French President Emmanuel Macron went furthest. I am not trying to read into the future but I do not think we shall grant any further delay,” he said last week They are certainly annoyed to have their own plans disrupted yet again, but very few people seriously expect the EU to say noa request comes in.German Chancellor Angela Merkel is among those who has indicated as much. The big question is how long an extension would be. Would they grant just two weeks of technical extension to allow the withdrawal bill legislation to pass through Parliament  Or would they insist on a longer one - until the end of January as set out in the Benn Act perhaps - to give the UK time to resolve this once and for all.  Will Boris Johnson be forced to accept an extension  Yes -    MPs do not vote it down in Parliament. That is, at least, according to the terms of the Benn Act which the PM could try to subvert or somehow get around. What does all this mean for an election   If MPs spend the next two weeks legislating on  Brexit, a general election  cannot be held before Christmas. Labour is unlikely to trigger a confidence vote, which could collapse Boris Johnsonaposs administration, while the legislative process is ongoing. And because of the five-weeks legally needed between the calling of a snap ballot and a poll being held, taking up parliamentary time until  Halloween  mean the earliest ballot would be held is in January. That is because Cabinet Secretary Sir Mark Sedwill has reportedly warned an election should not take place after December  in the run-up to Christmas. But early January will not see an election either because no-one wants the festive season to be overshadowed by electoral campaigning. So the next likely date would be mid-February. Boris Johnson finally agreed a Brexit deal with the EU on  October , though it still needs approval by MPs.

But it scraps the Irish backstop, an insurance policy designed at preventing a hard border between Northern Ireland the Republic. In the backstopaposs place would effectively be apostwo bordersapos in a hybrid system:Northern Ireland and Britain would share a legal customs territory - technically forcing customs checks on goods crossing the -mile border with the Republic. But in practice, to avoid checks at the border, the checks will instead happen when goods reach Northern Ireland on the island of Ireland. Critics say this puts a customs border across the Irish Sea - more of this below.  Northern Ireland and the Republic would share some EU single market rules - forcing checks on manufactured and agricultural products crossing the Irish Sea.The Northern Ireland Assembly - known as Stormont - will get a vote every four years on whether to let EU law continue.

MPs are snappy and irritable and bearing a collective headache that is preventing them from thinking straight. The uncertainty is not helping. The Government will today try  to hold a meaningful vote on Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal  but this is expected to be ruled out of order by the Speaker on the grounds it is similar to the motion tabled on Saturday. Commons rules, depending on their interpretation, prevent the same motion being tabled in the same parliamentary sitting. If the vote does go ahead Downing Street is confident it has the numbers. Stand by for furyshould John Bercow thwart the plan. On Tuesday there will be the second reading of the Withdrawal Agreement Bill which will be weighed down with amendments like an over-decorated Christmas tree. These will include a fresh attempt to push for a softer Brexit based around UK membership of the customs union and yet another attempt for a second referendum. Brussels is reported to be waiting to seethe  Withdrawal Agreement Bill passes its second reading before deciding on whether to grant an extension.  My colleague Dan Bloom has done  an excellent explainer of how the week could pan out here . The problem for the anti-Brexiteers is they cannot agree on the best way forward. Justine Greening, for instance, this morning said she would back the amendment calling for a second referendum but not the one on the customs union. You fear that by the end of week Parliament will have yet again proved, in case this was not already apparent, that it knows what sort of Brexit it does not want but it has no idea what sort of Brexit it does want.

He insisted Britain would still leave the EU on Halloween despite Boris Johnson being forced to request a three-month delay from EU leaders hours earlier.The Prime Minister last night sent a request to the EU to delay until January , deal or no deal, after MPs forced him to with a vote in Parliament. But he refused to sign it and sent a second signed note which branded an extension corrosive. That left questions over whether an extension would be granted or EU leaders would leave the UK to crash out with no deal. In a bid to leave on time, the PM is now racing to hold a fresh vote on his Brexit deal and get a Bill through the Commons to pass it into law in time for Halloween.    A Withdrawal Agreement Bill - which makes the Brexit deal law - will be introduced to Parliament on Monday and have its first debate on Tuesday. But Downing Street is facing a string of kne-edge votes to pass the Bill with no guarantee of success. And there will be a string of amendments - including for a customs union and second referendum - that could throw a spanner in the works. If the Bill does not get through, and European leaders refuse to delay Brexit, Britain faces no-deal next Thursday. Boris Johnson will try to have a fresh ‘meaningful vote’ on his deal tomorrow night to establishhe has the numbers. But he could be blockedSpeaker John Bercow decides the vote is outside Commons procedure. Mr Gove told Sky Newsapos Sophy Ridge on Sunday: We are going to leave by October . We have the means and the ability to do so. He added: The risk of leaving without a deal has actually increased because we cannot guarantee that the European Council will grant an extension.“ And that is why I will, later today, be chairing a Cabinet committee meeting, extraordinarily on a Sunday, in order to ensure that the next stage of our exit preparations and our preparedness for no-deal is accelerated. It means that we are triggering Operation Yellowhammer. It means that we are preparing to ensure that,no extension is granted, we have done everything possible in order to prepare to leave without a deal.

Campaigners who have fought for decades celebrated the historic changes today as a last-ditch bid to block them ended in chaos and acrimony. Tonight the UK government confirmed a framework for legal abortion services in Northern Ireland will be in place by  March . And same-sex marriage regulations will be made no later than  January . Northern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith declared: This means, at the latest, the first civil same-sex marriages will take place on the week of Valentineaposs Day . It will take longer to allow religious same-sex marriage ceremonies, or convert existing civil partnerships, because a short consultation is needed. Northern Ireland has for decades been the only part of the United Kingdom that does not allow same-sex marriage. And it has a ban on abortions in almost all cases, even rape or incest, except where a motheraposs le is at risk.    That has forced desperate mums to cross the Irish Sea for terminations.In both cases Northern Ireland law is stricter than the Republic. So MPs in London voted overwhelmingly in July to overhaul both lawsBelfastaposs devolved executive - long dormant thanks to splits between unionists and nationalists - had still not been restored by October . Today political leaders in Northern Ireland staged a string of walkouts as a last-minute bid to block the legalisation ended in acrimony. Anti-abortion members ed to the Stormont chamber for the first time in two-and-a-half years in a desperate last-ditch bid to block the law.  But their attempt to rush through the move fell apart as it became clear a new Speaker could not be elected with both unionist and nationalist support. Sinn Fein refused to turn up to the sitting at all - branding it a circus. SDLP leader Colum Eastwood turned up, but slammed anti-abortion members for using and abusing peopleaposs emotions and sensitivities in a way that would undermine Northern Ireland peace. He then stood up and walked out - taking other SDLP members with him.  That left anti-abortion DUP leader Arlene Foster in  the chamber to denounce the scene as a shameful day that would give Northern Ireland the most liberal abortion regime anywhere in Europe. She fumed this is not a day of celebration for the unborn and said her party would explore every possible legal option to oppose it. She then also walked out. It left a bizarre scene where the Speaker proposed to an empty chamber that the Assembly adjourned - and no one was left to answer him. The abortion law will change in Northern Ireland at midnight on Monday when the Executive Formation Act  comes into effect. Once the th-century laws that criminalise abortion lapse at midnight, the Government will assume responsibility for introducing new regulations to provide greater access to terminations in the region by next April. In the interim period, women will be offered free transport to access abortion services in England.    With the rt between erstwhile coalition partners the DUP and Sinn Fein over issues such as Irish language legislation as wide as ever, a deal to restore powersharing still looks a long way off. Pro choice activists held aloft cardboard letters spelling out decriminalised in front of Parliament Buildings ahead of the sitting.  Sarah Ewart, who has become a vocal advocate for reform since having to travel to England for an abortion after receiving a diagnosis of fatal foetal abnormality, welcomed the law change. This law change will not fix what I had to go through but it will make it hopefully better for those who follow after me, she said. Grainne Teggart from Amnesty International said the law change would pave the way for a more compassionate system. From midnight tonight history will be made, these oppressive laws that have policed our bodies and our healthcare will be brought to an end, she said. Finally our rights and our healthcare are being brought into the st century.

Speaking to , she explains that the idea went crazy after she put a request for possible suitors on Facebook. She said: I had three months left of my s, I decided I was going to make the most of them. She put her plan on Facebook and before long she was inundated with messages from friends and family offering to set up.    If they were  to , straight and single I would go on a date with them. It just exploded. Everyone was commenting on it. , people replied on the first day. She spent the next three months going on up to three dates a week, meeting some really interesting people along the way. And she also learnt a lot about herself.  I just had the most incredible time. It wasnapost about meeting someone, it was about realising how much fun it was being single. It made me appreciate myself a lot more. The conversations you have on first dates are dferent to conversations you have with any other part of le. You tell stories about yourself. It was all about how much fun you can have dating. I went on some really incredible dates and did some really fun things. She started to blog about her dating journey, keeping all the guys anonymous, which led to her being offered work reviewing dating apps.  Before long she had enough work to quit her job and work in the industry full time as a consultant, reviewer and expert. She said: Over four years I tried and judged pretty much every dating app and site out there. I knew a lot about the industry and I was at the stage when I was quite ready to leave.

The app would be exclusively for people over the age of , with extra security and advice, but without being patronising or boring. I worked in dating for so long that everyone I knew came to me with dating questions. One of the most common questions was people asking me about their mums and dads. I would honestly say not to use any of the apps.  I knew there was a market for it. I knew just from my own friends. Iaposm now , and I think the older you get the harder it is to meet like minded people. There were people in their s and s who needed it. Itaposs ridiculous how ageist society is. There is such a warped view of what a -year-old looks like. I think most people see them in their heads as a -year-old. I really want Lumen to champion pro-age. I think for too long weaposve talked about ageing as a bad thing. We live in a world where  is really young. Weaposre really fortunate that  is middle-aged now. The app launched in the UK last September and in the US in April. It has been really exciting. Itaposs only when I take a step back that I appreciate how much weaposve achieved.  There have already been three weddings from people meeting on the app and Charly is still very hands on with the members. Charly said: How cool is that  Weaposre actually changing peopleaposs lives. If we didnapost have this idea last year these people probably wouldnapost have met let alone got married. It makes me grin. I probably speak to about  members day, they can ask me for dating advice.

Meghan admitted she wasnapost OK while Harry said his relationship with his brother Prince William had suffered dficult times .A royal source told the Mirror that senior royals are “concerned for the couple”, and said the breakdown in their relationship was desperately sad. They’re going completely separate ways and Harry is the one who seems to be visibly struggling.    “It seems the boy who walked behind their mother’s coffin, which is so vividly seared onto the nation’s consciousness, has never fully recovered, which is an utter tragedy. Charles has sought to help the young men, even that hasn’t helped. “Many inside the family have said how seeing her sons drting apart would be the last thing Diana would have wanted.” BBC royal correspondent Jonny Dymond said: I think theywill be pretty horried actually.  One is because whoever wins these legal actions with the newspapers, are the newspapers actually going to change what they do  Because the newspapers donapost think they have done anything wrong. They think this is about reporting about what is going on. Secondly, the monarchy is supposed to be a unying force in this country, and yet a very signicant chunk of it, Harry and Meghan, are being isive. It runs against what the monarchy is doing in these already isive times.

Dundee is on the up and that’s one of the reasons we invested initially. When I first arrived the Waterfront was all rubble, it was hard to see it was a city on the up. But now the Waterfront is fantastic.“The focus can’t just be there, it has to be in the city centre and surrounding areas.“We need to build Dundee into a place where people want to spend more than a couple of hours.”More than  jobs could be created by a new stadium at Camperdown Park.Dundee managing director John Nelms has revealed government predictions suggest Dundonians could benefit from hundreds of jobs thanks to the project.He said: “All of these things, the hotel, the restaurants, the crematorium all bring jobs. “according to government documents, it brings about  full time jobs.#It also brings, over a two-three year period, construction jobs and part-time jobs.#It creates more opportunity for the city and that’s our goal.”Nelms also hopes a new stadium can help bring top music acts to Dundee and help Slessor Gardens to carry the load – as well as a conference centre which can attract , guests.

This means they are without a win in their last five league matches.Speaking after Saturday’s - defeat against Coventry, Stars coach Omar Pacha said: “The positives are we played better defensively but we didn’t have that spark offensively or the jump we usually have.”Following Sunday’s loss, the Canadian mentioned how defensive mistakes cost his team late in the game and how frustrating it is to be on the wrong side of controversial calls.Blaze held a - lead after the first period as Evan Bloodoff capitalised on a Dundee turnover in the eighth minute.However, when both teams went down to four skaters each in the second period, Kevin Dufour put Stars back on level terms as he went clean through on the Coventry goal and dispatched the puck through the legs of Jamie Phillips on the halfway mark.The West Midlands club nicked the two points in the final period as Alex Forbes scored a shorthanded goal in the th minute.Yesterday, Stars were in Yorkshire where they were beaten - by Sheffield Steelers.The scoring was opened when Dundee’s captain Matt Marquardt was in the penalty box for slashing. On the resulting powerplay, Marc-Olivier Vallerand fired a shot into the top-left corner after  minutes.Robert Dowd quickly doubled Steelers’ lead as he batted in the rebound of Ben O’Connor’s shot a minute later.However, the goal was reviewed for a high-stick foul but, after a lot of deliberation, the call on the ice stood, much to the Stars boss Pacha’s frustration.Aaron Fox’s men were in top gear and added a third goal in the th minute as Tanner Eberle pulled the puck around a charging Leclerc and tucked it into the Stars net as he was taken down by the Dundee goaltender.Sheffield held onto their three-goal cushion going into the first break but, early in the second period, the visitors hit back to cut the deficit to - as Brett Stovin was on hand to turn in the rebound of Jagger Dirk’s blocked shot.Pacha’s men were on top for most of the second session and, in the third, Stars closed in again.While on the powerplay, Dundee’s Elgin Pearce pulled one back to make it - on  minutes.The Canadian forward was in space and picked out by Anthony Beauregard before he released a quick shot that flew past Duba and deflected down off the crossbar.The Tayside team were only within one goal of the Steelmen for five minutes as Sheffield restored their two-goal lead after  minutes.Steelers’ Eric Meland released a fast and low shot that hit the leg of Eberle and that was enough to deflect the puck past Leclerc, making it -.Despite Dundee going all out in the final few minutes, the home side held on to claim a - home win.Dundee’s next matches see them face another tough test with a trip to Belfast Giants on Friday night before a home clash against Glasgow Clan on Saturday."},{"url":null,"title":"britbox-streaming-service-pricing-announced","story":"UK streaming subscription service BritBoxwill launch later this yearat pound. a month, the BBC and ITV have said."},{"url":null,"title":"love-island-anton-danyluks-mum-shaves-bum-joins-instagram-delight-fans","story":"Love Island star Anton Danyluks mum has become an instant hit with fans after joining Instagram."},{"url":null,"title":"tunnel-mystery-paisley-abbey-solved","story":"EXPERTS have discovered one of Scotlandrsquos best-preserved medieval tunnels was a m long drain beneath Paisley Abbey -

win at Fir Park.After Joe Lewis saved an early James Scott penalty goals from Sam Cosgrove # his th of the season # Niall McGinn and Zak Vyner moved the Reds just a point behind the third-placed Steelmen.Dons boss Derek McInnes made five changes to the side which drew - with Hibs at Pittodrie a fortnight ago.Lewis Ferguson and Curtis Main dropped out due to suspension, Dean Campbell and Ryan Hedges were moved to the bench and Ethan Ross dropped out of the -man squad altogether.In came Mikey Devlin, McGinn, Jon Gallagher, James Wilson and Vyner.With six defenders on the pitch there was intrigue as to how the Reds would line-up pre-match.The answer was a --- formation with Vyner and Greg Leigh used as holding midfielders.The match roared into le with both sides looking to get on the front foot in the early stages and in the fth minute Motherwell passed up a great chance to take the lead.Shay Logan was short with a pass back to keeper Lewis, Chris Long nipped in first and was tripped by Lewis, with referee Euan Anderson quickly pointing to the penalty spot.Scott stepped up, but his right footed effort was tipped over the bar by Lewis, who flung himself to his right.After quarter of an hour Aberdeen took the lead with a devastating counter-attack.The Steelmen#s skipper Peter Hartley was off the pitch receiving treatment for an injury with Barry Maguire dropping into central defence and marking Cosgrove.Long had possession for the home side, but Leigh tackled him in the centre of the pitch and the alert Cosgrove spun away from Maguire. Leigh found him with the perfect through ball and the striker raised into the box and chipped the beyond Mark Gillespie for his th goal of the season.Soon after Jon Gallagher headed over from a Logan cross, but midway through the first period Motherwell hit the woodwork.Declan Gallagher#s measured ball found the lively Long on the right side of the area, he side-stepped Lewis, but with the angle against him Long#s attempted finish hit the right post and went behind.Up until the interval the same pattern continued with Motherwell having more of the ball, but struggling to penetrate the Dons defence, while the men from the Granite City appeared threatening when they were able to counter-attack at speed.Eight minutes into the second half the Reds left the Steelmen with a mountain to climb as they moved two up.Aberdeen pressed Motherwell and when Allan Campbell dithered  yards from goal McGinn pounced. The Northern Irish international won the ball and curled a shot into the top right corner from the edge of the area.Any hopes of a home comeback were extinguished on the hour when Vyner created space  yards out and hammered a right footed shot in off the right post.By now Motherwell were ragged at the back and Leigh#s cross-cum-shot slipped just wide.Andy Considine also sent a header by the far post in the closing stages, but it finished -.Motherwell: Mark Gillespie, Richard Tait, Liam Grimshaw, Peter Hartley , Allan Campbell, Christopher Long, Sherwin Seedorf, Barry Maguire , James Scott , Liam Polworth, Declan Gallagher.Subs not used: Trevor Carson, Christy Manzinga, Christian Ilic, Jamie Semple.Aberdeen: Joe Lewis, Shay Logan, Andy Considine, Mikey Devlin, Scott McKenna, Greg Leigh , Jon Gallagher, Zak Vyner, James Wilson , Niall McGinn , Sam Cosgrove.Subs not used: Tomas Cerny, Craig Bryson, Ryan Hedges, Bruce Anderson."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/2.45531049-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/2.45531049-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/2.45531049-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/2.45531049-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"aberdeen pet foodbank a great success","story":"A foodbank for dogs set up to help Aberdeen pet owners facing financial dficulties has been hailed as a “great success”.The initiative – believed to be the first of its kind in the north-east – was set up in July by the StarCommunity Flat and Mrs Murray’s Home for Stray Dogs and Cats.Emergency food packs are handed out to people who have fallen on hard times and could face giving up their pets because they can’t afford to feed them.Staff at the animal rescue shelter have so far handed out  packs for dogs and even two emergency supplies for cats.Now dog and cat homes are setting up similar schemes in other parts of the country with a leading pet charity in Edinburgh launching a similar initiative last week.Marie Simpson, manager of Mrs Murray’s rehoming centre, said: “The pet foodbank has been a great success for those in need of it and now other centres are setting up similar schemes which shows how much it is needed.

Last year, it rehomed over , domestic pets and successfully released , wild animals back to their natural environment. The society now also delivers industry-leading animal welfare educational programmes to people of all ages.In my short time with the society I know of hundreds of examples of our dedicated people going above and beyond to do all they can for the animals and humans they come across. So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government. If they live on one of our beautul islands, they can soon jump on one of the new ferries being completed as I write, again thanks to the Scottish Government.All this aside, when he rejoins us on planet earth, Mr Craig might think of entering his mysterious pie in the baking section of next year#s Mid Argyll Show, though I think by that time we may all be in need of something a little stronger from Scotland’s political larder to extract us from the bitter reality of Brexit Britain.Charles Ambrose, Lochgilphead.Sir,The National Autistic Society wants to find exceptional people, schools and services making a huge dference to autistic children and adults and their families.

While emotive, this is what many people directly affected by Brexit feel is happening.For example, on the matter of Germans buying our fish without a trade agreement the tarf will be  per cent on our fish exports to the EU. The Germans will no longer buy our fish.We can all read about other examples of the harm being done in the press every day.

Two men were paid to accompany Patrick the Fool on his journey from England to provide entertainment for the King and his guests while residing at Tarbert.Also recorded is a figure for #making a suit for the King at Tarbert#.  Bruce visited Tarbert on many occasions. His final visit was in the year of his death.Tarbert is believed to have been one of the earliest Royal Burghs in Argyll. An early reference as such was made in . It is also said to have had one of the earliest paved streets in Scotland.King James IV also had a close connection with Tarbert. The addition of the #keep# to the castle, part of which still stands today, was constructed at his direction. Whilst this work was underway, James summoned parliament to meet him here to discuss matters local to the area. This meeting took place on July  .Over the years, many travellers of note have passed this way and commented on Tarbert and its scenic surroundings.In  Thomas Pennant arrived by sea at East Loch Tarbert and described the scenery as #picturesque#.CGS Teighnmouthpassed through the Kyles of Bute in  and commented that #it offers no scenery worthy of notice#.

We moved onto Schubert’s #Du Bist Die Ruh# which was beautully controlled by both singer and pianist.This was contrasted with Shubert’s angsty #Gretchen am Spinnrade# and I commend Rebecca Taylor for playing the right hand part with ease. The journey then moved through Schumann and into Brahms where the audience murmured in agreement at the rollercoaster of emotions before us.As we reached Wolf the themes took a darker turn in a short but intense piece about crying tears of blood. Swtly moving onto Strauss and Mahler the audience were given songs of simple love, a sing off between a cuckoo and a nightingale and a man in great pain which reigned the audience in with a spiritual lull.The second half opened with a stunning rendition of Faure’s #Apres Un Reve#. Through Debussy’s impressionist piece, Rinaldo Hahn’s Operatic journey and into Du Parc comforting his love with a dream like harp created by the piano.The duo then gave us a contemporary piece by Joseph Horowitz which comprised of snippets from the monologues of Shakespeare’s Lady Macbeth and the music tracks her descent into madness. It was aAs a light and fun ending we were given #I can be a sexy lady#, a piece about poor mezzos and how they always play boys and not much  in operas.

Perceptive, spirited and loving.\"Photographer Allan, who has been publishing his work since the s, spent decades in locations such as Vietnam, Morocco, Libya and Australia to produce unforgettable images.Since ing home earlier this year he has released photographic titles, Vintage Tractors and Scotlands Islands, before putting the final shots together for Edinburgh.Allan admits that Gerdas involvement has taken the publication to a new level. He said: \"My initial concept was to produce a comparatively modest format, aimed at the photographically conscious visitor.\"By good fortune however, in engaging with Gerda as co-author, the scope and spirit of the work has been widened and deepened.\"The poems featured in this book have interacted with my images penetrating the veneer that can often dominate the city.\"All those prestigious castings and fine masonry may, collectively, have created one of Europersquos most beautul cities, but there were struggles in its making, and so often a human price was paid.\"I hope, therefore, it proves thought provoking at the very least.Gerda, who is an award-winning actor, songwriter and director as well as a writer, added: \"This has been a fascinating and welcome collaboration ndash an opportunity to reacquaint myself with my beloved home city, and its many contradictions.\"Irsquove relished both the process of responding to Allanrsquos vibrant images, and the way in which the

Set in the Western Indian Territory just after the turn of the th century, the spirited rivalry between the local farmers and cowboys provides the backdrop for a love story between Curly, a handsome cowboy, and Laurey, a beautul farm girl.But the road to true love is a bumpy one, especially as sinister farm-hand Jud Fry has his sights set on Laurey, and hersquoll do whatever it takes to get her.But Laurey isnrsquot the only girl in Oklahoma with cowboy troubles.

Assisted by Scott Souden’s low cross from the left flank, the substitute striker guided a delightful flick into the net beyond the Glynhill keeper. Taking on the role of target-man with gusto, Radecki played a big part in the Feathers-sponsored Pupils’ fourth goal, when he held off a defender down the right wing and crossed to substitute Calum McKillop, whose back-heel flick found Souden at the penalty spot, and the -year-old winger, making the journey home from Edinburgh for a game, passed the ball into the net with ease to complete the scoring.The game became a procession in the closing minutes with man-of-the-match Crossan, the midfield linchpin alongside the impressive Liam Renton, orchestrating some controlled possession football, but there was some trouble on  minutes when a malicious foul on ex-Dumbarton man D McCallum sparked into a melee with players from both sides involved. It resulted in a second booking for Kenny Kerr, a yellow for J McCallum, and a red card for the original Glynhill culprit, as well as yellow for the visiting keeper from referee Jimmy Litster, after charging from his own goalmouth to become involved.Undeterred, the Pupils settled back down to seal a richly deserved victory,achieved through a disciplined and determined performance.The Kintyre Park side will now enjoy a free week, with ato action scheduled for Saturday October , opponent to be confirmed.For fixture updates, and to see second-half action and goals from last Saturday’s match, see Campbeltown Football on Facebook, or @PupilsAFC on Twitter."},{"url":null,"title":"dramatic final minute sees young pupils take points","story":"With a dramatic finish to the game the Pupils Youth Under s ed to Kintyre with all three points after a tight encounter played at Glasgow Club Milton on Sunday.This was the first time the sides had met and the Pupils knew they would be in for another tough test on the road playing against a side which won the GADYFL B Division last season.The visitors showed no signs of their early journey to the north end of Glasgow as they started brightly and enjoyed the majority of possession early in the game. However, it was the home side that took the lead on the nd minute when Ashfield’s centre forward cut in from the left before sending an unstoppable shot in to the top corner.A test of character was required from the boys as they fell behind and with five minutes of the half remaining they were rewarded after a corner dropped to Stuart Phillps in the box.

A long clearance by Ashfield was misjudged by the Pupils defence to allow Ashfield’s player in with a chance of his hat-trick but the youngster scuffed his shot into thankful hands of Pupils goal-keeper Lorne Paterson.Knowing it was the final minute, Paterson tried to kick the ball up the field as quickly as possible only for it to cannon off the back of Euan O’May’s head!

That race took place over the course of last weekend.The series featured five rounds at dferent venues, and each race was set up like a car rally, with untimed uphill transition stages leading to ious timed downhill sections, the results of which were amalgamated into an overall race time. The stages ied massively in , from as little as  seconds to an absolute behemoth we endured at Laggan in April which took us  minutes to ride! The topography and trail surface dfered wildly from venue to venue but also from stage to stage, and the taped trails we raced down last weekend at Fort William epitomised this eclectic set-up.Stage  was the easiest and least technical track we have raced on all year, an entirely man-made sprint through flowing banked corners coated in compacted quarry dust. Of course you had to be careful you didn`t push too hard, it is all too easy to wreck a race run by hitting the deck on an easy stage. We assumed that the organisers were trying to lull us into a  sense of security with stage #and we were so right!Stage  started halfway down the legendary World Cup track , channelling riders through some savage rock gardens before cutting off to the right along a lung-busting fireroad before descending into another sculpted hardpack track which then erted down a horrendously muddy, freshly cut chute that was littered with roots big enough to swallow a bike wheel whole. Even walking down it was impossible.A big transition ride towards Torlundy took us to the top of stage , which was the famous Blue Crane trail running into Ridgeline. Both of these tracks are black-graded on a good day, but there is a huge dference between trying to ride these ‘for fun’ and then trying to race on them once  people have spent a whole Saturday skidding them to bits in the tipping rain! A lot of people fell foul of this stage, but we survived and we absolutely loved it.Stage  was a dferent animal altogether. We had tackled it fairly early on practice day and hadn`t had any issues with it, but the swarm of maniacs who had ridden it in the rain since our earlier visit had turned it into an absolute swamp and the ruts were so deep that I found it almost impossible to negotiate with my limited skills. Dave telling me afterwards that he had romped it didn`t help my mood one bit!The last  stages were so high up the mountain that we needed a trip on the gondola to get to them. The black graded Top Chief track is a fearsome animal that follows the best twisty bedrock line around the hill before plummeting several hundred feet straight down off it into the tree line below, where it once again becomes sanitised into a flowing, twisty and utterly hilarious serpent of a trail that had riders drting and whooping all the way to the carpark. The organisers had cleverly split the Top Chief track into two stages, as there is a long section of perched wooden boardwalk high up on the mountain that is great fun to ride but would be far too dangerous to race on. Stage  was therefore very short -taking most riders about  seconds to ride- while stage  was a  minute monster. What a way to finish a season!So how did we do David was fastest of the three of us, as he has been all season. He finished in a time of  minutes,  seconds. He races in the Senior category , so it is a tough school littered with sponsored riders and crazy kids. He finished th in seniors on the day, and th overall out of an entry of  riders. Having failed to finish the race at Laggan earlier in the year due to a mechanical breakdown, David has been constantly playing catch-up but he still managed to finish in a brilliant nd place overall in the seniors category for the season.Alex has ridden consistently all year and has managed to tread the fine line between wrecking and ruling perfectly at every round. He had one of his very few crashes on the last stage at Fort William which cost him a few seconds, but he still ed a very respectable time of : to finish nd in the Masters category. The Masters section almost always attracts the largest entry and it is full of well-heeled chargers on very expensive steeds, so for Alex to finish in th place in that championshipin his first full season is a highly respectable result.I have continually been either on par or just slower than Alex on nearly every stage of the year, and nothing changed here. I knowI`ve kept within a few seconds of him I have done just fine, and I managed my ride to achieve this perfectly right up until the last stage where a cruel puncture right on top of the hill put paid to any chances of a good result to finish the year. With  top s already in the bag for the season though , I managed to hold onto th place in the Grand Veteran`s championship which was some consolation for a day that finished with me feeling, well, a bit deflated.Competing in this series has been a brilliant experience for us. We have had some hilarious times racing our bikes through some of Scotland`s very best scenery, and we have loved camping out of the back of vans.

A high-energy showing in Paisley saw the McFadyens-sponsored side run out convincing winners.With the match going ahead at the Kibble’s grass park despite the heavy rain overnight and during the week leading up to the game, the surface was in surprisingly good condition, allowing the Pupils to get into their attacking flow early on.Up against a home side not lacking in height and physical stature, the Pupils had to be ready to contend with some lofted early balls from back to front by the hosts, whose game plan seemed to be to get the ball to their forwards as quickly as possible, but the Pupils# defence of Fraser Wylie, Ross Souden, Ryan McConnachie and Stuart Crossan, stood up to the task well.The Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils quick passing and inidual pace and skill in the final third caused the hosts problems early on, and Ryan Gilchrist and Gregor McFadyen, and both had almost identical attempts to score, but snatched at their shots at the vital moment.However, the Kintyre Park side would not be denied for long, and scored after  minutes through a sharp passing move that released Gregor McFayden, who buried an arrowed shot from the edge of the box to continue his excellent goalscoring form.Then, the visitors made it - after  minutes, when an enterprising move out of defence found right-back Crossan, whose ball through to Johnny McCormick allowed the right winger to cut inside onto his left foot and release a thunderous first-time drive into roof of the net for a great goal, his second of the season.After seeing their deficit doubled, Carlton for their part put their Kintyre visitors under a bit of pressure from several corners and free kicks, but the Pupils’ defensive discipline continued to win over.Into the second half, the Pupils made it - when Donald McCallum scored another great goal, in a move started by Liam Renton, whose in-swinging corner was cleared to the edge of the penalty box where the ex-Dumbarton man McCallum made space to drive a deflected shot into the top corner of the net.At this point in the match, all three subs were used, with Ellis Robertson and Michael McKinlay replacing the excellent deep-lying midfield pairing of Ryan Gilchrist and Liam Renton, and Ross Brown entering in the fray in a direct swap with winger McCormick.The youngster Brown quickly got involved to create the Pupils# fourth goal, outpacing the Carlton full-back to draw out the last defender and square the ball across for Scott Souden to cheekily chip the ball over the home keeper into the net.The rampant Pupils completed the scoring in the th minute after hesitation between a Carlton defender and his keeper allowed McFadyen to nip in, touch the ball round the keeper to score a simple but well-earned second goal, for his brace on the day, and his fourth of the season.At the other end, the Pupils were determined to get their second consecutive clean sheet in league action, and while young keeper Alistair Ferguson spilled a deflected free kick in the latter stages, he bravely ed at the feet of the striker to smother his effort. The Pupils management noted how Ferguson’s kicking and distribution was first-class throughout the match.A Pupils spokesman said: ‘It was a great team effort, with our attacking players working together to cause problems all game. At the back, we defended high balls and direct play really well.’The Pupils are in league action again tomorrowwhen they welcome Argyll rivals Lochgilphead Red Star. Kick off is pm, with Kintyre Park the expected venue.The Pupils’ Liam Renton on the ball with Ryan Gilchrist looking on at Saturday#s match in Paisley.

George reminisced: ‘It was announced at a Town Council meeting that the Royal couple was scheduled to visit. It was all to be top secret, but that didn’t happen. The next morning the #secret# was ulged in a queue in one of the town’s shops and the news was out.’With a smile that showed how fond these memories are to him, George continued: ‘The Royal Yacht Britannia was anchored out in the loch and a small boat brought the Queen and Prince Philip to the quay where my father was delegated to catch and secure the rope. They were then driven to the Town Hall and there was a huge crowd present.‘Campbeltown Gaelic Choir, conducted by Mr M G McCallum who was also a councillor, had a lovely surprise for the Royal visitors. Prince Charles had just been made Prince of Wales, so the choir sang ‘God Bless the Prince of Wales’. This was very well received, and the Queen said that she had not heard it before.’George and Mrs McMillan were present at a reception given by the Town Council in the Town Hall. George remembers that he shook hands with the Queen and spoke with the Duke of Edinburgh. He said: ‘Only those invited could speak to the Queen, but the Duke moved among the gathering and spoke to some of the councillors. I was a coal miner at Machrihanish at that time and he asked me and some other miners about our work.’He continued: ‘The food and drinks were served on silver trays by waiters in tails and bow-ties. Afterwards, when the couple was taken on a tour of the town, the heavens opened and oh how it rained and rained.’A town councillor from May  to its disbanding in , and then a councillor on the District Council and the Strathclyde Regional Council, George was to meet the Queen and other members of the Royal Family on other occasions.

prosecution, and used needles can be easily and safely disposed of. \"Until such times, it is worth reminding the community again that Bankton Pharmacy currently offers a needle exchange facility

They were written in Cuneorm, the writing of the ancient Sumerians.A shortened and simplied version of one of these earliest riddles is: ldquoA house you enter blind, but come out with sight. What kind of house is it  The answer is a school, although some may raise an eyebrow at this answer.Perhaps the most famous riddle from antiquity is the Riddle of the Sphinx to Oedipus, recorded in ancient Greek around the fth century BC: ldquoWhat is the creature that walks on four legs in the morning, two legs at noon, and three legs in the evening The answer is a human being. When a baby we crawl on four legs, as an adult we walk on two legs, in old age we need a third leg .With my now continuous painful knee, this riddle has particular relevance for me, although Irsquom stubbornly resisting the stick!I use riddles as ice breakers in storytelling sessions and as an engagement technique because they quickly hook an audiencersquos attention since they are, by their nature, interactive.But they are also great fun to use with the children in your family.I use them to help distract and calm my younger ones when they are fractious. I use them in the morning when the kids are getting ready for school so they concentrate on them while they are getting ready.We make the riddles about the things we can see and the things we are doing, for example: ldquoTherersquos a big one and a wee one and three in between, we are two families of five, we are all going to nursery, but we are usually not seen. Who are we  The answer, of course, is my sonrsquos toes!For younger kids, itrsquos important to repeat riddles they already know the answer to. It helps them learn the riddle and how wordplay works. It also teaches them the rhythm of how they are told.My four-year-old is getting pretty good at this, although the answers to his own made-up riddles donrsquot always make sense.That doesnrsquot matter at this stage, whatrsquos important is hersquos developing an understanding of how they work and it encourages him to look for things to make riddles about.His nearly six-year-old sister likes to challenge him too.Her riddle ldquoI am short when I sit, I am long when I jump, what am I  had me thinking for some time before I got the answer: a frog.To make a riddle, think of the answer first. Then work the riddle up to the answer. It involves thinking about all the dferent qualities, uses of and parts of the answer and how they can be twisted or described dferently.For example, a shoe has a tongue but canrsquot talk, a clock has a face and hands but no body, a river has a bed but doesnrsquot sleep.Once introduced to riddle-making, children can get really engaged with it. A group of seven-eight-year-olds in a P class challenged me last week with a riddle they had made up themselves: ldquoI have a brain full of teacherrsquos knowledge, I crash without moving, I freeze while staying warm, what am I  The answer is a computer.Some riddles rhyme and it can be an extra challenge to think of a rhyming riddle, but they donrsquot have to rhyme.It really is a fun and rewarding activity to make a regular habit in the car, dinner table, on a walk or even a bedtime riddle.To help you out, there are literally thousands of examples of riddles in books, on the internet, in history, films and ones you hear. But the best ones will be those made up yourself, and the more you do it, the better at it you will become.And the benefits of riddling regularly with your family can be signicant, especially for children. It can promote critical thinking, encourage the observation of the world around us, help language development and can be a powerful bonding process with your child. And itrsquos fun!And so when next time you are with your kids, grandchildren, nieces or nephews and find yourself waiting for food to be delivered in a restaurant or have no time for a proper bedtime story, or you just want to spend some quality time together without a screen, try make riddling part of it. Trust me, it will be fun.Oh, and the answer to the well-known riddle at the beginning  Itrsquos a coffin."},{"url":null,"title":"positives-negatives-plans-haddington-town-centre-says-group","story":"Proposals were revealed by the Courier last month that would see a complete revamp of Haddington town centre.Dozens of spaces could be removed from High Street and Market Street, with the introduction of cycle lanes, wider footpaths and a communal space on High Street.The proposals have been met with concern by businesses in the town centre, who fear that the removal of up to  spaces ndash and the introduction of a car park of more than  spaces on Whittingehame Drive ndash could have a negative impact on their way of le.Haddington and District Community Council heard from both Haddington Business Community Partnershipand residents last Tuesday before asking non-community councillors, including the Courier, to leave to discuss the proposals in private.Now, a sub-group ndash made up of community councillors Jan Wilson , Fiona McEwan , Paul Darling , Pat Lemmon and Jack Worden ndash is to meet to draft a letter to East Lothian Council outlining concerns and any positives regarding the scheme.Mrs Lemmon said: ldquoAll community councillors managed to finally see the draft plan that has already been submitted to Sustrans.ldquoThere are some positives but there are also negatives.ldquoSo the community council has formed a sub-group, which is meeting on Tuesday to draft a letter to East Lothian Council. It is felt at the moment that the draft in its entirety is not acceptable until this letter is lodged and any concerns we have are taken on board.ldquoNot everybody understood everything that was involved in the draft plan but time was needed to make sure not only all the community councillors were more familiar with the draft plan but we had heard from HBCP and Haddington residents.ldquoIt was felt in the past that at community council meetings not enough time had been dedicated to it, hence the reason why Tuesday night happened.When the controversial proposals were revealed, the local authority confirmed it was ldquoexploring additional options for sustainable travel improvements in and around Haddington town centre.The new lsquoedge of centrersquo car park, dubbed a park and stride or a park and ride, would encourage people to walk or be bussed from Whittingehame Drive back into the town centre.No location has been confirmed for any new car park, although there have been concerns raised as to how it would impact upon community events such as Nungate Gala and the townrsquos fireworks.The long-stay car park at the townrsquos Tesco store, which is used by many people working in the town centre, could also become a short-stay car park.Joanna Gibson, HBCP chairwoman, outlined the grouprsquos feelings about the proposed scheme before non-community councillors were asked to leave the meeting ndash a decision that, according to East Lothian Council, was entirely down to the community council.A number of businesses feared they would not be able to operate through a y construction period. There were also worries that businesses would be forced to close and, with none moving in, it would result in a poorer High Street.Mrs Gibson said: ldquoWe do not think that this design has enough merit to counter the huge disruption of even phase one of the plan.ldquoThere were at least three plans at the initial consultations, why were none of the others considered  Perhaps within these plans we might have found a non-disruptive way to actually improve the town centre.ldquoThe shared space for events we believe will rarely be used as there does not seem to be any motivation or intentions, to our knowledge, to appoint someone to manage this.ldquoWe already have excellent event space outside the Corn Exchange offering indoor and outdoor event space and at Whittingehame Drive, and round the River Tyne where very successful community events are held.ldquoWe believe that parking is an important factor in retaining businesswe are to compete with the [proposed] new retail park [at Gateside] and survive and prosper.ldquoThis has also been the conclusion of many high street and town centre survival papers and studies worldwide.A council spokesman said: ldquoWe are continuing to develop proposals to improve the attractiveness, ality and accessibility of the town in support of the community and local businesses. This includes improved pedestrian and cycle access, as well as exploring additional options for sustainable travel improvements in and around Haddington town centre.ldquoOur priorities are to protect and enhance the local environment while supporting the local economy.

Since its inception in , the award has only twice before been shared. First was in , when Nadine Gordimer and Stanley Middleton were twinned, and again in , with Michael Ondaatje and Barry Unsworth. After that regrettable outcome, whereby both writersrsquo thunder was stolen, the rules were changed, vetoing this ever happening again.During rsquos final meeting, Florence and his team ndash Liz Calder, Xiaolu Guo, Afua Hirsch and Joanna McGregor ndash were reluctant or unable to make a clear-cut decision. Asking for advice, they were reminded of the rules. Gaby Wood, of the Booker Prize Foundation, reported that, ldquoThey were not so much ided as unwilling to jettison any more when they finally got down to two, and askedthey might split the prize between them. On being told that it was definitively against the rules, the judges held a further discussion and chose to flout them. They left the judging room happy and proud...Should they be proud  I donrsquot think so. That rule was in place to prevent exactly what is already happening. The impact on an author of winning this prestigious title can be dramatic, as last yearrsquos laureate, Anna Burns, made clear in her speech to the literati in Londonrsquos glitzy medieval Guildhall. Gaining the imprimatur of the Booker brings a blaze of international attention, and a Himalayan spike in sales that no sensible novelist would dare dream of, for fear of waking up to the grim reality of meagre royalties that make the living wage look like a Euro Lottery windfall.Margaret Atwood, a previous winner, hinted as much when accepting the accolade. More than anyone, she understands the stakes. This was attention she does not need, her career already illustrious, and she was gracious in acknowledging that. Perhaps she also knows The Testaments isnrsquot in the same class as some of her earlier work. It is not one of the best books Irsquove read this year, although one that is ndash Lucy Ellmannrsquos Ducks, Newburyport, which was shortlisted ndash was a strong contender for first place.Atwood, to my mind, was given her share of the trophy because of the hype around her long-awaited follow-up and its cult following, thanks in large part to the recent television series. But even had it been her finest novel yet, the judges have been cruel to Bernardine Eisto. She is the first black woman to win, a good news story by any standards. That triumph should have been shouted from the rooftops. What a great statement it would have been for her to have been selected, head and shoulders above the rest. Instead, a  that consisted of four women and one man did a disservice to a writer who deserved the full glory, and the full commercial boost, that this distinction brings.The make-up of the judging  is interesting, reflecting the need for greater ersity, and less male dominance, in literary decision-making. And yet this predominantly female group, drawn from a iety of backgrounds and disciplines, blew it. What might have been a historic moment, representing a signicant cultural turning point, has had its impact blunted, its signicance diminished.The reasoning behind this is hard to understand. With five members, it cannot be impossible to have a majority for one particular title. A resolute chair would usually insist on that, gradually eliminating books to reach a single choice. Previous judges have spoken of the angst and turmoil in that final meeting, as the clock ticks down to the ceremony that evening. Last-minute deals are struck, compromises conceded, arguments clinched. For the chair especially, blood pressure mounts at the thought of facing the cameras with a speech when as yet no name has been picked.The reasons for deciding the award on the day of the ceremony are obvious: fear of a leak ruining the live announcement. Yetit is possible to sign waivers in order to get hold of embargoed books ahead of publication, as happened with The Testaments, which was shrouded in Harry Potter-style secrecy, Bookerrsquos organisers can surely bind the judges to keep their choice under wraps overnight. If the final meeting could instead be held without a gun to the head, in itself a form of literary roulette, cooler heads and better counsel would prevail. Perhaps, like a jury in a murder trial, the five could be holed up incommunicado in a hotel until the award night arrives. Better still, they could simply promise to say nothing and then, for the space of  hours, keep their word. How novel would that be What this split decision suggests is that in the judgesrsquo minds, the entire shortlist was worthy of the prize, and they wanted to show as little favouritism as they could. Yet what is the point of a le-changing pound, rewardnot to anoint a standout victor  In effect, this attitude is an echo of the ideology that says we are all successes, and nobody should ever be declared a runner-up or loser in a race or an exam. By insisting on a double honour, ostensibly for big-hearted reasons, the judges have in fact ducked the tough responsibility with which they were charged.Whatever its impact on Atwood and Eisto, this two-hander feels horribly, tediously familiar. Just picture the scene, as the adjudication meeting dragged on for hours. Indecision, a mounting sense of impasse, endless, increasingly feverish discussions, and a leader who could not or would not break the deadlock. After this, a last-ditch soliciting of professional opinion, followed by a flagrant breaking of the rules. In this sense, at least, Booker rsquos unsatisfactory outcome is very much a story of our times."},{"url":null,"title":"music-liam-gallagher-oasis-getting-back-together---definitely-maybe","story":"HAS Liam Gallagher turned over a new leaf  There is something very dferent about the bad boy of Britpop in .Itrsquos clear, Gallagher has been taking stock of both his le and career.The singer is in talk-mode to sell his impressive second solo album, Why Me  Why Not  which reached No.  on the UK Chart.We chat on the eve of his th birthday.

Or whether the Speaker John Bercow was going to send it. Or some judge under Nobile Officium. But the whole exercise is pointless anyway. The Prime Minister made clear at the Dispatch Box that, letter or no, he is not going to ldquonegotiate a delay.:Theres a real chance the Scottish courts will have to interveneThis means he will refuse to cooperate with any prolongation, which had anyway been ldquoruled out by the President of the European Commission, Jean Claude Juncker, on Thursday. Juncker emphatically did say precisely this, despite claims to the contrary. Of course, the President can be over-ruled by the  heads of government. But Brussels patience has been sorely tested.Last week, Boris Johnson won what must surely be the final concessions from the European Union. He got Brussels to reopen the Withdrawal Agreement, abandon the Irish Backstop, and agree to dual customs arrangements at the Irish border. None of us thought this possible only fortnight ago.Opposition MPs didnt just say that Boris Johnson could never get a deal, they accused him of actively working against one. The negotiations were a ldquosham according to Jeremy Corbyn. Labour MPs said Boris Johnson was in the pay of hedge fund billionaires, whod ordered him to secure a No Deal Brexit, so that they could make a killing on October .On the Tory side, Amber Rudd, the former pensions secretary, resigned from the Cabinet last month claiming that the PM wasnt even trying to get a deal. The Tory MP, Nick Boles, resigned the party whip accusing Johnson of turning the Conservatives into a ldquohard right English Nationalist Party.To be fair, Boles paid fulsome tribute last week to the PMs negotiating skills and admitted he had been wrong. But he still voted against him on Saturday. Another cabinet rebel, Rory Stewart, said thatthe PM got a deal, he would ldquoget down on my knees before Boris Johnson and admit I was wrong. That has yet to happen.Yet, whatever you think of Boris Johnsonrsquos new deal, it undoubtedly is one. Last week, he turned the Irish Backstop back to front. Theresa Mays protocol would have kept the entire UK in the single market and customs union indefinitely. Now only Northern Ireland is in the single market, and the arrangement is time-limited. The protocol is a frontstop, and will only continue with the consent of the Northern Ireland Assembly. No longer is there ldquoregulation without representation in the province.Further, Northern Ireland remains in the customs territory of the UK, yet there will be no hard border on Ireland. Goods travelling from Great Britain to Northern Ireland will be subject to EU tarfs, but onlythere is a ldquorisk that the goods will go on to the European Union through the non-existent Irish border. The UK will police the border at Stranraer, under a joint EU UK committee.:Leadsom and Rees-Mogg abused by demo crowdLabour are right to say that the Johnson deal waters down commitments on workers rights and the environment. The ldquolevel playing field on standards will be negotiated as part of the future trading relationship, rather than as a legally-binding condition of the Withdrawal Deal. But that is pretty much inevitable, since the UK is leaving the European Union, and therefore cannot reasonably remain under its jurisdiction.However, this allowed Labour and the SNP to reject the deal on the grounds that Johnson was planning a ldquorace to the bottom on regulation and workplace standards. But Im not sure it is reasonable to assume that. Theres no reason to suppose that the UK Parliament will impose worse standards than those of the EU. The Tories wont be in power for ever.Of course, Johnson made further concessions. He now accepts at least some customs checks in the Irish Sea. He dumped the Democratic Unionist Partys veto on future arrangements, in place of consent by a simple majority in the Northern Irish Assembly. It was odd to hear some Labour MPs siding with the DUP on consent, when previously theyd accused Boris Johnson of being in Arlene Fosters pocket.The opposition also found themselves son the wrong side of the European Union. Brussels really wants this deal. What was remarkable about the optics of last weeks EC summit was the back-slapping bonhomie with which Boris Johnson was greeted by the EU heads of state.Not long ago, Brussels regarded Boris Johnson as a monster ndash a populist, ultra-Brexiteer, who could not be trusted. He was consigned to that ldquospecial place in hell that the EC President Donald Tusk said was reserved for ldquonationalist politicians like him. Yet last week it was all smiles and fist bumps.But that all seems academic now. We are back in Brexit purgatory after another  dawn. The problem is that the opposition parties cannot agree on what they want, and will only insist on what they dont want.Despite the huge demonstration in London in favour of a Peoples Vote, Remain MPs didnt even try to secure a vote on a repeat referendum on Saturday. Nor will Parliament ever vote to Revoke Article .Even the  Labour MPs, led by Stephen Kinnock, who wrote to Brussels urging the EU to agree a deal with Boris Johnson, ended up voting against. Numerous Tory MPs who broadly support the deal, like Ken Clarke, cant get in line. Everyone wants something that they cant have.There will now be further procedural wrangling and wriggling this week, as the Government tries to get another meaningful vote tomorrow and a second reading of the Withdrawal Bill on Tuesday. On paper, the votes should be there,the Tory rebels relent and Labour Brexiteers vote for the deal.But votes alone have never been enough to get Brexit over the line. This affair has now gone beyond politics and turned into a kind of psychological condition.

Its MPs voted against the idea in April, but could they now compromise to avoid regulatory checks in the Irish Sea  Some Westminster insiders think so.If Mr Johnson does emerge from this bruising game as a winner and the UK leaves the EU before the end of the year, it appears increasingly likely that his opponents will have signicantly changed the definition of a victory.But what of the spectators  The hundreds of thousands who marched on London at the weekend to demand a Peoplersquos Vote on Brexit.Itrsquos an idea that now has the support of  per cent of people in Scotland, compared to only %t who would prefer a General Election ndash with % unsure ndash according to a Panelbase poll published yesterday.The team campaigning for a confirmatory referendum started le in the lower leagues, but has now reached the Premiership.

And not only that, Nigel Farage and Boris Johnsonrsquos likely successes in England will be exactly the away result the SNP thrives upon.The only way the SNP can really lose isBrexit is stopped, taking away the partyrsquos justication for demanding a snap second independence referendum.That might go some way to explaining why neither Nicola Sturgeon nor Ian Blackford mentioned a Peoplersquos Vote in their conference speeches last week, and the SNP has used its Parliamentary amendments to prioritise a General Election instead.First things first though: this morning all eyes are on Jacob Rees-Mogg as he outlines the Governmentrsquos preferred next steps.A reminder that perhaps wersquore all losers in this game."},{"url":null,"title":"andy-maciver-take-moral-high-ground-ignore-public-mood-peril","story":"Two major movements showed their lack of this power last week - Extinction Rebellion and the Remain Alliance. These movements share a number of similarities. Firstly, they have both emerged out of a genuine and real problem. Climate change is undeniably a global issue of enormous proportion. And those who are currently dedicating their lives to campaigning on the issue, we must accept, do so from an altruistic starting point. And Brexit, though a far smaller problem, also needs to be fixed and those who wish to fix it by scrapping it are perfectly entitled to devote their time to so doing, with the rest of us also accepting that they are decent people.Their second commonality, though, is where their problems begin. For they are both characterised by a very heavy dosage of moral superiority. Extinction Rebellion protesters are so utterly convinced of their righteousness that they are completely unable to see the validity of any other argument. Even those of us who are personally exercised by the climate change problem and wish to contribute to fixing it in a realistic timescale are castigated by Extinction Rebellion as ruthless capitalists. Similarly, those in the Remain Alliance who wish to scrap Brexit find it almost impossible to see the perspective of someone like me: a Remain voter who believes that democratic legitimacy demands that the biggest democratic exercise in the countryrsquos history is honoured.It is this moral superiority that has led to both movements crossing a threshold this week, which in the final analysis is likely to lead to their emaciation. In both cases, their most hardcore supporters will never accept that any errors have been made, but in their pursuing of the purest form of their argument, both movements are now risking losing the goodwill of the \"silent majority\".In the case of Extinction Rebellion, the removal of a protester from the roof of a tube train by London commuters was a metaphor for a misreading of the public mood. It had, before that, largely escaped the scrutiny it deserves, given that the execution of its net-zero by  policy  would probably involve the end of capitalism, mass unemployment and a global famine. But the disruption of electric mass-transit public transport, as well as making no strategic sense, may represent the peak of the curve for Extinction Rebellion, particularly in a country which is actually making seismic strides to alter its energy production away from coal, towards renewable sources. This could be the point at which the public says: ldquowersquoll find our own way through this, thanks. Or, worse still, the point at which the public association of Extinction Rebellion with climate change sets back the legitimate case for action.And here we arrive at Brexit, again. I voted Remain in , and I donrsquot regret that. I voted Remain for all the reasons that have come to fruition. It was never going to be an amicable orce because the EU was always likely to make it dficult, and, as the Scottish independence referendum has taught us, the UK was always likely to enter a period of deep ision. EU membership was a priority issue for a small proportion of people, and we are here essentially because of an internal schism in the Tory party.The public has since been remarkably patient with politicians. We have allowed them to prolong the process in the hope that we may reach the most sensible outcome possible. We have allowed extensions, and a change of Prime Minister. We are even prepared, polling would suggest, to allow another general election, the third in four years,it would serve a purpose to break the jam. But there comes a time where that silent majority says: ldquothatrsquos it.That time came when Boris Johnson, against the received wisdom, it must be said, came back from Brussels with a new deal. Polling in the immediate aftermath, by YouGov, captured concisely the mood of the nation. Leaving with Johnsonrsquos deal now leads Remain by  per cent. More than one in five Remain voters - yes Remain voters - want to take the deal. And only % of Labour voters - still notionally driving the Remain Alliance - now want to stay.I would suggest that the scale of the Remain Alliancersquos misreading of that public mood on \"Super Saturday\" will only become more evident in the days to come, with polling sentiment on the up for taking the deal, for Johnson himself and for the Tory party.The morally superior always make tactical errors. And out of that moral superiority - that bunker mentality - has emerged this absolute clanger.Actions have consequences. In truth, Remain has overplayed its hand to the degree that this is a win-win for Boris Johnson. The optics of the Remain Alliance, for the umpteenth time trying to thwart Brexit, will do him nothing but good in the tired eyes of the public. Despite that, it seems more likely than not that his deal will make it through the Commons, with a departure from the EU on or very shortly after st October.There is then very little left in the tactical arsenal of the Labour Party or the Remain Alliance to prevent a General Election. And, at that, a General Election in a post-Brexit environment with very little role for, or visible presence of, Nigel Farage. Therersquos only one place for the Brexit Partyrsquos votes to go, and thatrsquos to Boris, complete with barrel-loads of Labour Leave votes in the Midlands, north of England and South Wales.If this all sounds familiar, it is because it would represent the near-precise execution of the Dominic Cummings Boris Johnson strategy from day one. They knew which votes were available to them, they pursued a deal while the media swallowed the narrative to the contrary, and they understood the rewards of a post-Brexit election. Both men, I suspect can put up being called dictators in Parliament and Nazis on a Peoplersquos Vote march. Their eyes have always been on a bigger prize - a landslide.Remainers have blindly danced to their tune all along. We Remainers like to think wersquore very clever, but the Alliance showed all the hallmarks of bunker mentality by failing to understand the public and business mood on Super Saturday.Andy Maciver is Director of Message Matters"},{"url":null,"title":"parliament-must-accept-deal-britain-get-eu-fta-end-2020-truss-says","story":"International Trade Secretary Liz Truss said numerous countries including the US and Japan were keen to secure FTAs with Britain.Read more:Labour set to push for second referendum to be included in Govts Brexit dealldquoOur friends across the Channel have also indicated a desire for a strong trade agreement and there is plenty of time to secure an EU FTA by the end of we leave with this deal on October  without further pointless delay, Ms Truss wrote in The Daily .On Thursday, Ms Trussrsquos Tory colleague Conor Burns gave an update to the Commons on the UKrsquos post-Brexit trade agreements.Mr Burns told MPs: ldquoIn preparation for our exit from the European Union the Government has, to date, secured  continuity trade agreements with  countries.Read more:Scottish judges set to rule on whether Boris Johnson in contempt of court over Brexit lettersldquoTrade with these countries represents  per cent of the UKrsquos total trade.Ms Truss has previously indicated that the UK could have up to  free ports creating ldquothousands of jobs after it leaves the EU.On Monday she wrote that Parliament had a chance to end the lack of clarity about Britainrsquos trade future.ldquoAnd think of where we could be in December we do  she added.Read more:Row over BBC Laura Kuenssberg biased anti-Sturgeon tweetldquoFree trade deals negotiated with the EU and other partners that ensure our future as a high skilled, innovative, free enterprise economy, excelling in tech, data and services and selling our high-quality food around the world."},{"url":null,"title":"holyrood-set-emergency-recall-brexit","story":"The First Minister has asked the opposition parties to agree to parliament convening on Thursday afternoon to debate the Prime Ministers revised withdrawal agreement.Holyrood is currently in a two-week recess, and is not due tountil next Monday.The party business managers are now expected to consider the proposals.They will have to consider whether it is practical for MSPs, some of whom may be out of the country.The final decision lies with Presiding Officer Ken Macintosh, who is currently on a short trip to the Swedish parliament.However in practice, he would be guided by the wishes of the parties.Earlier this year there were plans to recall Holyrood from its Easter recess in the event of a no-deal Brexit, but they were not put into effect.Scottish Liberal Democrat leaderWillie Rennie said: ldquoScottish Liberal Democrats will vote against Brexit again on Thursday.ldquoThe vote on Thursday in the Scottish Parliament will be another signal that the Brexit deal is a bad idea.ldquoIt is time for Scottish Conservatives to show some backbone.

As is tradition, an ensign, which has been tied to the wreck of the battleship was presented to a family member of one of the crewmen. This year, it was presented to Allan Myers from Stoke-on-Trent, whose father, marine George Myers, was lost aboard the battleship.HMS Royal Oak sank to the bottom of Scapa Flow after it was torpedoed by the German submarine U-.

Customers travelling from Kirkwall will now be able to fly to destinations such as Exeter, Norwich and Southampton with just one ticket.Loganair and Flybe routes to and from Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Inverness and Manchester – the five main airports where the airlines’ networks meet – are included. According to the companies, this means that customers making a single booking for a connecting journey between Flybe and Loganair flights will be  check-in bags right through to their final destination with the assurance that they will be re-booked to their destination free of chargeweather conditions or other delays lead to missed connections.The airlines have said that the new codeshare agreement also offers a signicant saving for customers as they no longer have to pay the multiple Air Passenger Duty charges they faced previously when buying separate tickets from Loganair and Flybe to build their own connecting itinerary.Alan Tune, Flybe’s director of sales, alliances and strategic partnerships, said: “We are pleased to add Loganair to our ever-increasing list of codeshare partners, offering customers even more flight connection opportunities by linking our route networks.#The new codeshare agreement with our Loganair partner offers unrivalled connectivity between most of the main cities, islands and regions of the UK, and onwards to several key European cities, too.”Jonathan Hinkles, Loganair’s Managing Director, added: “I’m incredibly pleased to be launching this new partnership with Flybe, which will bring tremendous benefits for customers through assured connections, reduced travel costs and convenient through check-in.#The new codeshare agreement will link all of the communities that we’re proud to serve as Scotland’s airline with major destinations throughout the UK and Europe, and I’m sure that this will be fantastic news for UK tourism, business and by making it easier to visit friends and family.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This latest delay is blamed on concerns raised by the European Commission.

Orkney currently outranks every other Scottish partnership in eight out of nine of these indicators.Sally Shaw, chief officer for Orkney Health and Care, said: #In undertaking the activities set out in this plan and the developing Strategic Commissioning Implementation Plan, we are determined to use all available community assets and also to ensure our third sector colleagues become equal partners.  Equal does not just mean sitting at the same table, it means having an equal say in how, what and when we commission, amongst other things.#We also seek to ensure that we break down hierarchy and other barriers that hinder our staff in their day to day work. We want to develop imagination, innovation and a culture where staff feel engaged, enabled and are part of a learning organisation.  We see this as essential for driving forward what will be a ‘health and social care revolution’ here in Orkney.#The plan is available on Orkney Islands Council’s website # https:www.orkney.gov.uk Service-Directory S ohac-strategic-commissioning-plan.htmcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

People will get their money back when theytheir empty container for recycling.The scheme is expected to increase recycling of single-use bottles and cans and cut CO emissions, playing an important role in tackling the climate emergency. It will also give people an extra incentive not to litter.Zero Waste Scotland, who helped the Scottish Government design the scheme, is especially interested to hear from islands-based drinks producers, retailers, hospitality businesses, and other key stakeholders, such as tourism businesses.The draft regulations laid before the Scottish Parliament in September include a target of capturing  per cent of all scheme containers. Achieving that requires making the scheme accessible and practical for everyone in Scotland.In addition to this and six other island engagement events, the Scottish Government will complete an Islands Impact Assessment to ensure that any signicant unique impacts on island communities are captured and mitigated against. A webinar will be held after the final event to give people that could not attend a chance to learn more about the scheme.Jill Farrell, chief operating officer, Zero Waste Scotland, said: “We want to make sure that Scotland’s Deposit Return Scheme works for the whole of Scotland. That’s why we are visiting Orkney to speak with residents, businesses and stakeholders. We want to benefit from their insight into how this will work for the islands.“Making the scheme a success in Orkney will require dferent approaches from in Scotland’s cities. From logistics and transport, to cash flow and tourism, we look forward to discussing how we can work together to deliver a world-class scheme.”Alastair Nicolson, programme manager at Highlands  Islands Enterprise, said: “This is a very ambitious scheme that aims to make a real dference to people and communities in every part of Scotland.“For the scheme to work effectively, dferent approaches will need to be worked out and applied. Models of recycling that work well in large towns and cities won’t necessarily bring about the desired results in rural areas, including islands and remote mainland communities.“It’s great that the needs of islanders are being recognised at this early stage of the Deposit Return Scheme through this programme of events on the ground and online.”The Orkney engagement event will take place at The Orkney Hotel, Kirkwall, on Thursday October , from am to pm.To sign up to take part, visit http:bit.ly DepositReturnOrkneyA webinar will be hosted by Zero Waste Scotland following its series of island engagement events.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Competitive pricing from hotels and other accommodation providers in Aberdeen has undoubtedly contributed to this, but that also acts as reassurance there are other options available for those who need it. Bookings are not being taken beyond the end of October, which is the intended date of closure subject to the outcome of our consultation with affected staff.“We will continue to offer other British Red Cross services from other locations in the city.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Targeting public transport is ideologically nonsensical but to do it at a time when irritable commuters are trying to make their way across heaving s is akin to having a death wish. Which is not to suggest the way the mob turned against the man standing on top of the train was acceptable merely that it could have been predicted by anyone who has spent time on the London Underground at rush hour.The misjudgment alienated workers who might in other, less volatile circumstances have been interested in a discussion about climate change. But it also allowed those right-wing commentators – the Brendan O’Neills and the Toby Youngs – to build on existing tropes of the campaigners as too middle class, too “elitist” and too extreme. The spectacle of the likes of Times columnist and Brexiteer Iain Martin positioning himself as the defender of “working class cleaners” would be hilariousit wasn’t so depressing. But these labels stick, especiallythe targets are stupid enough to engage in behaviour which perpetuates them. It’s dficult enough to take on governments and global corporations without handing their smirking henchmen the weapons with which to shoot you.Though the Canning Town protest brought matters to a dramatic head, criticism of the movement – its lack of a coherent ideology or strategy, its insensitivity to race and class issues its “the end of the world is nigh” catastrophising – have been a source of internal and external friction for a while.Extinction Rebellionhas been influenced by political scientist Erica Chenoweth who says . per cent of a population must take part in a campaign of civil disobedience to guarantee political change. In order to attract that . per cent, the movement has to be inclusive. However,you embrace a large cross-section – rich and poor, young and old, people from all ethnicities and political perspectives – it’s unrealistic to expect their views on causes, priorities or tactics to be aligned.There are many obvious fault lines in XR. There is the ide between those in the global north – where we are being urged to “think of the children” – and the global south, where the poorest are already directly being impacted by floods. There is a ide between those who can afford to pay a carbon tax on flights and those for whom it might mean the loss of their once-a-year package holiday.And then there is the ide between left and right between those anti-capitalists who would once have been in Occupy and “Malthusians” – like Rupert Read – who want to rein in large-scale immigration. The extent to which this obliviousness to potential “othering” has the capacity to damage XR can be seen in the furore over the flowers left for the police officers at Brixton Police station. It takes a gag-inducing dollop of white privilege not to associate Brixton Police station with the oppression of black communities or to understand that praising officers for their “decency and professionalism” might be considered offensive.The kind of climate change deniers who tweeted: “Please not Greta Thunberg” on the day the Nobel Peace Prize was due to be announced have already branded XR a Doomsday Cult. I would argue you can’t be a Doomsday “cultist” when the Doomsday scenario is rooted in science. But again XR sometimes behaves in a way that encourages this interpretation. It doesn’t help that co-founder Gail Bradbrook’s world view altered after she took mind-bending drugs on a retreat in Costa Rica. Nor that some of those involved are so Biblical in their presentation of future destruction. When Bradbrook declares  per cent of species will be dead within her daughter’s letime unless we all stop producing CO by , she sounds more like a wild-eyed prophet than a credible campaigner.This matters a lot. If the complaint about climate change deniers is they ignore science, then XR has to be rigorous in sticking to the facts. It should base its statements on demonstrable truths – the destruction of our coral reefs, rising sea water levels, plummeting insect numbers. And its demands should be realistic. If it is feasible to ask the UK to reduce carbon emissions to net zero by , fair enough, Butit is not – and many experts believe it isn’t – then they should focus on what can be achieved. Pushing for too much, too quickly is only going to wind up potential sympathisers.Talking of winding people up, XR leaders should use the tube station disaster as “a learning opportunity”. Civil disobedience is an important tool. It can raise awareness. It can force the hands of governments. But the targets have to be carefully chosen. Not the London underground. Or the BBC which – despite sometimes giving climate change deniers a  – devotes time to reporting the impact of extreme weather conditions.Those organising the protests ought to be mindful of workers’ routines and a balance ought to be struck between causing enough of a disturbance to make an impact and so great a disturbance it threatens livelihoods. And use some imagination. If you want to target public transport, don’t bring it to a standstill, forcing more people to use their cars make some statement about its cost or inefficiency. Alongside the civil disobedience, the movement would gain from demonstrating some grasp of the complexity of climate change: the way it intersects with capitalism and class and how –we do not guard against it – the solutions may entrench inequality rather than reverse it.Extinction Rebellion is right in principle. Climate change is the most important issue of our time. The consequences of not acting quickly enough will be seismic. It is not true, as Thunberg has implied, that governments are doing nothing but they are not doing nearly enough.To force them to change their ways requires a massive, but also a measured response. Martin Luther King – the inspiration behind much of XR’s thinking – orchestrated bus boycotts and marches. But he retained enough establishment respect to be accepted into the White House to talk to JFK and Lyndon B Johnson at least until the Civil Rights Act was signed into law. At the moment, the movement is making le easy for those naysayers who criticise XR’s tactics not because they have better ones, but because they want to push climate change off the agenda.If Extinction Rebellion wants to be taken seriously, it needs to be less scatter-gun. It needs to rein in its renegades and rid itself of racists who see those in the global south as “the problem” rather than as victims of colonialism. Saving the world is a lofty aim, but it won’t be achieved by alienating all those whose co-operation is neededthings are to change. It will be done by creating a consensus by persuading as many people as possible that radical, systemic change is not just desirable, but imperative.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"lesley riddoch snp must back labour s brexit vote plan","story":"Keir Starmer#s is the only constructive and democratic way out of the Brexit stalemate, and Sturgeon should follow, writes Lesley Riddoch.Never mind the provocative bluster from Boris Johnson’s hollow frontmen and women, there is no disguising the signicance of the Tories’ weekend defeat. Of course, many predict rebel Conservatives will nowto the fold, able to support the Johnson deal since the Letwin amendment ensures it cannot be “accidentally” dropped, talked out or stalled before  October. But Tory Remainers will soon face another testing option – putting the withdrawal deal to the people in a second Deal v Remain European referendum. It looks increasingly that this is the only constructive and democratic way out of the Brexit stalemate, and the option’s current traction owes a lot to the growing status of Keir Starmer.: Ian Blackford: Boris Johnson not treating office of PM with any respectThe shadow Brexit secretary followed an impressive Commons speech on Saturday with a categorical assurance on yesterday’s Andrew Marr Show that Labour will back an amendment calling for a referendum on Johnson’s Brexit deal, perhaps as early as tomorrow. No s or buts. No self-defeating subclauses or bizarre contradictions. : MSPs on course to back laws for quickfire Scottish independence voteClear, comprehensible and conclusive. Hardly Labour-like at all.And bold, leaving Britain open to the great risk of a second Leave vote – a result that would then be impossible to sidestep or deny. A game-changer But the plan has just as big an upside – it’s as bold as the disruptive and eye-catching strategy of one Boris Johnson.Could this be the game-changer that finally unites the opposition around a single Remain plan  Will Jeremy Corbyn back a colleague who’s widely and openly being touted as the next leader of the Labour Party  And will the SNP follow suit  Strangely enough – even on the fractious left – the answer to both questions could finally be yes.The stock of Starmer, former director of public prosecutions, has been rising quietly throughout the Brexit debacle but his Commons speech on “super Saturday” was as succinct and punchy as Corbyn contributions are generally “nuanced” and stumbling.Historian Simon Schama tweeted: “Keir Starmer has actually READ the proposed agreement in crucial detail and thought deeply and forensically about it – and then argues responsibly from that detail. Brilliant, but makes everyone WISH he were leader.”Such open praise and longing for change at the top would be enough to send a younger rival packing,Labour had a petty, self-opinionated leader. But while Corbyn may have many faults, personal envy doesn’t seem to be one of them. Indeed Starmer’s success actually reflects very well on the man who appointed him. As one supporter tweeted: “Corbyn runs a team, takes a backseat when needed and lets his star members shine. Other leaders demand the spotlight, refuse to delegate and fail. It’s no coincidence he’s seen out two Tory PMs.”Jeremy CorbynBut is the Brexit-leaning Labour leader smart enough to back Starmer instead of overriding him  A second referendum call has the benefit of being a relatively quick manoeuvre, not requiring a Labour election win, and helpfully separating the party from its own crazy plan to renegotiate Brexit but then campaign against its own new deal in a second referendum. Supporting Johnson’s deal would placate Brexit supporters and the “just get it over with” brigade, while also delighting Remain voters with the possibility that the attached second vote might dump Brexit altogether.Indeed the only thing wrong with Starmer’s second referendum plan is that it opens Labour up to the accusation of being feart – failing to propose a vote of no confidence and a general election, even though the next EU extension will certainly end the danger of a no-deal Brexit. So will Corbyn back a confirmatory referendum on Johnson’s deal  He might,other parties back the move. It’s rumoured high-profile Tories such as Amber Rudd now accept there’s no other way to break the deadlock. Will she and other rebels openly back a second referenduma suitably neutral backbencher champions the cause  Starmer even hopes to coax the DUP on board. Good luck with that. But what about the most important block of votes – the SNP. Is it ready to play ball Backing the wrong horseSpeaking on Sunday Politics Scotland, Ian Blackford wouldn’t commit the SNP to following Labour’s lead and talked instead of another court case or a vote of no confidence. It seems a strangely wooden response to a fluid situation and leaving the SNP in danger of backing the wrong horse tomorrow. Nicola Sturgeon has suggested that the path to a second vote will be rockier than anyone appreciates. Certainly,the amendment passes, it’s not clear how a second vote will be organised. Can Johnson really be expected to produce a fair, timeous, workable referendum he doesn’t want to hold  The childish, churlish clutch of letters sent to the EU this weekend shows how grudging he can be. That’s why many MPs believe a “government of national unity”is the only way to deliver a second vote that resolves the Brexit process once and for all. SNP MP Joanna Cherry believes such a scenario is the best chance of winning a Section  order – which would allow the Scottish Parliament to hold a legally binding second independence referendum – not just because the SNP would be in a bargaining position but also because democrats from other parties would find it hard to deny the inconsistency in their current second vote positions.There’s also clear popular support amongst Scottish voters for a pan-UK second vote to end the EU withdrawal deadlock. A new Panelbase poll found that only  per cent supported a general election - Nicola Sturgeon’s current stance - while  per cent would prefer another referendum.  per cent were don’t knows.Of course, the SNP may worry that a confirmatory referendum on Brexit sets a dficult precedent for indyref. It might, but we are where we are – perhaps about to find a democratic solution for a stalemate which might otherwise hand the next general election to Johnson on a plate. It’s also hoped the end of the Union will be more of a “conscious uncoupling” than a Brexit-style bust-up. Talks with opposition MPs in Scotland and London have been progressing quietly, aided by joint working over Brexit. Starting the indyref project in a collaborative, non-confrontational way allows the slender hope that constitutional change in Scotland will not be conducted with the high-handedness of the Conservatives’ Brexit.So all eyes will be on the backbenches tomorrow.If a well respected figure allows Labour to push for a second vote, and the SNP, Liberal Democrats and some Tory rebels follow suit, Britain’s constitutional logjam could be released far more quickly than anyone imagines. ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"bbc scotland presenter judith ralston swears after fluffing weather report","story":"Scottish weather presenter Judith Ralston swore on last nights Seven Days review programme after forgetting part of her report. window.twttr The BBC Scotland presenter was quick to apologise for saying the F-word before her sound was cut.

Downing Street said it would try once again to have a ldquomeaningful vote on its Brexit deal by presenting the motion to MPs later today. Number  is quietly confident it has the numbers to pass the deal and is eager to demonstrate to Brussels that it does not need an extension beyond  October.But Speaker John Bercow is widely expected to deny the Government the chance to put its deal before the House again, as he will see it as putting the same question to the Commons for a second time. It is something he did back in March to Theresa Mayrsquos deal and is likely to do so again.What does that mean for the legislation The Government will still have to present the Withdrawal Agreement Bill to the Commonsit wants Brexit to happen at all. The legislation is essentially an international treaty and MPs will be given time, as with any other bill, to debate what should and should not be in it. But deciding what should be in an international treaty usually takes time, something Mr Johnson does not have a lot ofhe is to stay true to his Brexit promise.: Scottish court delays decision on Boris Johnsons Brexit tacticsIt means the ldquoprogramme motion that will be tabled on Tuesday will be the first big vote as it will decide how long should be set aside to debate the bill. If MPs vote down or even amend the programme motion to beyond Halloween, it will be a setback for Mr Johnson.When will MPs first vote on the Bill Tuesday will also see MPs have their first vote on the Withdrawal Agreement Bill when it appears for the second reading. It is at this point at the second reading vote that things could become very hairy for the government. MPs from across the House are expected to table a raft of amendments to try and reshape the bill more to their liking in what one MP described as being ldquoguerrilla warfare.What kind of amendments will there be Labour has already said it is trying to garner support for an amendment that will keep the UK in a customs union with the EU. Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer made an open appeal to the DUP to back the plans, which it has yet to rule out.The party sees preserving the Union as more of a priority than leaving the EU, and has been hugely critical of Mr Johnsonrsquos deal. A previous indicative vote last March on remaining in the customs union only missed out by three votes, so there is every chance it could pass.What about a second referendum There is also likely to be an attempt to demand the Brexit deal should be subject to a ldquoconfirmatory referendum that would see the Brexit proposals put back to the people. However, there does not seem to be the support in the House for this as yet,indeed there ever is.What would the Government doany of these amendments pass Should Parliament succeed in amending the legislation to keep the UK in a customs union, there is a strong possibility that Mr Johnson will simply pull the bill, rather than see what he and many hardline Brexiteers call ldquoBrexit it name only.What would that mean for Brexit It would most likely mean more delay. The Prime Minister will be forced to accept any extension given by Brussels.

They should have a steady stream of Gaelicspeakers coming through the primary school now, so we’d be delighted to seethem back and entering choral and other competitions.“The same goes for Lochaber, where there is also a Gaelic school, and for Inverness Royal Academy, the school which pupils of Bun-sgoil Ghàidhlig Inbhir Nis go on to attend.#Mr Morrison added: “It’s often said that youngsters need more opportunity for speaking Gaelic outside of a school setting – and the Mòd should be the ideal  for that.“If Nicolson and Sir E Scott canmanage to come every year, there’s no reason why Portree couldn’t.“We’d love to see them back on stage when the Mòd comes to Inverness next year.”MEANWHILE, singers from Back and Benbecula qualied in first place for Thursday night#s Traditional Gold Medal final.Isabelle Bain, a -year-old postgraduate law student at Glasgow University, won the Moray Trophy in the women#s qualying competition.She has ed to competitive singing after a three year break, and tonight will be her third appearance in the prestigious final.Alasdair Iain MacPhee, from Nunton in Benbecula, leads the men#s competition after winning the Lochaber Rotary Club trophy.The -year-old works as a Gaelic primary teacher at Winhill School in Greenock, and is competing at his first ever Mòd, having been persuaded by his pupils to take part.Both Alasdair and Isabelle scored  out of  and, as a result, they shared the Donald Murray memorial trophyGlasgow gaels also won both of the Gold Medal singing competitions held om Wednesday.The men#s Gold Medal was won by Ruairidh Alasdair MacLennan, a BBC reporter from Glasgow, but with family connections to South Uist.The women#s prize was won by teacher Clare MacAulay, originally from Ness in Lewis."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IMG_2889.jpg","title":"premier mod choral prize for back gaelic choir in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineCòisir Sgire a# Bhac # Back Gaelic Choir # enjoyed a day of success during Thursday#s rural choral competitions at the Royal National Mòd in Glasgow The Lewis choristers won the Lorn Shield, with fellow islanders Carloway and Lochs completing the contest#s top three.Bùrach, a choir mainly from the Morvern area, won the Sherf MacMaster memorial quaich.It is the third year in succession that the choir, led by Riona Whyte, has won the coveted prize.competition.

The proposal was supported by the two SNP councillors in the Barra and South Uist Ward and the five SNP councillors from Lewis and Harris.”In his statement, Councillor MacMillan also accused Labour Highlands and Islands MSP Rhoda Grant of calling for a government inquiry into the issue as a means of “taking the focus” off of comhairle convenor Councillor Norman A MacDonald # whom he described as a “Labour party colleague” to Rhoda Grant # and who has voted, according to Councillor MacMillan, to back the Uist dental plan.Councillor MacMillan added: “Rhoda Grant#s proposal for an inquiry is a politically motivated ersionary tactic designed to prevent the truth about Labour Party councillors voting to close the medical provision at Uist Hospital.“Rhoda Grant should instead call for the Western Isles NHS to start telling the truth, to publish the voting record of the [Integration Joint Board]meeting and explain the real reason for centralising the dental provision into the Uist Hospital which is to close the Operating Theatre and Resuscitation Room to remove the surgical capacity from the hospital.”Responding to the claims, Norman A MacDonald stated that he wasn#t present at the last IJB meeting, and said that “assurances had been given” that the relocation of the dental service in Uist would have “no detrimental impact on the Uist and Barra hospital whatsoever.The convenor added: “After the original vote at the IJB on this matter resulted in a split vote, from then on it was up to the chief executives to decide what would take place.“I have no idea what kind of influence Councillor MacMillan might think I have, as both Uist and Barra hospital and the Western Isles Hospital hospital are solely the responsibility of the health board and it is not for councillors to make any decisions on their future.“I have never discussed in any shape or form either the dental service in Uist or her call for an inquiry with Rhoda Grant.“As to the colour of my politics, Councillor MacMillan#s claims are equally questionable. I have registered for the last fteen years as an independent councillor.”Mrs Grant said: “Councillor MacMillan#s assertion would be laughable were it not such a serious issue in question.“I have, from the outset in , listened to the concerns being raised by constituents, by the Uist Locality Planning Group, by the Association of Community Councils, by a stakeholder event held in Lochboisdale, and by all local elected members serving when this proposal to centralise dental services was first aired.“I have repeatedly made representation to the IJB, to NHS Western Isles, to the comhairle, to the previous Health Secretary, and to the First Minister.“Health boards and local authorities throughout Scotland are having to make incredibly dficult decisions to fit with the reducing budgets they are being given and perhaps Councillor MacMillan, instead of throwing meaningless insults around, would do better focusing on bringing this to the attention of his colleagues in the Scottish Government, opposing jobs and services being taken out of local communities.“This is an appalling decision, which flies in the face of local democracy, and constituents in Uist deserve to have their concerns heard, and heeded.”Officially, it was something called the Integration Joint Board that made the announcement at the end of last month: all roads will soon lead to Balivanich. But the IJB began le as a creature of the big boys it is staffed by officials from both public agencies. Is its independence nominal  It#s hard to be sure.Whatever the limits of its power, it is a useful fig leaf to hide behind. The barrage of flak directed at this rotten decision to centralise a vital health service can be dodged by the likes of NHS Western Isles chief executive Gordon Jamieson. The plan to close three dental surgeries came from the IJB. At least that#s how it was sold to the public.Before too long, everyone in the Uists will have to go to hospital in Balivanichthey need a filling or a tooth extracted. So much for the “professional concerns” comhairle chief executive Malcolm Burr has supposedly spent that last six months mulling over. At the end of September, he fell into line. Unanimity was required in order to proceed, and he delivered it.One particular paragraph from the IJB decision paper is worth quoting in full: “Given his familiarity with the subject matter, the chief executive of NHS Western Isles was able to come to an early view about the best arrangements for the provision of dental services in Uist but the chief executive of the comhairle, having no previous experience of these services, required more time to familiarise himself with the detail.”This admission is revealing. Completely out of his depth, it took Mr Burr six months to swot up on the intricacies of closing three dental surgeries before wielding the axe. In doing so, he perhaps exposed the limits of integrating health and social care, which is the IJB#s raison d#etre. Put simply, it should not be the responsibility of someone with no background in health care to make a decision like this. The IJB say there will be an “outreach” service aimed primarily at South Uist and Eriskay, the latter  miles away from Balivanich along single-track roads. What this pledge means, in dental terms, is still to be decided. Perhaps teeth can be extracted safely in the back of a van.If the fruits of integration — a much-hyped national paradigm — are vandalism on this scale, then we suggest a rethink is in order. The hybrid organisations driving the agenda don#t seem to be accountable to anyone, least of all the voters.Speaking of which, we are glad to see that Western Isles MSP Alasdair Allan has had a quiet word with Public Health Minister Joe Fitzpatrick about referring the matter to the Scottish Government. Ultimately, it is Health Secretary Jeane Freeman who has the power to stop this. Hopefully, she#ll use it before Stornoway wrecks a system that has worked well for decades."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/001WH1110NCA.jpg","title":"west highland free press audio files friday 11th","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineEvery week, Skye  Lochalsh Council for Voluntary Organisations http:www.slcvo.org.uk  produces an abridged audio version of the West Highland Free Press.

But for every bad news story about young people, there are so many more good news stories with many youngsters going above and beyond for the great of their own community.One such example is a group of girls from New Lodge Youth Centre who have recently embarked on an intergenerational project with elderly people in local nursing homes and accommodated living.An intergenerational project is one designed to help build better relationships between young and old people as well as tackle issues such as bullying and bereavement.The project also creates learning opportunities for the pupils and the elderly, with young people working one-on-one with seniors and asking questions about their childhood, work, hobbies and le in general.Paul Dynes from New Lodge Youth Centre said the intergenerational project came about thanks to their great relationship with Newington Housing Association.“Basically, the project came about after work between the youth centre and Martin Hamilton from Newington Housing Association, who use our building for ious events,” he said. “They have also provided us with support for ious programmes over the last couple of years. From our work together, it sparked an idea of doing some more things together. It was actually a group of young girls that came to one of our youth workers to express a real interest and want to engage with an elderly home or accommodated living or. as it is better known, some sort of intergenerational project.”The project is now in full swing with the girls spending a couple of hours each week engaging with the elderly.“The first session was all about storytelling, sharing experiences and memories before it progressed to taking part in games and activities to spark such conversations between them,” added Paul.“They were able to build up relationships with each other and started to understand more about each other which was key to the rest of the project. Since then, they have done all sorts of things together such as baking and other fun-based activities.“They have recently decided to go on to do a shared-art piece where they will create fashionable dresses to show the evolution of fashion over the years to the modern day.”Paul is now hopeful the project will be something other communities can take note of in order to break the stigma of some young people and elderly folk’s opinions of each other.“I think the bigger issue is that some young people may have views on elderly people and vice-versa.“Some young people get a bad name by causing trouble or engaging in anti-social behaviour and this type of project helps create an understanding of one another.“There is definitely a need for it within our community and indeed, in the wider society.“If there are people and groups who want to make it happen, it certainly can.“I would like to thank Martin Hamilton , James Begleyand everyone at New Lodge Arts and the Ashton Centre for their work and help in making the project happen.”To get involved with New Lodge Youth Centre, contact   "},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38615500.ece/c2f8c/BINARY/7_EU_Referendum_-_S.jpg","title":"35 of english public want northern ireland to remain in uk and many think irish politics complicated and mysterious","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

There’s water separating England and Ireland. SoNorthern Ireland became part of Ireland, that’s Ireland, one whole country\".Many, however, said they did not want to see the break up of the Union, although they acknowledged it was not up for them to decide. They said they felt the UK would be weakenedit were to break up with many feeling there was \"something important\" about the current constitutional arrangements.“We’re known as the four countries together worldwide. The Royal Family, bringing all of us together – people see us as one,\" was a common viewpoint found.“It’s like a family. You have dysal families but you still come together,” was another.“Historically, worldwide, the UK has been a leading force in a lot of areas. If it was all ided up I don’t think we would have the same standing in the world,” was another opinion among those surveyed.Does Brexit make it more likely that Scotland Northern Ireland will leave the UK, or not  pic OExXOikgvb— Lord AshcroftOctober , The polling found that while leave voters would be reluctant, they recognised both Scotland and Northern Ireland had voted to remain in the EU andit was a choice between the UK remaining  as it was or Brexit and the break up of the UK, they would chose Brexit.In the poll, % of English voters felt Brexit made Irish unication more likely, with % saying it made no dference and % saying they didnt know.Asked about Scottish independence, % said it was more likely than not.“You’d have to change the flag and everything. It wouldn’t be the United Kingdom any more,” was one view found.“We’re proud of our little nation and I don’t want bits breaking off. I want people to remember us as a dynamic little nation that fought against major powers and beat them. And it’s strength in numbers and historically what we’re known for. I’d rather we all stay together,\" was another view coming out of the focus groups.Lord Ashcroft added: \"This does not reflect a callous disregard for the Union but a pragmatic view that all parts of the UK had the right of self-determination.\"Is it acceptable for Northern Ireland to have dferent rules to the rest of the UK to get a Brexit deal  pic bKqOCKZ— Lord AshcroftOctober , The survey also asked about Northern Ireland having dferent arrangements to the rest of the UK in order to avoid a hardening of the border.A third - % - said that while it would not be ideal to have some EU laws and regulations apply, they felt it an acceptable compromise.

We will go ahead with the introduction of the WAB with second reading tomorrow,” the PM’s official spokesman said.”It came after Chief Secretary to the Treasury Rishi Sunak denied that trying to bring the deal back for a vote was a bid to portray Parliament as being obstructive.“It was an observation on the deal happening and I think what people need is a substantive vote,” he told BBC Radio ’s Today programme.“I think people are crying out to see that and they would find it odd , because of some technical procedural device, we weren’t able to have that vote.”If the Speaker does block the move, focus will switch to the Government bringing its Withdrawal Agreement Billbefore MPs on Monday, with a vote on its second reading on Tuesday.The WAB is the legally-binding treaty that must be passed for the UK to leave the bloc, while the Government must also win a meaningful vote.Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay called on MPs to “respect the referendum” by backing the Bill, warning them: “This is the chance to leave the EU with a deal on October .”Ministers insist they could have sufficient support among MPs to get it passed so the UK can depart by the current October  deadline.But, with no Commons majority, Mr Johnson faces a major battle to achieve his cast-iron pledge.We are not attempting to wreck it, we are attempting to safeguard the British economy, safeguard jobs and safeguard public servicesShadow health secretary Jonathan AshworthLabour has denied it is trying to scupper the PM’s agreement by planning to amend it to secure a customs union and a second referendum as the legislation passes through Parliament.Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth told Today: “We are not attempting to wreck it, we are attempting to safeguard the British economy, safeguard jobs and safeguard public services.“We believe that the responsible way in which to leave the European Union is in a customs union arrangement and that, in turn, should be put to the British people so they can have a say on this.”Number  is opposed to a customs union and second referendum, and warned thatthe legislation in the Commons “steps too far away” from what has been agreed with the EU then it would “bring into question ratication”.Meanwhile, judges at Scotland’s highest civil court who have been asked to rule whether the PM lawfully complied with the Benn Act delayed making a decision until it becomes clear to them it was “complied with in full”.Mr Johnson was forced to send the letter under the law passed by MPs trying to fend off a no-deal Brexit because MPs did not support his deal by the Saturday deadline.But he signed a second letter saying a delay would be a mistake, and judges at the Court of Session in Edinburgh are to resume at a later date.The letters were sent after former Tory minister Sir Oliver Letwin handed Mr Johnson an embarrassing defeat in the Commons.Sir Oliver, who was among the rebels exiled by Mr Johnson over their attempts to stop a no-deal, successfully tabled an amendment which effectively forced the PM to ask for a delay.As Parliament demanded in the Benn Act, Mr Johnson wrote to European Council president Donald Tusk requesting an extension to the end of January.The PM did not sign the letter, and sent a second communication insisting that a delay would be “deeply corrosive” for the UK and the EU.Labour accused Mr Johnson of behaving like a “spoiled brat”.Meanwhile, the EU’s process for ratying the Brexit deal has begun, European Commission spokeswoman Mina Andreeva said.Nicola Sturgeon and Mark Drakeford, the Scottish and Welsh First Ministers, warned Mr Johnson’s deal would be “more damaging” than Theresa May’s as they called for him to allow Parliament and the devolved legislatures sufficient time to scrutinise the Bill. They also wrote to EU Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker supporting the extension request so the Wab can be scrutinised and that a confirmatory referendum can be held."},{"url":null,"title":"orionid meteor display set to light up night skies","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The technology was developed by researchers at the University of Bristol in partnership with Telecomm ParisTech and Sorbonne University in Paris.The team says their work opens the door for a possible future with “anthropomorphic devices” – where gizmos have human characteristics.Dr Anne Roudaut, associate professor at the University of Bristol, told the PA news agency: “It [the articial skin] may look unconventional probably because we are used to our senseless and rigid casings, but we feel there are strong advantages of using more malleable technologies.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  “And the familiarity of the skin provides a more natural interface for end-users.”The articial skin was created using two layers of silicone – dubbed “dermis” and “hypodermis” layers – with an electrode layer in the middle made up of ultra-thin wires that act as sensors. Two dferent types of silicone were dipped in pigment and moulded to give the creation a skin-like texture. The researchers said their articial skin allows devices to “feel the user’s grasp” and has the ability “to detect interactions such as tickling, caressing, even twisting and pinching”.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  One of the things the researchers said they were able to demonstrate was “tactile emotions” with use of emojis. Marc Teyssier, a PhD student at Telecomm ParisTech and lead study author, said: “A strong grip conveys anger while tickling the skin displays a laughing emoji and tapping creates a surprised emoji.”He told PA: “This skin has a subtle surface texture – the sensing is performed in the dermis and the hypodermis layerand the elasticity is what allows us to perform expressive gestures such as pinching.”The team believe that their work, which is being presented at the nd ACM User Interface Software and Technology Symposium in the US, could allow people to have a richer emotional experience while using mobile phones or smartwatches.Mr Teyssier added: “When we are talking to someone face-to-face, we sometimes use touch to convey emotions and more generally enrich the discourse. “Now that mediated communication is performed through the devices, we lost this communication modality. \" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  “With this project, we tried to combine the best of the two.“The prototypes we developed propose a possible future with anthropomorphic devices.”While the concept of articial skin has been explored in the field of robotics as scientists attempt to develop robots that look and act like humans, the researchers said they were more interested in working with everyday devices.Dr Roudaut added: “We have seen many works trying to augment human with parts of machines, here we look at the other way around and try to make the devices we use every day more like us, ie, human-like.”"},{"url":null,"title":"watch skiing champion completes remarkable parkour routine at","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

When funding for the bypass has been confirmed, the piece of art will be fabricated.The news comes after it was confirmed recently that the Department of Finance is expected to approve the new roadrsquos economic appraisal by December which is viewed as a critical step in the process ahead of the required capital funding being released.While the required funding has not yet been made available, local politicians are hoping that it wonrsquot be long before contractors are on site.The Department of Infrastructure says the preparation of the schemersquos economic appraisal report is continuing with Department of Finance approval for the document due to be sought before the end of the year.In order to advance the bypass schemersquos state of readiness, preparatory work on contract documents is ongoing in a bid to minimise the time required to initiate a procurement competition, should funding become available for construction.As part of the proposed multi-million pound development, major new roundabouts are proposed at the Belfast Road junction with the Saintfield Road and at the Newcastle Road junction with the Downpatrick Road. A new bridge will be constructed over the Moss Road.It is also proposed that a section of the bypass will pass under part of the Crossgar Road with a  metre long bridge constructed to take traffic over Ballynahinch River.Overtaking lanes stretching almost  metres are proposed at either end of the bypass where the major new roundabouts are to be constructed, with the scheme also including a shared footpath and cycle lane.The bypass mdash which would be the single biggest road scheme ever constructed in the district mdash is expected to take in excess of  months to build, with roads officials insisting it will greatly benefit both strategic and local road users by reducing journey times and improving road safety.Roads officials are also confident that the schemersquos economic assessment demonstrates the bypass would provide a good economic ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/16th October 2019 Children.jpg","title":"Children from integrated schools listen talk  ","story":"A BALLYNAHINCH school played host to a conference to mark World Mental Health Day last Thursday.Over  young people from  integrated schools across the province converged on Drumlins Integrated Primary School to take part in lsquoListeningrsquo mdash an event organised by the Integrated Education Fund.The compere was BBC presenter Jo Scott ands guest speakers included Mr Richard Pengelly, Permanent Secretary at the Department of Health, and Kate Beggs, from the Northern Ireland Director of National Lottery Community Fund.Mr Pengelly said afterwards: ldquoYoung people are faced with a number of pressures including social media influences.

He and his we, who are committee members of the support group, have have always tried to integrate activities and sports for all of their three children.ldquoI didnrsquot want football to be a negative experience for my son or any other child, said Gerard. ldquoTeam sports such as football can be overwhelming for children with autism either in school or any local clubs but that doesnot mean they should not be able to participate.Gerard said that he has devised the five-week course which helps build up football skills at the appropriate level for each child.It will finish with a match of children playing against their parents in two weeks time.ldquoNinety-two percent of children with autism have a sensory processing delay so as coaches being able to communicate effectively to the children in a way that they can understand is important, explained Gerard. ldquoWe give the kids reward cards so they and their parents can see their progression which builds up to the match.ldquoThe parents are a brilliant support as some of the children would get very anxious but to have their parents there beside them makes it possible. With the added bit of theatre and drama we try to instil, it heightens the whole experience for them and helps to make memories for both.Gerard hopes to devise further sports courses for autistic children such as boxing.Aacuteine Sloan, chairperson, of the group, praised the contribution of the fathers, not just for helping their own children but for other local children with autism whose parents are members.She said: ldquoNot only is it fantastic that a programme of its kind is now available locally but that itrsquos down to two dads who took it upon themselves to fill the gap.ldquoDownpatrick Autism Family Support Group is % run by parents. Wersquore delighted that Gerard and Daniel have developed this programme so our children can have the same opportunities as their peers.

The same player then had a glorious chance for a goal when he got in behind the Kilcoo full back line, but lsquokeeper Martin McCourt made a brilliant save.The lsquoPoint continued to see plenty of the ball with corner forward Aron DrsquoArcy foraging deep, but they wasted a few kickable frees before Kilcoorsquos Ryan McEvoy brought the sides level with a free in the ninth minute.Ross McGarry then found his range and exchanged frees with Paul Devlin before the Kilcoo marksman punished Warrenpoint for another defensive indiscretion with his second point in quick succession.Ryan Johnston started seeing a lot more of the ball for Kilcoo, but it was Warrenpoint who drew level the th minute with a well-taken score from Ruairi McCormack.McGarry pointed Warrenpoint into a - to - lead after  minutes, but Kilcoo responded immediately with a m free from McCourt.Ryan Johnston then went on a searing run down the right flank and bore down on goal, but flashed his shot wide of Gary McMahonrsquos far post when he really should have tested the lsquokeeper.Devlin and McGarry swapped frees as the interval approached, but their was still time for the energetic Aidan Branagan to bomb forward from his full back berth to point Kilcoo into a - to - half-time lead.Warrenpoint were certainly not overawed by Kilcoo and started the second half the same way they attacked from the opening whistle of the game, but it was Kilcoo who edged into a - to - lead after  minutes with another score from the rampaging Ward.A McGarry free quickly negated this score before Kilcoo received a bad blow when Darryl Branagan was black carded and replaced by Shealan Johnston in the th minute.McGarry converted the resultant free to bring the sides level, but the game was really opening up at this stage and McMahon prevented a certain goal at the other end when he saved from Aiden Branagan.Warrenpoint went straight back on the attack and McGarry gave them a - to - lead with  minutes remaining.

Conor Laverty, who had been on the periphery of the game up until this stage, suddenly took centre stage.Nothing looked on when he received the ball about m from goal. However, he checked back inside his marker and somehow spotted Wardrsquos run from deep.An improvised flick-pass, albeit with the aid of a deflection, picked out the big midfielder and he made no mistake with an unerring finish past McMahon.That should have finished Warrenpoint off, but far from it.They immediately attacked in numbers and worked an opening for McGarry, but he sent his effort wide with the goal at his mercy.A McGarry free gave Warrenpoint some consolation and left a single point between the sides with  minutes played.The game was still anybodyrsquos, but consecutive scores from McEvoy and Jerome and Ryan Johnston seemed to put daylight between the entities with  minutes gone.Another McGarry free cut the deficit to three points as the game went into added time. Warrenpoint continued to bombard Kilcoo and further points from Donagh McAleenan and McGarry left a point in it, but Kilcoo won dirty ball when it mattered and ran the clock down to run out worthy winners.Kilcoo: Martin McCourt , Niall Branagan, Aidan Branagan , Niall McEvoy, Aaron Branagan, Darryl Branagan, Miceal Rooney, Ryan McEvoy , Dylan Ward , Anthony Morgan, Paul Devlin , Ryan Johnston , Eugene Branagan, Jerome Johnston , Conor Laverty.

The couplersquos son, Kenneth, was born in Swaziland and was smuggled across the border into South Africa and itrsquos this backstory which forms the genesis of his new book.Already an acclaimed author, Stan argues that the reason psychiatric hospitals and psychiatry were so signicant was because the way hospitals treated patients was equivalent to the way black people were classied and dominated in apartheid South Africa.All this is described in his new book, along with a way to evaluate the therapeutic value or lack of value in staff-patient interactions.When Stan came to Northern Ireland, he became a clinical psychologist, working in psychiatric hospitals. He was also the co-founder of a self-help group for mastering anxiety, panic and stress.Some of the background to this group is contained in his new book, as well as in another publication entitled lsquoSoul On Firersquorsquo mdash a guide to mastering anxiety, which is also available on Amazon.Together with the process of mastering anxiety, Stan also engaged in research into overcoming depression, put together in a book entitled lsquoRising from the Deadrsquo and the process of recovering from alcohol and drug addiction, contained in lsquoVictory of the Spiritrsquo.All this, he says, forms part of an understanding of the radical alternative to psychiatric colonialism.ldquoThe worst part of psychiatry lies in its process of diagnosing so-called mental illness, along with its prescribing of drugs, supposedly for correcting and lsquochemical imbalance in the brainrsquo says the author.Dr Papenfus illustrates that such a chemical imbalance does not exist. In fact, he argues that the ldquofraud involved in creating and medical basis for psychiatry is no more than a myth and there is shown in great detail in the book.Also demonstrated in great depth is what the author describes as the ldquounscientic basis of pharmaceutical companies supposed lsquotestingrsquo of prescribed psychiatric drugs.ldquoThis fraudulence results in millions of peoplersquos lives being ruined, year after year and in one country after another, said Dr Papenfus.ldquoEven children are now becoming a huge market for prescribed psychiatric drugs and some of their extremely dangerous effects are described. The research involved in this exposure calls for a dramatic and urgent response. This is what lsquoRenewing our Livesrsquorsquo provides.Between  and , Dr William Barrington was the leading psychiatrist at the Downshire Hospital in Downpatrick. According to Dr Papenfus, it was during these years that traditional bio-psychiatry was replaced with social psychiatry.ldquoUnder his guidance therapy always included a social dimension, said the author. ldquoGoals were formulated and realised. The personal empowerment of patients included regular reviews of what was going on and how everyone was making sense of everyone .ldquoThe result was that the Downshire Hospital was widely regarded as the best psychiatric facility in Europe. Because Dr Barringtonrsquos way of working was still strikingly held by many nurses, social workers and others, this is what persuaded me to come to work in the Downshire in .But, when he arrived, the author claimed that the ideology of the medical model of mental illness was in force once again and ldquothe dehumanising processes of bio-psychiatry was prominent once more.Despite this, the author says a transformation was still possible ands this is the hope behind his new book.Two copies of the new book have been placed in Downpatrick Library and it is also available on order, from Amazon..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/16th October 2019 Roy.jpg","title":"Roy Living healthy life to win coveted NI fitness accolade  ","story":"PORTAFERRYrsquoS Roy Livingstone has won the Centra Action Cancer Endeavour Award at the Northern Ireland Health and Fitness Awards.The prestigious event sponsored by Centra mdash held at Belfastrsquos Crowne Plaza and attended by  guests mdash celebrated the outstanding achievements of the local health and fitness industry.The awards were presented by TV personality and fitness advocate Vogue Williams and Q Radiorsquos Ibe Sesay.Roy has gone above and beyond the call of duty to help raise much-needed funds for Centrarsquos charity partner, Action Cancer, cycling from London to Paris and, most recently, a -mile cycle in San Francisco.Congratulating the Portaferry man on his win, Jenner Morton, Centra brand manager, said that over the years, Roy ldquoreally has gone the extra mile when it comes to fundraising for Action Cancer.She continued: ldquoFrom his cycles in Paris and San Francisco alongside local events and initiatives, Roy and the wider team at Centra in Portaferry have made a real impact with the funds they have raised.ldquoFrom everyone at Centra, wersquod like to say a big thank you to Roy.Funds raised by Centrarsquos customers go towards funding the health action programme which educates children of all ages about leading healthier lestyles as well as Action Cancerrsquos so-called big bus which travels across the Province driving home early cancer detection..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/16th October 2019 Traders.jpg","title":"Traders offered input into Irish Street scheme  ","story":"BUSINESS owners in Downpatrick are to be given a key input into ambitious plans to redevelop the former Irish Street police station site and a number of adjacent empty buildings.Newry, Mourne and Down Council and the Department for Communities are helping spearhead a an exciting retail and commercial proposal aimed at transforming the townrsquos economy, with both organisations working alongside the Provincersquos Strategic Investment Board.Last week, the Recorder revealed that a development brief designed to transform the sprawling town centre site as part of a multi-million pound investment was being progressed, with hopes that the document could be completed before the end of the year.During Mondayrsquos meeting of the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee,council officials confirmed that town centre traders, Downpatrick councillors and relevant public agencies will be involved in discussions to guide the development brief process.When the brief has been agreed, it will be advertised, inviting developers to come forward to transform the site to kick-start a signicant town centre economic regeneration initiative.A formal launch of the brief is also planned before Christmas.Marks and Spencer and Home Bargains are reported to be interested in opening new premises in Downpatrick and view Irish Street as an ideal location as there are currently no other suitable sites available.The development brief will outline what the local authority would like to see developed in Irish Street to maximise the potential of every square inch of available space.Permission has also been secured to purchase an outstanding piece of ground close to the Irish Street car park to allow the ambitious proposal to proceed.Itrsquos almost two years since it was revealed that the former police station site had been earmarked for a major economic regeneration initiative which could potentially include new housing.It is understood that as part of the regeneration scheme, the vacant buildings adjacent to the former police base will be bulldozed to open up a huge area. The development site also includes the council-owned Irish Street car park.However, the former police station mdash which enjoys protected status ndash will not be razed to the ground as part of the ambitious regeneration plan and is set to remain a key feature of the proposed redevelopment project.Downpatrick councillors Dermot Curran and Oonagh Hanlon have welcomed progress on developing the brief for the Irish Street redevelopment.Cllr Curran, who has been asking for traders to be involved with helping shape the development brief, is delighted this is going to happen to help shape the future development of the Irish Street site.He said it is critical all key stakeholders are involved in what will be the biggest ever investment in the town centre.Cllr Curran believes that with everyone on board at this early stage, the planned new retail and commercial centre has a signicant chance of succeeding, providing a boost for all businesses in the town.ldquoThis planned development can act as a catalyst for additional town centre investment, increasing footfall and providing a boost for existing businesses who have been at the backbone of the townrsquos economy for generations, he said.ldquoWhile details of the Irish Street scheme were announced almost two years ago, signicant progress is now being made. I have no doubt that the opportunity to redevelop a major town centre will appeal to many in the construction industry.Cllr Curran said the importance of the townrsquos business community being asked for its input into the redevelopment plan which has the potential to attract more shoppers to the town cannot be overstated.Cllr Hanlon agreed that the redevelopment proposal will provide Downpatrick with a much-needed economic boost and welcomed plans to form a stakeholder group to feed into the development brief.She added: ldquoThis forum will be open to all Downpatrick businesses and I would encourage their participation and views to ensure that all ideas are heard and considered. This will no doubt maximise the benefit of the proposed regeneration of this site for all of Downpatrick..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/16th October 2019 Funeral.jpg","title":"Tributes paid to former Down GAA star Eamonn Burns  ","story":"GLOWING tributes have been paid to former Down GAA player and manager Eamonn Burns who died suddenly last week.Hundreds of mourners turned out last Saturday to pay their final respects to the GAA star who was revered by everyone who knew him.A teacher at Shimna Integrated College where he was held in high esteem, Mr Burnshelped Down win two All Ireland titles in  and  and managed the team for three years before stepping down last summer.The father-of-two mdash who died following a heart attack mdash was buried at St Patrickrsquos Cemetery in Bryansford following a service of Requiem Mass in the Church of Our Lady of the Assumption in Newcastle.Local GAA teams lined the route as Mr Burnsrsquo remains were taken from his brother Colmrsquos house for Requiem Mass, while Shimna students formed a guard of honour at the church.Among the many tributes to Mr Burns was one from GAA president John Horan who said he had left ldquoa great legacy in the game.He added: ldquoOn and off the field Eamonn was a great ambassador for our association and we join our Mourne County colleagues and Gaels in lamenting his loss.Mr Horan said that it was with great sadness that he learnt of Mr Burnsrsquo passing and that it was only a few weeks ago at the jubilee dinner on All-Ireland football final day that he had the pleasure of meeting Eamonn and his colleagues as they saluted the th anniversary of the great lsquo Down team.He continued: ldquoThe special bond between the group was very evident and Eamonn was a big part of that. Not content with being a part of an iconic Down team, Eamonn was a man who was committed to giving back.ldquoHis club in Bryansford benefited and in more recent times he was prepared to put himself forward to take charge of the county team for three years and pass on his knowledge to a new generation of Down players.ldquoOn and off the field he was a great ambassador for our Association and we join our Mourne County colleagues and Gaels in lamenting his loss.Tributes have also been paid by former Down GAA legend Paddy lsquoMorsquo Doherty who referred to the late Eamonn Burns as ldquoa true legend because of the person he was.Doherty said: ldquoWhat very, very few people know is that in the build-up to one of the All-Ireland finals mdash I wonrsquot say which one mdash Eamonn was quietly nursing an injury. But such was his passion for Down that there was no way he was going to miss the game.ldquoFor me, that said much about the man he was. He ran the risk of maybe breaking down but through sheer willpower, courage and strength of character he came out triumphant.Doherty, one of the true GAA legends, said Eamonn Burns was never one to look for sympathy or seek comfort.ldquoHe stood on his own two feet and took what came at him. And when the going got tough he was always in there doing his bit for the cause. When you have a man like Eamonn in your corner, how could you fail to come out on top  he continued.Paddy Mo added: ldquoEamonn was a legend. Not just because he was a whole-hearted player who gave everything for the cause at club and county levels, but because he was as honest as the day is long.ldquoHe was a wonderful ambassador for our Association, honourable, dignied and respectful. In my book he was a true legend because of the person that he was. He has left a rich legacy both in a playing context and in the way he carried himself. His memory will linger on.Another colleague of the double All-Ireland winner, Conor Deegan, said he was left ldquonumb and devastated when he learnt of Eamonnrsquos passing.He added: ldquoWe are absolutely destroyed. Only a few weeks ago we were together at Croke Park. He took on the county job when it was not fashionable but nothing was ever about Eamonn there was just no ego with him. He just cared about the county. Itrsquos hard to believe that we will never see him again.Bryansford GAC mdash the Down manrsquos home club mdash which flew its flags at half mast following his passing mdash described Eamonn as ldquoa true legend of both club and county while Down GAA described him as ldquotrue son of Down.They said: ldquoEamonn has been taken from us too soon, we will miss you Eamonn but we will smile in the memory of the days that you gave us.Last Sunday, Eamonn Burnsrsquo sons Cathal and Thomas led the Down  team onto pitch in memory of father ahead of senior football final between Warrenpoint and Kilcoo at Pairc Esler, Newry.

The acts included opera with performers on horseback.ldquoThe horses were retired race horses which had been re-trained to perform in this show. There were breathtaking displays of riders with hoops and torches on fire, made all the more spectacular against the back of the floodlit castle.ldquoThe finale involved le-size inflatable horses, which were manipulated by dancers who moved with the music that filled the air. A spectacular display of culture for all to enjoy.On Sunday morning, the group viewed a historic presentation prepared by one of the historic and cultural associations in Lamorlaye.Ms Patterson explained: ldquoWe were then taken on a walking tour of the old Lamorlaye. The afternoon was free for the group to view a dressage display with ballet dancers at the Diane Stables. There was also a beautul show with Samurai warriors on horseback.ldquoThe activities just went on and on and the group was treated to a visit to a wine-making area in Gouvieux before being taken to the troglodyte quarter of Gouvieux and for a surprise dinner in a cave.The dinner was prepared by member of the committee and made all the more special because of the sing-song started by Herveacute Moula, chairwoman of the Lamorlaye Comiteacute de Jumelage, supported by Cllr Andrews and guests from Ballynahinch. The atmosphere was relaxed and this was the end to a lovely day.On the final day of the visit, the group was invited to view the facilities at the Golf du Lys, an exclusive golf course, which has facilities to host conferences, weddings and events, along with outdoor and indoor tennis courts, an outdoor pool and golf courses.Ms Patterson said: ldquoThe golf club has already hosted some players from Ballynahinch and they have asked uswe are interested in organising a reciprocal golf tournament with the local golf courses in Co Down.ldquoWe hope we will be able to take them up on this proposal when the French visit us in .ldquoOur final lunch was in a redundant factory complex which has been converted in to a stunning hotel and restaurant ndash testament to how an old property can be re-generated for the good of the community.ldquoThe programme for the weekend provided us with ample opportunity to meet up with those who had travelled over to Ballynahinch in July and to meet with some old faces from previous exchanges between Lamorlaye and Ballynahinch. It is our hope we will be able to sign a twinning charter with both the local council for the next five to ten years.Ms Patterson said that the two pilot exchange trips have shown the relationship is still as vibrant as ever, with new people getting involved on both sides.She added: ldquoWe are hoping to be in a position to host a small group over the St Patrickrsquos weekend and to take a small group out to Lamorlaye for the Bastille Day celebrations. We always welcome new families who would be interested in hosting French people and who would be interested in travelling out to France as part of the exchange.ldquoThose travelling pay for their own flights and the Rowallane and Slieve Croob Community Twinning Group has facilitated the visits through the generous support of Newry Mourne and Down Council.

The unveiling of the murals brought together many former factory workers and it was clear that they would relish the opportunity to formally celebrate that role under one roof. I would like to extend an invite to all of them to get involved in the celebrations and help raise funds for my chosen charities by booking their tickets for the event in the Guildhall.”.ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button Helen Quigley, Chief Executive, Inner City Trust, said: “For the first time in a long time we had ladies from factories all over the city come together to celebrate their past work. On the day, some of the girls had suggested a reunion night so we set about approaching the Mayor to work in collaboration with ourselves to arrange a night of celebration for the ladies. A small token of appreciation for the work carried out by the factory girls during some of the City’s most dficult times.” Booking for the Christmas Party in the Parlour is essential and tickets, priced at £ each, are available by contacting the Mayor’s Office and allocated on a first come first serve basis.All proceeds raised are in aid of the Mayor’s Charities, Foyle Women’s Aid and the Koram Centre.\"  \"  A shameful day for the unborn says Arlene Foster - SDLP MLAs walkout of chamber in protest over speaker Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingNI braces itself for storm battering and theres a big chill on the way tooMan shot in both legs in barbaric appointment attackHistoric Belfast Presbyterian church bought by Limerick-based Roman Catholic instituteN.I.

I bunked off afternoon games to go to the huge anti agreement rally at City Hall..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button Some of the rally I remember clearly, such as being close to the s corner building with a clock, opposite Robinson and Cleaver, at the corner of Donegall Square North and Donegall Place, where the crowd was crammed in a way that today would spark safety fears. For some reason I recall a middle aged woman in the packed crowd wearing a DUP , ,  sticker.The concept of giving Dublin a say in NI at a time when it was perceived to be doing little to stop a long terrorist campaign, was easy even for a teenager to understand.Yet I have only fully come to grasp the AIA’s signicance decades later, both the long-term intentions of the signatories, UK Ireland, and its impact.It also took a while to see what its signing said about the preceding failures of unionist leaders, and what the response to the AIA said about loyalism’s declining power.Not infrequently in  we report on developments that have their origins in , such as the recent episode in which the Taoiseach visited Hillsborough Castle without being hosted by a Secretary of State, days after the NIO advisor, Lord Caine, who had always insisted on such accompaniment, was not kept on his post.Despite the inappropriate circumstances of his visit, Leo Varadkar then used British state property to publicly attack a UK government that was not there to defend itself.As is the enduring pattern of NIO and British weakness in the face of such relentless Irish partisanship, London stayed politely silent in response to this subtle over reach.A well connected Westminster figure tells me that unionism, whatever its present dficulties, is in a better position than , when it had few friends in the House of Commons, hence why NI MPs were unaware of the coming Thatcher volte face.Kate Hoey: The Brexit plan ides the UK, so I will not be voting for it todayLord Empey: The Union is not safe in the DUP’s hands Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"There are now younger Tory MPs who grew up through the Troubles, or older ones who served here, who instinctively view NI as British.Another dference between the AIA and Boris Johnson’s u-turn is that two years ago, in the  backstop, London made clear its determination to avoid an Irish land border, so we have had time to get used to the risk of a sudden, forced Irish Sea one.But even so, there are key similarities with .In both cases, the climbdown was by two Tory prime ministers who had used emphatic language in defence of their full support for Northern Ireland’s undiluted place in the UK .In both cases, the number of Conservative MPs who were prepared to support unionists in defiance of their own prime minister was miniscule. In , a mere  Tory backbenchers rebelled against the AIA, out of Mrs Thatcher’s vast parliamentary reserves of almost  Conservative MPs.Today, we do not know how many Tories will reject the Boris Johnson Brexit plan, but it is expected to , or fewer than that, and not even all of them will do so on the basis of their support for the Union.This does not mean that Conservative MPs in  or today have been disinterested in the Union. To an overwhelming extent, they support it. But, when under pressurethere is only so far they will go to the wire to protect it.Both votes,  and today, also reflect a fundamental truth that no unionist should ever forget: our numerical near insignicance within the United Kingdom.Even the derisory Tory rebellion of  MPs in  is greater in number than there have ever been Northern Ireland unionist MPs, in any one Parliamentary session.Unionists are around .% of the population of the UK, and about .%of the population of the EU.There was only so long that unionist concerns were going to be allowed to hold up the might of Europe in its desire to strike a deal with a major nation state, the UK. But this latest political abandonment of unionists involves a factor that was absent previously: the views of Middle England.Middle England’s view of Northern Ireland has, perhaps mercully, never been put to the test before.It had not been asked whether or not it wants Scotland or Northern Ireland until the Scottish independence referendum of . I was alarmed by polls that showed % of English people wanted Scotland to stay. It was cited to encourage Scots to vote to remain in the UK, but it was in fact quite a lowish level of southern solidarity.Recently there were surveys that found that in a choice between Brexit and the Union, more people in England would choose Brexit.Parliament is sitting today, and last sat on a Saturday in  for the Falklands war. A task force was sent halfway across the world to defend almost uninhabited islands.The Troubles then was ongoing, and had been for  years, and would persist for another decade. Around , British servicemen were killed in the Falklands and NI, yet the UK public never rebelled against that sacrice.Now the population of England, which makes up the great bulk of the UK, and its establishment Tories, seems willing to make constitutional concessions over UK territory, on a scale that was resisted for decades despite relentless violence, all on behalf of a cause — Brexit — that had little traction a few years ago outside a eurosceptic fringe.As to the merits of this deal, I am still trying to absorb it. Respected pro Union voices including Lord Trimble, Ruth Dudley Edwards and the Spectator magazine think it is a good compromise for NI. Perhaps so. But it is a massive turning point in British history that will take decades to assess. I think, overall, it is a bit better than Theresa May’s deal. Yet there is no disguising the fact that soon we are likely to have a major, and probably permanent, internal border in the Irish Sea, something no other nation on earth would allow to ide its territory.Five years ago most unionists would have found that prospect unthinkable and appalling.• Ben Lowryis News Letter deputy editor©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":null,"title":"people","story":" getRequiredClientIdforjpiconsole.log requiredClientIdcatch]EV.Core.updateUserProfile]EV.Core.updateUserProfile....... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast News Letter and agreeing to JPIMedia Ltd#s Standard Terms and ConditionsWould you like to receive any of the following newsletters from Belfast News Letter, via email Daily news, news features and service updates\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \" addCustomTextToCreateAccountTemplateNewslettersWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"  \". s .  \". ss+s+  \". s  \".after+text+ .+text+ .before+text+ .after+text+]]]]]]]]]]]]]] initInArticleOnlySiteText, initArticleSiteText, isInArticleOnlyTemplateReady. s isArticleTemplateReady. s addCustomTextToSiteTemplate addSiteName.html  People   Jobs Cars Homes  Directory  Announcements  Advertise My Business Subscribe#jp #login-widget #login-flip.flip RegisterLoginEdit Account\"Sign Out\" --\"    --       News People Traffic and Travel Crime Weather Politics Business Education Health Opinion Read This News Traffic and Travel Crime Weather Politics Business Education Health Opinion Read This Sport Football Rugby Union Motorcycling More Sport Sport Opinion Whats On Arts  Entertainment Things To Do Nightle Lestyle Retro Cars Homes Must Read           People      Drug criminals ill-gotten gains to go under the hammer at NI auction - including pound, watch and holiday homeA drug criminals ill-gotten gains will be sold at Wilsons Auctions.

Ministers have attacked our independent judges. The Government is spending millions on an advertising campaign that appears to conflict with an Act of Parliament and all the meanwhile jobs, security and stability are put further and further at risk.Boris Johnson is playing Russian roulette with all of our lives over Brexit, and we cannot stand by and let him do it.The last three years have been a shambles, and it is clear we will now need to go back to the people for them to have the final say.That is why the case for a Peoplersquos Vote, where a credible deal is put to the British people, with the option to Remain, provides the best and most democratic ways of ending this crisis.Readers will know I think Brexit is a disaster for our jobs, security and international standing ndash and so would campaign resolutely to Remain in that scenario.Either way, I believe we need to heal some of the isions in this country and get back to focusing on the issues we all want to talk about.Despite the Brexit chaos, Irsquove continued to work hard on lots of other issues locally.It was a real pleasure to attend the Penarth Picnic at the weekend, and I want to thank Penarth Town Council, Production  and all those involved for a great event ndash showcasing the best of Penarthrsquos wonderful community spirit. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Yet, too many people across the UK ndash and here in Wales ndash are going hungry.It is shameful that in the sixth richest country on the planet people are struggling to put food on the table.A recent report by the South Wales Food Alliance has shown that  per cent of  to -year-olds ran out of food in the past year and , children in Wales are living in households for whom a healthy diet is increasingly unaffordable.In addition, the Trussell Trust has reported record numbers of people accessing its services. Last year, it provided over , emergency food parcels to people in crisis in Wales, , of them to children. A No Deal Brexit will be catastrophic for the countryrsquos most vulnerable households and would be an act of economic self-harm impacting many generations to come. This is why I am supporting the campaign for Food Justice.There can be no doubt that the causes of rising hunger are rooted in a decade of austerity, tax and welfare changes, and an economy that no longer provides a fair dayrsquos pay for a fair days work for too many.The food crisis that the UK is living through is likely to be signicantly worsenedwe leave the EU without a deal. The recently published government documents on Operation Yellow Hammer predict shortages of some fresh foods and an increase in the price of food by up to  per cent, as a likely scenario.The papers make for grim reading for the many hard pressed families who are already struggling to put food on the table.In Wales we are committed to eradicating food poverty but we need UK-wide action.The Co-operative campaign is calling on the UK Government to commit to zero-hunger by  and incorporate it into UK law.While many of the solutions to food poverty are the responsibility of the UK Government there is local action that we can take that can make a real dference.The campaign is encouraging councils across Wales to commit to playing their part by designating a lead member for food poverty, to draw up a food action plan, and to take inspiration from emerging community responses to food poverty.The good news is that there is a huge amount of work already going on in our communities by councils, churches, charities and food banks.For more information or to get involved in the campaign please visit www.party.coop campaign food-justice article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This compares to five per cent of the population in , when  per cent of adults smoked.However, there has also been an increase in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape.:The National Survey for Wales shows that, in ,  per cent of e-cigarettes users also smoked cigarettes. This fell to  per cent in  .Across the UK the number of vapers who are ex-smokers reached . per cent in  with the main reason given for using e-cigarettes being to help them quit.Of those surveyed by ASH Wales,  per cent of e-cigarette users cited health as their main reason for vaping.Suzanne Cass, chief executive of ASH Wales said: ldquoThe rise in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape in Wales shows that many smokers are using e-cigarettes to quit.ldquoIndeed, when coupled with behavioural support e-cigarettes have been shown to be one of the most effective ways to give up smoking, enabling thousands of smokers in Wales to break a habit that destroys lives.ldquoHowever, with more than double the amount of people in Wales smoking compared to vaping, we still face a major challenge when it comes to changing peoplersquos behaviour and de-normalising what has become an entrenched habit in many of our most deprived communities.Despite the increase in the number of people vaping, the survey also revealed perceptions of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes have worsened.Now almost a third of people in Wales believe e-cigarettes are equally or more harmful than tobacco cigarettes.Suzanne Cass said: ldquoThere is work to be done when it comes to raising awareness of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes and addressing concerns about the safety of vaping.Since the survey was carried out, reports of a possible link between e-cigarette use and deaths from lung disease in America have led some medical experts to warn of the dangers of vaping.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention many of those vapers affected had used products with liquids containing cannabinoid products.E-cigarettes are regulated in the UK in line with a set of European-wide rules by the medicines regulator, the MHRA. The MHRA also monitors adverse reactions through its yellow card system, which to date has not identied serious respiratory problems similar to that found in the US.Meanwhile vapers in the UK are urged by ASH to only ever purchase e-cigarettes from reputable suppliers. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We were a mix of young people, parents and other concerned citizens of Penarth, and met outside Grfin Books.ldquoWe joined the young people who have been striking from school. In a year this movement has grown from Greta Thunberg by herself to millions worldwide.ldquoThe evidence on climate change is clear. Our actions through burning fossil fuels and demands for continued economic growth cause global warming and climate change. People are already suffering and nature, upon which we all depend, is collapsing. Governments need to be honest about this and act upon the crisis.ldquoWe were over the moon with the response from Penarth residents, who walked with us or cheered us on, the day really gave us hope that the message is seeping in and change can happen. Myself and others had been feeling quite down because climate change is scary, we are worried about our childrenrsquos futures. Lets hope this walk leads to more local action on climate change.The young people on the march also spoke about their concerns.ldquoI went on strike because people cut down rainforests just to be able to eat meat, said seven-year-old Mylo Kitchiner. ldquoIf we keep cutting down trees we wonrsquot have oxygen to breath.

Any proposals would be subject to full consultation, meaning all interested parties would have an opportunity to share their views before any decision is made.ldquoShould proposals progress, they would also be subject to separate planning consultation.ldquoThis would include consideration of highways and traffic concerns. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We have had nine spaces taken away, which means  cars will be battling for spaces.ldquoWe understand the need to reduce cars and danger in the area but the way itrsquos been done will lead to reductions in house prices and make parking dficult for current residents.

A former head of two other schools in Gwent, he is clearly proud of his school and all they have accomplished.ldquoItrsquos a wonderful school and everyone here has worked so hard to make it that way, he said. ldquoBut it does face challenges.Like other head teachers in Penarth, Mr Rees had signed the open letter to the Welsh Government calling for fairer funding for Vale schools earlier this year. He had discussed coming in to the school on weekends to clean the toilets himself to help balance budgets. But he is firmly optimistic.ldquoBetween kind donations and fundraising efforts from our PTA, renting out the school hall, and younger members of staff taking on some extra burdens we are just about able to balance our budgets, he said. ldquoTo be honest, next year might start looking grim, but wersquore keeping our heads high.ldquoWith that said, wersquove been working hard on incorporating new initiatives and the new curriculum, we have a great crop of pupils and staff morale is high. We are very positive here.ldquoItrsquos also our th anniversary this year, so we have loads of ex-staff and pupils coming through the doors to say hello, a celebratory PTA barbecue and more planned.Taking a tour around the school, this positivity is reflected in students and staff alike. Children seem genuinely excited to learn, smiling, waving and saying hello to Mr Rees.Evenlode Primary School itself has an interesting history.It was opened in  as the first open plan primary school in South East Wales.The population of the school has risen dramatically over the last  years, from  on roll in  to the present .The building itself, a maze of classrooms and corridors plastered in colours, has also changed to accommodate more pupils.Much of the semi-open plan design has disappeared, making way for more conventional classrooms.The school benefits from having a superb site with two playgrounds as well as a large playing field, a designated play area for Reception children, a wildle area, open access to the local tennis club facilities, a newly constructed lsquooutside classroomrsquo and adventure trail.One of the first stops was a hall used by its lsquoSaplingsrsquo Out of School Care, the pre and after-school club for children.Saplings provides childcare for around  children from all year groups, providing breakfast in the morning and looking after children from .am to pm when needed.There, the children can access a wide range of activities, switched up on a regular basis.These have included cooking, gardening, art, crafts, sporting activities, outdoor play and plenty more.A couple of pupils, part of the Saplings, are called through. They happily talk about their favourite part of the clubs. One says arts and crafts another, going outside and playing sport four more say the food.Saplings isnrsquot the only place the students can indulge in a little food.Pupils have set up a fruit tuck shop in the school yard, a group endeavour that students control all aspects of - from placing orders for snacks, selecting the products, handling finances and, of course, selling to their friends.A small group of budding merchants were excited to show me their wares, selling oranges and bananas at break time.There was plenty more to do outside, as well.Mr Rees himself taught fire-making lessons in their fire pit, while the school also made use of rope courses, and a newly refurbished gazebo.Bike racks could be found at the front and back of the site, with students encouraged to cycle to school.Sport is very high on the schoolrsquos agenda.ldquoWe have kids from the school representing us in cricket, rugby and tennis at a county level, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore also fielding regular football, rugby and netball teams, and we are pushing plenty of other outdoor activities - like our new ropes and outdoor assault course.ldquoWersquore lucky to have parents in this area who are incredibly supportive of sports, and we have some shining examples of sporting prowess in our children.ldquoWe think itrsquos a very important part of being a rounded and healthy inidual.The school doesnrsquot just focus on sport - they aim to nurture minds and souls too.ldquoExpressive arts is a major area of focus at the moment, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore lucky enough to have a drama specialist supporting us, helping coach the children through both acting and production.ldquoWe are even working with the Welsh Government on a production of H.G. Wellrsquos The Time Machine, to be held in our school hall.The hall had been built with money raised from selling off surplus land, with a further loan from the Vale council.It is tidy, modern, and neatly decorated, with a sophisticated looking lighting system - built with help from parents.ldquoWersquore very proud of the relationship we have with parents here, said Mr Rees. ldquoThey have been enormously helpful with our budgetary concerns.Evenlode is a school with a cheerful outlook, a happy student body and a strong working relationship between staff, students and parent alike.It deserves to go far. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This must be investigated.ldquoThis is a deliberate attempt to present a  equivalence between genuine political canvassing and those who would wish to scam vulnerable people.ldquoMany people will be deeply unsettled by this behaviour from Cairns at the same time as the Tories are attempting to suppress votes by making it a requirement to show ID at polling stations- a move that will disproportionately affect working class, ethnic minority and young voters.ldquoThis is not how politics should be done.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals.

The Top  Northern Ireland Companies  dinner, with AL Goodbody, brought together some of top business chiefs making the list, to the grand backdrop of Queen’s University’s Great Hall. The event heard renewed calls for securing a deal on Brexit, and the restoration of Stormont, as we approach , days without a devolved government here. John Mulgrew, editor of Ulster Business, told those gathered: “On the precipice of Brexit, the voice of business has never been stronger or more important – further enforcing the need for a deal. Avoiding a hard exit. And retaining a strong trading relationship across the island. “But we should also take this opportunity to clearly note, that we are approaching , days since having a devolved government – up and running. “It affects you and your businesses, and it’s cited as the key reason putting off investment from overseas, and our own local companies, from making key investment decisions.” The Top  edition is an annual showcase of the leading and largest companies, located right across Northern Ireland. This year sales rose by almost %, approaching a combined figure of £bn. And for the eighth year in a row, poultry processing giant Moy Park has come in at the number one spot, with turnover of £.bn. Michael Neill, head of Belfast office at AL Goodbody, said: “What the Top  companies have achieved in the past  months in what can only be described as capricious circumstances is truly remarkable – but imagine what could have been achieved had we some semblance of ‘normality’. “My hope is that we find ourselves doing so in a Northern Ireland that is embarking on a new and positive era of opportunity, rather than picking up the shattered pieces of a ‘no deal’ Brexit for many years to come.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"firms must prepare for no deal as economic forecast revised down","story":"Posted on Tuesday October  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland firms must prepare for a ‘no deal’ Brexit – a bank chief economist has warned – as it downgraded its forecast for the economy to .%.  Danske Bank’s Conor Lambe said there were still a number of possibilities for what might happen over the next  days, with the UK due to leave the EU on October . Possibilities included a no-deal exit, a withdrawal agreement being reached, an extension of Article  period or a general election. But predictions were \"incredibly dficult\", he said. \"Businesses should behave prudently and use this time to ensure they are as prepared as they can be for a worst-case scenario, no-deal Brexit, in case it occurs at the end of this month,\" he said. The .% is down from the bank’s previous forecasts, delivered in June, that growth would hit % in  and .% in . In its latest Northern Ireland Quarterly Sectoral Forecasts report, Danske Bank said that the Northern Ireland economy likely expanded in the second quarter of the year, but the rate of growth over the first half of the year remained modest. “We have revised our forecast for economic growth in Northern Ireland downwards for both  and ,” he said. “This largely reflects the modest data for the first half of the year, increased Brexit-related uncertainty and the weaker global economic environment. “Assuming that a no-deal Brexit is avoided, we expect the Northern Ireland economy to grow by .% in  and .% in , below the .% we expect UK GDP to grow by in both years. “A combination of strong wage growth and more stable inflation is likely to lead to solid growth in consumer spending, but the lack of clarity around the UK’s future relationship with the EU is expected to continue holding back business investment.” It says the information and communication, and professional, scientic  technical services sectors are expected to be the fastest growing parts of the economy over the next two years.

Ulster Business speaks to Northern Ireland managing director Ian Sheppard, and learns more about how colleagues are being empowered to play an active role in the local communities where they live and work Bank of Ireland UK sees developing its colleagues and helping customers and communities to thrive as part of its DNA, according to Ian Sheppard, managing director in Northern Ireland.From key charity partnerships, to fundraising, volunteering, sponsorship and more, Ian says the desire for Bank of Ireland UK is to make a positive impact by empowering colleagues to make a dference.“When I speak to my colleagues, I hear how really active and involved they are in their own community,” Ian says. “There are so many examples and I never cease to be amazed by their passion and commitment.An important partnership for the bank is with Alzheimer’s Society, its flagship charity for the last two years. In that time around £, has been raised in Northern Ireland, but as Ian explains it’s about more than fundraising.“We realised that not only can we help them financially, but there are resources we can share and opportunities we can offer which can help to signicantly raise the charity’s profile and raise much needed funds.”One example in which the bank has supported Alzheimer’s Society in this way is through its own long-running partnership with Ulster Rugby.“We donated our advertising and promotion activity for a televised game at the Kingspan Stadium making the charity ‘Sponsor for a Day’. This included using their logo on the back of the Ulster Rugby jerseys, taking over the pitch side boards and inviting a group of people living with dementia, their family and carers to the game – helping to get their brand message out to not only a stadium with capacity of , people but to a much wider TV audience.”Alzheimer’s Society sees some fantastic people giving their time to help others. That’s no clearer than its Side by Side programme, which Bank of Ireland UK helps to fund.The photograph on the front of this edition of the magazine taken at the Grand Opera House in Belfast features Mary Dalzell a Side by Side volunteer, alongside Hazel Whiteside, who has been living with dementia for two years.They share a love of music, theatre and cinema and the Side by Side programme, which re-connects people with dementia to their communities by doing the things they love, has not only put a smile on both their faces but has had a positive impact on their lives.There are so many people impacted by dementia and Alzheimers in our local communities, and its touching so many people’s lives, taking this as our motivation, the bank now has almost , staff trained as Dementia Friends.The bank’s ‘Give Together’ programme means staff can take one day a year to spend the time working with a charity or community organisation of their choice. “This day can involve anything from gardening work to painting a youth centre,” Ian says“Beyond Alzheimer’s Society, colleagues are helping many other organisations such as Macmillan Cancer Support, Cancer Research UK through its Relay for Le Legenderry, the Wooden Spoon children’s rugby charity, and Space NI, which offers support services in health and social care sectors to the local community.” You canabout some of the good work colleagues have done further on in this feature.“We are also committed to reflecting the community by developing a erse and modern workforce – which is part-and-parcel of a progressive company,” Ian says. “It’s something that current and future employees expect in their employer. For us its part of our DNA, something that’s always been there but we are now putting a clear and visible structure around it,” Ian says.This has included being a founding member of FuSIoN – the Financial Services Inclusion Network which drives to support and promote LGBT+ professionals across the sector, becoming JAM Card members – allowing staff to knowcustomers with a communication barrier need ‘just a minute’, as well as recently being awarded the Diversity Charter Mark.“Our community involvement is something we are very clear about - something I’m passionate about and it’s an easy ask to get staff engaged. It’s very natural, and it has always been developed from the ground up,” Ian says.He believes this contributes to the huge numbers of staff doing their bit – enabling their own local communities to thrive.  ALISON MITCHELLA customer service manager for Bank of Ireland UK in Londonderry, Alison has worked for the bank for  years, but her motivation for fundraising and support for Alzheimer’s Society began in , following her mother-in-law’s diagnosis with dementia. Alison trained at her local hospital to become a dementia volunteer and learned so much she asked Alzheimer’s Society to run similar sessions in her own branch to enable staff to better assist customers with dementia.Sadly, Alison’s mother-in-law passed away in May of this year but to mark her passing and to raise vital funds in her memory, Alison took part in Alzheimer’s Society Cupcake Day. Initial plans to simply sell cupcakes within her own branch changed rapidly as colleagues from nearby branches heard of the event and wanted to support both Alison and the charity.  Faced with orders for more than  cupcakes, Alison requested a Give Together day, which is time given by the bank to both iniduals and teams to give back to their communities. Alison says: “I was in the kitchen from am to pm baking and icing but it was worth it. The event raised £, which Bank of Ireland UK matched doubling the amount raised to £,. “I could not have achieved that without the support of family, colleagues and the wider business. I was proud to raise the funds in my mother-in-law’s memory and I am proud to work for an organisation that not only values our role in the wider community but supports it too.” CHRISTINE GRAHAMChristine Graham has helped to raise funds for Cancer Research UK through the Relay for Le “Legenderry” event held in St. Columb’s Park, Londonderry.The Derry-based senior business manager for Bank of Ireland UK has personally been touched by cancer as she lost two close family members to the disease. Her young great niece was also diagnosed with a rare form of cancer in  and is now doing well, but seeing the impact a cancer diagnosis has on a family inspired Christine to get involved with the Relay for Le event.“Our event truly is ‘legenderry’,” she says. It is a -hour relay race that brings the whole community together to celebrate the lives of cancer survivors, to remember those lost to the disease, to fight back by increasing our knowledge of cancer and by raising money to fund le-saving cancer research.”In just three years the event has raised over £, for Cancer Research UK with Christine helping to raise £, in  – not only the most successful Relay for Le event in the UK this year but all funds raised in Northern Ireland stays here.  Christine values the support she has had from the bank who promote the event to the wider community and from her colleagues who enter teams.“Relay for Le is for all ages and stages, all shapes and sizes,” she says. It’s cross community and intergenerational and the atmosphere every year is electric.”Plans are already underway for Relay for Le  which promises to be another massive event. PAUL MAGEEPaul Magee, associate director of the corporate banking team, became involved with the Ulster Region Committee for Wooden Spoon, the Children’s Charity of Rugby, five years ago after he successfully completed the charity’s Four Peaks Challenge, reaching the summits of the UK and Ireland’s highest peaks. He is now an active committee member for Wooden Spoon, helping to raise funds to provide le-enhancing experiences for disadvantaged and disabled children. “All funds raised in Ulster stay in the region and benefit the children here,” Paul says. “For instance, we provided £, to the Mae Murray Foundation to buy specialist equipment for the first fully accessible beach in Ulster at Benone Strand. When we created the access to the beach, one parent was very emotional as he watched his teenage daughter in the sea for the first time. It’s those occasions where we’re responding to a need within the community that makes the effort worthwhile.”Wooden Spoon has funded numerous charity projects, most recently £, for a new multi-sensory room at Parkview Special School in Lisburn and purchasing a horse for Riding for the Disabled Association in Coleraine, a charity that enhances children’s lives every day.  With his passion for and involvement in Wooden Spoon, Paul is grateful for the support Bank of Ireland has given him in his role with the organisation, specically the corporate banking team who value his dedication to making a dference. He says: “The bank has been fantastic – I appreciate the flexibility the team offers in the lead up to events and my colleagues often attend Wooden Spoon fundraisers. I’ve also benefited from the bank’s Give Together initiative, which offers days of paid leave that employees can use for volunteering. The bank’s support has helped facilitate my commitment to Wooden Spoon, where I can really see and be a part of the impact the charity has on the local community.” SALLY IRVINEOver the last  years Sally Irvine’s coffee mornings have become a highlight in the office calendar, in turn raising more than £, for MacMillan Cancer Support and funding  days of specialist nursing care for cancer patients across Northern Ireland.Sally, a business lending and credit governance manager at Bank of Ireland UK, arranged her first Macmillan Coffee Morning in  following a colleague’s cancer diagnosis. She found herself wanting to do something to help people living with cancer and so took the plunge and decided to be a host as part of Macmillan’s biggest coffee morning fundraising event. From the outset, Sally had tremendous support from her team members and the wider business, and this has contributed to the ongoing success of the event.The bank plays a huge part in ensuring Sally can deliver the event each year by giving her support through their Give Together scheme.Sally says: “The coffee morning has become a very special occasion and a great day of fun where people from across the bank come together to have a wee cuppa and a cake and take time to catch up while raising money for a really important cause. One in two of us will face cancer at some time in our lives and I am passionate about continuing to fundraise to provide the specialist nursing care that’s so vital for those living with cancer.”Plans are already underway for this year’s Macmillan Coffee Morning and Sally is hopeful the annual fundraiser will continue to hold a special place in the office calendar. PAUL SLEVINBranch manager at Bank of Ireland UK in Newry, Paul Slevin is someone who embodies the bank’s ethos of community involvement through his role with the charity Space NI.  Space NI offers support services in health and social care sectors to the local community. Through its service Home to Hospital, the organisation has helped  elderly people travel to crucial hospital appointments, while its Family Support Hub offers vital assistance to families in distress. Paul joined the charity in  and has just completed five years as chairman of the Board of Directors. He is proud that his background in finance has enabled him to support the charity through its repositioning process to ensure that its activities best serve the community.  Since Paul’s involvement with the charity began, Space NI has won the ‘One to Watch’ award at NI Social Enterprise Awards and the ‘Community Wellbeing Initiative’ at the All Ireland Pride of Place Awards. The organisation has also grown and opened a third premises in Newry and launched a range of volunteer made soy wax candles to raise crucial funds. “Bank of Ireland UK encourage all staff to give back,” Paul says. “Every manager I’ve had was very active in their community, so they were both great role models and great motivators. I think it’s really important to give our time, our expertise, and to do whatever we can to help and support the communities we live and work in.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/12312323.jpg","title":"novosco sold to global services giant for m","story":"Posted on Monday  October  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland IT services firm Novosco has been bought by a German-based global industry giant for around £m, it has emerged.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: \"We’ve got a great new deal that takes back control — now Parliament should get Brexit done on Saturday so we can move on to other priorities like the cost of living, the NHS, violent crime and our environment.\" Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, said: “This agreement is a fair compromise between the EU and the UK. It is testament to the commitment and willingness of both sides to do what is best for EU and UK citizens. We now have a newly agreed Protocol that protects peace and stability on the island of Ireland and fully protects our Single Market. I hope that we can now bring this over the line and provide the certainty our citizens and businesses so deserve.” Michel Barnier, the European Commissions chief negotiator, said: “We had dficult discussions over the past days. We have managed to find solutions that fully respect the integrity of the Single Market. We created a new and legally operative solution to avoid a hard border, and protect peace and stability on the island of Ireland. It is a solution that works for the EU, for the UK and for people and businesses in Northern Ireland.” The DUP has said it could not support the deal brokered by Mr Johnson. So, what deal was agreed  A statement from the European Commission says: “In terms of regulations, Northern Ireland will remain aligned to a limited set of rules related to the EUs Single Market in order to avoid a hard border: legislation on goods, sanitary rules for veterinary controls , rules on agricultural production marketing, VAT and excise in respect of goods, and state aid rules. “In terms of customs, the EU-UK Single Customs Territory, as agreed in November , has been removed from the Protocol on Ireland   Northern Ireland, at the request of the current UK government. EU and UK negotiators have now found a new way to achieve the goal of avoiding a customs border on the island of Ireland, while at the same time ensuring Northern Ireland remains part of the UKs customs territory. This agreement fully protects the integrity of the EUs Single Market and Customs Union, and avoids any regulatory and customs checks at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. “Finally, the EU and the UK have agreed to create a new mechanism on ‘consent, which will give the Members of the Northern Ireland Assembly a decisive voice on the long-term application of relevant EU law in Northern Ireland. The Commission has been in close contact with the Irish government on this point.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
