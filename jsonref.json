Khan studied Philosophy, Politics and Economics, graduating three years later. Promising a ‘new Pakistan’, Imran Khan’s election victory has resulted in claims of vote rigging by rivals and has drawn widespread media attention, something the former cricket captain and playboy is more than used to.As reported in the BBC, Imran Khan has transformed into a religious reformer but struggled to garner support after forming his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party in 1996, was the only candidate from his party to win a seat two years later.          Pakistani opposition leader of the Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) political party Imran Khan  speaksFor some, Imran became ‘Imran Khan’t’ and it took until 2013 for things to change and for his party to be taken seriously, when his party narrowly missed becoming the second largest in Pakistan. Today, he Khan will become the next Prime Minister of the nation.Prior to the election, the PTI held under 10 percent of the 342 seats in the National Assembly and will need to win a large number in the province of Punjab, which has over half of the 272 directly-elected seats. Imran Khan\u0027s cricket careerOn his return to Pakistan, Imran Khan secured a place on the national team and began touring, establishing himself as one of the fastest bowlers in the world. He peaked in 1982, the year when he got 62 wickets at 13.29 each - the lowest average of any bowler in Test history with a minimum of 50 wickets in a calendar year.          Imran Khan of Pakistan lifts the cricket World Cup after Pakistan beat England in the finalBefore playing his first Test match for Pakistan in 1992 against Sri Lanka, he achieved the all-rounder’s triple, which means that Imran secured 3000 runs and 300 wickets, in 75 tests and took a six-month break following his historic World Cup win against England in the same year.Imran retired from cricket after playing for two decades and soon became renowned as a playboy on the London nightclub circuit, although he claimed that he never drank alcohol or engaged in anything that would be deemed inappropriate for a conservative Pakistani Muslim, as the BBC reported.          Jemima Goldsmith, who married Imran Khan to become Jemima Khan pictured here in 1996Imran Khan wifeIn 1995 when Khan was 43, he married the 21-year-old daughter of Sir James Goldsmith, Jemima and although the marriage was dissolved in 2004, they had two sons. Their split was mutual and the pair still remain friends.Imran Khan remarried in 2015 to journalist Reham Khan, but this partnership only lasted a year. As The Guardian reported, after revealing that the former BBC weather presenter would be releasing a tell-all memoir on July 25, the day of the election, she had been harassed by her supporters.He wed again in 2018, this time to Bushra Watto, who has been described as his spiritual adviser and the reason why he has emerged as a pious character, as well as an established politician. However, many have accused Khan of making dramatic U-turns.      Imran Khan and the PTI partyOn Imran Khan’s profile, it states: His profile says: ‘The party has Islamic overtones and is inspired partly by Imran Khan’s renewed commitment to Islam.‘As a politician, his vision is to turn Pakistan into a just society, based on humane values, by creating an independent and honest judiciary that will uphold democracy, protect human rights and ensure the rule of law and, by promoting a merit-based system that provides equal opportunity for upward social mobility to the working classes.’Despite claims of ‘blatant rigging’ in what has been described as a pivotal general election for Pakistan, Khan was declared the winner, even though the official results have yet to be released by Pakistan\u0027s electoral commission. Chief Election Commissioner Sardar Muhammad Raza said: ‘These elections were 100 per cent fair and transparent,’ but did not confirm whether election authorities were in a position to release the official results.Rival party leader Shahbaz Sharif, brother of Nawaz Sharif, said on the day of the election: ‘What they have done has pushed Pakistan back 30 years...People will not bear it.’ After other parties also alleged fraud, including the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), it could cause problem when the PTI need to form a coalition.This comes after claims that there had been campaigns against the military in the ‘dirtiest’ election Pakistan has ever seen, because of the increase of extremist religious parties out in the open. Political analyst Azeema Cheema said it was ‘complete chaos’ and was ‘very concerned’.\u0027It depends on how the civilian disobedience is being organised. You may have spontaneous riots among political party workers. Then maybe political parties will organise sit-ins and demonstrations,\u0027 she said.Dick Smith\u0027s net worth revealed as Australian businessman closes food storesWho is Rocio Oliva?

Even in the run-up to the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009 – when 100 per cent mortgages were offered to home buyers without a deposit – the country did not reach a point where the average household was a net borrower.\u0027In a sign that families are losing the habit of putting money aside for a rainy day, the proportion of disposable income that is saved has fallen to just 4.1 per cent. This is the third lowest since records began in 1963 and down from almost 15 per cent in the 1990s.The ONS said the typical household\u0027s outgoings were £900 higher than their incomings last year.The incomings relate to salaries, pensions, benefits and other income before tax and other costs. Corbyn ally Billy Bragg claims Jews have \u0027work to do\u0027 to...Boris Johnson \u0027held secret talks\u0027 with Trump\u0027s former...Share this articleThe outgoings include everything from tax, housing costs such as mortgages and rent and bills, to food, clothes, fuel and furniture.Tom Selby, senior analyst at AJ Bell investments, said: \u0027Economic growth founded on rising debt is clearly not sustainable and if this continues into the long term it would be profoundly worrying.\u0027One obvious reason for this is the interest rate environment we have experienced in recent years, encouraging people to borrow more and spend rather than save at the paltry rates offered through bank accounts and cash ISAs.\u0027Using a separate set of figures, the ONS report showed that the richest 10 per cent of households had a disposable income – after taxes and housing costs are accounted for – of more than £78,000 last year. These families spent less than £39,000 of that sum.By contrast, the poorest 10 per cent of households had a disposable income of just £5,000 but spent nearly £13,000.Jane Goodland, of wealth manager Quilter, said: \u0027This ONS research is yet another stark reminder of just how vulnerable the average UK household has become in terms of their financial wellbeing.

He predicts the social media giant\u0027s shares still have another 20 percent to fall.Wieser\u0027s street-low price target - his prediction of where stocks will move within the next year - is at $140, compared to the $174.78 low Facebook hit during early Thursday trading. The share price eventually closed in $176.26, but Wieser believes Facebook\u0027s days of 30 percent growth are now outnumbered.\u0027What a lot of the investment community has missed, is that they looked at growth as rather infinite,\u0027 Wieser told Bloomberg TV. \u0027This is only part of a bigger story that hasn\u0027t fully played out yet.\u0027Investors hammered shares in the social media giant after it reported slower revenue growth in the second quarter after markets closed on Wednesday. The results fell short of Wall Street expectations as the company continues to grapple with privacy issues.Subsequently, in overnight trading, the company\u0027s shares plunged 20 per cent, a figure that was then reflected when markets opened Thursday morning.Facebook\u0027s second-quarter results were the first sign that  new European privacy laws and a string of privacy scandals involving Cambridge Analytica and other app developers are hitting the company\u0027s business.In midday trading Thursday, the company\u0027s market value (the number of outstanding shares multiplied by the value of a single stock), fell by more than $122 billion.That means that in one day, just the decline in Facebook\u0027s market value is roughly the entire market value of McDonald\u0027s or Nike, give or take a few billion. And it far exceeds to total market value of major U.S. multinational corporations such as General Electric, Eli Lilly or Caterpillar.But the company still has a total market value close to $511 billion, which exceeds the annual gross domestic product of countries like Poland, Belgium and Iran.The $15.8 billion in net worth that Zuckerberg stands to lose in the move is equal to the wealth of the world\u0027s 81st-richest person, currently Japanese businessman Takemitsu Takizaki, according to Forbes real time data. The tumbling stock prices comes as:The social media giant released its financial results on Wednesday reporting slower revenue growth in the second quarterShareholders filed a proposal to fire Zuckerberg as chairman of Facebook, citing \u0027mishandling\u0027 of scandals including user privacy and election meddlingFacebook executives defended hosting Fox News and \u0027atrocious\u0027 Infowars on its platform in a heated exchange with reportersThe parents of a Sandy Hook massacre victim begged Zuckerberg to remove hateful and harassing comments posted by conspiracy theoristsDescribing the announcements as \u0027bombshells\u0027, Baird analysts said the issues were to a large degree \u0027self-inflicted\u0027.Facebook executives made investors nervous on Wednesday in a call with analysts when they said profit margins would plummet for several years due to the costs of improving privacy safeguards and slowing usage in its biggest advertising markets.Chief financial officer David Wehner warned in the earnings call  that revenue growth had already \u0027decelerated\u0027 in the second quarter and would drop \u0027by high single digit percentages\u0027 in coming quarters.    The sharp decline eradicated about $128 billion off the company\u0027s value - or nearly four times the entire market capitalization of Twitter IncAt one point during the call, Facebook shares were trading down as much as 24 percent, an unprecedented drop for a large firm. Until Wednesday, Facebook shares had been at record highs as investors seemed to shrug off fears about data protection and probes into the hijacking of private information by the political consultancy Cambridge Analytica. Tech firms suffer share price slumps as Facebook loses $120...Facebook shareholders try to fire Mark Zuckerberg as...Facebook executives defend hosting Fox News and \u0027atrocious\u0027...Facebook\u0027s market value plummets by $150 BILLION in just two...Share this articleFor the second quarter, profit was up 31 percent at $5.1 billion revenues rose 42 percent to $13.2 billion, only slightly below most forecasts. Ad sales in Facebook\u0027s second quarter rose 42 percent to $13.04 billion but the costs, bolstered by moves to improve content and security after the data scandal, rose 50 percent from a year earlier to $7.37 billion.           Mark Zuckerberg\u0027s fortune also took a $16 billion hit in the first five minutes of trading on Thursday as shares in his social media company plunged 19 percent to $175.30          Monthly active users came in at 2.23 billion, which fell short of analysts\u0027 estimated 2.25 billion    Ricky Van Veen, Head of Global Creative Strategy and Fidji Simo, Director of Product at Facebook, had combative exchanges with reporters at an event to promote Facebook Watch in Beverly Hills on Wednesday  Leonard Pozner (left with Noah) and Veronique Pozner\u0027s (right) six-year-old son, Noah, died in the December 2012 Newtown shooting massacre.

Smith, pictured here in 2001, promoted Australian-produced food at his supermarket chainMore recently, he founded the media firm Smith \u0026amp Nasht in 2010.In addition, Smith has  authored several books detailing his aviation ventures, including ‘The Earth Beneath Me’ in 1983, ‘Dick Smith Solo Around the World’ in 1992 and ‘Above the World: A Pictorial Circumnavigation’ in 1997.Who is Dick Smith’s wife?Smith’s wife is Phillipa Aird McManarney. The couple has two children together, Jenny and Hayley.Food company closureOn July 26, Smith announced the closure of his food company Dick Smith Foods in the wake of increased competition.\u0027It is my melancholy duty to inform everyone that after 19 years, I\u0027ve had to make the decision to close Dick Smith Foods.\u0027In two years’ time we will go out of business, so I\u0027m closing it down now when times are good.\u0027It\u0027s a decision forced on me because most people just want the cheapest prices and the cheapest prices will always come from overseas,’ the longtime businessman announced.Smith specifically blamed German supermarket giant Aldi, saying its practice of ‘extreme capitalism’ had ultimately ‘forced’ him to close the company he founded in 1999 as the only means of avoiding bankruptcy.          Smith specifically cited the German supermarket Aldi as to why his food store will be closingHowever, IBISWorld Senior Industry Analyst Bao Vuong said that there were many factors at play in the demise of the Australian supermarket, not just Aldi’s rapid expansion in the country as of late.He states: \u0027There\u0027s a lot of factors behind the downfall, it\u0027s not solely placed on Aldi. Coles and Woolworths and Aldi - they all had an effect on the downfall of Dick Smith Foods because consumers are price conscious.\u0027Vuong also believes that limited brand awareness hurt Dick Smith’s food company in particular, saying: \u0027It\u0027s the company itself, it\u0027s not a prominent or well-known company with Australian consumers. The lack of brand awareness contributed to the downfall over the decade.\u0027In addition, Vuong also noted that Dick Smith Foods’ higher prices compared to its competitors was a ‘large contributor’ to its closure.Despite his successful career as an entrepreneur for decades, Smith’s announcement of the upcoming shuttering of his food company wasn’t the only blow his Australian business empire has suffered in recent years.His oldest brand, Dick Smith Electronics, went into receivership in 2016.Dick Smith\u0027s net worth revealed as Australian businessman closes food storesWho is Rocio Oliva?

Avis were also caught charging British drivers £150 (218 New Zealand dollars) to hire a Toyota Yaris in New Zealand for four days          Afghan, German and Indian customers only had to pay £98 (143 New Zealand dollars) for the same car over the same period in New Zealand Britons visiting the USA would pay cheaper rates than their international counterparts from Germany, who would be charged £258. Drivers booking from Australia and India would both be charged £283, and motorists booking from Japan would pay £285, if they visited Washington DC for five days and hired a Toyota Yaris from Europcar.And international visitors to the UK found themselves facing the same fluctuating prices depending on where they live.Someone booking a Fiat 500 from Europcar for five days, collecting and returning it to Heathrow, would fork out £161 if they chose America as their location when they made the booking.But drivers booking from Australia would be able to hire the same car for £130.Someone booking from India, Japan, and Afghanistan would be charged £134.But those booking from Germany, Italy, France and Spain would be charged £125 for the five days with Europcar.

Now, according to The Hollywood Reporter, HBO has ordered a \u0027handful\u0027 of episodes, which began shooting in Los Angeles at West Hollywood\u0027s Barber Surgeons Guild last week.The show will premiere on HBO at 11pm on August 28.In one part of the preview, James can seen discussing the stress of parenthood: specifically watching his sons follow in his hardwood footstep. He also admitted to being an overly-competitive parent.  \u0027I didn\u0027t get into an argument with an AAU dad,\u0027 James said when talking about seeing his son, LeBron Jr., play youth basketball. \u0027I got into an argument with an AAU mom.\u0027James also confessed that he regretted giving his oldest son the \u0027Jr.\u0027 moniker, and gave a little window into his reasoning: \u0027When I was younger, obviously I didn\u0027t have a dad, my whole thing was when I have a kid, not only is he going to be a Jr. I\u0027m gonna do everything that this man didn\u0027t do.\u0027SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO            James (right) and New York Giants wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. (left) on the set of The Shop  All hail The King!

That\u0027s how The Shop became an idea.\u0027It\u0027s not yet clear how many episodes HBO will broadcast, or if James will appear throughout the series.

And he wants to do it as much as possible.\u0027          Another former Giants wide receiver, Victor Cruz, also made an appearance in the HBO trailer for the new show, \u0027The Shop\u0027 James\u0027s SpringHill Entertainment has several projects underway with HBO, including a multi-part documentary on Muhammad Ali, and something about student athletes, which will premiere on October 2 and focus on the NCAA\u0027s controversial rules regarding amateurism.The Shop gives the boxing-centric HBO Sports another avenue to reach new audiences.\u0027Sports for us is really about a lens into socioeconomic, political, cultural issues and ideas around virtuosity in competition,\u0027 says Nelson.\u0027The objective,\u0027 Nelson continued, \u0027is candor. On the one hand, the barbershop as a place historically of secular communion, and on the other hand of the athletes and artist who have achieved this certain level of excellence who want to get in a room and a setting to talk like that with each other because a dearth of forms like that where they can really feel porous and honest with one other. And so it\u0027s less about let\u0027s leverage these names and these relationships and can we get this person or that person. It\u0027s more about who has something to say.\u0027          James has appeared in the last eight NBA Finals as a member of the Cavaliers and the Miami Heat, but lost in three of the previous four meetings with Stephen Curry and the Warriors "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/27/01/4E9A0E7800000578-5997343-The_Beatles_are_pictured_making_their_249th_appearance_at_the_or-a-39_1532650417498.jpg","title":"Paul McCartney Cavern Club Liverpool","story":"    Paul McCartney returned to Liverpool\u0027s Cavern Club for a one-off gig yesterday, where the Beatles launched their career decades ago           The Beatles are pictured making their 249th appearance at the original Cavern Club Macca\u0027s back at the Cavern!

Then and now: The crowd of Beatles fan are pictured outside the Cavern Club yesterday           That was then: Children line up outside the Cavern Club in the 1960s during the Beatles\u0027 heydayInevitably, memories were evoked of his late bandmates – \u0027Here\u0027s to them. Let\u0027s hear it for John and George\u0027 – and performing with them in the original Cavern.How many can remember how the Cavern was in those days, nearly 60 years ago?I don\u0027t mean the Cavern of legend, the fabled spring from which the river of the Sixties spouted, bringing with it that tidal wave of colourful teenage fashion, youthful optimism, mini-skirts, the Pill, drugs and rock and roll.That wasn\u0027t the Cavern – a place that until then had been a jazz club. All that came later in the Sixties, when it seemed that the world had gone into Technicolor.The Cavern that Paul McCartney first knew was a monochrome world in a then unfashionable city that owed more to the Fifties than the Sixties – just a doorway in a warehouse in a cobbled alleyway.Not far from the Pier Head, the club\u0027s entrance was surrounded for much of the day by trucks and vans disgorging, or picking up, boxes of fresh produce, the essence of which would lace the surrounding atmosphere with the cloying aroma of ripening fruit.          Sir Paul McCartney returned to where his music career began on Thursday with a headline gig at Liverpool\u0027s Cavern Club - more than six decades after The Beatles first took to the stage          From Me To You: The Beatles\u0027 legend worked his way through a mammoth 22 track set list on Thursday afternoon, comprised of his solo material and some old classicsInside, 17 steps led to three airless, barrel-shaped cellars, with a couple of smaller ones to the sides, where, in the days before anyone worried too much about ventilators or air conditioning, the walls would quickly become damp with teenage perspiration.Paul\u0027s father used to think the place was a health hazard with all that sweat and electricity locked in there together.Although, over the couple of years that the Beatles played in the Cavern and their local fame grew, students would start to attend, most of their first audiences were made up of working class young people in their first jobs from offices and shops in the surrounding district.They called themselves Cavernites, and they only got into the club if they adhered to some strict rules.           Intimate:At the Cavern the band rubbed shoulders with other emerging musicians, including singer and actress Cilla Black, who was good friends with drummer Ringo          The Fifth Beatle: The band\u0027s tenure at the Cavern also led to their groundbreaking meeting with manager Brian Epstein, who would engineer their rise to superstardom (pictured in 1966)          Fab Four: The Beatles are the best selling band in history, having sold more than 800m albums worldwide (pictured in 1964 when John Lennon passed his driving test)While the Beatles were allowed to wear the black leather stage suits they\u0027d brought back from Hamburg where they\u0027d recently been playing, the fans had to be much more circumspect in their dress.For instance, jeans weren\u0027t allowed. Boys in denim, it was believed by the management, were the \u0027rougher types\u0027, and therefore not welcome.The girls who might attend at the lunchtime sessions would mainly be typists, shop workers or hairdressers\u0027 assistants and they would have to be appropriately dressed, too, in their sensible, if drab, skirts and back-combed beehive hair. Sometimes a girl would have a scarf around her head to hide the curlers in her hair if she was going on a date that night.          Tuneful: Fans went into a frenzy as he worked his way through a two hour set at the venue where his music career beganAt other times, the scarf might be removed just as the Beatles came on the little stage, where the four would joke and tease, eating while they gooned about between songs, all the time keeping a conversation going with the fans who would shout out requests.Somehow, the Beatles had developed the gift of turning the audience into friends.When something went wrong with an amp or a microphone, as it often did, they didn\u0027t panic and wonder what to say next. Instead, they would simply amuse the fans and maybe have a communal singsong until the problem was mended.For this the Beatles, who would often play two other gigs in other Liverpool venues on the same day, earned a total of £5 for a two-hour session – just over £1 each – with their fans paying a shilling to get in, where they could swap their Luncheon Vouchers, often given to them by their employers, for a Cavern cob (a roll) and a bowl of soup.          With a Little Help from My Friends: The pop icon was joined by his band-mates as fans sung along to every wordObviously, there was no alcohol on sale, but a cup of tea cost ﬁve pence. As for drugs, they hadn\u0027t yet reached Liverpool. Not even the Beatles had tried them – other than for the amphetamines they\u0027d been given in Germany.Part of the myth of the Cavern is that the Beatles tried out their early hits for the Cavern audiences. They did, but not often.          Feeling good! The Help! hitmaker was spotted in his home city on Wednesday (above), where he dropped a massive hint about the gig during a Q and A session at his old schoolLennon and McCartney never thought their own songs were as good as those by Chuck Berry and Buddy Holly that they liked to play, and the audiences really wanted to hear stomping hits they already knew, not songs that might become hits in the future.That it would be from this modest, cheap chrysalis of a former wine cellar that the Beatles would emerge, fully formed, less than two years later, seems ever more unlikely the further away in time we get from it.Yet it happened. As Paul put it so understatedly yesterday: \u0027We did OK.\u0027           Drive my Car: Macca was seen leaving the Cavern Club following his performance on Thursday"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/26/22/4E9A2F8B00000578-0-image-a-24_1532641480432.jpg","title":"Why budget flights best legroom","story":"    An investigation into seat size and legroom on long-haul flights found budget airlines are more generous and cheaper than traditional carriersThe low-cost carrier offers a 31 to 32-inch seat pitch on these flights – the distance from a headrest to the one in front and the best indicator of legroom – which, depending on where you sit, is already a more generous than Virgin\u0027s standard 31 on the same route.The time EVERYONE craves takeout: Researchers find people...People who flatter their boss are more likely to be unkind...Share this articleHowever, taller passengers can opt for one of Norwegian\u0027s bulkhead or exit row seats with up to 38 inches of legroom.The budget airline charges a flat fee of £25 for seat selection on long-haul flights, regardless of seat size. That is compared with Virgin\u0027s closest equivalent \u0027Economy Delight\u0027 which costs an extra £50 for 34 inches.Icelandic low-cost airline WOW Air sells fares to New York JFK via Reykjavik from £220. Standard economy seats are a bit tighter at 29-31 inches, compared with a standard 31 on BA.           But an upgrade to WOW\u0027s XL seats, offering 32-33 inches of legroom, costs an extra £47. And XXL seats, with a cavernous 35-37 inches, are an additional £61.Which? Travel said: \u0027It\u0027s not a bad little investment given that BA\u0027s extra legroom starts at £50, and fares are usually higher than those from WOW Air.\u0027Researchers said there are fewer options to upgrade on short-haul, but passengers should not assume the budget carriers have the smallest seats.While both Tui and Thomas Cook airlines have a knee-crushing seat pitch of just 28 inches, it\u0027s a different story with Ryanair. The budget carrier offers the same legroom as BA on many routes, although seat width with Ryanair is a snug 17 inches. The research said both Ryanair and Easyjet have scrapped reclining seats as part of a fare-slashing exercise and BA is also set to join them later this year on some European routes.Currently, there is no law detailing the minimum dimensions of a plane seat. Instead, a maximum passenger load is stipulated for each aircraft, based on whether it can be fully evacuated within 90 seconds –even if half of its exits are disabled. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/26/09/4E9450D700000578-5994307-image-m-8_1532594692223.jpg","title":"Mini tornado festival Germany","story":"The stunning footage shows powerful winds causing mayhem at the EDM festival Parookaville in Weeze, Germany as tents are ripped from the ground and thrown around in the airThe person who filmed the footage said that the mini-tornado formed while campers were preparing to leave at the end of the festival.Mini- tornadoes or dust devils are not a common feature in Germany and are usually due to dry and hot weather which forms a column, picking up dust and debris  from the ground.

Even in the run-up to the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009 – when 100 per cent mortgages were offered to home buyers without a deposit – the country did not reach a point where the average household was a net borrower.\u0027In a sign that families are losing the habit of putting money aside for a rainy day, the proportion of disposable income that is saved has fallen to just 4.1 per cent. This is the third lowest since records began in 1963 and down from almost 15 per cent in the 1990s.The ONS said the typical household\u0027s outgoings were £900 higher than their incomings last year.The incomings relate to salaries, pensions, benefits and other income before tax and other costs. Corbyn ally Billy Bragg claims Jews have \u0027work to do\u0027 to...Boris Johnson \u0027held secret talks\u0027 with Trump\u0027s former...Share this articleThe outgoings include everything from tax, housing costs such as mortgages and rent and bills, to food, clothes, fuel and furniture.Tom Selby, senior analyst at AJ Bell investments, said: \u0027Economic growth founded on rising debt is clearly not sustainable and if this continues into the long term it would be profoundly worrying.\u0027One obvious reason for this is the interest rate environment we have experienced in recent years, encouraging people to borrow more and spend rather than save at the paltry rates offered through bank accounts and cash ISAs.\u0027Using a separate set of figures, the ONS report showed that the richest 10 per cent of households had a disposable income – after taxes and housing costs are accounted for – of more than £78,000 last year.

He predicts the social media giant\u0027s shares still have another 20 percent to fall.Wieser\u0027s street-low price target - his prediction of where stocks will move within the next year - is at $140, compared to the $174.78 low Facebook hit during early Thursday trading. The share price eventually closed in $176.26, but Wieser believes Facebook\u0027s days of 30 percent growth are now outnumbered.\u0027What a lot of the investment community has missed, is that they looked at growth as rather infinite,\u0027 Wieser told Bloomberg TV. \u0027This is only part of a bigger story that hasn\u0027t fully played out yet.\u0027Investors hammered shares in the social media giant after it reported slower revenue growth in the second quarter after markets closed on Wednesday. The results fell short of Wall Street expectations as the company continues to grapple with privacy issues.Subsequently, in overnight trading, the company\u0027s shares plunged 20 per cent, a figure that was then reflected when markets opened Thursday morning.Facebook\u0027s second-quarter results were the first sign that  new European privacy laws and a string of privacy scandals involving Cambridge Analytica and other app developers are hitting the company\u0027s business.In midday trading Thursday, the company\u0027s market value (the number of outstanding shares multiplied by the value of a single stock), fell by more than $122 billion.That means that in one day, just the decline in Facebook\u0027s market value is roughly the entire market value of McDonald\u0027s or Nike, give or take a few billion. And it far exceeds to total market value of major U.S. multinational corporations such as General Electric, Eli Lilly or Caterpillar.But the company still has a total market value close to $511 billion, which exceeds the annual gross domestic product of countries like Poland, Belgium and Iran.The $15.8 billion in net worth that Zuckerberg stands to lose in the move is equal to the wealth of the world\u0027s 81st-richest person, currently Japanese businessman Takemitsu Takizaki, according to Forbes real time data. The tumbling stock prices comes as:The social media giant released its financial results on Wednesday reporting slower revenue growth in the second quarterShareholders filed a proposal to fire Zuckerberg as chairman of Facebook, citing \u0027mishandling\u0027 of scandals including user privacy and election meddlingFacebook executives defended hosting Fox News and \u0027atrocious\u0027 Infowars on its platform in a heated exchange with reportersThe parents of a Sandy Hook massacre victim begged Zuckerberg to remove hateful and harassing comments posted by conspiracy theoristsDescribing the announcements as \u0027bombshells\u0027, Baird analysts said the issues were to a large degree \u0027self-inflicted\u0027.Facebook executives made investors nervous on Wednesday in a call with analysts when they said profit margins would plummet for several years due to the costs of improving privacy safeguards and slowing usage in its biggest advertising markets.Chief financial officer David Wehner warned in the earnings call  that revenue growth had already \u0027decelerated\u0027 in the second quarter and would drop \u0027by high single digit percentages\u0027 in coming quarters.

These two are making ham and cheese sandwiches for the road’Murga is Argentinian street theatre that combines dance with percussion. The first time I heard the hypnotic drumbeat of a performance was in a park in Buenos Aires. I walked towards it and watched the dancers as they moved from the first simple steps to the intense high kicks the performances culminate in. I was hooked. I wanted to know everything about it.For ordinary, working class people, murga plays an important role. Austerity means it’s becoming much harder to live in Argentina. Murga gives them something to look forward to, an escape.Each area of Buenos Aires has its own murga group, with their own colours. In February, throughout carnival season, they travel from neighbourhood to neighbourhood on weekends, performing well into the night. They travel around in these knackered old school buses to makeshift stages on streets shut down for the evening. In some places, the audience is on fire, it’s exciting. There is a real buzz when the drums start. The sound is addictive the audience gets lost in it and even though it’s so hot and so late, the performers give it their all.I shot this in 2013, while trailing a local troupe I’d befriended a few years earlier. It was about 6.45 in the evening, and it was very hot, very humid. Everyone was moving a little slowly, which I think this picture captures. The troupe – about 150 dancers and drummers – had gathered at the director’s house, which transforms into a community centre of sorts.I came across this private moment in the kitchen. Someone had made stew for dinner, in that big pot, and two dancers were making ham and cheese sandwiches for the road. The boy had put the knife down to concentrate on talking to the girl. They were having an intense conversation. I liked how they were mirroring each other’s body language, unconsciously, beautifully. The composition reminded me of Dutch paintings.In the room next door, people were doing their makeup and making last-minute adjustments to their costumes – men with their coat-tails and smart hats, girls with short skirts. Elsewhere, others were loading drums into buses. I liked how this quiet, fleeting moment, stood in direct contrast to the flurry of activity all around. I went back the following year with printed copies of the image to give the boy and the girl, but they were no longer members. I never found out their names.Training: BA in fine art at Norwich School of Art and MA in contemporary art theory at Goldsmiths College, London.Influences: “Vermeer, Alessandra Sanguinetti, and many other photographers, artists and film directors.”High point: “Photographing Somaliland’s presidential elections recently for the NGO Saferworld.

Projections give his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party a commanding lead, but opponents of the cricket star turned populist politician are unanimous in rejecting the outcome. Though the startling delay in results and reports of ballot-stuffing fuelled suspicion and anger, there had already been warnings of the dirtiest election in recent history.But even before the problems with casting and counting votes, Pakistan’s Independent Human Rights Commission had warned of “blatant, aggressive and unabashed attempts to manipulate” the outcome, mostly through intense pressure on the media and the intimidation of candidates. While the military denies it has intervened in favour of Mr Khan, no one doubted its determination to see off the incumbent Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz. Though the jailing of its leader Nawaz Sharif followed revelations in the Panama Papers, his supporters were not alone in seeing selective prosecution or suggesting that his greater offence was pushing back against the military.But Mr Khan has also benefited from voters’ frustration with years of corruption and dynastic politics dominated by the PML-N and the Pakistan Peoples party (now headed by Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, son of the assassinated Benazir Bhutto, the PPP seems to be positioning itself for the next contest). Mr Khan promises a new Pakistan, and has certainly reinvented himself. In the west, he is still seen as a cosmopolitan playboy in Pakistan he has wooed the religious right, vowing to defend the blasphemy law and describing the Taliban’s fight in Afghanistan as a “holy war”. He has portrayed himself as the outsider who will clean up a dirty business, despite his elite background and reliance on “electables” who bring their own vote banks as they switch between parties. There was some relief at his conciliatory tone as he claimed victory. But his campaigning record is not encouraging, and now he must actually run a country – in so far as he is allowed to. His party has governed one province. He takes over a country struggling with violence, extremism, poverty and a worsening economic situation, in a fraught international environment a mightier China, tense relations with the US, India and Afghanistan. Whatever he does will be done within the context of a strengthened military. He claimed the country’s “umpires” would step back if he were elected. But Mr Khan’s promised “New Pakistan” seems likely to look rather like the old variety."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e3381798ea62cc71d0bf0d2dbf369233c89af8c1/0_232_1080_648/master/1080.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=94b96e49282a738e893bc5f79b0e7f3a","title":"the day i wore a puffer jacket and became a george costanza meme","story":"My brother bought me a jacket and told me not to wear it outside. But I decided to go to the cinema in itMy brother comes to visit me on the weekend bearing a gift. It’s a fancy North Face puffer jacket he found at the op shop for $10, in excellent condition.“It’s worth at least $600,” he says.I’m excited for my new jacket. I have a wardrobe full of Sydney clothes that don’t quite cut it in a central Victorian winter, where the nights are brilliant with cold and the air is sharp and clarifying.He arrives off the train carrying what looks like a sleeping bag but is actually the jacket in its own special case. We walk to my place, where I eagerly undo it. “The thing with this jacket,” says my brother in his most serious voice, “is that you cannot wear it outside the house.”“Why not? That would defeat the whole purpose of a jacket. A jacket is something that you wear when you go outside.”I pull the jacket from its cover. It sort of bounces out. I can see why he has advised me not to wear it in public. It’s not a normal puffer jacket. “If you wear it inside you won’t need heating …” he says. “You’ll save on electricity.”The jacket resembles a sleeping bag with arms – the sort of sleeping bag people take when they might be in a situation where they have to sleep in the snow. To call it bulky is an understatement. It looks like an inflated life raft and sits on the kitchen floor taking up an enormous amount of space.I put the jacket on and we both crack up laughing. My brother punches me in the arm and I don’t feel a thing.“It’s like a grossly exaggerated puffer jacket,” I say taking it off. “Perhaps the person that owned this was a polar explorer.”The next morning I disobey my brother and wear the jacket outside, to the farmer’s market. Walking in it is difficult. I cannot swing my arms. They sort of sit away from my body at 45 degree angles – suspended by great volumes of nylon and goose down feathers. But slowly crossing the highway, I feel invincible – as if the bulk of the jacket will protect me if I am hit by a car.I get a take away coffee and a snack at the market but find I cannot eat or drink while wearing the jacket. Its high, bulky collar keeps getting in the way – there is so much puff in the sleeves that my hand holding the cup can’t reach my mouth and I spill coffee down my chin.“I can’t believe you wore that outside,” says my brother when I get home.I give him a rundown: wearing it is like being in a sweat lodge or wrapped in roof insulation, it’s too hot in there! The inside of the sleeves are spiky – maybe it’s loose quills? It’s slowed me down and I cannot eat or drink in it AND I look like a gridiron player. Yet wearing it, I feel cosy and coddled.That night it’s very cold – bitter in fact – and I decide to wear the puffer out to a documentary film festival. There are many other people wearing puffers at the film festival but they are the Uniqlo sort that are streamlined and flat. They are flattering puffas.I want to get in their faces, grab their jackets and say, “that’s not puffer, this is a puffer!” And then softly shirtfront them with my enormous padded chest.But I don’t. I am the Walrus.When I run into friends at the theatre they immediately start laughing and then hitting me on either side of my body and saying, “It’s Gortex” over and over. This is apparently a Seinfeld reference to the episode where George wore a similar big puffer to Jerry’s, and Jerry and Elaine mocked him and whacked him in the arms.Like George, my spatial awareness in the jacket is all off. It’s the sartorial equivalent of drunk driving – I knock stuff over and bump into people. I edge out entire families at the counter. My bulk is impressive. I have trouble clearing doorways.At the documentary festival I am seeing Last Men in Aleppo, a film about the incredible first responders who have stayed in the besieged and ruined Syrian city, trying to pull out people from bombed buildings.I arrive late and take a seat on a couch that has been placed lengthways. I am conscious that because of the angle I am sitting at, and more importantly, because of my massive puffer, the man behind me cannot see the film. I can sense him behind me – shifting forward at a sharp angle – trying to see around my massive silhouette.On screen there is a really tense moment of shelling, and Syrians running for cover as bombs rain down and buildings fall. Will they save the baby trapped in the rubble?I try and take the jacket off slowly and quietly - but the puffer is noisy. It’s like someone crinkling a large chip packet – except I am the chip packet. After the film, people take pictures of me in the jacket and the theatre owner makes me into a meme and puts me on their Facebook page next to a picture of George Costanza in his big puffer saying: “It’s Gore-Tex!”The next day, I send Mum a picture on WhatsApp of me in the jacket. “Look what Matt got me!” I write.After the laughter and the ridicule and the warnings not to wear it in public, it’s a nice message to get. I wouldn’t have thought of comparing me in the puffer to Michelangelo but perhaps it takes one’s mother to see the form and sculpted biceps of her child underneath the super-sized jacket.I recline on the couch, still in the puffer. I am warm and cosy, I am a Michelangelo woman.Then another message from my mother: “I mean Michelin woman.”Oh. Damn autocorrect. And despite my puffer, I suddenly feel deflated."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4bf4caf529a18d827898ca6f25e4096f90453802/126_340_3240_1944/master/3240.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=046113a4595cc7db7b7e3c052d9985ec","title":"chinas long game to dominate nuclear power relies on the uk","story":"Approval of Chinese nuclear technology in the UK would act as a springboard to the rest of the worldChina wants to become a global leader in nuclear power and the UK is crucial to realising its ambitions.While other countries have scaled back on atomic energy in the wake of the Fukushima disaster, state-backed Chinese companies benefit from the fact that China is still relying on nuclear energy to reach the country’s low-carbon goals.“China is going in the opposite direction. The massive experience possessed by the Chinese nuclear industry, consistently building for the past 30 years and adopting various next-generation technologies, is being recognised by the global nuclear industry,” said Zaf Coelho, the director of Asia Nuclear Business Platform, based in Singapore.But the depth of CGN’s existing involvement in UK nuclear may surprise some.It was that Chinese ownership of a strategic piece of infrastructure that led Theresa May to temporarily halt the signing of the crucial subsidy deal for Hinkley when she became prime minister.Isabel Hilton, the CEO of Chinadialogue.net, said the UK opening up vital infrastructure to China was without parallel in the western world. “No other OECD country has done this. This is strategic infrastructure, and China is a partner but not an ally in the security sense.“You are making a 50-year bet, not only that there will be no dispute between the UK and China, but also no dispute between China and one of the UK’s allies. It makes no strategic sense.”The UK has appeared amenable to Chinese investment, though recently the UK cybersecurity watchdog warned British telecommunications companies against dealing with Chinese tech firm ZTE. One expert acknowledges that security concerns are a potential check to Chinese ambitions. Zha Daojiong, a professor of non-traditional security studies at Peking University, said: “The question is not whether your nuclear technology is safe or not, it’s a question of politics. To be blunt, most countries think: ‘Anybody but China.’ This kind of thinking is becoming more and more popular among western countries. It’s a serious problem.”While Germany and other western countries have turned their backs on nuclear, the UK is strongly committed to new nuclear to meet its carbon goals and this means, despite security concerns, the government needs Chinese involvement.Robert Davies, the chief operating officer of CGN UK, said: “The UK is open to investment, and we want to invest in clean energy in this country.”He is acutely aware of the need for future plants to be cheaper, given criticism over the cost of the EDF subsidy deal. “We understand the cost of electricity has to fall significantly from Hinkley Point,” he said.But the company is open about the bigger prize – the UK as a springboard for exporting Chinese nuclear technology to other countries. Asked if the UK should be concerned about China owning its nuclear power stations, he said: “We are not surprised and see nothing wrong with governments questioning our rationale for investing in their country.”For now, the company’s UK footprint is small – just 70 of its 44,000 staff are based here. But his hope is the firm will become viewed “not as an outsider that has come in, but part of the furniture”.China’s commitment was on show at a recent lavish nuclear industry event in London. No expense was spared on hosting the summit at the prestigious Guildhall building, where the Chinese ambassador to the UK told jokes and argued the case for new nuclear.Mycle Schneider, a Paris-based nuclear industry analyst, said cost was not an issue for Beijing because the Chinese are playing a long game. “It was clear quite early on there was a strategy to make the UK a platform … A few billion here or there is not the point. It’s about strategic assets.”But he said CGN still had a lot to learn about how the UK worked. “China does not have any building experience in any countries other than Pakistan, and that is not really comparable to the UK.”Zhou Dali, a former Chinese energy official, as director of the energy research institute of China’s National Development and Reform Commission, said: “We are learning how to do business with patience. Because you cannot force others to do something. You can only help. “We will give more and more information about the technology’s improvements, but the final decision will be made by the UK people and your politicians.”Additional reporting by Wang Xueying"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/336d9c61f97757f08c3ad49ac292be5570cbaed5/2_0_10663_6400/master/10663.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=16ec65fd85f5745c3da0996abbc107e1","title":"the bright side why women fell out of love with black","story":"For decades it has been synonymous with timeless chic – but now joyful, attention-grabbing colours are pushing it out of the wardrobeNew Yorkers do it. Parisians do it. Fashion types, Swedes and architects do it. In fact, name any stylish tribe and you’ll find that they do it. Wear black, that is – a colour that has come to signify so much: rigour, elegance, sex appeal, piety, formality, slenderness, even wickedness.Recently, however, black’s supposedly timeless status as the go-to hue for the chic has been thrown into the shade. And maybe that is no bad thing.Scroll through any British fashion website today and a rainbow of colour beams out. The breadth of shades feels remarkable: Topshop sets out its stall with a parrot-green silk skirt, a lemon coat and an azure trouser suit. At Boden, it’s all tomato-red cardigans and spotty cerise frocks. At Zara, there are russet and emerald tartans and rollneck jumpers in highlighter pen yellow and candy pink.Yes, Britain is in the midst of a heatwave, but this is no seasonal aberration. For months, the fashion news agenda has been hijacked by colour, seen everywhere from Amal Clooney’s dandelion-yellow royal wedding frock to Janelle Monáe’s so-called “vagina” trousers (pink, of course).Black is not dead, but Florence Allday, Euromonitor International’s analyst, predicts it will become an “increasingly smaller proportion of retailers’ product offering”, thanks to shifts in our lifestyles. “Now your office can be anywhere, the boundaries between formalinformal, workhome, onlineoffline are blurring,” she says. “Colour is no longer seen as frivolous, eccentric or inappropriate.”Colour is going nowhere for autumn, when the trends set to trickle down from the catwalk include neon and hi-vis. And this is not just for the very young or achingly hip: the philosophy behind John Lewis’s biggest womenswear relaunch in decades, on sale in September, is about using colour as a means for expressing iniduality, with most items available in up to four hues.The professionally seen-and-not-heard have used colour cannily for decades. The Queen, for one, dresses brightly to ensure visibility. Recently, she has noticeably ramped up the intensity, dabbling in head-to-toe lime green and shocking chartreuse.Such expert tricks are becoming part of civilian wardrobes, too, thanks to social media, and what Smith describes as “millennial peacocking”. She says: “It’s the fastest way to stand out on an endlessly updating feed.”Instagram stars are virtuoso colourists. The Danish street style star Pernille Teisbaek, for example, is an icon for what passes as understated chic now. Although monochrome makes up a significant part of her feed, she uses colour when it counts. On the cover of her recent book, Dress Scandinavian, for example, she wears mustard trousers, a canary-coloured jacket and a T-shirt with the word “yellow” over a picture of a bunch of bananas, an image which kills dead the idea of navy-and-cream Scandi minimalism.As the internet threatens the future of the traditional high street, the niche brands flourishing online have colour at the centre of their business plans. Kitri, for example, has seen products such as its £145 grass green Gabriella dress go viral. When the company launched, in March 2017, founder Haeni Kim says: “There was more of that traditional retail sense of putting more quantity behind neutrals. Now, we have started phasing out neutral colours, which is very unlike the traditional rules.” Bright colours, she says, “make people feel special. They get such amazing compliments. They photograph well on our website, and also stand out when customers take photographs of themselves. We are living in a very photographed world.”Even vampires don’t wear much black these days, according to Susie Cave, the wife of musician Nick, whose label, the Vampire’s Wife, has quickly captured the fashion zeitgeist. The brand’s name, which was always meant to be ironic (“You know, my husband has been held hostage by the Prince of Darkness thing for years,” she says), might suggest a Morticia Addams palette – but the emphasis is on peaches-and-cream florals and deep shimmering greens.“I think the world in which we live as women has become so isive, so bloodthirsty, so vindictive and puritanical that women want to exist beyond these reductive influences, and colour is one way of doing this,” says Cave. “Colour has a huge positive psychological impact – it is a shout of iniduality – and I think women want some life and wonder and joy and wildness in their lives and colour gives them that.”Cave is far from alone in using emotional language about colour. In fact, one of the most fascinating shifts in our approach to colour is the way we talk about it. In the 90s, colour analysis meant finding out if you were “cool autumn” or a “warm spring” in order to buy a jumper that would make your eyes sparkle. Now, colour chat rarely mentions appearance, but is about politics, identity and mood.In 2016, the term “millennial pink” was coined to describe a shade said to encapsulate the moment’s “ambivalent girliness”. Since then, as the fashion blog ManRepeller wrote in May, colour has become clickbait. Other shades with catchy names – among them “Gen Z yellow” and “melodramatic purple” – have also been briefly posited as generation-defining, while bright colours are increasingly used for protest, from pink pussy hats to calls to wear red for International Women’s Day, or green for Grenfell or orange for gun safety.WGSN’s colour director, Jane Boddy, believes we are all increasingly aware of “how colour connects us, as human beings, and how we use it as a tool to define us”. Certainly, a fascination with something as digestible as colour makes sense when the news agenda is so tangled and baffling, thanks to Brexit and Trump.We may be living through the most visual era ever. But at least fashion experts are no longer urging women to wear black clothing to look thinner or less distracting in the workplace.Issues of class and gender swirl around black dresses like clouds of chiffon. Black has been linked with money and taste since the 1500s. In the Victorian era, it was a signifier of mourning, and scandalously worn by women of loose morals in paintings, including Manet’s A Bar at the Folies-Bergère and John Singer Sargent’s Madame X. The pivotal moment, however, for black as we know it was Coco Chanel’s little black dress, a simple, long-sleeved, straight-up-and-down shift hailed, on a 1926 Vogue cover, as the fashion equivalent to Ford’s Model T, “a sort of uniform for all women of taste”.The reality of Chanel’s LBD was far less progressive than the mythology suggests. According to Shelley Puhak, writing in the Atlantic: Chanel’s innovation was an appropriation of servant’s uniforms, part of the luxurious poverty – “la pauvreté de luxe” – trend “reserved exclusively for those who could ‘afford’ to look poor by pretending that they simply couldn’t be bothered with fashion. But on closer inspection, there would be some small detail in her seemingly anonymous garment – a certain cut or fabric or label – that acted as a secret handshake for those in the know.” Plus ça change.Little black dresses have since become a cultural totem. They can launch careers (Liz Hurley and her safety pins) and wreak revenge (Princess Diana at the Serpentine Gallery party in 1994). Their icons are usually very sharp and very thin. The patron saint is Audrey Hepburn in a black Givenchy shift in Breakfast at Tiffany’s or a black beatnik rollneck in Funny Face. Other notable black dress icons include the quartet of grumpy glamazons in the video for Robert Palmer’s Addicted to Love.Black is not very friendly. So many of the aphorisms that exist about the shade have a hectoring tone: “A woman without a little black dress, has no future,” said Coco Chanel. Black, according to the Japanese designer Yohji Yamamoto, says: “I don’t bother you. Don’t bother me!” Karl Lagerfeld, of course, thinks wearing black is much safer than dressing according to your own terrible taste. “If you’re wearing black, you’re on sure ground.” And behind it all is the pernicious idea that black matters because, as Christian Dior put it: “It is the most slimming of all.”So, is black a feminist issue? Susie Orbach says black has been “coded” as elegant, but often this really means slimming. “You could go back to Breakfast at Tiffany’s, the image of the gamine, cute sophisticate in the black dress. What’s in that is skinny, which, of course, has been absolutely critical to the representation of femininity for years.”At a time when body image issues are worse than ever, according to Orbach, dancing on black’s grave is probably not merited. “There is no bloody difference when you are talking about clothing,” she says. “It’s still about: ‘How do I represent myself?’ There is always an internal eye that’s judgmental, whether the current trend is that you need to stand out, rather than look svelte and sophisticated. It’s the same thing, just a different version of it. It strikes me as a wish too far, frankly.”Naomi Wolf, the author of The Beauty Myth, is a little more optimistic. “If women are embracing colour, it suggests that they are confident they can be taken seriously without wearing black,” she says. “If people aren’t choosing clothes primarily to appear smaller, I think that’s really politically important. It says: ‘I’m here and I’m not ashamed.’ It’s very non-apologetic.” And that’s an argument that I can buy into. After all, we may as well look on the bright side."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/763414374ef48fec817a7231291d65acf2e355fc/0_0_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e1d94450763f17ed5dd818154892b2cd","title":"tommy hilfiger new clothing line monitor customers","story":"Tommy Jeans Xplore items contain a bluetooth chip that will also track customers’ locationClothing stores have long employed all kinds of sneaky behaviour to make you want buy their products. The store assistants tell you you look fantastic in everything, the changing mirrors make you look skinnier, they play music that encourages people to make more purchases. Then often when you get home, those trousers don’t look so good after all, and they stay at the back of your closet forever more.Tommy Jeans, part of the Tommy Hilfiger brand, believe they can solve this part of the problem. Their new line, Tommy Jeans Xplore, will contain smart-chip technology that will track how often customers wear the clothes. Tommy Jeans will offer rewards and experiences, including gig tickets and gift certificates, to people that wear their clothes often enough (presumably some rewards will be even more wear-tracking items).Tommy Jeans says that by tracking users’ clothes-wearing habits they will be creating a “micro-community of brand ambassadors”.The collection includes hoodies, T-shirts, jeans and a denim skirt as well as bags, backpacks and hats. Every item is fitted with a bluetooth chip that can be linked to an Xplore app to start collecting “rewards”. As well as rewards for just wearing the clothes, bonus credits will be awarded for walking past special Tommy Jeans locations, which will be displayed on the app. So you could put the jacket on and then travel across town so that you can tell your jacket you’ve gone to where it told you to go.Tommy Hilfiger representatives said that the data they receive will be encrypted and wearers will be able to turn off the chip’s functionality at any time using the app – so perhaps that will make people feel better about wearing a baseball cap that knows where it is."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/904b0b9003b3bde41ae2242f43a14b2b8c8dd60b/444_37_2350_1410/master/2350.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=daeb1b15f34196a6580e0c05f4489790","title":"aberdeen burnley europa league match report","story":"Burnley substitute Sam Vokes struck a crucial late away goal to deny Aberdeen a famous Europa League win at Pittodrie.The Dons led through Gary Mackay-Steven’s penalty from the 19th minute and were more than holding their own until Vokes flicked the ball over two defenders’ heads and fired into the roof of the net to make it 1-1 with 10 minutes left.Finances suggested the game should have been a mismatch – Burnley raked in £120m for finishing seventh in the Premier League while their hosts collected £2.3m for a fourth consecutive runners-up spot in Scotland.But Aberdeen had more than an edge in European experience, not just from their 1980s heyday when they won the European Cup Winners’ Cup and Super Cup. The Dons are used to competing in the summer months in recent years while Burnley were making their return to European competition after 51 years.The visitors suffered an early blow when they lost the England goalkeeper Nick Pope to a shoulder injury. The World Cup squad member dropped the ball under pressure from Sam Cosgrove before being injured in a follow-up challenge from Lewis Ferguson, which drew a foul.Sean Dyche said: “He’s gone to hospital. At this stage it looks more serious than not serious.” His replacement, Anders Lindegaard, was soon picking the ball out of the net after the well-placed German referee Daniel Siebert spotted an illegal challenge with the arm by James Tarkowski, which left Cosgrove clutching his face. Mackay-Steven sent the Danish substitute the wrong way from the spot.Aberdeen were pressed in for much of the rest of the half but they soaked up the pressure and looked purposeful in attack. The half-time situation could have been worse for Dyche’s side but Graeme Shinnie shot weakly at Lindegaard after robbing Ashley Westwood and driving to the edge of the box.Aberdeen had two players in defence who were making their debuts after missing the whole of last season with knee injuries. The former Hamilton captain Michael Devlin was hugely impressive while Tommie Hoban just about emerged unscathed from a difficult night against Aaron Lennon after joining on loan from Watford on Wednesday.They protected Joe Lewis until the 49th minute, when the goalkeeper produced a brilliant point-blank stop from Jack Cork’s ing header before getting a crucial touch to Lennon’s driven cross. The hosts weathered a brief storm before threatening again. Cosgrove had a shot saved as a break caught Burnley wide open and Mackay-Steven forced a flying save from Lindegaard with a header from eight yards.Shinnie dropped into a back five after Johann Berg Gudmundsson and substitute Vokes had efforts off target for Burnley and Aberdeen again came close when Niall McGinn fired just wide.But the tie turned when Vokes brought down a knockdown eight yards out and gave the 2,000 away fans cause for celebration and optimism before next week’s second leg at Turf Moor.The Aberdeen manager, Derek McInnes, felt his side deserved to take the lead but admitted the Clarets were well worth their equaliser for their second-half efforts.McInnes said: “We ran out of legs a little bit. It’s nothing new. In that first game in Europe it’s difficult to sustain your energy levels. But we’re still in the game.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/afe8b5ce5a7c934159c8df449f2af03d66bc6591/0_268_1488_892/master/1488.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ceebf0c0792e5b3c9cb36ad5c5322495","title":"liverpool mohamed salah james milner","story":"• Egyptian striker shows value in 2-1 win over Manchester City• Milner warns teammates they must chip in to help with goalsJames Milner believes Mohamed Salah can better the phenomenal impact he had at Liverpool last season but says his teammates must ease the pressure on the Egypt international by sharing responsibility for goals.Salah needed only one minute to announce his return to the Liverpool team in the early hours of Thursday when equalising against Manchester City in the International Champions Cup game in New Jersey, which ended 2-1 to Liverpool.The 61st‑minute introduction of the forward turned the friendly significantly in favour of Liverpool, who had previously looked sluggish against a youthful City side. Salah, on his first Liverpool outing since the Champions League final defeat by Real Madrid, also struck the bar, created several chances and was involved in the stoppage‑time penalty that enabled Sadio Mané to seal victory.Salah scored 44 goals in all competitions for Liverpool last season, including 32 goals in 36 Premier League games, a record in a 38-match season. Milner fully expects the forward to demonstrate he is one of the finest players in the world next season but says the onus is on the Liverpool team to improve in tandem.“The best players in the world aren’t known because they just did it in one season, they do it over and over again,” Milner said. “He is more than capable of doing that. There is pressure when you have had one good year to deliver again but he is a top player. He’s shown that. He’s going to keep on improving. We need to keep improving as a side with him as well, and make sure that all the pressure is not on his shoulders to deliver goals and get us out of tough situations. It’s down to all of us to help him be the best player he can and do that as part of a team.”Liverpool have spent more than £170m on new players this summer but securing Salah on a new five-year contract worth around £200,000 a week, without a release clause, was arguably the club’s most important piece of business. Milner agrees, saying: “Yes, but I was never worried personally. There’s always going to be stories when players do well. You saw how well he played last season, improving, and he seems happy. So I don’t see any reason why he’d want to go.Jürgen Klopp’s squad travelled from New Jersey to Michigan on Thursday before their final ICC fixture against Manchester United in Ann Arbor on Saturday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aecd4b2b2c8164ecf268ee8b183f82fedcc99daf/463_671_4177_2506/master/4177.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eff0dd13c476c2ec014c5d74357dc9b7","title":"luke shaw manchester united jose mourinho","story":"The Manchester United full-back is ready to prove his worth to José Mourinho after a personal pre-season programme in DubaiLuke Shaw is honest regarding the criticism he attracts for perceived weight issues.Speaking at the Montage hotel in Beverly Hills, where Manchester United are based for their US summer tour, Shaw is about to embark on a make-or-break year at Old Trafford. The defender is in great shape physically after a personal pre-season programme in Dubai this month but, more than anything, he would rather his physique was not constantly judged.Shaw, who has started all three of United’s games in the US, is entering the final year of a contract he signed in 2014, when he arrived at Old Trafford from Southampton for a fee in excess of £27m and with the then 18-year-old an England left‑back. He was expected to occupy the same position at United for a decade or more but his career there has yet to fire.Shaw has endured injury, notably a broken leg in September 2015 that ended his season. And from the moment Louis van Gaal, José Mourinho’s predecessor, branded him overweight during the 2014 summer tour of the US, the charge has dogged him.“People can say I’m fat but I know my own body,” Shaw says. “I always look big because I’m bigger built – I’ve got that Wayne Rooney type of body.”The trip to Dubai illustrates the player’s determination to compete with Ashley Young for United’s starting left-back slot, and if a picture he posted on social media is anything to go by the 23-year-old has been doing all the right things.Like Van Gaal before him Mourinho has been critical of Shaw’s weight, leading to accusations of bullying on the Portuguese’s part and the player at one stage last year believing he had no future at United. But as Shaw reveals, the current United manager has been hugely supportive of his summer fitness regime, going as far as to send him encouraging text messages.Shaw runs through his routine in Dubai. “We had to wake up early because it was hitting 45 degrees by 10 o’clock – it was quite painful the first day as we did do it in that heat. I would train and go in the gym. Then relax during the day and run on the beach and do core work in the evening before the sun went down.”Shaw is referencing Mourinho’s public admonishments regarding his approach to training and performances in matches. “It would be easy for me to quit and say: ‘I want to go.’ Of course, if the manager comes and says: ‘You’re not a player for Manchester United, you’re not a player for me,’ then I’ll accept that and find another place.“I want to earn a contract. I don’t want a contract because in the next year I’m a free agent, so they might look to tie me down. I know the club believe me – I’ve spoken with them, the manager, I’ve had discussions, meetings. If they really wanted to they could’ve cashed in. I’m going to fight for it this year and I want to be in that starting team.”“He knows what I can do. That was one of the texts he sent me in the off-season: ‘I know what you can do – you can be the best but you’ve just got to work on a couple of things.’ That’s why it pushes me on more. He says these things because he knows I can do it. He knows I can play for Manchester United."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db395978ad1bef6be6669cfdb44a7f3404226ea4/0_0_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d7191d7d497e289ecf55b6246e348002","title":"france croatia final trophy russia 2018 ends on high world cup football daily","story":"Max and co discuss France’s World Cup final triumph over Croatia, another penalty, another controversial VAR incident, the tournament’s highs and lows and players taking shots to the conkers"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c64a371b5532a9abd10532baaa73132dfea1bfe/0_233_3600_2161/master/3600.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2acbae2cc4f6ae66668d86bb2fc1c2ee","title":"scroll free september weaning off social media health","story":"Take back control, urges public health body, as it encourages people to abstain or cut downWe’ve got Dry January for anyone tempted to try alcohol abstinence and Stoptober for smokers who want to quit. Now, Scroll Free September will target the use of social media.The Royal Society for Public Health, which is behind the campaign, is urging everyone to stop using – or reduce use of – Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, Instagram and other social media platforms for the month.The campaign is being billed as an “opportunity to take back control of our relationship with social media” for the millions of Britons for whom social media plays a large, possibly unhealthily large, role in their lives. Anyone accepting the challenge can either go cold turkey, abstaining completely for a month, or commit to reduce their use, for example by steering clear of social media at social events or in the evening. Shirley Cramer, chief executive of the Royal Society for Public Health, said: “The aim is that by the end of the month we will be able to reflect back on what we missed and what we got to enjoy instead of scrolling through our newsfeeds.” But, she added: “Of course we know this will be a challenge because of the addictive nature of social media technology.” Chris Elmore, chair of an all-party group of MPs and peers looking at the impact of social media on young people’s mental health, said: “Many of us are becoming consumed by social media and whilst there are many benefits to using the various platforms available, it’s important to take some time out.” Mark Winstanley, the chief executive of Rethink Mental Illness, said people should limit, rather than abandon, their use of social media. “Social media, like fire, can be a great servant but a deadly master,” he said. “There’s plenty of evidence that shows that those affected by mental illness can get support and guidance through social media but at the same time it can prove addictive and affect some people’s wellbeing.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b94abc75407ba6508028c6fbc55b88aa682d0791/0_250_5700_3420/master/5700.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b12eac68179d7a5451f43e9e5394bd28","title":"household debt in uk worse than at any time on record","story":"British household finances among most indebted in major western countries, ONS saysBritish households spent around £900 more on average than they received in income during 2017, pushing their finances into deficit for the first time since the credit boom of the 1980s. The Office for National Statistics said the shortfall amounted to nearly £25bn – equal to almost a quarter of the NHS budget – and the overspend was mostly paid for with borrowed money, though households also ran down savings.The figures pose a challenge to the government, which was warned last year that Britain’s consumer credit bubble of more than £200bn was unsustainable. A dramatic rise in debt-fuelled spending since 2016 has also taken place against the backdrop of the Brexit vote, which triggered a rise in inflation at a time of weak wage growth.Analysts warned that a squeeze on household incomes from benefit cuts, lacklustre wages and high inflation would continue to force poorer households to borrow more to pay basic bills.Tom Selby, a research analyst at financial adviser AJ Bell, said the figures presented ministers with a significant challenge as they sought “to build financial resilience in the UK”.Researchers at the ONS said the situation was worse than at any time on record after the £25bn deficit last year surpassed the £300m deficit recorded in 1988. British household finances also slumped from being among the most solvent in the 1990s to being among the most indebted compared with households in other major western countries.Last year official data showed unsecured credit – such as credit cards and payday loans – climbed to a record high of more than £205bn while the consultancy PwC said its own measure showed consumer debts rising above £300bn.The ONS said households took out nearly £80bn in loans in 2017, the most in a decade. But they deposited just £37bn with UK banks, the least since 2011. Households accumulated more debt than they acquired in assets even when their investments in bonds, shares and pensions were included.Anti-poverty charities warned that millions of low income households were the worst affected. StepChange, which provides advice for indebted households, said the poorest were in constant need of credit to keep their heads above water.The charity’s chief executive, Phil Andrew, criticised the ONS for saying that households were living beyond their means, which he said implied they could cut back if they wanted to. “It’s really unfortunate that this very useful data is so heavily sprinkled with the phrase that households are ‘living beyond their means’. The reality is that too many households, here in Britain, in 2018, simply cannot make ends meet, however hard they try.”He added: “Not having enough money to make ends meet is not the same thing as living beyond your means – which implies you have a choice, when too many people do not.”The ONS said a rise in interest rates, expected to be pushed through by the Bank of England next week, could encourage greater saving and an improvement in household finances.But AJ Bell’s Selby said: “For people having to borrow to make ends meet, saving for the future might feel like a luxury they simply cannot afford.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/67096c910ea244771676e0ef86120b6e0c7b453e/0_8_3564_2139/master/3564.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a111a25793c5d995329438eaf101a508","title":"it felt like wed got the golden ticket paul mccartney plays cavern club","story":"Beatles fans tune into Twitter to find ticket location of McCartney’s gig at Liverpool venueGordon Smith was visiting his brother in Manchester on Wednesday night when he first saw rumours online that there was to be a secret Paul McCartney gig at Liverpool’s Cavern club the next day.

At 9am, McCartney’s official Twitter account announced that 200 tickets for the 2pm gig would be available for free on a first-come, first-served basis at the Echo arena – a 15-minute walk away – not the Cavern club, as many had presumed.“I heard a man shout behind me,” said Smith. “I didn’t hear what he said, but I saw a bunch of people running off and leaving the queue.” He asked a group piling into a taxi where they were going and they told him they were going to the arena. “I’m not a sports person, but I ran as fast as I could from the Cavern club to the Echo arena and I managed to get a ticket, luckily.”Others weren’t so fortunate. Emma Ley wrote on Twitter that she had waited outside the Cavern club for about 10 hours overnight only to hear they were being given out at the arena. “I got there five minutes too late,” she wrote. “Gutted is an understatement. I’m not even happy for people with tickets. I’m sad and tired.”McCartney’s surprise gig comes days after he appeared on the crossing at Abbey Road made famous by the Beatles’ album cover, and as he prepares to go on tour, including dates in Liverpool, Glasgow and London in December.The original Cavern club opened in a warehouse cellar on Liverpool’s Mathew Street in 1957 and the Beatles are thought to have performed there nearly 300 times in the early 1960s. The club closed in 1973 and the cellar was filled in as part of the construction of the Merseyrail underground system. In the 1980s the club was rebuilt using many of the original bricks and reopened in 1984. This is only the second time McCartney has performed at the Cavern club since the 1960s the first was a gig in 1999 which was turned into the film Live at the Cavern Club.Waiting patiently in line to enter the Cavern club about 1pm on Thursday were Paul and Tina Magee, civil servants in their 50s. They’d been on their way to work when a parking attendant told them that free tickets to the concert were available at the arena. The couple arrived to find only about 30 people in line. “It felt like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, like we’d got the golden ticket,” said Paul.Helen Brown, 37, had been in a cab on her way to join the queue outside the Cavern club when she saw on Twitter that tickets would be given out at the arena. “I erted the taxi and when I got out I just threw loads of money at him and didn’t even wait for the change. I just legged it,” she said. “If I’d been caught at one red light, I would have missed out.”“As time goes on you realise how much the Beatles influenced everything,” she said. “They changed things culturally, socially, musically. I grew up here with parents from Liverpool, who saw the Beatles in the 60s and went to the Cavern club, so this is me getting a little bit of that action ... There’s also a feeling like there might not be many more chances to see him perform again.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aea2626ca1f9161a534bdec99864ee84d2933a56/0_236_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e1e2ab69f85e4954b191a85be6a34a11","title":"vast haul of spice girls mementos goes on display","story":"Alan Smith-Allison’s huge trove ranges from costumes and cups to crackers and crispsA superfan’s jaw-dropping collection of Spice Girls memorabilia is to go on a UK tour of 12 cities. It includes costumes, dolls, flasks, lunch boxes, plates, cups, Christmas crackers, toys, biscuits and cushions.There are also cake toppers, jigsaws, radios, magazines, Easter eggs, Pepsi cans, drinking glasses, handbags, three Aprilia mopeds and dozens of packets of Walkers crisps.“I’ve always been a bit of a magpie,” said Alan Smith-Allison ahead of the opening of his Spice Girls exhibition in London on Saturday. “I always collected things when I was little.”The new show features thousands of examples of the multitudinous merchandise that accompanied the band, along with hundreds of costumes the Spice Girls wore for their performances, videos and movie.The double-decker bus that featured in the Spice World film will arrive and be parked outside the exhibition on Friday, borrowed from a marina on the Isle of Wight and lovingly restored thanks to a crowdfunding campaign.Visitors will also be able to watch footage from the Spice Girls’ Istanbul concert and, although not compulsory, the whole Spice World movie.Smith-Allison admits some people might see his obsession as being a little over the top. “I’ve met the two Mels and Geri,” he said. “I would love to meet Victoria and Emma, but at the same time I’m not going to go hang about their houses. I respect their privacy.”Smith-Allison was a teenager when Wannabe came out in 1996 and it changed his world. “In the 90s, being gay and 15-years-old, it was a bit uncomfortable at times. I grew up in Scotland, in a quiet countryside village and it wasn’t always easy.“I’m not saying ‘oh poor me’ because everybody was in the same boat in the 90s, but these girls came along and said ‘be who you want to be and it doesn’t matter’.”For girls it was about girl power. For Smith-Alison it was: “If you’re a bit different, a bit quirky then embrace it and go for it, as long as you work hard and try hard you can do whatever you want.”Smith-Alison was formerly a charity worker, but he realised after buying his first costume in 2007 was that what he really wanted was to build up perhaps the greatest Spice Girls collection in the world and make an exhibition out of it. It has not been cheap. His partner’s “hair would fall out” if he knew, he said. “It must be well over a hundred grand, probably a couple of hundred.”Smith-Allison said he had always seen the collection as an investment, and with 10,000 advance tickets already sold for the London show he may be proved right.The red corset dress with union jack detailing that Halliwell commissioned from Suzanne Neville for the 2012 London Olympics closing ceremony is part of the exhibition on loan from the designer.After London, the Spice Girls show will move to Manchester and 10 other cities over the next 18 months, Smith-Alison said. Dates are still to be announced.The band may gone their separate ways, but Smith-Allison said the Spice Girls were still as current today as ever. “Who doesn’t love a bit of fun and girl power and cheesy pop music?”• The Spice Girl Exhibition is at the Business Design Centre, Islington, from 28 July to 20 August, and at the Manchester Central Convention Complex from 24 August to 4 September This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

After Theresa May’s Chequers deal and the subsequent departures from the cabinet of Boris Johnson and David Davis, the Conservative party is ided and the Brexit debate has entered its final, critical phase. How did we end up here? And what could happen in the coming months?In the 1990s, as Conservative opposition to ever-growing closeness to what was now the EU festered, John Major faced repeated challenges from what he called the “bastards” – die-hard Eurosceptic MPs who opposed the Maastricht treaty and other integration moves.After the Tony Blair and Gordon Brown years, during which the main debate about Europe was whether or not the UK should join the euro, from 2010 David Cameron was tormented both by Tory Eurosceptics and a seemingly rampant Ukip, and so in 2013 he proposed an inout vote. Emboldened by the 2014 Scottish independence vote, he took the Tories into the 2015 election with an EU referendum as a manifesto pledge. There are two key dates in Theresa May’s mind: 18 October, which is the start of the two-day EU summit that is expected to approve a withdrawal agreement and 29 March 2019, Brexit day. But there are several other milestones along the way.In September the government is due to unveil its plans for a post-Brexit immigration policy, one of the most tortuous and controversial elements of the process. Then, at the end of the month, May faces what could be a hugely hostile Conservative party conference.If all this is achieved, the work begins on trade talks and the other measures to come into force at the start of 2021, when the transition period is due to end. This would be when any deal on a backstop solution to prevent a hard border in Ireland would – in the UK’s view – expire.Is the Chequers proposal dead?It’s certainly not very popular, possibly even among May’s cabinet, but it has one thing in its favour. No one else currently has an alternative plan that could conceivably pass through parliament and have a chance of being accepted by the EU while not breaking the Tory party apart. As with almost everything connected to Brexit though, all this could change.Will May face a leadership challenge, or could there be an election? As with her Brexit plan, the one thing keeping May in No 10 is the lack of a plausible alternative. The PM is, at best, grudgingly respected by her fellow Tory MPs for her dogged persistence, and many would like to see her go. Not enough seem committed to forcing an immediate leadership contest though, mindful that installing a committed Brexiter in her place could fracture the party, and that the two most talked-up contenders, Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, are hugely isive in their own party, let alone the country. As such, May seems a fair bet to see Brexit through. As with the Chequers plan, however, everything could change almost overnight. An election is seen as less likely, with MPs painfully aware the public would not relish yet another call on their attention, and it could be seen as self-indulgent given the Brexit deadlines. Conservative MPs in particular will have also noted their party’s recent mini-slump in the polls.What are the various camps up to this summer?With parliament in recess until September, it would be nice to think the more single-minded MPs from both sides will focus on constituency duties, and on reintroducing themselves to their families and spending a quiet couple of weeks on a beach.In reality, the plotting is unlikely to take a summer break. May cannot realistically expect a leadership challenge without the Commons sitting, but her principal opponents will be gathering their forces before the Tory conference.Similarly, some among the majority of Labour members who wish Jeremy Corbyn would do more to oppose or mitigate Brexit will hope to raise a proper debate on the issue at their conference. This could even include dissent from the Momentum group that back Corbyn.Officially, just two. A deal based on May’s Chequers plan, with whatever alterations are imposed during negotiations, or a departure without a deal, whether moving to World Trade Organisation trade terms or some other hastily agreed arrangement.Some of May’s MPs advocate other options. Boris Johnson used his first speech since stepping down as foreign secretary to call for a plan based on May’s more hard Brexit-based Mansion House speech, while David Davis’s allies hanker after a Canada-style deal. Given the strict timetable, however, and lack of any details as to how these would work, it seems a big ask.What are the forecasts for these options?The only semi-official forecasts, made by government officials and seen by MPs but not published, suggest that whatever Brexit outcome emerges, the UK economy will take something of a hit.Brexiters have dismissed the figures as alarmist, and it is true that it is difficult to extrapolate what might happen given so many variables, but big business groups such as the CBI and Institute of Directors agree that a no-deal Brexit would be seen as the most damaging.Could there be a second referendum, and what would it ask?What was until fairly recently something of a fringe position, advocated largely by the Liberal Democrats and the remainer edge of the Labour party, has moved slightly more into the mainstream in recent weeks.The idea seems unlikely though, for now at least, given the government’s intractable opposition, the public’s scepticism and the, at best, ambivalence of the Labour leadership. There is also extremely limited time to make the necessary legal preparations.Could it all be delayed?Pressured UK negotiators would be advised not to rely on this. Some believe that if the October EU summit fails to reach a deal, an emergency EU gathering before the end of the year could achieve one, but that’s probably as far as the flexibility goes. The one overriding reason is article 50. When this was triggered by May’s government on 29 March 2017, it set in place a formal legal process heading in one direction: the UK’s exit precisely two years later.Officials in Brussels say that while the article 50 process could in theory be extended, there would be no appetite to do so if it were merely to delay an inevitably disorderly departure. The only way it could conceivably happen, they say, would be because of some fundamental shift in the UK position, for example a new prime minister or a general election.When will we know if it’s been worth it?Among the many moveable deadlines of Brexit, this is perhaps the most elusive of them all. For all the Brexiters’ pre-referendum talk of sunlit uplands and the easiest trade deals imaginable, even some diehard believers now seem to be arguing that the benefits will be more visible in the long term.How long term depends on who you ask. In a much-shared recent interview with Channel 4 News, the Brexit cheerleader Jacob Rees-Mogg was challenged on how the success or otherwise of departure could be gauged. He replied that it was “a question of timescale”. Pressed on this, he said: “The overwhelming opportunity for Brexit is over the next 50 years.”• This article was amended on 26 July 2018. Measures would be set to come into force at the start of 2021, not the end of that year as an earlier version said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e067f63b1c2e8d72bdb8e8ba76a7954e7980584/0_311_5068_3041/master/5068.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a346e3d29dc4e019eec49977e54b8a3c","title":"michel barnier tears up theresa mays brexit customs proposals","story":"EU’s chief Brexit negotiator says UK ministers’ attempts to appeal to inidual leaders are ‘waste of time’Michel Barnier has warned that attempts to appeal to EU leaders over his head were a waste of time as he rejected Theresa May’s proposals on customs after Brexit, in effect killing off the Chequers plan.Against a backdrop of British cabinet ministers travelling across Europe to persuade governments of the benefits of the proposals, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator insisted there was no difference in opinion to exploit.“Anyone who wants to find a sliver of difference between my mandate and what the heads of government say they want are wasting their time, quite frankly,” he told reporters at a joint press conference with the new Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab, in Brussels.The British negotiators have become increasingly frustrated with the EU’s attitude to the white paper thrashed out at the prime minister’s country retreat. They feel that it will take an intervention by leaders, most likely at a summit in Salzburg in September, to move the dial in favour of a deal. A number of cabinet ministers have been despatched around EU capitals to make their case for greater flexibility.The impasse in the negotiations was laid bare in the press conference in the European commission’s Berlaymont headquarters as a thunderstorm broke outside.While Raab insisted that with “political will” a deal on trade and on avoiding a border on the island of Ireland was achievable by a crunch summit in October, Barnier offered a damning verdict on a major element of the UK’s vision of the future.To avoid customs checks after Brexit, the government wants an unprecedented system where the UK would collect EU duties while having the freedom to set different tariffs on goods destined for the British market.The plan would allow the UK to make its own free trade deals around the world, while not losing the benefits of frictionless trade to and from the rest of Europe.But echoing the language of Theresa May on her goals for Brexit, Barnier responded: “Maintaining control of our money, law and borders also applies to the EU customs policy. The EU cannot and will not delegate the application of its customs policy and rules, VAT and duty collection to a non-member who would not be subject to the EU governance structures.“Any customs arrangements or customs union – and I have always said that the EU is open to a customs union – must respect this principle.”Moments earlier, Barnier had struck a warmer note by saying he was “particularly pleased” with the progress of talks on foreign policy and security. But he added: “On our future economic relationship, it comes as no surprise that finding common ground between the EU27 and the UK is more difficult.” Raab, in his second appearance in Brussels since he replaced David Davis in the cabinet, claimed in response that the EU needed to display some of the creativity it had applied in the past.He said: “We have designed our proposals both to respect the result of the referendum, and the core principles of the EU. We have considered the innovative approaches the EU has taken in the past with other third countries – when the political will has been there.”Barnier offered the UK some cause for hope with regard to its temporary customs proposals, which are designed to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland in the period before the final arrangements are ready. The technology needed for the UK’s customs plan in the white paper, in the unlikely event of a U-turn by Barnier, is not expected to be ready until 2022 at the earliest.The EU is seeking what Barnier likes to call “an-all weather insurance policy”, known as the backstop, that would kick into place should the two sides be unable to agree a new trading relationship.The commission’s negotiator conceded that a UK-wide customs plan, avoiding a border in the Irish sea, was the goal, rather than one that simply kept Northern Ireland in the EU’s customs territory.“We have no objection in principle to this,” Barnier said. “But we have doubts that this can be done without putting at risk the integrity of our customs union, our common commercial policy, our regulatory policy and our fiscal revenue.”He said Raab had promised to answer those concerns when they meet again in mid-August.The two men clashed on whether the Brexit orce treaty would be reopened over the bill: the UK’s debts accrued over 45 years of membership that British officials estimate to be £39bn. Raab said there needed to be “conditionality” tying the Brexit orce bill to the deal on future relations.Barnier countered: “It is quite clear that what has been agreed in December and agreed in March has been agreed for good,” referring to the deals May signed with EU leaders."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6480a0f0138aa4bc468c78f9c8ff4cb8c24e211/0_329_5067_3040/master/5067.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2be7349adf2e11b308773a1821e8a9ec","title":"chris froome tour de france","story":"How many more years can the French stomach Team Sky’s domination of the Tour de France? Are the traditions of the Tour, the accessibility of the riders, the proximity of the fans, the international nature of the peloton, under threat after one of the most ill-tempered editions of the race in living memory?The Tour de France has survived two world wars, the civil unrest of 1968, serial doping scandals, financial and sponsorship crises, riders being punched, shoved and drugged and\u0026nbspyes, even farmers and fishermen protesting.As Richard Plugge, the vice‑president of the professional teams association (AIGCP), says: “What is normal at the Tour de\u0026nbspFrance?”Like many others, Plugge believes that the roots of the booing, spitting, grabbing and fraught nature of this year’s race lie across the Pyrenees in Spain, where Chris Froome’s salbutamol adverse finding at the Vuelta a España last year first fuelled this summer of discontent. The Team Sky rider was cleared at the beginning of July after the UCI eventually closed its case.The Dutchman, manager of the Lotto Jumbo NL team of the podium contender Primoz Roglic, says the lack of resolution to Froome’s case was the greatest provocation to a nation already disenchanted with Sky’s domination. “The most important element was that there was a case with Froome, starting in November,” he said.“We have a referee in our sport – the UCI – and it took them way too\u0026nbsplong to decide whether Froome\u0026nbspgot a green light, or a red light. That case dragged out for so long – for eight months or so – and all the while the tensions were building up in France.“The UCI should be more of a governing body. Team Sky is being booed for something that they never did: they got the green light from the UCI – they didn’t get a red card. But there’s nothing the Tour’s promoters ASO can do about that. ASO did a lot of work to really create a secure environment.”Yet whatever the race organisers\u0026nbspdo, the Tour remains vulnerable and always will be if it is run on open roads. The race has\u0026nbsplong relied on the goodwill of\u0026nbspthe roadside fans. Unticketed and almost impossible to police, it\u0026nbspis world sport’s greatest free event. This year, at times, that goodwill has been sorely lacking. “One of the reasons that this is a great sport is because of the proximity of the fans to the riders,” Plugge said. “There’s no way that we can put barriers all along the complete course of each stage.”Nor would the Tour’s economic model extend to hundreds of kilometres of barriers. The race generates most of its revenue from TV rights and sponsorship. Any attempt to charge any kind of entrance fee would be met with outrage from a French audience that is already losing interest in a race that since the mid‑1980s has been dominated by foreigners.Security, in a country scarred by recent terrorist attacks, is now a growing concern. Froome’s comical interception by an overzealous policeman as he descended to his team bus after the summit finish at the Col de Portet was indicative of the stress that the gendarmerie, faced with the mad chaos of the mountain stages, is increasingly being placed under.Plugge accepted that the Tour’s old traditions may have to adapt. “We understand the tense situation among the policemen. But what happened to Froome – it’s not a good thing that a policemen pulled Froome off his bike, but on the other hand there are so many people riding through the cars and the caravan that I understand the gendarme’s mistake.”Yet Plugge argued that any fan who caused an athlete to crash should be subjected to police action. “I can’t understand that guy that grabbed Thomas. You should never touch an athlete and I hope the police will find him. If he’d made Thomas crash, then it’s an assault.”Perhaps the best scenario for the Tour’s security managers would be a French winner – an outcome that, with Romain Bardet yet again falling short, Thibaut Pinot sidelined by illness and no other contenders on the horizon remains a dream.Plugge is sure, however, where the blame for the tensions lies. “The UCI should have played more of a United Nations ‘Kofi\u0026nbspAnnan role’ instead of putting oil on the fire with the Froome case, especially in France. That did not\u0026nbsphelp.“The UCI is our referee either Froome is in the race, or he’s out of the race. That message could have been communicated way earlier.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/99a43d694ecf6e2e168e00f52358176845b7f906/77_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c136b8e25e2cd9c0f2af21504c53701","title":"nine endorphin boosting ideas to get you outdoors this spring and summer","story":"Time outdoors has a hugely positive impact on our mental health and wellbeing. Whether you fancy paddleboarding around the coast or zipwiring across the treetops, here’s how to unlock a healthier, happier you this spring and summerFrom reducing blood pressure to alleviating symptoms of depression, countless studies have proved that being outdoors and in contact with nature is beneficial for both physical and mental health. In these milder months, there’s no excuse not to be outside as much as possible. Here are nine ideas for inspiration.Ride a waveThe north Cornwall coast, with its big Atlantic seas, is Britain’s premier surf destination, with Fistral beach at Newquay probably the country’s best-known surf beach. But there are great places to learn to surf all around the UK. If you’re after a board experience with a less steep learning curve, stand-up paddleboarding offers the chance to take to the water in an easy-to-learn fashion. As well as the exhilaration of surfing the waves, paddleboarding can be a means of exploring the wonders of Britain’s tranquil inland waterways.Get started: Surfing England (surfingengland.org) has information on surf clubs and learning to surf. The British Stand Up Paddle Association website (bsupa.org.uk) has information on where to learn.See colours in bloomSpring and summer are the best times to explore England’s most glorious gardens. Among the Royal Horticultural Society’s (RHS) stunners is its flagship garden, Wisley in Surrey. Home to one of the world’s largest plant collections, it’s a riot of flowering bulbs and blossoms in spring, with fragrant roses and colourful mixed borders in summer. The RHS also runs summer flower shows around the country, including the world-famous Chelsea flower show. The National Trust is  to more than 200 gardens and landscaped parks, many attached to its historic houses, with Studley Royal water gardens at Fountains Abbey, also a world heritage site, among the best known.Freewheel through forest trailsZip along peaceful country lanes between summer hedgerows, pedal past glowering mountains above Scotland’s Glencoe pass as part of a tour or expedition, race with other cyclists, or even head off-road along forest trails on a mountain bike. Cycling can provide high-adrenaline sport or light, relaxing exercise, but whichever way you ride, getting on a bike gives you an up-close view of the countryside that you’d never get from a car.Get started: Cycling UK (cyclinguk.org) can help you get on the road, with advice on everything from buying a bike to cycling groups and routes.Escape to the countryCity dwellers craving a rural fix should seek out one of the many regional annual outdoor shows, a celebration of farming and rural life, with sheep and cattle competitions, horse and dog shows, sheep-shearing contests and farm machinery displays. These days, though, the events are also packed with family-friendly entertainments, ranging from air displays and carriage-driving races to skateboarding and marching bands. Local producers showcase their food and drink, and makers display arts and crafts.Get started:UK County Shows (ukcountyshows) has countrywide information and links to inidual shows.Swim in scenic surroundingsWhat could be a more perfect summer idyll than plunging into a cool lake or river on a hot, sunny day? Wild swimming – taking a dip in rivers, lakes, streams and waterfalls – has a growing number of fans. Popular spots to swim include Ullswater in the Lake District and lochs throughout Scotland, while rivers in the Brecon Beacons are home to stunning waterfall plunge pools. In the south of England, Pangbourne on the river Thames is one of many popular locations, and there are even urban swims to be had in London’s Serpentine and Highgate ponds.Get started: There’s information on locations throughout the UK and all-important safety tips tips at wildswimming.Soar into the treetopsThere’s a special kind of thrill to hurtling through the treetops suspended on a wire. Locations range from urban parks (such as Heaton Park in Manchester and Battersea Park in London) to mountains and forests. Zip World, with locations in Wales, offers a variety of adventures through forest, over a quarry and even – this one’s for the fitter and more adventurous – underground in caverns. Go Ape has locations throughout England, Scotland and Wales, and a collection of mainly forest-based attractions.Kayak along the waterwaysBritain has thousands of miles of rivers, lakes, reservoirs and canals canoeing (single-ended paddle), or kayaking (double-ended paddle), is a great way to explore them. Assuming you don’t have your own canoe, you’ll need to join a club or go to an activity centre, where staff will generally help new paddlers with an induction session. Sea kayaking is a lot of fun, too, and more experienced paddlers may enjoy canoe polo (just as it sounds) or white-water canoeing. Get started: British Canoeing (britishcanoeing.org.uk) has information on canoe clubs and activity centres around the country, and on canoe hire.Walk this wayWhether it’s a Sunday stroll or a serious hike, there’s no simpler – or cheaper – way to explore Britain’s great outdoors than on foot. The British countryside is laced with public footpaths all you need to get going is a pair of walking boots or sturdy trainers (plus a map and weatherproof gear if you’re going far). Among myriad footpaths, 16 national trails pass through some of the country’s most iconic landscapes. They include the South West Coast Path, with 630 miles of trails snaking around the Dorset, Devon, Cornwall and Somerset coasts, and northern England’s hilly Pennine Way.Get started: National Trails (nationaltrail). In addition, Ramblers (ramblers.org.uk) has suggestions for hiking routes on its website.Combine your love of music with the outdoorsPack your tent and wellington boots and head for one of the country’s iconic music festivals this summer.

Whatever the weather this summer, Shakespeare comedy As You Like It lends itself so well to the enchanting backdrop you’ll feel like you’re in the mythical Forest of Arden itself. Sit back and immerse yourself in an evening of love, laughter and classic lines like, “All the world’s a stage.” And the dreamy musical score – comprising brand new tunes from former Noah and the Whale frontman Charlie Fink – isn’t bad either.openairtheatre 06-28 JulyHead to the hottest art showWhat could be better than an exhibition of work from one of the 20th century’s greatest artists? A good nosy at their previously unseen personal possessions and artefacts, that’s what. This summer, that’s exactly what London’s V\u0026ampA museum delivers in the much-anticipated Frida Kahlo: Making Her Self Up. The majority of this collection of jewellery, letters, photographs and items from her wardrobe (including hand-painted corsets) was only recently discovered, having been shut away for 50 years since her death. Consider this essential for demystifying the Mexican artist and sartorial icon, and it’s a lot cheaper than going all the way to Mexico. Granted, the exhibition is indoors, but you can combine your visit with a stop-off at the V\u0026ampA’s garden cafe, a hidden oasis in the centre of the museum, where you can sit at one of the courtyard tables or picnic on the lawn.vam.ac.uk from 16 JuneArrange a bouquet of flowersYou don’t have to be embarking on a second career as a florist to appreciate a beautifully arranged bunch of flowers, although a workshop at The Narcissus Flower School in Edinburgh could well send you in that direction. From learning to hand-tie a spring wedding bouquet to perfecting a festival-ready floral crown, this is the place to go this summer for cutting-edge botanical design. The highlight in the programme has to be The Foragers Garden Party workshop, which caters to all al fresco needs, from rustic barbecues to afternoon tea. Bring it on.narcissusflowers 21 June (and various dates)Learn a new craftStep away from the sandy beaches and seafood and head straight to The Studio at Burlingham Hall in Norfolk to get your hands – rather than your toes – dirty this summer. Artist Victoria Hall runs a two-day workshop for beginners in the art of paper marbling at this picturesque country estate. You’ll learn about the history, get familiar with watercolours, and tackle various paper patterns (including curl and comb designs). In fact, you’ll have a range of eclectic designs under your belt by the end. And if you don’t leave feeling like a born-again artist, you’ll certainly have the materials to make some pretty alternative Christmas cards.burlinghamhall 16-17 AugustGo down to the woodsHead to the Latitude festival for late-night poetry, light installations, and the biggest comedy, theatre, and arts line up in its 12-year history. Held in Suffolk’s picturesque Henham Park, Latitude is renowned for its eclectic arts programme, with a bit of yoga and lake swimming thrown in for good measure. This year it’s all about Bridget Christie and Tim Key in the comedy selection, while the Killers and Alt-J are definitely headliners to be reckoned with. But it’s the addition of enigmatic music and fashion icon Solange to the bill – her first time heading up a UK festival – that’ll be a real feast of the senses.latitudefestival 12-15 JulyFill up at a foodie festivalIs your idea of heaven on a hot day hitting up a beer garden?

There are four locations – Higginson Park in Marlow, Royal Victoria Park in Bath, Dunorlan Park in Tunbridge Wells and Knutsford, Cheshire – to choose from. Dishes from Kerridge’s own Michelin-starred Marlow pubs The Hand and Flowers and The Coach will pop up at the four festivals, alongside others from throughout Britain, and there’ll be chef demonstrations and a whole foodie village to shop in.

When it’s warm outside (and even when it’s not) there is no shortage of quirky film events, but Picnic Cinema – run by the arts organisation and charity Eden Arts, in Penrith, Cumbria – pulls out all the stops. You can dress up, bring your own picnic (the clue is in the title), and even sleep over. With music, dancing and surprise entertainment, amid spectacular scenic views, you may even forget you’re there to watch a film.

Not that you’ll have much time to sit with your head in a book at Hay festival Wales, where Margaret Atwood leads a stellar line up of about 800 inspirational, thought-provoking discussions and panels. She’ll speak on The Handmaid’s Tale and beyond, while Philip Pullman, joined by Marina Warner and folklore academic Jack Zipes, promise tales of wonder, magic, and hope.

Here, she explains how her palate has developed, and the importance of smell in getting the most out of a tastingIt was while I was working as a model in my 20s that I discovered a real love of wine, and realised how important the nose is in my ability to taste. But I certainly wouldn’t have guessed that wine would become my passion and career. Before that, if I’m honest, wine was not a big part of my life at all. Growing up, my parents would buy the odd cheap bottle if someone was coming for dinner but it’s not like they collected it or took us to vineyards in the summer holidays.When I got older, I much preferred wine to beer or spirits, but I was totally unsophisticated and used to drink fortified wine flavoured with herbs, which I don’t remember ever sniffing. I thought I was drinking a cocktail. Now I know it was just a vermouth, which is trendy these days, but at the time it was just sweet and easy to drink. A bit later, I was in a bar with actual grownups and didn’t know what to drink. I asked for a martini, so they got me a real one and I was like: “Woah, that is so strong – that’s not what I remember.”Going to France changed all that. I was about 22 and my career was going well and I was lucky to be able to travel and experience lots of different food and cultures. I remember working in France and being amazed that on shoots they would all stop for lunch. In London, nobody stopped for lunch and you’d be constantly starving and usually freezing cold.But on this one job, for a big store in Paris one November, there was a big budget and I thought: “OK, this is going to be a good lunch.” But then we were working through it and I was wondering what was going on. Then, at about three o’clock, everything stopped. It turned out it was Beaujolais Nouveau Day, when people celebrate the harvest of the new wine. I didn’t know what it was but we sat there for hours eating and drinking and it really felt like I’d found my kindred spirits.By my late 20s I was getting a bit bored of modelling and got into restaurants. I cooked and then got into wine, and then I ended up crafting a freelance career as a consultant sommelier. I also write, and run Wine Car Boot, an occasional independent market for wine tasting and buying. During this stage of my life, smell became so important. When you know nothing about wine, you go to the supermarket and it’s all about the same price and they all say on the labels that they’re really delicious. But it was when I began to engage in taste and smell that I realised I could make better choices.The more you smell, the more you can sense things and the more enjoyment you get out of wine. That allows you to learn more, which spurs you on to wanting to taste more and different things. Even a small amount of engagement in your senses – especially smell – enhances your enjoyment of life generally, and you get more out of everything you do.The whole thing about how to taste wine is really how to smell it. Sure, wine does also affect your mouth – the sweetness on your tongue, the acidity and structure on your gums, and how mouthwatering it is – and you could have the best wine in the world and just swallow it down and still enjoy it. But it’s about maximising that pleasure, like savouring an amazing sandwich rather than just wolfing it down. And if you hold your nose while tasting wine you don’t taste much.When I smell a wine now I’m looking for a hint of what’s there – to start the tasting process. Does it smell fresh or older? What kind of fruits am I getting? Does it smell particularly alcoholic or is it very delicate? What is the grape variety? Non-aromatic wines can be very minerally and refreshing, and more able to take on other flavours. Then the aromatic grapes have a strong perfume, like a good riesling. Sometimes it can be like smelling a perfume rather than grapes.I love the perfumes of grapes like pinot noir and burgundy that are highly fragrant, often with some oak in them. You can get floral and spicy or even leathery notes. Instead of being a single smell there’s a whole load going on. Every time I smell a wine like that I can detect something new.It’s got to the stage now where I can’t really remember what it was like to not smell wine, and when I go back and have the wines I drank 10 or 15 years ago they seem awful. Your palate changes both with experience and age and you become more or less sensitive to certain things. I certainly think I have a bigger perspective on smells now. It isn’t like wine experts go around having this constantly fragrant experience of everything and that we’re hypersensitive. But it does become habitual. Sometimes I find myself almost smelling a glass of water and I’m like: Why am I doing this?Wine has also made me more aware of smells in cooking. I swing between rosemary and sage as my favourite herbs. When I worked in restaurants, I did the wine list for a chef called Stevie Parle. He makes these amazing kind of fried sage leaves, done almost in a tempura batter that you can nearly see through. Crispy-sage crisps almost, with this fragrant, herbal and slightly sweet touch to them. They’re absolutely delicious. I could think of a few wines to pair with them, but I’d have them as a little nibble with a glass of good, cold champagne - and I would smell them and savour every moment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40d5117a268c0ec5178f5d9ed1cc76815fbdcbdc/0_380_5700_3420/master/5700.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0d5584ecbe541e1982f62f47e1709ace","title":"parklife britains green spaces in urban places","story":"Spending time outdoors in nature has a hugely positive effect on our wellbeing, but you don’t have to live in a rural area to experience the benefits. Kevin Rushby shares some of his favourite city parks, heaths, wetlands and gardens The only British city to ever win the European Green Capital award (for 2015), Bristol is an urban park-lover’s paradise. Close to the centre is Castle Park, a garden with ruins that is linked across the river by the elegant Castle footbridge. There’s a good five-mile walk to be had along the river, linking gardens and the docks, including Brandon Hill Park. Climb the 30-metre-tall (105ft) Cabot Tower for a fine city view. Scattered all around the city are some great parks worthy of cycle adventures. To the south there is Victoria Park, presided over by the colourful terraced houses of St Luke’s Crescent. Nearby, a real gem is Arnos Vale Victorian cemetery, 18 hectares (45 acres) of greenery where, with luck, you can spot woodpeckers, deer and even slow worms basking on tombstones.Arriving at Glasgow Central, you might be forgiven for wondering where all the green spaces might be, given the extent to which the city’s formidable architecture dominates. Dotted around, however, are some magnificent spots: a top place to go is Kelvingrove, a park with everything for a day out – cafes (try An Clachan), a brilliant museum, monuments, and fountains (the Stewart is a good meeting point). Heading east, check out the Necropolis, last resting place of Victorian grandees. Southwards, the gem is Pollok country park, a lovely day out, even though the unparalleled Burrell Collection is currently closed (till 2020). In the west are the Botanic Gardens, with their fascinating hothouse collection.Given London property prices, you might reasonably expect the city’s green spaces to shrink, not grow. But there have been recent additions, notably Walthamstow Wetlands, a huge area of lakes with 13 miles of trails just a few minutes’ walk from Tottenham Hale station. There is great birdwatching, fishing, cycling and a decent cafe, the Engine House. Also new are the Woodberry Wetlands, a green space that had existed since 1833, but only opened to the public in 2013. Right beside Finsbury Park, it is a good inner-city birding site: you can spot red kites and even marsh harriers. Not exactly new, but renewed, is Burgess Park off the Old Kent Road in Southwark, which recently had an £8m facelift, introducing a bigger lake, new bridge and play areas. Downriver from Greenwich, there are fascinating brownfield parks.Birmingham has hundreds of parks, many of them vast. Kingfisher country park, for example, runs for 11km along the river Cole, while Cannon Hill Park covers around 100 hectares (250 acres). Within that space you have lakes, tennis, golf, playgrounds, running trails and tearooms – this place really can do a full family day out. If you believe that any great park must be in search of a stately home, then try Aston Park – it has a magnificent Jacobean palace. All the above, however, are dwarfed by Sutton Park, a 970-hectare (2,400-acre) national nature reserve six miles north of the centre, which boasts 22 species of butterfly, plus a few rarities. Look out for the startling Camberwell Beauty – unseen since 1996.Holyrood Park certainly has the size (263 hectares650 acres) and the eye-catching eminence of Arthur’s Seat, but this former royal hunting park also leads through to the less well-known Dr Neil’s Garden, a lovely area created by two local GPs who used caravan holidays in Europe as plant-hunting expeditions. Other off-the-beaten track green spaces in Edinburgh include the Archivists’ Garden, one of several small city gardens tucked away from the busy streets. Also check out Dunbar’s Close, a 17th-century garden, and the roof garden at the National Museum of Scotland. About a mile north from the centre is Inverleith Park, which neighbours the magnificent Royal Botanic Garden.Few cities can boast a green space like Cardiff’s Bute Park, a vast expanse of woodland, grass, trails and playgrounds close to the city centre. Its true magic, however, is that it connects, all along the banks of the river Taff, to several other parks: across the Millennium footbridge check out Sophia Gardens – home to Glamorgan Cricket Club, plus cycle hire, horse-riding centre and cafes – then various meadows, parks and gardens all the way north to the M4. Forest Farm country park is worth a visit: the footpath along the old Glamorganshire canal is rich in birdlife, including kingfishers. Also right in the heart of the city is another, much smaller, green space: the Victorian roof garden on top of the Bute Tower in Cardiff Castle.Green may not be the first colour that pops into your mind when thinking of Liverpool, but the city is blessed with great parks. Stanley Park, a classic Victorian creation, separates the Reds and the Blues – the two football grounds of Anfield and Goodison Park. There’s a good cafe in the Isla Gladstone conservatory, plus fishing lake, playground and a red sandstone wall that inspired the Redwall series of children’s books by Brian Jacques. On the other side of the city, check out Sefton Park and Calderstones. From the latter you could walk the mile to another green space: St Peter’s church, Woolton, scene of arguably the most important musical moment in the 20th century: the first public performance by Lennon and McCartney. Also in this quiet churchyard is the gravestone that inspired the Beatles’ Eleanor Rigby."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/947d9eb8f28cce11b90d05d228d8ab0c9b31c131/0_35_2400_1440/master/2400.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9949149f2791224a8b202a3cb01d7d13","title":"king lear review ian mckellen duke of yorks","story":"Duke of York’s, LondonThe 79-year-old star shines brightest in play’s darkest moments, in what may be his last big Shakespearean role on stageIt would make for a perfect swan song if so. There is a sense of an actor putting the finest last touches to his majestic legacy: in McKellen’s incarnation as the arrogant ruler undone by age, infirmity and filial disobedience. Jonathan Munby’s modern production bears the added weight of being staged in the theatre where McKellen made his West End debut in 1964, as his tweet goes on to say. It transfers from a first run at Chichester festival theatre and, in an attempt to keep the intimacy of that original setting, a false wall has been erected, while a ramp runs through the centre to extend the action into the auditorium and reduce the size of the audience to just over 500. It allows McKellen to play the part with a naturalism that initially seems risky in its illustrious West End context but pays off for its deep melancholic charge.McKellen’s Lear seems half-absent in the opening scene as he invites his daughters’ praise in return for his kingdom, not with imperious demand but with casual entitlement. The staging speaks his power for him – a large union jack spread across the set, guards nodding their deference and an oversized self-portrait that hangs centre stage, painted in the style of Rembrandt’s last portrait and like it, prefiguring Lear’s end with his face already half in shade.This is not the declamatory monarch McKellen played in Trevor Nunn’s 2007 production, tearing off his trousers in the histrionics of the heath scene. It is a quickly broken Lear. His lines are spoken softly, stumbled upon, croaked out or interrupted by tears and occasional capers to show his ignominious decline. McKellen draws out Lear’s signs of dementia – the angry outbursts, the sudden memory blanks – and infuses his performance with such compassion that we feel for this “discarded father” long before his breakdown in the storm.The play is indeterminately modern in its setting: the dress code is that of a 1930s drawing room, though the army’s camouflage fatigues and guns suggest a more contemporary era. The drama happens in wood-panelled rooms and chandeliered dining halls but props fall away after the storm to open up to a barer stage set and a stark white backdrop on Lear’s arrival to Dover.The contemporary setting is a perfect fit for the nihilism at the heart of the play in its obsession with being and nothingness and Shakespeare’s subtle and heretical challenge to the biblical concept of a soul. Lear is both the ancient Celtic king of curses and superstition and the existential antihero, questioning what, if anything, lies at the centre of his being once his worldly titles are stripped away.The lighting is sleek and cinematic: characters are spotlit for an instant before the stage falls to black again, and the mood is set on edge with sudden bursts of thrillerish music. It gives the production its clarity and pace in the first part – a rare achievement for a play of epic proportions, opaque plotlines and anguished depths. The filmic elements remain subtle until Gloucester’s eyes are gouged out. A sexually perverse Regan flicks on the radio and dances with voyeuristic delight as Gloucester is tied to a chair and blinded, channelling the seminal scene of violence from Quentin Tarantino’s Reservoir Dogs. It is a heavy-handed cross-reference, and it works, but it changes the tenor of the play, bringing out the dark comedy that has until now remained under the surface.Kirsty Bushell’s Regan becomes ever more ham as a simpering, hypersexual sadist, while James Corrigan amps up the villainy as Edmund, glinting with malice in conspiratorial soliloquies. Both are entertaining characterisations but have a touch of pantomime. Whatever its inconsistencies and imperfections, this production still dazzles, McKellen shimmering brightest at its dark, tormented heart. At the Duke of York’s until 3 November. The play will be broadcast live on 27 September with National Theatre Live."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/10523de583069141bf6d21db1b10b04f4266ae54/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=39eaff9655d0af6818f8df39d3881b25","title":"amazon profit second quarter 2018 advertising cloud","story":"Amazon posted a record profit of $2.5bn in the second quarter of 2018, thanks to strong performance by the retail giant’s non-retail isions – advertising and cloud-computing, the company announced Thursday,The favorable profit results, which were double analyst expectations, buoyed tech investors a day after weak growth saw Facebook’s market value plunged by $119bn, the single greatest one-day loss in US history. On a conference call with investors, Brian Olsavsky, the company’s chief financial officer, attributed the quarter’s success to accelerating growth in Amazon’s “most profitable areas”, particularly the cloud-computing ision, Amazon Web Services (AWS). Olsavsky also pointed to the company’s advertising products as contributing to gross profit while “growing at a rapid clip”. Amazon’s results reveal the degree to which it has benefited from selling products unrelated to its original e-commerce business. The company drew $1.64bn in operating income off $6.1bn in AWS revenues, compared to $1.83bn in operating income off $32.1bn in North American net sales. Internationally, Amazon had an operating loss of $494m. Olsavsky noted that Amazon had improved margins in Europe and Japan but remains in “a period of investment” abroad, especially in India. Amazon’s results announcement drew attention to the extraordinary breadth of the company’s activities, from its 22 Emmy nominations for Amazon Prime Video original programming to its expansion of Prime benefits to shoppers at Whole Foods Markets. “As Prime members increasingly scan their mobile apps to get discounts, Amazon is collecting more data about consumers’ grocery purchase habits,” said Patricia Orsini, an analyst for eMarketer. “This will help Amazon not only to curate product selection in-store, but it will give them better insights into what online shoppers might buy.”Amazon also touted the success of its bespoke holiday, “Prime Day”, which was hampered this year by a website outage. The company nevertheless managed to sell 100m products on 16 July, making it “Amazon’s biggest global shopping event ever”. Though Amazon’s financial results and forecasts are decidedly more optimistic than Facebook’s were, the company has not entirely evaded the increased political scrutiny currently facing the US’s major technology companies. Earlier on Thursday, the company was hit with criticism from members of Congress over AWS’s sale of facial recognition tools to law enforcement agencies. And both Amazon and Bezos remain a favorite target of Donald Trump, who most recently threatened the company with an antitrust investigation on Monday.

They were originally linked to some Tannoys but I didn’t bring them with me from South Africa.I want to be able to play my CDs and DVDs with the speakers linked up to the TV. I’m not a purist and don’t want to pay top price. If you could point me towards a few alternatives, I can then make the decision what to pay. MaggieThe Rotel RA-810A is a classic stereo amplifier from the late 1980s. I remember it as being well made and having a decent sound. However, it does have a couple of drawbacks.First, like all amplifiers from that era, the RCA phono inputs on the back are designed to work with turntables, CD and cassette tape players. While the RA-810A has phono sockets for AVAux, which you can select from the knob on the front, this input has the same spec as the others. There are no digital or HDMI sockets of the sort you would find on a new AV amplifier.Second, the Rotel RA-810A is somewhat underpowered, delivering just 20 watts per channel. This was quickly corrected in later models such as the RA-820AX and RA-930AX. However, it does mean that you will need speakers that are reasonably efficient, or at least easy to drive.The RCA phono socket problem, mentioned above, means that it may be hard to set up the system you want. Worse, there is no general solution, because it depends on the inputs and outputs on your specific products.If you are lucky, your DVD player will have two phono sockets that you can connect to the AVAux sockets on your Rotel amplifier. Problem solved.Alternatively, your TV set may have phono sockets, or at least some form of analogue sound output, such as a headphone jack. In this case, you can connect the DVD player to the TV set by whatever means – an HDMI or SCART cable – and then take the audio output from the TV.This is not quite problem solved, because you may need to use the TV set’s menu system to turn on the analogue phono sockets and disable the built-in speakers. This should be explained in the manual. In fact, if it’s a good manual, it will explain how to connect your TV to a standard amplifier. (If you can’t find it, most manuals are available online in PDF format.)Otherwise, adding a general purpose DAC is the simplest way to enable an old-style amplifier to work with digital services. I covered this in an answer in 2015: How should I upgrade my old hi-fi in a digital world?Most loudspeakers have a sensitivity rating, expressed in decibels (dB). For example, an 88dB loudspeaker will produce 88dB of sound at a distance of one meter when driven with one watt of power.While 88dB is loud, a loudspeaker needs to handle transient peaks up to about 105dB. Music and movies may include dynamic sounds that are very loud for short periods, such as explosions in a blockbuster such as Independence Day. The problem is that you need twice as much power to make the sound just 3dB louder. Powering an 88dB speaker to 106dB would therefore require 64W, and you only have 20W.Worse, it’s a bad idea to drive amps and speakers flat out: it can lead to distortion, clipping, or even equipment failure. It’s better to do 70mph in a car that can cruise at 140mph than in one that’s hitting its limits at 50mph, and an amplifier that has power in reserve will manage transient peaks better than one that’s pushing the limit.In practical terms, you’d only need half as much power to drive a 91dB loudspeaker, while you’d need twice as much power to drive an 85dB speaker.Lower impedance means louder sounds, so in theory you could buy 4-ohm loudspeakers instead. However, your RA-810A is designed to handle 8-16 ohm speakers, so I don’t recommend that.Of course, life is complicated. The impedance of a loudspeaker can vary between 3 ohms and 24 ohms over different frequency ranges, so you can probably get away with a 6-8 ohm rating.It’s a pity you can’t remember which Tannoy speakers you had, because this would tell us the dB rating, and the level of performance you found acceptable.The drawback is that they are not the best specification for your amplifier. They are 6-ohm speakers with a dB rating of only 86dB, when ideally you want 8 ohms90dB. However, Wharfedale Diamonds are generally easy to drive – it’s one of the reasons they’re popular – and they should work fine, if you don’t push them too hard.There are lots of alternatives, and it would be worth popping into a local hi-fi shop, if you have one. Most cater to people who are spending serious amounts of cash, but I’ve happily bought tons of stuff from Richer Sounds.At the moment, Richer Sounds has Wharfedale Diamond 2020 speakers – which What Hi-fi rates above the old Diamond 9.1 version – for £119, Wharfedale Diamond 9.0’s for £49, and Q Acoustics 3010’s for £99. All three are 86dB speakers. Mission LX2 speakers (£149) raise that very slightly to 87dB, but the Richer Sounds sales staff may have better suggestions.Lots of great-sounding old hi-fi systems are being junked by people switching to smaller but worse-sounding systems that work wirelessly with their smartphones, Spotify and similar digital services. There are lots of old Kef, Spendor, Celestion, Monitor Audio, Tannoy and other speakers around. You might even spot some familiar front grills.The first drawback is that old speakers tend to be big by today’s standards, or – like my beloved 82dB LS35a loudspeakers – hard to drive well. The second is that they may have been abused, or are failing as a natural result of old age. You might be able to find a bargain, particularly if you know a hi-fi buff who is willing to help. But if you are shopping for compact speakers at £49 to £99, it may not be worth the effort.Have you got a question?

With half the vote counted – more than 15 hours after the official result was due – the PTI was projected to win about 120 of the 272 contested seats in the national assembly, leaving it only a few shy of a majority coalition.Early on Thursday morning, Shahbaz Sharif, the leader of the second-placed Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), said his party would “wholly reject” the result. “It is a sheer rigging. The way the people’s mandate has blatantly been insulted, it is intolerable,” Sharif said.Leaders from six major parties alleged that their polling agents – workers who keep an eye on the count – were evicted from ballot-booths by security officials in contravention of electoral rules.Khan said: “I feel that this election has been the fairest in Pakistan’s history. If any party has any doubts, we will open the results of those constituencies up for investigation.”Appearing calm, the 65-year-old promised to improve Pakistan’s governance, widen the tax base and shun the VIP lifestyle of previous rulers. He said he would be “ashamed” to live in the lavish prime minister’s house, and would turn it into an “educational institution”.“His speech will calm people down a bit,” said Asad Liaqat of Harvard University, describing it as Khan’s best in years and in contrast to the “obnoxious victory speech” many would have expected.Although results are not expected to be finalised until late on Thursday evening or early on Friday, the PTI seems likely to make an unprecedented sweep of Pakistan. It stands to control the central government, provincial governments in the crucial province of Punjab and northern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, as well as holding a dominant position in the southern business capital of Karachi.This means the party will find it easier to implement policies across the nation.“His first priority needs to be macroeconomic stability,” said columnist Mosharraf Zaidi, “and addressing the balance of payments crisis that is staring Pakistan in the face.”The election marked only the second time in Pakistan’s 71-year history that one civilian government has handed power to another in the country of 200 million people. There was, however, still widespread concern during the campaign about manipulation by the military, which has directly or indirectly ruled Pakistan for most of its existence. The PML-N, the party of Shahbaz Sharif’s brother, the jailed former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, repeatedly complained that it was being targeted by the security establishment during the campaign. Khan has staunchly denied allegations by PML-N that he is getting help from the military. The army, which also dismisses allegations of meddling, deployed 371,000 soldiers at polling stations across the country, nearly five times more than the last election in 2013. As voting got under way on Wednesday in the south-western city of Quetta, the Balochistan provincial capital, a suicide bomber attacked a crowded polling station, killing 31 people. Balochistan also saw the worst violence during campaigning earlier this month, when a suicide bomber struck a political rally, killing 149 people.While there was no sign of popular protests on Thursday, Sen Mir Hasil Khan Bezinjo, president of the National party, said that “all major political parties who rejected the vote” would hold a press conference on Friday.The EU’s Election Observation Mission will also give its report on the conduct of the poll on Friday. The results from the respected organisation – which also observed the previous vote in 2013 – are likely to impact what the losing parties do next.Shahbaz Sharif has not been heard from since his firebrand speech on Thursday, and one PML-N insider said that he decided at a party meeting later in the day to protest against the vote in parliament and not on the streets, in a move that reduces the chance of prolonged instability.Complaints have also emerged from Pakistan’s independent human rights commission, which issued a statement saying women had not been allowed to vote in some places. In other areas, it said “polling staff appeared to be biased toward a certain party”, but did not name the party. In the days before the election, the rights activist IA Rehman called the campaign the dirtiest in his country’s troubled journey towards sustained democracy.Provisional results put the liberal Pakistan Peoples party (PPP), led by Bilawal Bhutto, the son of assassinated two-time prime minister Benazir Bhutto, in third place, ahead in 42 constituencies.Far-right religious parties did not make any significant gains, to the relief of many Pakistanis, although Aamir Liaquat Hussain, a controversial TV host banned from screens for inciting violence against minorities, won a seat for the PTI in Karachi.Khan’s success in the election is a stunning rise for the charismatic anti-corruption crusader who has spent much of his political career on the fringes of Pakistani politics. On foreign policy, he lamented on Thursday that Indian media had portrayed him as a “Bollywood villain” ahead of the vote, but said that if Pakistan’s warring neighbour took one step towards peace “we would take two”. He also promised stronger relations with Saudi Arabia and China, while coolly demanding a less “one-sided” relationship with the United States, which he came to political prominence for criticising over its drone strikes in 2011.Analysts noted that Khan’s call for open borders and trade with Afghanistan contrasted with the ongoing, military-led construction of a fence along the Durand Line separating the two nations – an early sighting of potential conflict between the army and the man many term their “blue-eyed-boy”."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Fourteen more women take action over cancer screening programme claimsJudge tells claimant that damage to her car could not have been the result of the incidentOPW to decide within weeks whether the planned command centre will go aheadSuggested law would deal with cases where a man wrongfully believed consent was givenNew treatment could \u0026lsquoradically alter\u0026rsquo approach to conditionJohn Paul McCloskey did not get treatment he required at Letterkenny General HospitalJury discharged after man asked to be excused from the panelLong-standing member seeking injunction over conduct of vote for national executiveMan accused woman of cheating on him before beating her, while baby slept in next roomOver 100 residents from Edenmore turn out to public meeting in opposition to the BusConnects planNo liability admitted by Sisters of Charity in Linda Kavanagh\u0026rsquos alleged assault by nurseOfficials and hospital representatives had \u0026lsquoacrimonious\u0026rsquo meeting, High Court toldHigh Court had heard incidents extremely serious and had \u0026lsquohorrific consequences\u0026rsquoDraft report expresses serious concern at governance and management issues at labGroup begins to examine actions to address legacy of institutions and ex residentsScientists able directly test theory of general relativity near supermassive black holeCervical smear test woman who developed cancer has one to two years to live, High Court hearsBrian Hanrahan (34) was convicted last year of assaulting Emer Kelly and Aisling KingCatholic Church to become irrelevant unless it changes stance on women, sexuality , says priestAn Bord Plean\u0026aacutela grants permission for scheme between Baldoyle and Portmarnock"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3576428.1532545139!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"block on east west border non negotiable says hammond","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond (second left) meets local MPs and business leaders during his visit to the Magee campus of Ulster University in Derry. Photograph: Niall CarsonPA WirePreventing an “east-west border” between Northern Ireland and Britain is as non-negotiable for the UK in the Brexit talks as avoiding a “North-South” Border is for the EU, Britain’s chancellor of the exchequer has said. During a rare visit to the North, Mr Hammond said he did not agree with Tánaiste Simon Coveney’s view that the British government could not afford a “no deal Brexit”.“I think there is no doubt that Britain would be better off with a deal than without a deal. But I don’t think we are sliding to towards no deal,” he said. Mr Hammond said the recent British White Paper, which sought to reconcile how to avoid borders, was a “constructive move forward” and could be engaged with by both the British and EU.“I very much hope over next few months we are going to see rapid progress towards a shared vision of what the future relationship can look like and of course putting in place the Irish backstop arrangements which are a crucial part of the overall package.”Mr Hammond said he was sure that the long-running row over the possibility of a hard Border was not being “hyped up”. “One of the challenges we have had over the past few months is getting the EU to understand that no east-west border is as non-negotiable a part of this picture as no North-South border is for them,” he told reporters. “The no east-west border is equally non-negotiable from the point of view of British Conservatives and unionists. I certainly would not be prepared to sign up to any solution that involved an east-west border between Northern Ireland and GB.”As a Remainer during the EU referendum debate, he acknowledged there were tensions on Brexit within the Conservatives but did not think that it would lead to the implosion of the party. He said “no one disagrees with the direction of travel, that we are leaving the EU and seeking to get the best deal we can with the EU”. On the restoration of powersharing, he said that during an earlier meeting with financial services executives in Belfast he “sensed frustration and a concern that if the situation were to go on it would exact a toll on inward investment and confidence by foreign firms who are investing here”.He said US chief executives of firms based in the North also told him it was “very difficult to explain to their corporate leaders in the US what it means and how it works to be in a place that has no political governance”.“We have to go forward, we have to get back to the powersharing arrangements that have delivered such progress over past 20 years.”Mr Hammond’s visit to Belfast and Derry raised suspicions among some nationalists that an attempt was being made to deflect attention from the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, which took place in London on Wednesday. The DUP had described the conference as a “talking shop” and some suspected Mr Hammond’s arrival was a sop to the party, which is keeping Theresa May’s government afloat.The chancellor denied this was the case and said he was there to announce £12 million in funding for a Bombardier factory and also to talk to financial services executives and to meet academics at Ulster University in Derry. Mr Hammond said he had invited “a city deal” bid from Derry whereby the local council, university and businesses were given the chance to submit plans to the British government on their priorities for economic growth in the region. The British government already is investing more than £1.6 billion in city deals in Scotland and Wales and is in negotiations for a Belfast city deal."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3577461.1532643917!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit talks are almost out of time but is an extension possible","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA placard outside the Houses of Parliament.

If, that is, all the member states agree to such an extension.All this talk in Brussels and London of time running out, of insuperable obstacles like the Irish backstop, and the real possibility of a “no-deal” Brexit has given currency to the idea of an extension.The Taoiseach and Tánaiste have both suggested in recent days that they would be open to the idea, although London has preferred instead to talk of accelerating or invigorating the talks, as if a reluctant Brussels is responsible for negotiations foot-dragging. Ha!Many Brexiteers now say privately, however, that almost any concession by London on the Withdrawal Agreement (WA) – not including a border in the Irish Sea – should be contemplated just to get the UK out of the EU on March 31st. Freedom! So the idea of extending UK membership is likely to be politically toxic in the Tory party.It would certainly be portrayed as the first step in betraying the Brexit cause, an incremental remain.Another way of circumventing the backstop roadblock, London would say, would be to kick discussions on it out of the WA framework and into the transition period when the UK will have left the EU but talks on the shape of a future relationship will be getting under way. The Border issue, they have always argued, is more easily resolved in the context of an overall settlement of that relationship.But seductive as that transition option might be – it was apparently advocated by a Polish minister last week – it remains completely unacceptable to the Irish and EU negotiators. It might appear simply to be another version of the article 50 extension breathing space for talks, but in truth it is a horse of an entirely different colour.Removing the backstop issue from the WA, which has to be ratified by the member states and the European Parliament, would be necessary for the issue to be kicked forward to transition.That would represent both a formal repudiation of a key element of the joint accord reached in December between the EU task force and the UK, and, just as importantly, a dangerous backsliding on a previously agreed policy that would inevitably call into question all agreed outcomes in the talks.The corollary of the principle that “nothing is agreed until everything is agreed” is that the process can also not involve endless renegotiation of settled matters.Crucially, the separation of the backstop issue from the WA would remove important leverage on the EU side, fatally undermining its ability to safeguard the special position of Northern Ireland. The UK needs a WA to have any prospect of an orderly Brexit and the vital transition. That means it must now, not later, face up to hard choices – notably some controls on the Irish Sea – or lose everything in a painful no-deal, no-transition exit.That much was again made abundantly clear to the Poles at the ministerial meeting last week when, once again, many member states rallied round the Irish. It is believed that they would not, however, stand in the way of an article 50 extension.That, however politically unpalatable in London, would simply allow more time for the WA to be agreed, undermining none of the previously made undertakings. And none of the hard choices for the UK.For the time being, however, London is not asking. Two months of unproductive summer discussions, with an October summit deal in doubt, may well bring a different perspective.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspDeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

The men\u0027s team always flies in first or business class.Amid a social media outcry, Barcelona FC’s spokesman, Josep Vives, said it regretted the controversy around the issue but insisted it was not of the club’s own making. Photos posted to the female players\u0026#39 Instagram accounts showed their team flying in economyMr Vifes insisted the club’s commitment to women’s sports should be “valued” and that it was working hard for equality and to make the women’s side a “top-level team around Europe”. “We believe that generating a controversy for an issue like this is trying to attack us, he added.Alexia Putellas, a striker for the women’s team, also defended the club. She told El Mundo Deportivo that the decision to add the female side had come after travel arrangements had already been made. The club had made an effort to organise everything at practically the last minute,” Putellas said.But BarcaWomen, a popular fan account on Twitter, questioned why the first class seating could not have been shared between the most senior players on each side. It said that many of the male players were from the B-team - with top players resting following the World Cup - while the women’s side was fielding its best talent. “I will always advocate that a senior professional player - who has given 14 years to the club, many of them without being paid, wearing the badge with pride and honour, and defending the club of herhis life - has more seniority within a club than a newly bought-in B team player,” BarcaWomen explained in one tweet.Writing in the Spanish magazine Sport, Carme Barceló said she believed the controversy was “disproportionate”. However she criticised the club’s decision to release a misleading photo of the captains supposedly travelling in the same class, saying it instead should have “admitted its slip”. The two teams trained together at facilities in Portland before they were due to move on to Los Angeles on Friday.The men’s side is playing in the International Champion’s Cup and will face Tottenham Hotspur on Saturday. The women’s team, which this year reached the quarter final of the UEFA Champion’s League in a record performance, are playing friendlies against teams from the US Women’s Premier Soccer LeaguePlease review our commenting policyThree people arrested after \u0026#39shots fired at police\u0026#39 in east LondonHundreds of migrant children still not returned to parents amid warnings they are disappearing into \u0026#39black hole\u0026#39Scroll free September: NHS endorses mental health campaign to get children to give up social media for one monthOfficers restore order after inmates \u0026#39riot\u0026#39 at Lowdham Grange PrisonUK blood moon: How to view the longest total lunar eclipse so far this century tomorrowEurotunnel cancels thousands of tickets as UK prepares for \u0026#39Furnace Friday\u0026#39Arson linked to deaths in Greek town built like \u0026#39fire trap\u0026#39Lunar eclipse: How stargazers will be able to see Mars, Jupiter and the International Space Station tooHandmaid\u0026#39s Tale: Joseph Fiennes refused to film rape scene and had it removed from scriptComment: Education is not enough – our youngsters must go out and get summer jobsHorizon: Spina Bifida \u0026amp Me, review: a humbling film that offered hope for the futureTeenagers should take more summer jobs to prepare them for the workplace, says ministerMichelle Williams marries musician Phil Elverum in secret New York ceremonyComment: No, I didn\u0026#39t plot a coup in a small African country.

For students, they are killers of motivation. “A student given an unconditional offer can hardly be expected to work as hard as they would have for the second part of their a-level course. Even the best school may struggle to motivate that young person, or even get them to come to school.”The number of unconditional offers given to BBB students has soaredFigures from Ucas, the university admissions service, have revealed that almost one in four students - some 24 per cent - who were predicted to get three Bs were given at least one unconditional offer in 2017.This figure is far higher than that for top students, which stood at 4.6 per cent for those predicted to get three A*s. In 2010, just 0.9 per cent of students who were predicted to get three Bs were given at least one unconditional offer, but this has soared by 23.1 percentage points in seven years. Dr Stephen continued: “Unconditional offers can sometimes put a student at a disadvantage: if a young person has not mastered the demands of a-level, they may not be able to cope with what is expected at university. “They can be seriously damaging to a student who is unsuited either to the course or university itself, as the dropout rate suggests.”This was the fate of one student, Eden Scott. Miss Scott was predicted AAB but dropped one grade to ABB in her final examinations, a result she feels was down to her unconditional offer.The 20-year-old from London said: “I got an unconditional offer to study American and Canadian studies at Birmingham University but that 100 per cent made me stop trying as hard as I should have. “I didn’t even want to study there that much but I just went with the unconditional offer and ended up settling when I really wasn’t that bothered. “I think unconditional offers aren’t a good idea - I know that if I didn’t have one I would have got better grades and probably gone to a university I really wanted to. “Instead I settled for Birmingham and ended up having to pay £9,000 in fees after I dropped out at the start of my second year.”She added that such offers “encourage laziness” and meant “some students aren’t reaching their full potential.”Dr Stephen also raised concerns over the value of degrees which were handing out unconditional offers to their students. Media, technologies and arts courses give out a lot of unconditionalsHe said: “How impressed are employers going to be by a course that you do not have to work for to get into or reach any standard, but which you get into simply by filling in an application form?“The plain truth is that we have too many universities and we need to bring back the Polytechnics. “Nobody – students, schools, the economy – wins from the disgrace of unconditional offers, and a degree so easy to get into is likely to be as valuable as a shady Diploma bought off the internet  – except the latter won’t cost the student, and society, £50,000.”Yesterday the Office for Students confirmed that whilst it would not be appropriate to ban conditional offers they will be looking to ensure the admissions process remains “fair and reliable” and would taken action if necessary. Three people arrested after \u0026#39shots fired at police\u0026#39 in east LondonHundreds of migrant children still not returned to parents amid warnings they are disappearing into \u0026#39black hole\u0026#39Scroll free September: NHS endorses mental health campaign to get children to give up social media for one monthOfficers restore order after inmates \u0026#39riot\u0026#39 at Lowdham Grange PrisonUK blood moon: How to view the longest total lunar eclipse so far this century tomorrowEurotunnel cancels thousands of tickets as UK prepares for \u0026#39Furnace Friday\u0026#39Arson linked to deaths in Greek town built like \u0026#39fire trap\u0026#39Lunar eclipse: How stargazers will be able to see Mars, Jupiter and the International Space Station tooHandmaid\u0026#39s Tale: Joseph Fiennes refused to film rape scene and had it removed from scriptComment: Education is not enough – our youngsters must go out and get summer jobsHorizon: Spina Bifida \u0026amp Me, review: a humbling film that offered hope for the futureTeenagers should take more summer jobs to prepare them for the workplace, says ministerMichelle Williams marries musician Phil Elverum in secret New York ceremonyComment: No, I didn\u0026#39t plot a coup in a small African country.

Since then, areas like\u0026nbspPeckham and Frome\u0026nbsphave taken the message on as their ownClick to followThe Independent OnlineFrom Bristol to LA: The anti-gentrification posters sweeping through our citiesLast summer, stickers and posters began to appear on the walls of Bristol. In a gnomic parody of Trump’s “Make America Great Again“ they read “Make Bristol Shit Again”, and were plastered over the city’s gentrifying high-tide areas, such as Stokes Croft and St Pauls.\u0026nbspThe city talked. Vice magazine did a piece about it, and MBSA went viral as both an exemplar of the city’s mordant humour and a plea against gentrification.“My hometown is becoming an extension of London, and losing its crappy edge,” wrote Vice’s Angus Harrison in a bittersweet excoriation of Bristol’s new-found glossiness.\u0026nbspMBSA might have been a one-off valedictory howl, but in an act of synchronicity, other “Shit Again” activity arrived.In Peckham, the southeast London district previously known for being the location of Only Fools and Horses and latterly for being a hipster hotspot, a “Make Peckham Shit Again” landed\u0026nbspin March, as did a Twitter account called “Make Frome Shit Again” along with a few MFSA hashtags of the same vintage.\u0026nbsp(In an odd circularity, much of Only Fools and Horses, although set in\u0026nbspPeckham, was actually filmed in Bristol.)\u0026nbspBristolStreetWearUK)Then, this spring an international brigade of “Shit Again” warriors\u0026nbspin Los Angeles in the form of “Make Venice Shit Again” (Venice the hippyish LA district, to be clear, not the Birmingham of Italy).Such was its clout that Hollywood actor Josh Brolin sported a MVSA baseball cap, part of a local atmosphere so heightened that a recent LA Weekly story found cause to lament that in Venice, “You’ll sooner find a $200 (£150) wool poncho than a $12 pair of flip-flops.”\u0026nbspSo the “Shit Again” tag somehow hit the mark, both as a lament to the new and deracinated world of overpriced and socially exclusive development, and as a great merchandise idea in its own right. So there’s a MBSA hat, T-shirt and even “laptop skins”, while MVSA baseball caps retail at $30 and MPSA baseball caps a snip at a tenner.\u0026nbspAs Tumbleweed Parker puts it (not his real name) his Make Peckham Shit Again hats were a response to Trump’s MAGA cap as well as a way to protest the gentrification of Peckham, which has deep roots but has gathered pace in the last five years as a domino in what you might call the “de-shitting” of London.“Before Trump I’d been thinking about doing some merchandise to kick back against all the happy-clappy local pride movements that seemed to spring up after the London riots in 2011,” says Parker.Peckham-based rockers Fat White Family (centre) wears a ‘Make Peckham Shit Again’ cap with siblings Sasha and Vida Adamczewski (Morbid Books)“It’s delusional to think London’s the best place in the world when its homegrown youth are so desperate to burn it down, and Sadiq Khan’s idiotic marketing of London is used to sell it off to developers.”Moreover, he adds, “people can’t afford to live in this so-called paradise”. So in its own way, the hats and T-shirts are a kind of Situationist protest or, as he puts it, “a barricade against the unhelpful narrative that Peckham is, was, or ever could be a great place for property speculators. I think it’s important that we say, it’s actually not that great.”So is this ‘Shit Again’ activity really a hankering for the days of shuttered high streets without good coffee: a kind of “Fings Ain’t What They Used to Be” for disgruntled millennials? Possibly: the creator\u0026nbspof Make Bristol Shit Again, Bristolstreetwear, bears the legend “Say no to sourdough” on its website, and certainly, there’s a sense of loss about gentrification’s march through the neighbourhoods: the sticky-carpet pubs turning into homes, the chain stores pushing out independents, and £3-a-cup flat whites and avocado-on-spelt ousting the chipped mug of tea and sausage sarnie.Frome\u0026nbspis known for its independent shops and cobbled street\u0026nbsp(Shutterstock)The protestors are also needled by endless proclamations of arrival, such as Frome’s topping the charts as a good place to move, and Bristol winning The Sunday Times’ “best place to live in the UK” gong: the kind of boosterism that gives some locals the impression their towns are forgotten backwaters just itching to be discovered.It’s rattled further by development that piggybacks on existing “bohemian” infrastructure, such as Stokes Croft in Bristol, where the loss of artist-occupied warehouses and office blocks like Hamilton House have sparked long battles.Yet perhaps there’s something else afoot too: a nostalgie de la boue for the old townscape of sticky boozers and crap shops where people supposedly felt a sense of belonging.The term “gentrification” was minted in 1964 by British sociologist Ruth Glass with reference to Islington, then attracting the middle classes into areas full of multi-occupied late Georgian and early Victorian houses, where they set about losing the net curtains and exposing the floorboards, hence the contemporary jibe, “stripped pine-eers”. Indeed, today’s neo-gentrifiers still like their decoration “raw”, although these days it’s more about bare bricks, old shops and and cocktails in jam jars. And there has long been a missionary-like flavour about the process, whereby gentrifiers comes into an unreconstructed urban district, “discover” it anew and turn it into a mirror of their own taste.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWoodage  Twitter)But the idea of what gentrification constitutes has shifted, says Loretta Lees, a professor of human geography at the University of Leicester and author of several books on the matter, including Planetary Gentrification. “I’ve noticed that anti-gentrification has become more performative in the last two to three years,” says Lees. “The traditional class aspect of it has given way to a more complicated scenario, full of internal conflict, where critics of gentrification are often gentrifiers themselves and where the discussion is more about consumerism more than class.”The 2017 book Gentrifier by John Joe Schlichtman, Jason Patch and Marc Lamont Hill also works this theme with a look at how gentrification\u0026nbspis now commonly used as a means to describe clothing choices, food and art, often centred around the cipher-like figure of the “hipster“ and part of a battle for the authentic soul of a place.Shoreditch (Jamie OsmanTwitter)“Imagined realities and physical realities collide in gentrification,“ they wrote. This aspect became apparent in 2015, when a demonstration against a branch of the Cereal Cafe in London’s Brick Lane bought a sense of pantomime to the debate, while in 2016 Montreal’s local government introduced a by-law that no more than one in six businesses can be a restaurant: a move that has been seen as a way of moderating gentrification.\u0026nbspAlamy)So the new symbols of gentrification – the cortados, chachka shops and themed restaurants – began to seemingly represent a force that was making Bristol want to be shit again, as well as rippling out anxiously to other corners of the country. It’s a phenomenon that Lees says has seen “gentrification move on from key world cities to rural areas, market towns and ‘edge cities’ – places on the margins of urban areas”. One of the key differences between the Ruth Glass era and now is that gentrification has been globalised and also exists in miniature.\u0026nbspTenants’ lives ‘at risk’ after government fails to act on safety rulesDonald Trump has been scared off by a big balloonLondon to get first permanent LGBT+ homeless shelterAs for Frome becoming “shit again”, she says that the actual long-term locals want a post office, a good supermarket and a Peacocks: all things that\u0026nbspmight not be the grails of a “down from London” person’s eye.\u0026nbspThere’s also a streak of self-deprecation that runs through a certain British mentality, as seen in Crap Towns, the 1990s hit, bringing the “declinism” of the 1980s up to date. Then, things could only get worse. And surely gentrification can sometimes be good? Lees draws a moral distinction between the “gentrification that displaces people, and the good regeneration that keeps people in place”, but struggles to think of a good example of the latter.In 2015, research from the US magazine City Lab concluded that gentrifying neighbourhoods don’t actually lose low-income residents at a substantially lower rate than any other neighbourhood. Plus, it should be said, there’s nothing gentrifiers scorn more than other gentrifiers. It’s fun to have a pop.\u0026nbspPerhaps “shit again” means affordable housing and a regaining of convivial civic life, or perhaps it’s an aesthetic of urban decline. Whatever, a “shit again” cap is the perfect self-abnegating gift for an uncertain age. “It seems to be resonating with a lot of people who feel alienated by the discourse of positivity around urban redevelopment, which is most people I know,” says Parker. “Even the local estate agent ordered one. I hope he wears it when he hangs himself.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

They help Ates organise weekly prayers, give tours to school groups and hold seminars on democracy, love and the concept of an open, tolerant interpretation of Islam and a forgiving God.Religious groups join together for interfaith collaborationHere\u0027s a reminder of what Donald Trump said about Muslims in the past When is Eid al-Fitr and how do Muslim people celebrate it?During Eid, it\u0027s important to reflect on Islam in BritainThree years after a wave of more than 1 million, mostly Muslim, migrants arrived in Germany seeking asylum, culture wars over religious identity and the possible threat posed by Islam have led to a rise in nationalist, populist movements.The government of Chancellor Angela Merkel was nearly brought down this week over a dispute with the Bavarian sister of her conservative party, which sought to turn back refugees at the border.The Bavarian conservatives of the Christian Social Union joined the far-right party Alternative for Germany in promoting a narrative that refugees pose a threat, after several highly publicised killings and sexual assaults in the country led to charges against Muslim migrants.The party ordered that crosses be displayed in all public buildings in the state, and Merkel’s new interior minister, Horst Seehofer – also a Bavarian – declared: “Islam is not a part of Germany.”Against the backdrop of these debates, Ates sees the survival of the Ibn Rushd-Goethe Mosque, which recently celebrated its first anniversary, as proof that Muslims living in Germany need and are open to an interpretation of Islam that reflects the values of the Western society in which they live.Tombs in the centre of Tarung village serve as handy laundry driers on a sunny Sumba morning.Each tomb in Waihola village (near Nihiwatu) represents massive expense in terms of ritual sacrifices for local families who observe the ancestral Marapu religionCatholic imagery on a tomb in Waihola village (near Nihiwatu) shows how imported religions seem often to have blended almost seamlessly with the ancient Marapu religion.In an effort to minimise economic strain the law stipulates that only 5 buffalo can be sacrificed at funerals - in reality many more are often killed and a big buffalo with a wide horn spread will often fetch close to $4,000.A royal tomb in Pasunga village is flanked by the smaller tombs where servants were buried (sometimes buried alive!) alongside their master.Village dogs - currently s but, more than likely, part of some future feast - on tombs in Pasunga village.A horse - another part of Sumba\u0027s ancestral warrior heritage - grazes among the tombs in Pasunga village.A more humble modern style tomb stands next to the kings burial place in Galu Bakul, Anakalang.A village dog relaxes on a tomb in Prai Ijing village.While still considered sacred the tombs very quickly become part of normal village life.

The Arabs will never allow it,\u0027” she said. Instead, hundreds of people from across Germany, Europe and abroad have visited or attended services.Those most committed to its survival have made donations, some as much as €500, Ates said, emphasising that the mosque receives no public funding.“Even atheists come here and appreciate this place, as a spiritual place, a place of peace,” she said recently, standing barefoot on the pale carpet of the mosque. “I had hoped, but never dreamed, that so many atheists would be interested. That was a positive surprise.”The criticism and rejection, in its fierceness and intensity, less so. Even before the mosque opened, her personal Facebook page and that of the mosque were flooded with derogatory messages and even some death threats.“May Allah put you on the right path, or destroy you,” someone writing under the name Xalo Bero said, in one of the friendlier remarks.Protection provided by the police and paid for by the city government, in place since she published the book Islam Needs a Sexual Revolution\u0026nbspin 2009, was increased to a personal security detail after the heightened threats on her life.Days after the mosque opened, Dar al-Ifta, an influential arm of the Egyptian Justice Ministry that issues religious verdicts, denounced the mosque and declared that allowing men and women to pray alongside one another violated Islamic law.Turkish news outlets reported that the mosque was a terrorist organisation with links to the Islamist cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom Turkey blames for a coup attempt in 2016 against President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.Despite a video message in which Ates states that the “the Rushd-Goethe mosque has nothing to do with the Gulen movement”, the rumours have persisted.She blames them for the fact that few Turks have joined the congregants, although they make up the vast majority of the estimated 4.5 million Muslims living in Germany.Despite the demands of running the mosque, she takes Arabic classes and continues to work as a lawyer. She considers achieving a degree in Islamic theology important to her recognition in the Muslim community.“I want to understand the words and know the meanings so no one can say, ‘She’s just a lawyer,\u0027” she said.Born in Istanbul to a Turkish mother and a Kurdish father, she emigrated with her parents to what was then West Berlin in the late 1960s, part of the first large wave of Muslim immigrants who came to fill the blue-collar jobs needed to rebuild the German economy after World War II.Ates was 6 when she and her four siblings moved into a one-room apartment with their parents.As she learned German and excelled in school, Ates says, she came to understand that it was not the crowded living conditions that she found suffocating, but the realisation that because of her gender, she was not afforded the freedoms of her non-Muslim peers.“I was a girl,” she wrote in 2007 in Zeit Online. “I embodied the family’s honour, and my hymen – for a long time I didn’t even know what that was – was more important to the whole family than my brain.”At 17, she fled her home, graduated from high school and started studying law at the Free University of Berlin. To support herself, she worked as a counsellor in a women’s centre.In September 1984, she was speaking with a client when a man wearing a trench coat entered the centre, pulled out a pistol and fired three shots. One hit the client in the stomach, killing her the other struck Ates.She survived to see the suspect, a Turkish bricklayer, acquitted for lack of evidence, which enraged her. For years, she struggled with the psychological fallout of the attack.Violent clashes leave ’86 dead’ in NigeriaFrench far-right group arrested over alleged plot to attack MuslimsShe returned to her faith, but was again alienated by Berlin’s traditional, conservative mosques, where women were forced to pray behind a curtain. She decided that if the faith community that she needed did not exist, she would create it.It took years of planning, fundraising and looking for a suitable space. While she received support from like-minded liberal Muslims from Switzerland to the US, the critics have remained.What keeps her going is the encouragement, not only from social media postings, but also from the visitors who go out of their way to find a place of worship that previously existed only in their dreams.​Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

She won the Brit Critics’ Choice Award in January this year.\u0026nbspArguably one of the more surprising appearances is Lily Allen earning her first ever Mercury Prize nod for her anticipated fourth studio album No Shame, which The Independent hailed as a “return to form” following the lukewarm reception to her previous record Sheezus.\u0026nbsp“She’s managed to move with the times but still hold onto a sound that defines her as an artist, rather than attempting to emulate anyone else… that freshness is enabled by the fact that she still, after all this time, has the finger on the pulse of modern music,” The Independent review said.\u0026nbspKing Krule (singer-songwriter Archy Marshall) received his first Mercury Prize nomination for third album The Ooz, which made The Independent’s Albums of the Year 2017 list.

More than one in five detainees are held for at least two months.In the Commons on Tuesday, Mr Javid told MPs he wanted a detention policy “based on not only what works to tackle illegal migration, but what is humane for those who are detained” and promised that he would “further consider the issue of time limits on immigration detention”.His announcement followed the publication of a second review of the UK’s immigration detention system by former prisons and probation ombudsman Stephan Shaw, which found people were being locked in “unacceptable” conditions, often for “deeply troubling” lengths of time.While there has been a drop in the overall detainee population, the number of people held in removal centres for more than six months has increased. The Home Office’s strategy of expanding capacity by adding extra beds into existing rooms had “exacerbated overcrowding, and created unacceptable conditions”, the review found.In response to the findings, Mr Javid said it confirmed the government was on the “right track” in improving detention, but conceded that there were also areas where ministers “could and should do better”.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

It should be your #Finalsay.”Theresa May\u0026nbsphas urged voters not to worry about\u0026nbspBrexit, despite her government setting out plans to stockpile food, blood and medicine in case it goes badly.She said people should take “reassurance and comfort” from news of the plans, to be implemented if the UK crashes out of the EU without an agreement in March next year.It came after health secretary Matt Hancock admitted he had already met with industry leaders\u0026nbspto discuss building up NHS reserves\u0026nbspof vaccinations, medical devices, clinical consumables and blood products if Britain crashes out of the EU without a deal.Dominic Raab, the new Brexit secretary, also recently\u0026nbspconfirmed preparations were being made to stockpile food, as ministers ramp up planning in case the negotiations fail.Mr Blair follows a string of other politicians baking the Independent’s campaign, including ex-attorney general\u0026nbspDominic Grieve\u0026nbspwho said another referendum is “the sensible way forward”, Labour’s Chuka Umunna, Lib Dem MP Layla Moran, ex Labour spinner Alistair Campbell and Gina Miller.The push was launched with\u0026nbspa major editorial\u0026nbspon Tuesday night which set out why a Final Say is needed for the British people.33m+ people voted in the EU referendum wanting a better country, not to be poorer, not to put further pressure on our already stretched health service, not for job losses or to stockpile food and medicines.It read: “The British people decided to pursue our course in the referendum of 2016, so as we now look for a decision on whether we will like the deal agreed with the EU (assuming there is one), it is natural that those same people should have the final say.“Indeed, given the magnitude of the decision, it would be essential for the British people to be given that final right of approval, even if cabinet and parliament were providing the leadership we need, which they are not.”The most recent polling shows that amid the chaos of the Brexit process, the largest number of people in the UK would prefer to simply remain in the EU, if forced to choose between staying or going.The survey undertaken by BMG Research asked some 1,500 people in a balanced cross-section of the public: “should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union, or leave the European Union?”Some 49 per cent said “remain”, while 43 per cent said “leave”, 7 per cent said they did not know and 1 per cent refused to answer.When those who did not give a clear answer the first time were asked which way they are “leaning towards most”, a total of 51 per cent said “remain”, and 45 per cent said “leave”, while 5 per cent still said they did not know or refused to answer.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Michel Barnier does not represent only the Commission. He is the negotiator for the European Union,” she said.“He gets his mandate and his guidelines from the heads of state and government. And we have discussed it regularly at the level of ministers. We meet with Michel Barnier on a regular basis.\u0026nbsp“So do the heads of state and government.

None of this is easy to doClick to followThe Independent OnlineThe new Pakistani prime minister has vowed to help the 25 million children in educationAfter more than two decades of political campaigning, much of it spent in the political wilderness, Imran Khan will finally become Prime Minister of Pakistan. Along the way, as his ex-wife Jemima Khan\u0026nbspnoted on Twitter, he endured “humiliations, hurdles and sacrifices”. Now, the former cricket legend and philanthropist could become one of the most powerful civilian leaders the country has known.Older readers will of course be familiar with him. After playing cricket for Oxford while he studied politics, philosophy and economics at Keble College, Imran became one of the best known Pakistanis in Britain. He figured prominently in tabloids for his social life, was often spotted at exclusive private members clubs like Annabel’s and Tramp.\u0026nbspHe\u0026nbspbefriended Mick Jagger, Sting and Goldie Hawn while being on nodding terms with Prince Charles and other royals. He married Jemima Goldsmith, the journalist and filmmaker sister of Zac, and invited Princess Diana to Pakistan.For Pakistanis, Khan was one of the few people who did them proud. Winning the Cricket World Cup in 1992 was a rare moment when Pakistan distinguished itself internationally. Pakistanis had grown weary of being principally depicted as a Third World basket case beset by social problems where women, minorities and the poor were treated appallingly. At times when boorish and condescending English cricketers like Ian Botham described Pakistan as “a place to send your mother-in-law”, Khan confronted that racism publicly.Pakistanis craved a confident, good-looking spokesman and the former cricketer could play the part. It’s one of the reasons why many voted for him.“I believe Oxford educated Imran Khan can stand toe to toe with world leaders and make a strong case for Pakistan,” wrote Haroon, a Pakistani singer and one of many celebrities, including cricketers, singers and actors who backed him.\u0026nbspBut he was also supported by a bewildering array of people from religious conservative backgrounds, wealthy businessmen, grafters from the middle classes, taxi drivers and factory workers.Khan is many things to many people. Central to his appeal is that he has not been in power before. It was common to hear his supporters say: “We’ve tried the others”,\u0026nbspreferring to the parties of former prime ministers Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif, “let’s try him this time”.\u0026nbspFor people alarmed at endemic levels of corruption, Khan represents a rare, honest and financially “clean” leader valiantly battling against an entrenched venal order. For religious conservatives and nationalists, he soothes feelings of injured pride and rouses their spirits.There are people whose support he should be embarrassed by. Sara Taseer, a Singapore-based entrepreneur, declared herself appalled by the sight of poor Baluch women lining up to vote. “Love seeing this turnout of women,” she tweeted, “but then I think would I allow these ladies to make a decision even about what be cooking in my kitchen today? And these ladies will decide on the future of the nation. Scary thought.”And there are supporters he should stay clear of. Asad Umar, Imran Khan’s finance minister to be, posted photos of himself courting the support of Fazlur Rehman Khalil, someone whose name is on a US\u0026nbspterror watchlist.Khan’s rhetoric is often studded with references to the plight of the poor and the ravages of the elite. “A country shouldn’t be measured by how its wealthiest live,” he said in his first speech after the election, “but by how its poorest people are treated.” Critics say that message is at odds with the composition of his party, which is dominated by some of the wealthiest people in Pakistani politics. Many of Khan’s candidates this time around were also drawn from conventional old parties or military regimes, undermining the claim that their election will herald a “new Pakistan”.There are contradictions people notice in Imran’s own pronouncements. When I interviewed him for The Independent, he came across as thoughtful, polite, serious and even good-humoured. On the campaign trail, however, he was seen as boastful and arrogant – making crude jibes against his opponents, taunting voters who support his rivals as “donkeys”, and denouncing liberals as “bloodthirsty”. He has forcefully denounced terrorism, and yet has been accused of being soft on the Taliban. Khan was a critic of Pakistan’s blasphemy laws and has defended religious minorities, but more recently vowed to protect the laws and accused his opponents of being part of a foreign plot to undermine it.When I first came to Pakistan to report for The Independent, Imran was a fierce critic of General Pervez Musharraf’s military rule. I saw him on the streets supporting an independent judiciary, interviewed him the night before he was arrested for defying emergency rule, heard him speak out against attacks on the press, enforced disappearances, civilian casualties in military offensives, and covered his protests against CIA drone strikes. Those experiences do not easily reconcile with the image of him as a mere shill for the Pakistan army.As prime minister, Khan will want to be the most powerful leader in the country. That distinction has usually belonged to the head of the army, which has ruled the country directly for three decades and wielded its clout backstage for the rest. It will be interesting to see how he negotiates these structural tensions. Some of the areas of dispute between Khan and the army have faded: drone strikes are rare, military operations he opposed are a thing of the past, and the US-led, Pakistan-backed “war on terror” is all but over.So, how will Khan rule? As a crusader against corruption and champion of the poor, or as an angry demagogue? Will he strengthen Pakistan’s feeble civilian institutions or disappear into the shadows of the military? Can he unite all the different Pakistanis he appealed to this afternoon, or will he seek to deepen the dangerous political isions that this election has revealed? Will Pakistan pursue peace with its neighbours, or will old modes of chest-beating belligerence endure?Only time will tell. The speech he made this afternoon pleasantly surprised many: he vowed to lift the country out of poverty to combat corruption – starting by hold himself and his own cabinet accountable he said he would educate the more than 25 million children out of school and he said he would protect the rights of minorities and women. None of this is easy to do. There are strong reasons to believe Khan won’t be able to. But it would be good to see him try.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

He said he would pursue strong relations with\u0026nbspChina as well as vowing to try to develop relations with the US based on our mutual benefit.

The Muslim League stands firm on its message of\u0026nbsp\u0027vote ko azat do\u0027 (respect the vote).Mr Khan addressed those concerns in his speech, saying: I feel that this election has been the fairest in Pakistan\u0027s history.The electoral commission\u0026nbspchief had earlier dismissed any claims of rigging, saying the slow count was down to a failure in the electronic\u0026nbspsystem, and Mr Khan pointed out the body was created by two major political parties, the PML-N and the PPP - the parties which came second and third in Wednesday\u0027s vote, respectively.If you think there has been rigging, we will assist you in the investigation if you have any doubts, Mr Khan said. If any party has any doubts, we will open the results of those constituencies up for investigation.The country will be plunged into a crisis situation if the commission cannot convince all parties the election was fair, warned Ahmad Bilal Mehboob, president of the leading think-tank the Pakistan Institute of Legislative Development and Transparency (PILDAT).He said the fact that all Pakistan\u0027s five other main political parties were united against\u0026nbspPTI\u0026nbspcould cause political turmoil. Led by the incumbent PML-N\u0026nbspparty of jailed Mr Sharif, they have all\u0026nbspagreed to stand together to oppose the result, all with\u0026nbspthe same criticisms that the count was unacceptably delayed and their agents at polling stations were not allowed to verify many of the results.But before even half the votes were counted, Mr Khan\u0027s leading rival Shahbaz Sharif, who heads the PML-N\u0026nbspwith his brother in jail -\u0026nbsprejected the vote, generating fears that the losers could delay the formation of the next government. Television projections give his party about 61 seats.Shahbaz Sharif said that our democratic process has been pushed back by decades, adding that had the public mandate been delivered in a fair manner, we would have accepted it happily.Complaints have also emerged from the independent Human Rights Commission, which issued a statement saying that in some places women were not allowed to vote.Khan leads as bloodshed and \u0027foul play\u0027 taint historic Pakistan voteFears for worst \u0027no matter who wins\u0027 after brutal Pakistan campaignHere\u0027s what we can expect of Pakistan\u0027s likely new leader, Imran KhanPakistan prepares for elections amid concerns over bulk voting In other areas, it said polling staff appeared to be biased toward a certain party, without naming the party.In the days before Wednesday\u0027s election, leading rights activist IA Rehman called the campaign the dirtiest in his country\u0027s troubled journey towards sustained democracy. If Mr Khan can form a government, it will be the first time Pakistan has ever managed a second successive democratic transition of power.Regardless, Mr Khan\u0027s message of a new Pakistan does appear to have resonated with young voters in a country where 64 per cent\u0026nbspof its 200 million people are below the age of 30.Outlining his plans on Thursday evening, in what was his first public speech since the campaign trail, Mr Khan fleshed out his vision for what a new country would look like.He said he would beat corruption in the form of tax avoidance by letting people see that their taxes are being spent on them.\u0026nbspI pledge to our people that I will introduce a system that is for the masses - all policies will be for the people, he said.Mr Khan vowed not to move into the official prime ministerial residence, saying it would be converted into an educational institution or something of the sort. I would be ashamed to live in such a large house, he said.And despite the vitriolic nature of his comments towards India on the campaign trail, he struck a conciliatory tone, saying that if we want to fight against poverty then we and India have to develop trade ties. He said that he was the Pakistani who knows the Indian people more than anyone. In his previous incarnation as a playboy celebrity, Mr Khan has dated a number of Bollywood stars.\u0026nbspCelebrations that really began on Wednesday night among Khan supporters are now expected to be injected with new vigour, and a number of parties were planned at local PTI\u0026nbspoffices across the country for Thursday night.\u0026nbspRevellers danced to the sound of beating drums draped in Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf\u0027s black and green-coloured flags - excited by the prospect of the political change they voted for.\u0026nbspEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

EU wants to FORCE the UK into Brexit CRISISIt includes eliminating tariffs and quotas between members, including on agricultural products, and mutual recognition of each other\u0027s regulations and rules on cross-border investment.Joining is seen as a swifter and more effective alternative to forging separate deals with inidual nations and both Australian and Japanese representatives have indicated the UK would be welcome.But in an essay for the centre right Policy Exchange think tank, Australian former ambassador to the World Trade Organisation Geoff Raby warned Mrs May\u0027s deal, hammered out with ministers at Chequers and formalised in a white paper, would limit the UK\u0027s ability to take part.By aligning UK policy to EU policy on agriculture and manufactured goods, the white paper will constrain the opportunities that the UK has to pursue an independent trade policy, he wrote.Mrs May had expressed an interest in participating for services, he said, but: Without being able to participate fully in the agricultural and manufactured goods dimension it is most unlikely that the UK would able to join, but if it did it would not be able to get the full benefits of the CPTPP.Policy Exchange chairman Alexander Downer, the former Australian high commissioner to the UK, said The UK, with its modern services-based economy, would be a welcome addition to the CPTPP.Joining the CPTPP would give the UK unfettered access to many markets that represent a large part of the future of the world\u0027s economy.But it was a problem if the UK tried to exclude part of its economy from such a deal: The Chequers Agreement shows a desire for the UK to remain closely tied to the EU for manufactured and agricultural goods.The Prime Minister gathered her cabinet together ahead of a crunch Brexit showdown at her country retreat at Chequers in Buckinghamshire                    PA1 of 14Members of the cabinet and government officials gather at ChequersIn essence it says you want to be free to sell the things you\u0027re good at and protect less competitive areas of your economy.As the Policy Exchange paper highlights, the process of ratification has been difficult for some - Japan, for example, experienced heavy resistance from its agriculture sector.Having fought such battles to secure the comprehensive nature of CPTPP, it is unlikely that the UK will be accepted without meeting the same obligations.Essay co-author Warwick Lightfoot, a former special adviser to Tory Chancellors Nigel Lawson, John Major and Norman Lamont, said: Leaving the political relationship with the EU should not result in a more closed outlook on the world.Instead the UK should focus on the opportunities in the wider world if we adopt a more free trading approach which exposes our domestic market to greater competition and challenge."},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/139/590x/994919_1.jpg","title":"Labour peer calls Government review free diabetes patch","story":"                Diabetes type 1: Drink this to help maintain blood sugar levels                Diabetics need a better deal than this from NHS - EXPRESS COMMENT\u0026ldquoHis mother and father are paying \u0026pound1,400 a year for it.

The man claimed he had been sexually assaulted by Sir Cliff during an event featuring evangelist Billy Graham at Sheffield United\u0026rsquos Bramall Lane stadium in 1985, when he was a child. politan Police officers passed the allegation to South Yorkshire Police in July 2014.

The spread of social media and other online communication, with its inherent anonymity, has only increased the misery for victims.But the speed of change has not been matched by a more robust framework to deal with it.Yes, we have tougher sentences — the Government was absolutely right to last year double jail terms for the worst cases from five to ten years.But progress has been too slow in recognising these crimes.In 2016-17, fewer than 1,000 prosecutions were commenced under stalking legislation.It was horrifying to read the account of Nicola Roberts from Girls Aloud yesterday.She told how she faced a barrage of more than 3,000 texts over five years from an ex-boyfriend, including threats to stab and burn her.Soon after being handed a lifetime restraining order, her ex began following her on Instagram.He “wanted me to know he was still watching me”, she said, chillingly.And yet the CPS saw no realistic chance of a successful prosecution for stalking because the social media activity was not taken sufficiently seriously, despite the obvious impact on Nicola’s life.As she put it: “I should be able to move on from an unhealthy relationship if I want and that’s not been able to happen.”She wants change — and she is right to.These kinds of messages leave you in fear for your life — feeling that someone is watching or following you is immensely distressing.A bunch of flowers is not a romantic gesture when sent by a stalker but a reminder that your persecutor is still watching and can still reach you.Stalking is a crime of obsession and fixation and it needs to be stopped before it becomes deeply ingrained.No legislation will be effective unless it is accompanied by training at the front line of policing and across the wider courts system.Victims must have the confidence to come forward at an earlier stage, for all forms of stalking to be recognised for what they are. It is my intention to make this happen.My Stalking Protection Bill will introduce so-called Stalking Protection Orders (SPOs) to help fill some of the gaps in the law.It will allow the police to act more quickly and to protect victims of so-called stranger stalking, where the stalker is not a former partner.Importantly, it will also take the onus off the victim to have to take action, as is currently the case for stranger stalking. At present many victims are left unprotected because they have to put protective measures in place for themselves, such as applying for a civil injunction to restrain someone from harassing them.Needless to say, many victims find this such a daunting task — not to mention expensive and time-consuming — that they end up not going through with it.If passed, the Stalking Protection Bill would allow the police to apply for an SPO through the magistrates’ courts on behalf of victims.Orders will require the civil standard of proof “on the balance of probabilities” but breach of an order would be a criminal offence, punishable in the most serious cases by a term of up to five years in prison.SPOs could set out requirements prohibiting certain behaviours, such as contacting the victim either directly or indirectly.It would be able to prohibit behaviours such as driving past the victim’s house, harassing friends, colleagues or family members, going within a certain distance of the victim or following them online.It could also set out so called positive requirements, such as attending a psychiatric assessment.In this digital age, the law would cover online contact from abroad and require that any IT equipment would be free from encryption, so perpetrators could not cover their tracks.Unlike the now-abandoned Police Information Notices, SPOs will have teeth, as they would be enforceable and breaching the terms of an order would have consequences.SPOs would also require stalkers to register all the names they use, as well as their address.While SPOs will provide better early intervention to protect victims, they are not intended to replace full prosecution for an offence of stalking.They will, however, enable police to better protect the safety of victims while gathering the full evidence for the CPS to prosecute a full stalking case.The Bill has almost completed its Commons journey but will not now return to the Chamber until late November.When the case for change is so pressing, and the Bill is backed by members across the House, I believe the Government should bring forward the final Commons stage so we can get on with delivering this vital change to the law — which will help to save lives.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Genteel Norfolk a hotbed of sex?And lo and behold, two days after this revelation, a survey by our sister paper The Sun on Sunday revealed that the nookie capital of Britain is…drum roll…Norfolk.So quite what they’re putting in the water up there is anyone’s guess.But something tells me house prices are suddenly set to rise.Charlie, 45, told his brother Matthew on the phone: “I’d really like to go out for a bottle of wine.

The 27 EU states, or most of them at any rate, might individually want good relations with us.But, in Brussels, there are plenty of officials who would rather see all sides suffer than watch Brexit succeed.If their view prevails, the implications go well beyond Brexit. For 70 years, Britain has been a European power.Although we kept our military ties with the other English-speaking democracies, our focus was the defence of Europe. It still is.There are, for example, British soldiers patrolling the borders of Poland and Estonia.The RAF is, to all intents and purposes, acting as Romania’s air force, responding to incursions into that country’s airspace. And so on.In intelligence and security, rather as with the Common Fisheries Policy, Britain puts a lot more than its share into the common pot.We have done so cheerfully because we saw European states as our allies, and felt that we had a stake in their security. But what if that feeling is no longer reciprocated?Visiting Germany on Monday, Jeremy Hunt, the Foreign Secretary, pointed out in measured and polite language that the EU could not expect to treat Britain aggressively without consequences.Now Mr Hunt is no Little Englander. He is an entrepreneur who made his money from language courses, is married to a Chinese woman and, after some soul-searching, came down on the side of Remain.But what he said is impossible to argue with. If the EU chooses to treat Brexit as a hostile act, the basis of European security will be undone — at the very moment that Donald Trump has made it clear that America is no longer interested in defending Europe.In almost every European speech since the referendum, Theresa May has said that she wants Britain to be the EU’s closest friend and strongest ally.But when have you ever heard those good wishes returned?The PM keeps saying she wants the EU 27 to succeed. EU leaders keep saying they want Brexit to fail.They mean it. Eurocrats are not offering Britain the kind of deal that they have with neighbours such as Norway and Switzerland.They think UK will just swallow what’s offered.If we want to remain in the single market, says chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier, then, unlike those countries, we’d have to give Brussels 100 per cent control of our trade policy — an impossible condition.But neither are they offering the kind of simple free trade deal that they have with, say, Canada and Japan.If we want a straightforward trade deal, Barnier says, we’d have to leave Northern Ireland under EU rules — an equally impossible condition.In other words, Britain won’t be allowed the friendly relations with the EU that other democracies take for granted.It is not for a lack of willingness on our side. In February, Theresa May told a Munich audience: “Europe’s security is our security. And that is why I say that the United Kingdom is unconditionally committed to maintaining it.”The EU’s response? To exclude us from the Galileo satellite programme on grounds that we could no longer be trusted.Well, fine. I never saw much point in the Galileo system, which was pushed by French leader Jacques Chirac to challenge the “technological imperialism” of America’s GPS system.Britain should now either go in with the Americans or create its own satellite system, possibly with friendly states such as Australia and Canada.But the point is, the EU’s logic goes well beyond satellites.If Brussels no longer sees us as an ally, we can hardly carry on behaving like one unilaterally, so to speak.While we talk of trade and co-operation, EU negotiators talk of border queues and grounded flights.Ireland’s prime minister, Leo Varadkar, even threatens to close his airspace.If such thinking wins out, we shall have no choice but to leave Europe to itself and turn our faces, as our ancestors did, to the open seas.That is not an outcome anyone should want, but we shall be ready if it comes.Understandably enough, you might say, given what feeble negotiators we have been so far. But Britain has a bad habit of switching from vague amiability to sudden resolve when it is almost too late.Such a moment is upon us.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

OK, later you might find a hash brown stuck halfway up your bottom, but it’s worth it, just for the pleasantly cool sensation.It’s been a lovely summer, the best that I can remember since 1976. That summer was the happiest time of my life. But this hasn’t been bad, has it?But there are downsides to the driest and warmest spell we’ve had for years.Public transport isn’t always much fun, especially if you’re crunched up on the Tube next to a large bearded lady who last washed when hula hoops were all the rage.If you live in the country, there are mosquitoes — I’ve got bites in ­places I ­forgot existed.Work can be a bit of a chore. And if you’re a smoker, the pub gardens are suddenly full of tossers who waft their hands around if the smoke goes anywhere near them.Where were you when it was snowing, huh? I was there, lighting my Superking in a blizzard, while you were tucked away inside.But the hot weather is very good for us.There’s a link between clear, sunny days and good health — mental as well as physical.People feel better about themselves and tend to spend more money, which is good for the economy.OK, crime rates tend to increase when the weather is hot — more precisely, when the temperature ­hovers between 28C and 32C, according to psychologists.But on the whole, this summer — a proper summer, at last — is something to be enjoyed, cherished and remembered. We don’t have them very often.We can admire the women walking around with not many clothes on and laugh at the men dressed in toddler shorts with beer bellies hanging down to their knees.We can relax with a beer and forget about bloody Brexit for a while.The authorities think of nice summers as altogether something very different.For them, nice summers are a crisis.That’s why those tiresome drongos at the Met Office put out an amber alert when the temperature rose this week.“Don’t go out! Stay in your homes! Or you will die — DIE, I tell you.”Oh, with the greatest respect — f*** off!We’ll go out when and where we please, thank you, so you can stuff your advice where the sun isn’t shining.And, of course, the climate change ­monkeys are in full voice.“This is it! The end of the world! Look at the incredible temperatures and those wildfires in poor Greece. We told you!”Give it a rest. I think there is something to global warming. I am not a denier. But I remember the last few ­summers we’ve had — rainy and cool — and the climate change monkeys saying THAT was a consequence of global ­warming, too. You can’t have it both ways.And there have been wildfires in hot, dry areas for the past 100,000 years.So enjoy this wonderful heatwave while you can. Because someday, quite soon, it will be gone and the rain and the cold will be back, and the Christmas adverts will start appearing in supermarkets.And this summer will just be ­something you talk about in years to come. Remember the summer of 2018? Wasn’t it brilliant? If only we could have it again.Carlos Delacruz was in court in Scotland accused of having sex with two women with something other than a penis.The lasses THOUGHT it was his todger. But then, the lights were off.And the sad truth is that Mr Delacruz does not have a penis. Not even a small one.The women complained the sex was painful. So what was it, then?It was referred to in court as an “unknown object”.Here are my guesses:Incidentally, the prosecuting lawyer was called Ms Cockburn.No kidding, love.NO sooner has the World Cup finished than the domestic football season is about to begin.And with it the endless round of transfer speculation.If you’re still wondering why England didn’t win the World Cup, check out how many top foreign teams are trying to buy our players.None. None whatsoever.All the sides we played against in the final stages had players at Juventus, Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich etc.That’s because they are very good players.But none of the top European clubs wants Harry or Dele or Raheem.We are a lot further behind than many people think.LABOUR MP and fervent Brexiteer Kate Hoey received the following email from a man called Robert Crangle.“I have never written to an MP before. I just want to say that you are a f***ing disgrace for helping to keep the Tories in power. I hope you die soon.”Lefty Remainers are a lovely bunch, aren’t they?IS it actually the law that all pop musicians must end up skagged out of their heads and taken to hospital?And then, if they survive, check into some poncey rehab clinic and tell their fans they are “fighting my demons”.And then come out of rehab and get skagged out of their heads again.The latest is Demi Lovato.I must admit I’m not a huge fan, but still.First time we knew anything was amiss was when she forgot the lyrics to one of her songs. The track was called Sober.So let’s wish her a speedy recovery from whatever foul substance laid her low.And remind pop singers that nobody looks cool in a pine box.THE Palestinian Authority has just revealed that at least half of the money it receives in aid goes to funding vile acts of terrorism against Israel. One Hamas bomber even pocketed £100,000.Please, think carefully and do your homework before giving money to charities working in Palestine.The British Government has already stopped aid to the Palestinian Authority. It’s time these Islamist thugs had the plug pulled on their slush fund from naive Westerners.LATEST news from the front line of scientific research on . . . crows.Apparently these birds are fond of a bit of necrophilia.Experts Dr John Marzluff and Kaeli Swift professed themselves “surprised” to seeing crows trying to have sexual intercourse with dead members of their species.The pair put this down to confusion caused by hormonal imbalance.I am not so sure. I have watched crows. And I can tell you that if I were forced to have sex with them I would much prefer it if they were dead.They would make that awful cawing noise if they were alive, and probably try to peck at your bits.Crows, I think, feel the same way.JUST a short word of congratulations to Jeremy Corbyn’s favourite country, Venezuela.The socialist paradise will soon experience an inflation rate of ONE MILLION PER CENT. That’s a pretty astonishing achievement.Most addled old Marxist dictators manage to keep inflation down to the low thousands.Meanwhile, Venezuela’s people are starving and every so often murdered or arrested by the foul Corbynista government.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is a vital precaution we should have begun two years ago.Leavers do not fear it, despite the panic Remainers are now deliberately stoking.Nor is it a bluff. It simply looks more likely every day. Especially on days when Irish politicians are wheeled on to pressurise us to shift even further towards Brussels’ fixed position.We have compromised far too much already. The EU must now cross some red lines. Why not? No country has left before. The situation is unprecedented. The EU’s response must be too.Ireland will be hit hard if no deal is struck.It should be pleading with Brussels. It can see Theresa May has no ­further room for manoeuvre without her Government imploding.And no, Mr Coveney, Britain doesn’t need “more time”.We need the EU to finally accept we aren’t changing our minds — unlike ­Ireland over the Lisbon Treaty and despite the Remainer clamour to do so.That way lies permanent servitude, global humiliation and political chaos.HOW can anyone guarantee a convicted paedophile or rapist is safe enough to be taken off the sex offenders’ register?The number of criminals winning that right since a law change six years ago is 1,230, including 632 child abusers.They no longer report to police or tell them if they are away from home.Even some put on the database “for life” can apply after 15 years to be removed. A thriving legal industry helps them do it.Decisions are simply at cops’ discretion. But how stringent are their tests when approval rates vary so wildly?We know “life” sentences in prison mean nothing.

Our policies will be developed for the poor and for the workers.Vowing to bring peace to Afghanistan, Mr Khan added: Accountability to start from me. We will set an example in terms of law and order. Improved governance system, investment and law and order to be our priorities, he vowed.I am ashamed of living inside Prime Ministers House, it is made out of corrupted money. We will use all of Governors Houses for public use. Pakistans leaders would no longer live off the tax of the common people.We will try to bring peace to Afghanistan. We want open borders between Pakistan and Afghanistan.Although Pakistans election commission has not yet released official, he is expected to fall short of an overall majority, and may have to seek coalition partners.Khans message of a new Pakistan resonated with young voters in a country where 64 per cent of its 200 million people are below the age of 30, a United Nations report claimed.When 47 per cent of the votes were counted on Wednesday night, Mr Khans followers began to celebrate in the streets and his ex-wife hailed his victory on Twitter.Jemima - who married the famed ladies man in 1995 - said on Twitter: 22 years later, after humiliations, hurdles and sacrifices, my sons’ father is Pakistan’s next PM.It’s an incredible lesson in tenacity, belief \u0026amp refusal to accept defeat.The challenge now is to remember why he entered politics in the 1st place. Congratulations @ImranKhanPTI.The next Prime Minister is set to face a crumbling economy and violence after an ISIS fanatic blew himself up outside a polling station in Quetta yesterday as dozens cast their vote.Earlier this month another ISIS suicide bomber struck a political rally, killing 149 people including PM candidate Siraj Raisani.Most of the election night revellers were young men, who danced to the sound of beating drums draped in Tehreek-e-Insaf party black and green-coloured flags.Mr Khans Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) party was leading in 113 of the 272 National Assembly constituencies after votes were counted in 47 per cent of stations.Khans leading rival Shahbaz Sharif - who heads the Pakistan Muslim League, the party of jailed ex-prime minister Nawaz Sharif - has already rejected the vote.But officials have denied claims of vote rigging.Khans party spokesman, Fawad Chaudhry, tweeted: Congratulations to the nation on a new Pakistan! Prime Minister Imran Khan, although his party has officially held off on declaring victory.Mr Khan himself has denied allegations that he is getting help from the military which has ruled Pakistan for almost half of its history.The army has also denied allegations of meddling in the election.Imran Khan is a cricket star-turned politician who is a leading contender in Pakistans election.Described as a quiet and shy boy in his youth Mr Khan attended the Royal Grammar School, Worcester, before completing his formal schooling with an undergraduate degree in economics from Keble College, Oxford.He was Pakistans cricket captain when the national squad won the World Cup in 1992.But after marrying Jemima in 1995, he moved into politics, founding his Tehreek-e-Insaf, the Movement for Justice party.The pairs romance generated shockwaves as he was a strict Muslim, and she was 20 years his junior.Jemima, daughter of the late Jewish financier Sir James Goldsmith, converted to Islam when she married Mr Khan, who was dubbed crickets greatest playboy in the 1980s and 1990s and was a favourite with women.The couple divorced in 2004.Mr Khans passion for politics was spurred by his renewed commitment to Islam.A profile on his party website says: As a politician, his vision is to turn Pakistan into a just society, based on humane values.[He aims to create] an independent and honest judiciary that will uphold democracy, protect human rights and ensure the rule of law.Mr Khan also hopes to provide equal opportunity for upward social mobility to the working classes.This election will mark the second transfer of power from one civilian to another in Pakistans 71-year history.The country was been under military rule on and off for a total of 33 years.Since obtaining independence in 1947, all of 29 of Pakistans Prime Ministers failed to complete a full term, with four only lasting for one day.They were booted out of office for a variety of reasons including military coups and assassination.Election campaigns were plagued for months by allegations the powerful armed forces have been trying to tilt the race in Khans favour.Military officials had fallen out with the outgoing ruling party of Shehbaz Sharif, who was jailed on corruption charges this month.Pakistans military have been accused of interefering in the election results.Around 371,000 soldiers were stationed at polling stations across the country on Wednseday, nearly five times the number deployed at the last election in 2013.Mr Khans rivals Benazir Bhutto who leads the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and Sharif who leads the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) party, have reported of election rigging.The PML-N and the PPP both said they recieved hand-written tallies of election counts that officials could not verify, as monitors in many voting centres had not received the official notifications.PPP Senator Sherry Rehman said:  This whole election could be null and void, and we dont want this.Mr Shehbaz told a conference on election day: It is a sheer rigging. The way the peoples mandate has blatantly been insulted, it is intolerable."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000422975501-e1532610204208.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"theresa may offered brexit lifeline by angela merkel who insists eu leaders give pm one last chance to sell chequers plan to them","story":"Amid mounting fears of stalemate a meeting in Salzburg in September is being lined up to give her “one last chance” to sell the proposals in her white paper to the other 27 nations.All negotiations are supposed to go through the European Commission’s lead man Michel Barnier, who has expressed concern Mrs May’s current position cannot lead to a deal.The Times is reporting that the German Chancellor Ms Merkel is frustrated the talks are not leading to a breakthrough, and is taking matters into her own hands.She is said to have suggested they use the summit scheduled in Austria for the PM to hold direct talks to avert a no-deal Brexit.A government source told the paper it could be “Britain’s last chance” to sell a compromise to the other EU leaders – who will have the final say on whether a deal can be done.Donald Tusk, president of the European Council, will now have to decide whether to let negotiations on Brexit onto the agenda of the Salzburg gathering on September 20.The shift in focus comes as the new Brexit Secretary is in Brussels hold a joint press conference with Mr Barnier.Dominic Raab promised to bring as much energy as I can ahead of the crunch talks as he tries to shift focus away from the escalating preparations for exiting without a deal.Yesterday Mrs May the British public should take reassurance and comfort from Government plans to stockpile food and medicines for after we leave.Today she told farmers at the Royal Welsh Show Brexit offers agriculture a real opportunity for the future.While meeting key industry stakeholders at Europes largest summertime agricultural show, the Tory leader set out the Governments plans for farming policy once we exit the bloc.She was given a tour of the showcase, which attracts 250,000 visitors a year with 7,000 livestock on show, in Llanelwedd, Powys.The PM was invited to hang the Best in Harness rosette on shire horse Mr Tumble, shown by Barrie Yeates, remarking that the seven-year-old giant looked too big to tumble.After being shown sheep-shearing, a prize bull, and a foal named Fairywood Thumbelina, Mrs May met farmers to discuss Brexit.Addressing the meeting, she said: It seems to me that what we have when we come out of the Common Agricultural Policy is an opportunity to determine what is going to be right for the United Kingdom, rather than being part of policy developed for a number of countries within the EU.”She added: Leaving the EU presents us with a unique opportunity to transform our food, farming and environmental policies so we can have a healthy and prosperous agricultural industry that is fit for the future, and helps us to leave the environment in a better place than we found it.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

livestock","story":"Freezers and fridges have failed at supermarkets all over the country, as the UK swelters in record breaking heat.The first half of summer is already the driest on record with record temperatures today sent tumbling as the mercury soared to 35C.But while Brits have rushed to parks and beaches to make the most of the heat, the high temperatures have triggered a nightmare combination of conditions for farmers.Following the driest first half of summer on record, farming leaders warned crops are being hit and livestock are having to be fed with feed that should be held for winter as grasslands are parched.Ian Wright, director general of the Food and Drink Federation, told BBC Radio: We’re going through the most extraordinary summer and we’re already seeing farmers struggling with crops, with feed for ruminants [cattle and sheep].There are vegetable shortages because there hasn’t been enough rain.Already, carrot growers have warned shoppers could see a shortage at the supermarket due to the hot and dry conditions.The Chairman of the British Carrot Growers Association Roger Hobson told The Grocerthat it is inevitable that shoppers will see a price hike later this year thanks to the warm weather.Shoppers could also see a shortage in onions due to the weather. And it could get even hotter, with a sizzling 37C forecast for Friday - creeping closest to the UKs all-time heat record of 38.5C.Todays hot conditions saw Europe the hottest country in Europe.But a short relief is in sight, with the Met Office predicting torrential downpours, accompanied by hail and strong gusts on Friday afternoon and into the evening.The yellow weather warning will cover the south east of England, as well as northern and eastern parts of the country.The hot weather has also sparked warnings for a high air pollution alert to be issued for London.Mayor Sadiq Khan said: This is the second time in six months that we have had to use the high alert system and shows just why air pollution is a public health crisis.Children, the elderly and people with lung or heart problems have been advised to reduce strenuous exercise and physical exertion.Meanwhile, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has been urged to set out what measures he is taking to make sure the NHS can cope with the heatwave.Shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth said hospitals are facing year-round pressures, saying the traditional lull in NHS activity during the quieter summer months is a thing of the past.Blood supplies have dropped, health officials have said, saying some people have been too dehydrated to donate while others have chosen to stay in the sun.MPs have warned heat-related deaths will treble by mid-century unless the Government takes action to tackle the dangers of soaring summer temperatures."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000000833387.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"man allergic sun","story":"Though he was initially sent home from hospital with a supposed infection, shockingly it later transpired that he was allergic to the sun.This rare condition is known as Xeroderma Pigmentosum and only 100 people in the UK have been diagnosed with it. It causes skin to blister and burn if it is exposed to the slightest amount of UV light.Understandably getting on with daily routines had been a real struggle for Alex, 25.Every inch of his skin had to be covered to stop it from burning. To protect his face his mum, Anna, designed and made a thick visor from plastic that hung from a hat and covered his face – but it was incredibly hot and distorted his vision.As part of a new TV experiment airing tonight, Inventing the Impossible: The Big Life, three people with various medical conditions hope to have their world transformed by a group of inventors. Alex, who also has neurological complications which have led to hearing loss and learning difficulties says: I wish I could be like everyone else but I cant help not being that.Design engineer Zoe Laughlin was challenged with to come up with a better solution to Alexs large and clunky homemade visor.But because Alex is 10,000 times more sensitive to UV damage than a normal person - so much so that even on gloomy days, he can’t go out unprotected - the requirements were extensive.He has to check the lights in every room with a special UV protection device wherever he goes.Anna says: “While a normal person’s DNA repairs at a rate of 98 per cent, his repairs at just 3 per cent. So if I was to get cancer at 60, he’d be likely to get it at three.“The doctors told us we’d have to live by night and sleep by day. So for the first few years we lived with the curtains closed.“I’d sit inside every day and cry with him. And the rest of the world went on outside.“But doctors said he might die at three and I wanted to show him as much of the world as I could. I wasn’t prepared to lock him away.Using a UV testing meter and a UV light, the engineers set to work to test different materials to see what might work as a base material for a mask to protect Alexs skin.Glass, snorkel masks and plastic all proved too weak and let UV rays through - which would cause Alex to burn.It turns out that Zoes moment of inspiration occurred while on a spa break.After trying a peel-off mask, the lead engineer tracked down a prosthetics company to see if they could make a UV protecting mask - like that used in Ninteties hit film Mrs Doubtfire.The idea was that it would be a second skin, which Alex could put on whenever he wants to leave the house.The mask was made by taking a scan of the persons face using a flashing light camera that takes thousands and thousands of pictures per seconds. The code of these photos is then sent to a computer and a 3D mask is created in the right proportions for the customers face.She finds a special kind of silicone that has 100 per cent UV protection.Dubious at first, Alex agrees to let Zoe and the other engineers go ahead and make the mask for him and undergoes a 3D body scan. It creates a lifelike 3D model of him which is then printed and cast back in the workshop.Using a bed of polymer powder, they print an exact model of Alex that will form the basis of the mask. A mould is then filled with the silicone.The mask took more than 300 painstaking hours to create - but once it is ready, Zoe takes the finished piece - complete with artificial stubble and hair - to Alex.Clearly unsure and shocked, the 25-year-old agrees to try it on, admitting hes blown away by the similarity between his face and the masks.Anna says: Im so glad they tried something that hasnt been done before. I just didnt think that you could do it. Theres a lot of work gone into it.Trying it on, Alex is speechless.Its so much more comfortable, he finally says, walking round in the mask of his own face.Without hesitating, Alex takes his first steps outside in his new mask.His mum, clearly emotional, say: Ive never seen Alex like this in my life.Alex hasnt been out like this, in broad daylight, at midday, ever, Anna says. Its a whole new world of potential."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000422867088.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"lucky passenger gets a 168 seat boeing to himself for flight home from corfu","story":"Cabin crew attempted a synchronised safety demonstration and took selfies with Saad Jilani on his way home from a wedding on 21 July.The 28-year-old got a pick of 168 seats on the brand new Boeing 738 on the Jet2Airways 2am service to Birmingham.In one video Saad captured himself boarding the plane to be greeted by four members of cabin crew who were waiting for him outside the jet after he was taken by car from the gate to the plane.They welcomed him, saying: “Welcome aboard your private jet sir”.He also took snaps of him at the controls of the plane, grinning in the cockpit with the pilot on the two and a half hour flight.Another video shows the cabin crew attempt to give him a personal synchronised safety demonstration, showing the empty seats behind them.They pouted together to show off the empty seats and red lighting in the brand new plane.Saad didn’t have to worry about leg room as he stretched out at the front of the plane and avoided screeching infants which left him able to snooze comfortably.He said: “The staff was amazing and very excited that I was the only person on the plane with them.“Even though it was just me and them they were professional but we did have a laugh and a joke and it was brilliant.“I had been at a friend’s wedding in Greece, and I think there was meant to be one other person booked on my flight.“It’s a new route that they are doing so not a lot of people would have known about it yet.“When I was at the airport the members of staff came up to me and told me that I was the only person booked onto the flight.“I was really excited and I got the full private jet experience. The staff were young and laughing and joking with me.“We took photographs together and they basically let me have the run of the plane it was amazing.“There was food and drink if I wanted it, they let me take videos of the experience and sitting in the cockpit was brilliant as well.“Everyone was as excited as me to have only one passenger on the plane and movies and music were played over the PA system for all of us to enjoy.“We were having fun and it was the best flight that I have ever been on!”He added that he had no idea he was the only passenger on the plane until he reached the boarding gate and laughing staff told him he would be flying solo.And to finish off an “amazing” flight, on request the pilot announced ‘the eagle has landed’ upon touching down in the UK.Saad also got a free £60 voucher to use on his next holiday with jet2, after only paying £40 for the initial flight.A Jet2 spokeswoman said: “We were delighted to launch our first ever flight to Corfu from Birmingham on 21st July, which was full of happy holidaymakers.“As it was our first time operating this new route, there were fewer returning holidaymakers which meant that Saad got to experience our VIP customer service in style, on board one of our brand new aircraft.”Last month pals Yvette Francis and Peaches Murray were upgraded to business class when they were the only passengers on a flight to New York and washed down champagne and cocktails for free.In January Beth VerSteeg was the only passenger on a one-hour flight from Rochester, New York, to Washington DC.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Prime Minister’s Chequers proposals suggested a situation where the UK would collect excise duties at the border on the EU’s behalf.  But after a day of negotiations with Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, Brussels chief negotiator Michel Barnier unceremoniously killed the idea.  At a press conference following the day’s negotiations, he said: “The EU cannot and will not delegate its customs policy and rules, VAT and excise duty collections to a non member who would not be subject to the EU’s governance structures. “Any customs arrangements or customs union - and I’ve always said the EU is open to a customs union - must respect this principle. “And in any case, a customs union, which would help to reduce friction at the border, would come with our common policy for goods.”  He added: “The UK wants to take back control of its money, law and borders, and we will respect that, But the EU also wants to keep control of its money, law and borders and the UK should respect that. Mr Barnier said that he wanted to bring new energy into these negotiations over the coming weeks ahead of the EU summit in October at which it is hoped to finalise the Withdrawal Agreement and reach a political declaration on a future relationship. He said that UK proposals on security marked a real step forward and welcomed the acknowledgement in Mrs May\u0027s White Paper that the European Court of Justice is the only arbiter of EU law. He said he was particularly pleased with progress on foreign policy and external security. But he said: In contrast, on our future economic relationship, it comes as no surprise that finding common ground between the EU27 and the UK is more difficult.  Mr Barnier said future market access for financial services would be governed by autonomous decisions on both sides. We recognise the need for this autonomy not only at the time of granting equivalence decisions but also at the time of withdrawing such decisions and we agreed to have close regulatory cooperation, he said. And he said the backstop on the Irish border must be resolved and raised concerns about the UK\u0027s position.

Each of the destitute ‘Blanketeers’ carried a blanket, to show they were textile workers and to sleep in during their wintry journey. They also carried a letter to the Prince Regent. “We will let them see it is not riot and disturbance we want,” the \u0026shyLancashire reformer Samuel \u0026shyDrummond told the crowds. “It is bread we want, and we will apply to our noble Prince as a child would to its Father for bread.” Beaten back by the King’s Dragoon Guards, the Blanketeers were the forerunners of the tens of thousands who gathered at St Peter’s Fields two years later, only to be charged by cavalry. On that hot August day in 1819 – a turning point in Britain’s social history that is the subject of Mike Leigh’s latest film Peterloo – 15 people including a young child died, and up to 700 people were injured.  On Sunday, three artists from Manchester will follow the Blanketeers’ route to London, carrying blankets made by Lauren Sagar, 59, an award-winning artist. For Sagar, and her fellow travellers – Eve Robertson, 41, an actor and director, and John-Paul Brown, 36, a photographer and sculptor – their modern-day march is about the pain of austerity and the way gentrification drives artists and working class people out of cities. “The story of the Blanketeers seems to be fairly unknown, even to people who know about The Peterloo Massacre,” Sagar says. “They were self-employed spinners and weavers facing the loss of their jobs and poor working conditions. They were destitute. “They each carried a small piece of the petition for the Prince Regent, which they planned to put together when they got there. As soon as they set off, they were read the Riot Act and faced violence and intimidation. One man was killed and the story has it that only one man, Abel Cauldwell, made it to London. When I read about it I was inspired by their bravery, walking into the unknown, people who might not have left home before. “They wanted to let people know what was happening and the importance of that story really struck me. Blankets are something we all need, something basic and fundamentally human, and like the original Blanketeers, we’ll carry ones, created by me.” "},{"url":null,"title":"theresa mays holiday plans almost","story":"NewsTheresa May\u0027s holiday plans are almost identical to the break she took last summerIt\u0027s Groundhog May!

Assaults on prison officers are at a record high, more than 15,000 mobile phones were found in England’s jails and drug abuse is rife. One in 10 prisons is now rated “a serious concern.”  If this were not bad enough, the Government is having to spend millions bailing out the privatised probation service.

Politicians passed a motion that terminally ill residents should have the right to end their life, subject to proper safeguards. The islands’ Legislative Assembly also voted to consider changing laws if the UK first did the same. Both motions passed by a majority of four votes to three, with one abstention. Although laws are not changing on the South Atlantic islands, campaigners hope the show of support will lead the way for other areas. The assembly chair will write to the Prime Minister to say if the UK enacts legislation allowing people to end their lives legally, the Falkland Islands would consider following suit.  The news follows a shock defeat on a bill legalising assisted dying in Guernsey. Proposals were rejected by 24 votes to 16 after three days of debate on the Channel island in May. However pro-assisted dying campaigners say the vote acted as ‘driving force for change’ - inspiring motions in the Falklands and ramping up debate in Jersey. Sarah Wootton, chief executive of Dignity in Dying, said: “The Falkland Islands have today been shown to be a compassionate, sensible and progressive society which cares deeply about its terminally ill citizens and rightly feels that they deserve better.” A Mirror poll last month found three out of four Britons would support a change in the law to allow assisted dying.

Evie-Beth Taylor was just five when she flummoxed doctors with chickenpox so bad they initially told her parents it might be a rare genetic disease and not the childhood disease at all. The infection was so severe the little girl was left screaming in pain whenever she was touched making it impossible for mum Lianne Taylor, 33, to clean her airways. So poorly she couldn\u0027t eat, drink or even use the toilet, poor Evie-Beth\u0027s nose became so clogged with \u0027rock hard\u0027 mucus that the little girl struggled to breathe. Lianne called paramedics and her poorly daughter was rushed to A\u0026ampE twice in just two days.  But Lianne claims she was \u0027treated like an over the top parent\u0027 and turned away both times, claiming she was told that she had to wait 10 days for the antibiotics prescribed by her GP to work. Desperate, Lianne took her daughter back to the GP once more who immediately arranged for her to go straight to hospital - where doctors told Lianne she was lucky to have brought her in when she did. After four days in hospital Evie-Beth was finally allowed to return home but it took months for the spots to completely go and has been left with scarring across her face and body. But now a year on, Lianne and Evie-Beth are bravely sharing the shocking images of her ordeal to raise awareness of just how serious chickenpox can be and tell other parents to seek help if concerned. Lianne, from Newton Aycliffe, County Durham, said: It was really traumatic seeing Evie-Beth like this.  She was struggling to breathe because she was so blocked up with mucus that went really hard. We couldn\u0027t get near her to wash her down or clean it away because she was screaming in pain. The spots just kept coming and coming. Even when she was in hospital the doctors were coming in every day and she was coming out with more and more spots. The doctors said they had never seen chickenpox that bad. They had a photographer come in and take photos of her skin because they had never seen a case as bad as hers before. They didn\u0027t know why. Mum-of-two Lianne first noticed a spot on her daughter\u0027s arm on February 4 2017 and thought it could be chickenpox. When the infection broke out in spots all over her body on February 8, her worried mum and dad Stuart Taylor bathed her in a bath with oats and rubbed her with creams and camomile lotions to ease the itch. But their daughter only got worse.  Lianne started sleeping in the same bed as little Evie-Beth so she could wake her up every hour to give her a drink. She was devastated when Evie-Beth only got more and more lethargic and eventually had to be carried and held over the toilet because her spots were too painful for her to even sit. Her GP prescribed her with antibiotics - but when paramedics took Evie-Beth to A and E on Feb 10 they turned her away then and on Feb 11 and told Lianne to wait 10 days for them to take effect. It wasn\u0027t until her GP sent Evie-Beth straight to Darlington Memorial Hospital on February 13 that the little girl was finally admitted. Lianne, who studies history at Teesside University, said: It was absolutely awful. It was really bad. Being sent away from A and E made me feel like I was treated like an over the top parent. It made it feel like it was beyond me and I couldn\u0027t do this. This was beyond the help I could give her. She couldn\u0027t eat or drink, she just lay there. She was crying and moaning and every time she moved she screamed. I was having to sleep next to her every night and not having much sleep myself and having to set an alarm to wake myself up every hour to get some fluids in her throat and give her paracetamol every four hours. It was horrendous. It was a really tough time.  I took her in the car to the doctor\u0027s and it took the GP to see her in pain to phone A and E and get her straight in at Darlington Hospital. They said this is really bad, any later and it would have been a different situation. They took her bloods and put her in isolation. The consultant sat us down and said it might not be chickenpox but could be a very rare genetic disease. They were going to have to transfer her over to Durham hospital where they could test her for it. It was very worrying. We got her across to Durham where consultants came in confirmed it was chicken pox but they didn\u0027t know why it was so bad. She was severely dehydrated. She\u0027d lost loads of weight because she still wasn\u0027t eating, and she would go to the toilet in a bedpan because we couldn\u0027t get her to the toilet. The doctors gave her some antiviral medication on a drip. Eventually, she did have to go on to normal painkillers. They were coming and checking her vitals all the time. I slept in a room with her for those days when she was really bad. The hospital staff were fantastic though and got her a TV and DVD player and toys for her to play with when she was feeling a bit better.

They are already at levels not seen since the 1980s, leaving many people isolated and cut off from towns and cities. And the dire situation could get worse with even more routes under threat as Tory cuts bite deeper into town hall budgets. Public transport campaigners and Mirror readers say people are being left unable to reach their doctors’ surgeries and shops. In the 1960s, thousands of miles of track were scrapped and hundreds of stations closed after a report by British Railways boss Dr Richard Beeching. It could be the same for bus routes. Chris Todd, of the Campaign for Better Transport, said: “We are not talking a loss of that level but we are heading that way.”  The UK bus network has shrunk by 8% in a decade. That equates to 134 million fewer miles, the equivalent of more than 5,000 trips around the equator. Department for Transport figures also paint a grim picture, putting bus routes at a 28-year low with 1.5 billion miles travelled last year. Every day, almost 2.5 million people all over Britain travel to work by bus and a million more use the bus as a vital back-up. But since 2010, the Tories have nearly halved funding in England by \u0026pound182million, fares have gone up by 13% above inflation and 3,347 routes have been axed or reduced.  The Mirror revealed yesterday how mum-of-nine Gemma Headley, 36, of Driffield, East Yorks, has to walk seven miles to get her two young daughters to infant school because of bus cuts. But many more people are being affected by the savage cuts. Life-long Mirror reader Brian Newbold, 76, of High Ercall, a village near Telford in Shropshire, uses buses to get to Shrewsbury every day. But in September, the Saturday service will be axed. The retired lecturer said getting out on the bus helped him cope with the death of wife Edith in 2001. He added: “Losing the Saturday service might not seem much but it is important to me.” Experts say there is an alternative — investing in bus travel and reaping the benefits as people return to towns and cities to spend their money. Earlier this month, the Mirror revealed analysis for Greener Journeys by auditors KPMG LLP shows that targeted investment to improve bus services would typically generate \u0026pound3.32 of net economic benefit for each \u0026pound1 spent.  Experts say for every \u0026pound1 spent on concessionary travel schemes used by older and disabled people \u0026pound2.87 is generated in benefits. Pass users have easier access to shops and healthcare as well as other services and activities plus visits to family and friends. The report adds: “With more freedom to travel, older people are more able to contribute as volunteers, as mentors, event organisers and fundraisers. They have new opportunities to look after children and to care for others. Free bus passes encourage older people to be more active and they have better health.” By 2037, the number of people in England aged over 60 will grow from 12 million to 18 million and campaigners say this will make the case for concessionary passes even stronger.

The three dresses were created by designer Kate Tabor and took her over three weeks to make, using 20 metres of wetsuit material and 12 litres of foam.  Tabor took inspiration from the structural designs of Alexander McQueen and renowned haute-couturier Iris Van Herpen in creating the lip-smacking gowns.  The Couture creations were commissioned to celebrate the launch of Costa Coffee’s new Whipped Milk, which gives iced coffee drinks like the Iced Flat White and Cold Brew a silky mouth-feel while topping them with an elegant meringue-like appearance.  Kate Tabor, designer said: “Each dress is bespoke from a flirty minidress to an edgy asymmetric design and a classic, full-length bridal number all were inspired by the texture of Whipped Milk and the way it is poured. “I’ve created innovative costumes for everyone from David Bowie to The Chemical Brothers, but I’ve never designed anything as challenging or unique as Costa Coffee’s Whipped Milk Couture.” Designer Kate, who has created awe-inspiring costumes for music videos for the likes of Katy Perry and Kylie Minogue, began the process by sketching designs, then experimenting with delicate foams ahead of crafting robust neoprene shells, which supported the overall structure of the dresses. The painstaking application process took three hours per gown. The Whipped Milk creations mark the reinvention of Costa Coffee’s Iced Flat White and Iced Cappuccino drinks this summer.  The addition of Whipped Milk, an aerated skimmed milk foam topping, also forms the finishing flourish on summer menu items such as refreshing Cold Brew and in Costa Coffee’s new range of Milk Whips. Gennaro Pelliccia, Costa Coffee\u0027s Master of Coffee, added: Whipped Milk is Costa Coffee’s must-have summer drink addition, inviting coffee-lovers to enjoy their favourite hot choices as refreshing chilled drinks, perfect for the scorching weather we’ve been enjoying. “Coffee fans don’t even have to wait for Whipped Milk to make it from the catwalk to the high street, it’s already whipping up a storm in store now!” The Iced Flat White is expertly handcrafted by Costa Coffee\u0027s skilled baristas using the purest extract of the coffee bean.  In the same way the traditional ‘hot Flat White’ that fans know and love is finished with texturised milk so too is the iced version using the chilled Whipped Milk to recreate the luxurious silky texture. Cappuccino drinkers can enjoy the Iced Cappuccino made with either a double or triple extraction of espresso and topped with the delicate chilled milk foam. For a twist on your favourite Costa Cold Brew, try the Cold Brew with Whipped Milk. The meringue-like Whipped Milk floats beautifully on top of the Cold Brew and is a great way to add milk to the drink without diluting the coffee flavour and adding visual and sensorial excitement to the coffee drinking experience.

It is thought to be the first time the pair have locked lips in public since their wedding day in May.  The rare moment happened on stage as the Duchess of Sussex presented Harry\u0027s victorious team with the winning trophy at the Sentebale Polo Cup 2018.  She gave the team captain a kiss on each cheek before turning to her husband for a kiss on the lips. Social media users thought it was an adorable moment, with one saying I love this couple and another commenting love is love very sweet. Meghan also later rubbed Harry\u0027s back as the couple left the polo field, holding hands.  Meghan looked a picture of elegance today as she made a surprise appearance at the fundraising polo match to cheer on Harry. The Duchess channelled 50s chic after opting for a navy Carolina Herrera dress with a flared skirt - thought to cost around \u0026pound2,300 - teamed with a pair of \u0026pound550 nude heels. Her locks were tied in a loose bun and she chose a summery rattan clutch to complete the outfit. Meanwhile, Harry went for more casual attire in jeans, a white shirt and a grey blazer. The 36-year-old former Suits actress watched him score two goals from the royal box as the team ran out 5-4 winners. At one point during the game Harry sent the ball flying inches from a photographer when attempting to defend his goal - but he quickly apologised for the mishap.  The sporting fixture has become an important annual event raising funds and awareness for Harry\u0027s charity Sentebale. It\u0027s an organisation which works with children and teenagers in Lesotho and Botswana who are coming to terms with being HIV positive, have Aids or have lost their parents to the disease. The sweltering temperatures meant the match between Harry\u0027s Sentebale St Regis team, captained by Sentebale ambassador Nacho Figueras, and the Royal Salute players, led by Malcolm Borwick, was shortened to protect the polo ponies and the breaks were lengthened.  Mr Figueras, who was invited to Harry\u0027s wedding with wife Delfina Blaquier, said about Meghan: She\u0027s lovely, she\u0027s wonderful, I\u0027m very happy for Harry. I think they\u0027re both lucky to have found each other, I\u0027m very excited about this new chapter in his life. Speaking about his brief chat with the duchess while on stage, he said: She said that she enjoyed the game. She watched the game with my wife, which is wonderful because they were able to talk about polo and she could learn more about the game.

The Met Office warned that there is a small chance homes and businesses could be flooded quickly as well as damage from lightning strikes, hail or strong winds.  There is a slight chance of power cuts in some areas. The extreme weather could also affect public transport with the possibility of delays to train and bus services. Spray and sudden flooding could also lead to difficult driving conditions and some road closures. A similar warning has been issued for tomorrow between 2pm and 11.45pm. The Met Office said: With hot air over the UK some scattered thunderstorms may form over parts of central and eastern England on Thursday afternoon.  Where these do form there is the potential for some very heavy rain for a short period of time as well as frequent lightning and perhaps hail and some gusty winds.

Social media have heaped praise on the five-year-old girl - calling her stunning and a living doll after a professional photographer shared her portrait. Last Friday, photographer Mofe Bamuyiwa posted three photos of the young girl named Jare, saying: “Oh yes she’s human! She’s also an angel! and children are a gift from heaven. The little girl shows no hint of shyness in the distinctive portraits where she looks straight into the camera and shows off her skillful poses.  Fans gushed over the images on Instagram commenting simply gorgeous, soo beautiful and absolutely stunning. Mofe reportedly works as a lifestyle and wedding photographer in Lagos, Nigeria. Despite Jare\u0027s obvious confidence Mofe told Yahoo Lifestyle: “Jare isn’t a professional model.  She has two sisters - Jomi, 7, and Joba, 10 - who also model and have their own instagram page. Although not everyone was a fan. Some people couldn\u0027t believe the images were real and asked if photoshop was used or the girl was given a wig. Jare isn\u0027t the first girl to take Instagram by storm at such a young age. French supermodel and actress Thylane Blondeau, 17, first made a name for herself at just four years old modelling for Jean Paul Gaultier.   Two years later, aged six, she graced the page of fashion-bible vogue and her blond her and blue eyes made her a global superstar.  The photo earned her the original title of the \u0027most beautiful girl in the world\u0027 and she is now a regular on runways across the world. Meanwhile, six-year-old Anna Knyazeva, from Russia, has attracted over 1.2 million fans on Instagram thanks to her model-looks.

It is the crowning political achievement for a man who made his name not as a statesman but as a sporting hero. Since finishing his sporting career as one of the world\u0027s most famous cricketers, he has become an outspoken campaigner against political corruption. And on Thursday he declared victory in Pakistan\u0027s general elections - just 22 years after founding his political party. Here\u0027s everything you need to know about his journey from cricket star to world leader.  Imran Khan\u0027s cricket career  Khan was born in October 1952 in Lahore, Pakistan . He started his schooling at the private Aitchison school in Lohore, and later attended the Royal Grammar School, Worcester.  He completed an undergraduate degree in economics at Keble College, Oxford. He first started playing cricket for his college at the age of 13, and would later play for Worcestershire. He made his debut for Pakistan in 1971 at the age of 18, and by 1982 had become the national team\u0027s captain. Khan is commonly regarded as one of the greatest ever fast bowlers. In a glittering career he played 88 Test matches and scored 3807. He retired from cricket after winning the World Cup in 1992 as one of Pakistan’s all-time most successful players.  How did Imran Khan become Pakistan\u0027s Prime Minister? After his retirement from cricket, Khan became more focused on politics. In 1996 he founded the political party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), a centrist party opposed to the centre-left Pakistan People\u0027s Party (PPP) and conservative Pakistan Muslim League (PML). Khan went on hunger strike in 2007 as a protest against emergency rule in Pakistan. It came a week after he was jailed as part of a crackdown on political opponents by then-president Pervez Musharraf. PTI grew rapidly over the two decades, and is now one of the major political forces in Pakistan. In the 2013 elections it overtook the PPP to become the official opposition party in the provinces of Punjab and Sindh.  In the 2018 election Khan\u0027s party went up against the ruling PML, whose former leader Nawaz Sharif was removed from office as Prime Minister over corruption charges in 2017 and later jailed. The election campaign has been marred by violence, delays in ballot counting and claims of vote rigging. A suicide bombing killed 31 people near a polling station in Quetta, capital of the Baluchistan province. Khan declared victory in the election on 26 July 2018, but looked unlikely to hit the majority of seats needed to form a solo government, meaning he would have to look to form a coalition.  Who is Imran Khan\u0027s wife? In the 1970s and 80s, Khan had an image as a playboy. He was often seen partying at London nightclubs, and was linked to a series of socialites and minor aristocrats. His first marriage, in May 1995, was to journalist and documentary producer Jemima Goldsmith - daughter of finance tycoon Sir James Goldsmith. Jemima converted to Islam before their wedding, and they married in a short ceremony in Paris. They had two sons together, Sulaiman Isa and Kasim. The pair divorced in June 2004, with Khan saying: my political life made it difficult for her to adapt to life in Pakistan.  His second marriage came in January 2015 to British-Pakistani journalist Reham Khan, but the pair announced their divorce just nine months later. Khan\u0027s political party confirmed in February 2018 that he had married for the third time, this time to his spiritual advisor Bushra Manika.

Definitely not.“I think this was to do with the changes we had to make and because we didn’t keep the ball in the front and be more simple.“Nicky Clark was tired and James Keatings has just come back from an injury so he got tired. After that our attacking game was not there.“But I want a team who is ready for Dunfermline, that is ready for the league. We have the two weeks and we go now for the next level.”And Csaba was quick to point out United have not been the only team to have problems in these early season fixtures.“I have watched the results and every big team is struggling. You are not there where you want to be at the moment. This is not an excuse but it is true. If you train every week two times daily you see that legs are tired. Still, with these tired legs you have to win the game one zero, or two zero and finish.”United now head for Elgin City on Saturday knowing they have no chance of qualifying.It will, however, be another vital game as the manager tries to knock his new-look side into shape in their last outing before the league business starts.United’s ‘Meet the fans day’ takes place at Tannadice on Sunday when supporters will get the chance to see the team train.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b51f13f2179a.jpg ","title":"dundee people all aboard thehms unicornfor family fun","story":"\t\t\t\t\tSwashbuckling pirates stormed the HMS Unicorn as people of all ages turned out for the vessel’s summer family fun day.Youngsters dressed up and got the chance to meet unofficial mascot Pirate Bob.Children also had their faces painted and took part in sand art activities.There was even a special curator’s tour of the Music of Maritime Life.Billy Rough, education officer at the Unicorn, said: “It was such a fantastic day.“It was incredibly busy despite it being a glorious sunny day.

The first is my collections of jewellery which I design and make to be distributed to the shops that stock my designs up and down the country.“The second is my bespoke pieces.“This is where someone comes in with a design in mind or with a piece they want to be remodelled.“With my bespoke designs it is much more fun as I can be a bit more creative.“It can be a big responsibility as a lot of the time someone is grieving over the loss of a loved one and they want a piece to remember them by or they want a piece of their loved one’s jewellery reworked.“You can’t change it back, so it can be quite nerve-racking.“I have also incorporated people ashes into designs, so it can be a very emotional journey with my customer.“It is lovely that I can really help customers after the passing of a loved one with a piece that is incredibly sentimental.“The third part is teaching.“I have held workshops since the beginning. I think it makes the pieces more sentimental when someone has made the ring themselves.”After taking the plunge to work on her business full time only a year ago, Scarlett has urged anyone else in the same position to take that leap into self employment.“This business is my life and I love it. It is hard and scary to take that step but I am so glad I did it. I can really put my heart and soul into my pieces now.“I should have done it way sooner.”Scarlett’s workshops allow couples to have a personal touch at their wedding.A growing number of couples are visiting her studios to create their wedding rings – and some of those ready to get down on one knee are even coming to create a bespoke engagement ring for their other half.Scarlett said: “The workshops are incredibly popular and weddings are becoming a lot more DIY with couples wanting to be more hands on.“I love being part of the love story of making their rings.“We also hold hen parties a lot and brides love to come in and make matching silver rings with their bridesmaids.“It is a lot of fun.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee people spar customers raise cash for good causes","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe Spar store on Ballindean Road in the Douglas area of Dundee has been raising funds for a number of local good causes, including Brown Street Kennels, The Crescent in Whitfield and seven-year-old Garvie Winter, who is being treated for leukaemia.Kirsty Laing, from the store, said: “We do quite a lot of different things in the shop to raise money.“We sell a lot of books, mostly for 50p, which are really popular and we also get a lot of little things from customers who want to sell them to raise funds too.

It has completely blighted the community and many homes are now unsaleable.\"He said the proposed expansion would bring the substation boundary within 30 yards of the nearest property, and 75 yards of his home.He added: \"SSE refuses to acknowledge any fault or offer compensation of any kind.\"There appears to be no clearly established legal obligation for SSE to compensate, but there is a moral one, considering the substantial financial loss suffered by the residents and the spoiling of a peaceful rural atmosphere.\"He added that the planning authority, Highland Council, has expressed little interest in helping them.Mr Lanning said that in February he was forced to take his house off the market after a year because he could not sell it at \u0026pound40,000 below the market value.The substation began growing to accommodate the Beauly to Denny power line and the new renewable energy sources in the surrounding hills.Pensioner Mr Lanning, who has lived in the glen for 11 years, said: \"The substation has been enlarged about four times.\"There are liaison meetings but they are simply PR exercises.\"This is not just about me. The other residents are my friends and we are all in the same boat.\"A spokeswoman from SSE said: \"Our proposal has been developed in close consultation with the local community and other stakeholders based on a range of economic, environmental and technical considerations.\u0026nbsp\"As a responsible developer, we have listened carefully to the feedback during consultation, and to minimise the visual impact of the extension, we are proposing a gas-insulated switchgear solution, which significantly reduces the footprint of the site.\"We have also purchased additional land to

the discussions.There have been nine meetings to date.Three more are scheduled to follow.The board has hit back, insisting that \"organisational change is managed within existing resources\".Such a reason is regularly given by public bodies when questioned about the use of staff time that is clearly beyond their regular, scheduled\u0026nbsp duties.The union has complained that morale among security staff is low while general staff safety has become an increasing concern at the north of Scotland\u0027 largest hospital.It is furious that the lengthy review of staff cover within the security department was apparently prompted \"because an ex manager has the view that the guards don\u0026rsquot have enough work to do\".The GMB\u0027 regional officer Liz Gordon calculates that the process has so far cost taxpayers \u0026pound7808.34.It prompted her to ask: \"How many operations would that pay for?\"Ms Gordon said: \"The security staff cover a 32-acre site and have an increasingly challenging job.\"The statistics show that aggression and the threat of violence is escalating not diminishing.\"It\u0027 suspected that the board want to save money by getting security guards to undertake more of the work done by the porters, and vice versa.\"Equally, nursing is going to be expected to call upon the security guards less frequently and, therefore, do more themselves.\"She added: \"Police Scotland will be looked upon as a resource but their new triaging system will prevent this.\"Portering is literally run off its feet.\"It is covering an average of 22,000 steps per eight-hour shift \u0026ndash that\u0027 11 miles \u0026ndash and is often in crisis being reduced to single-man working.\"A spokeswoman for NHS Highland attempted to dismiss all the

there was no way she could complete the lengthy application process in time or find the \u0026pound559 required for a public entertainment licence. She said: \"Everything for kids is so expensive nowadays, I thought we could have some good old fashioned fun on the beach and bring a few families together.\"The idea was for the kids to have an hour to make their sandcastles, they would all get stickers and we would get someone local to judge the best ones.\"She had thought that parents would simply mind their own children, but Highland Council told her she would have to provide formal first aid cover and explain fully how the event would impact other beach users.As Mrs Cowie-Mcinnes had advertised the event on social media and circulated flyers around the town, she was worried she might have to call the whole thing off: \"I was panicking when I got the email through, thinking I might need to cancel it and the kids were already excited.\"There is too much red tape and so many barriers to get through to run an event, people will end up giving up.\"Unsure of how to save the event, she took to the Nairn Rocks social media page to ask people for advice.And as a result, Fochabers firm Saltaire Security offered their services for free and provided a copy of their own public liability insurance certificate to Highland Council.There were also offers to provide lifeguard cover and Nairn Business Improvement District also came forward to say it would help.In the end, Highland Council agreed to waive permission fees.\"It couldn\u0026rsquot have gone ahead without the security company and everyone else who is helping for free,\" said Mrs Cowie-Mcinnes, who has also been delighted at the offers of prizes from local businesses.Weather permitting, the event will now go ahead on Sunday with registration taking place from 10am at Nairn Links for categories ranging from pre-school through to teenagers and

taken from the murky waters of Loch Ness and sent to Hull so that the DNA can be extracted.It is all part of a Kiwi scientist\u0027 plan to finally answer the question of whether Nessie is real.Neil Gemmell, geneticist and professor at the University of Otago in New Zealand, visited the Highlands with a team of specialist scientists to collect the water samples in June.The Super Natural History Team will then study the samples in bases around the world for signs of DNA.Mr Gemmell is satisfied that the collection process went well.\"All is going to plan but it is too early for any results,\" he said.He believes it will be late in this year or the beginning of next before they have any revelations.Once the DNA has been extracted in Hull the samples will be sent on to France and Switzerland to get the sequence data \u0026ndash the digital breakdown of all the DNA found.\"From there the data goes all over the world,\" Mr Gemmell added.He has previously admitted that while he does not believe in the Loch Ness Monster he is \"open to the idea of something unusual living in the loch\".The team used specialist equipment and boats to take samples up to 200m below the surface.The research has reignited discussions within Scottish National Heritage (SNH) about what would happen if Nessie is found.\u0026nbsp In 2001, the organisation reacted to a period of peaked interest in the

project.\u0026nbspIf approved by councillors, it will consist of patterned sculptural stepping stones made of granite, sitting in a stainless steel channel or lade.Water from the river will feed into this channel where some of the stones will be fitted with moveable sluice gates to allow children to control the flow of water themselves.The plan is for it to be located in the middle of the Ness Islands at a spot already popular with families.The proposal is just one element of the River Ness Public Art Project, worth a total of \u0026pound727,000.Inverness Provost Helen Carmichael was yesterday hopeful that the concept would find favour with councillors on Highland Council\u0027 south planning committee, especially since local schoolchildren had been consulted on what they would like to see there, and Inverness College UHI design students had input on the concept.She said: \"Children were very involved along with students at the university. Children love jumping from stone to stone and guddling about in water.\"It has all been looked at from the safety point of view, but let\u0027 face it, if you take children to the beach they jump from stone to stone.

The stones would be patterned, partly to minimise slips and also to reflect foliage patterns from trees growing on the islands.A report from Inverness City Artworks Group states: \"While it was preferable to use natural stone, the cost might prove prohibitive and alternative materials might need to be considered.\"It was also minuted that if concerns were raised regarding the cost of this feature, the high cost of \"providing basic play equipment should be highlighted.\"The group was given assurances that the design would, when completed, look like part of the landscape, and members were told that Bespoke Atelier was confident that all aspects of the design could be met within the available budget.Path improvements in the vicinity are included in the application.Company director Yvonne Elliot-Kellighan said the stepping stone forms envisaged were inspired by the shape of the Ness Islands, and the stones themselves could be engraved with botanical patterns \"creating a ow and connection between stepping stones\".The children\u0027 feature is not far from MY Ness, a \u0026pound300,000 centrepiece which was unveiled as a concept in May and has still to receive planning permission.The River Ness Public Art Project is funded by Creative Scotland (\u0026pound305,000), Inverness Common Good Fund (\u0026pound250,000), HIE (\u0026pound66,000) and Highland Council (\u0026pound106,000).At a time of heightened concern about public spending, Highland Council has stressed that the vast majority of the money for the projects comes from third parties and cannot be used for other purposes, and the council\u0027 \u0026pound106k is from capital investment and not revenue spend.Friday 27 Jul 2018 2:35 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116735.jpg","title":"Pamiloo to make its first visit to Black Isle Show","story":"\u0026nbspCAMPAIGNERS have welcomed news that accessible toilets will be installed at this year\u0027 Black Isle Show \u0026ndash allowing people with complex needs to enjoy the event.Fiona MacLeod-Chiarini, whose brother Ewan MacLeod is severely disabled, contacted the show\u0027 organisers to ask about the availability of a Pamiloo (right), a mobile facility for those with profound impairments.Rod Mackenzie, the Black Isle Show\u0027 company secretary, immediately got in touch with the charity Promoting a More Inclusive Scotland (Pamis), which owns the Pamiloo, in order to make the event accessible for the family.Mrs MacLeod-Chiarini hailed the move, and believes facilities such as the Pamiloo can be life-changing.She said: \"We are absolutely delighted that the Black Isle Show have taken our concerns on board and have booked the Pamiloo.

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 25","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 23/06/18, 5:52 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,Labour and the Lib Dems must recognise and respect the recent vote in the Scottish Parliament and the views of their Scottish colleagues who refused to give consent to the damaging Brexit legislation proposed at Westminster.Labour amendments to former clause 11 of the bill require consent of the Scottish Parliament unless a UK Minister ‘has reasonable grounds for believing that regulations are required for the purpose of giving effect to any international obligations’.It would be catastrophic for Scotland if Labour left the door open for the Tory Government to breach the devolution settlement.Leaving Holyrood exposed to powers taken without consent in any area connected to an international trade agreement would be disastrous. This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

I am still receiving many justifiable complaints about the terrible condition of Mansefield Road in Port Ellen and the hospital road in Bowmore. With long overdue road works going on across Islay and the rest of the Kintyre and Islands ward, it\u0026#8217s only fair these roads are not ignored.The poor condition of the Bruichladdich toilets continues to be raised by local residents.Since contacting the appropriate department I have been informed repairs and maintenance are planned for them.While checking on the progress of pothole repairs I had previously requested, I noticed some of the recent street light repairs leave a lot to be desired. While a quick fix is better than nothing, many of these short-term fixes need to be looked at again.I have been speaking to the BT Openreach staff across Islay who are expanding our island\u0026#8217s internet capabilities. I have contacted BT to make sure recent issues with phone lines in some local households are not a result of the broadband upgrades.There has been progress with local housing associations after pointing out many of their tenants are having trouble with mould in their housing. Measures are now being implemented to to rectify the problem. I was happy to hear Argyll Community Housing Association has fixed gate latches on four of its houses at Cnoc Na Faire in Port Ellen after I raised this with them a few weeks ago.I met with environment, development and infrastructure committee member councillor Gary Mulvaney about Kintyre and Islands\u0026#8217 crumbling infrastructure, alongside our growing industrial output with the success of distilleries on Islay and Jura.Later that day I spoke directly to my constituents in Tarbert after a number of locals \u0026#8211 some business owners \u0026#8211 contacted me about the recent flood of sewage on Harbour Street as a result of blocked drains. Scottish Water were coming under fire from locals because of its slow progress on the matter.I made my anger about the poor conditions in Tarbert very clear when I contacted Scottish Water. A long-term solution to needs to be put in place.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Scottish Water is asking customers to use water wisely in their daily activities to help maintain supplies during the current hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer use has increased significantly.In some areas, there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of use and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce use wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their use and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible and use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.More advice on using water wisely is online at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or call 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer, Chief Operating Officer, Scottish Water.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"riverside fun day sparkles in the sun","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 9:44 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe sun shone on the Riverside in Lochgilphead for a day of fun.Mid Argyll Community Pool and Riverside Rascals nursery hosted the family day on Sunday July 1, featuring a variety of colourful craft and charity stalls.The unmistakeable aroma of barbecue wafted across the car park from Riverside Rascals nursery, which opened its doors to the public for the occasion, complete with children\u0026#8217s activities.MACPool lifeguards were on hand to keep an eye on the youngsters in the pedal boats while the sunshine glistened across the splashing fun.PICS:Four-year-old Kaiden Abel from Lochgilphead has fun splashing in the inflatable outdoor pool. 06_a27RiversideFun01Kyra Robertson, aged 11, from Cairnbaan, tries to hook a duck on the MS centre stand \u0026#8211 and it\u0026#8217s not as easy as it looks. 06_a27RiversideFun04On the MS Centre Mid Argyll stall were Maggie Dodd and centre manager Karen McCurry. 06_a27RiversideFun07Mary Stewart of the Loch Awe Pottery helps sisters Abby and Chloe McCallum, from Glasgow, to decorate their pottery. 06_a27RiversideFun08Cathleen MacDonald was there with her Woolly Bobbins textile-base crafts. 06_a27RiversideFun09Alongside Cathleen was her mum Margaret Davidson, who creates soft toys under the name Twisted Yarn.

The brainless and pathetic vandalism at Blarbuie, for example. The perpetrators, and those close to them, need to get a grip and take a hard look at themselves.And there are the positive stories. The drama and uncertainty of the Yot Spot era can now be forgotten in Ardrishaig, as the new Steamer Terminal cafe opens. If it is managed properly and folk work together, there is surely enough cafe business to go round everyone in Ardrishaig.Then there are the school awards. Well done to the Tarbert pupils and staff, hot on the heels of the Lochgilphead presentations a couple of weeks back.As for good news, we can\u0026#8217t go much beyond the weather.

John\u0026#8217s 72 was the best gross score on the day with Peter Mclean Jnr moving into third place when he recovered from a horror start to post a 76.The handicap trophy was another tight affair with Jimmy MacNab showing the youngsters how it is done with a superb net 64 taking a one shot lead over David Ronald and a two-shot lead over James Smyth.The John Reid Quaich which is played as part of the championship was won by Duncan Johnstone on 134, edging out Iain Macalister by one shot.Despite the weather conditions, the members gathered in good spirits for the final round of the championship, a day that everyone looks forward to and with all competitions very close an interesting days play lay ahead.In the leading group, play was a bit nervy with neither player at their best on the front nine with Iain reducing the deficit to one shot with eight holes left to play.

His problems did not end there, though, as injury also ruled out Gordon Whyte, Thomas Whyte and Dunky Kerr although the latter was stripped as Kyles only substitute, while Robbie MacLeod was unavailable.Caberfeidh manager Jodi Gorski had Ally MacLennan back but he was also short of players, with Jamie Matheson and Colin MacLennan among his absentees and they lined-up with the Cabers with the second team.Kyles settled into the game with a goal on four minutes. There was a scramble in the goal area where Colin MacDonald fought for possession with Caberfeidh keeper Ewen Pilcher and defender Blair Morrison, and it was actually Luke Thornton who got the final touch to put the hosts ahead.Luke Thornton got Kyles and his second on eight minutes. Sandy MacKenzie played the ball across from the left wing forward position to Luke Thornton who smashed a shoulder-high volley past the Cabers keeper from 15 yards.Kevin Bartlett made it 2-1 on 13 minutes when he latched onto a loose ball in defence and carried the ball forward before thumping it past John Whyte from a central position.However Kyles restored their two-goal cushion on 42 minutes to make it 3-1 at the break. Former Skye Camanachd player Neil MacVicar, playing in attack, switched play from right wing forward to Sandy MacKenzie at left wing forward and he rifled the ball past keeper Pilcher from 18 yards.Grant Irvine got in on the act on 55 minutes. A ball forward from midfield was brought out of the air by Colin MacDonald, who slipped it out to the right wing forward position to the onrushing Grant Irvine, who swept the ball across the keeper into the right-hand side of the net.Sandy MacKenzie put gloss on the win with a rather fortuitous effort on 62 minutes. MacKenzie turned full back Blair Morrison and as keeper Pilcher came out to clear the ball, it rebounded off MacKenzie into the net.Donald Irvine was superb for Kyles, while Grant Irvine was an instrumental figure at full centre.Caberfeidh did not perform at the levels seen when they took shinty’s top flight by surprise in the earlier part of this season.\u0026nbspMarine Harvest South Division 1Title hopefuls the Kyles Athletic second team march on, beating Ballachulish 1-0 at the Jubilee Park.Balla’s Cain MacPhee was free of a one-match ban, while Kyles were without Luke Thornton who was on first team duty.The only goal of the game came on 19 minutes and it was a superb strike from Martin MacFadyen whose 25 yard piledriver from the middle of the park gave the keeper no chance.Balla’ had the chance to level on 35 minutes when referee Callum Duff awarded them a penalty, penalising a \u0026#8216kick\u0026#8217 inside the D.Lorne Brown took the penalty and he struck the ball well enough but his effort was superbly saved by Kyles keeper Douglas Nicolson. It was one of a number of great stops by the Kyles custodian.Kyles have a five point lead on second place Bute although they have played a game more.Bute 4 Bute scored three times in the final third of the game to defeat Aberdour 4-1 in their 12.30pm throw up at The Meadows.Bute’s Craig MacKay was unavailable as he served the second game of a two-match suspension.Aberdour travelled without Cameron McCue and David McDougal.James Craig gave Bute the lead after just five minutes and that proved to be the only goal of a tight first 45 minutes during which Bute goalie Kevin Queen saved well from David MacKenzie, tipping his effort over the bar.Referee Robert Baxter pointed to the penalty spot when Ruairidh Reid was wiped out inside the D, taking a stick across the knees, when he looked set to equalise. Angus Thorburn struck the penalty well but Kevin Queen made a brilliant save to keep his side in front.The visitors were awarded a second penalty shortly after when Roddy MacColl was felled inside the box. Angus Thorburn stepped up again but this time he did not catch the ball as he would have liked and his effort went past the post.The penalty misses were a blow for Aberdour and Bute took advantage and, with some good running and quick passing, they went on to score three more times.Robert Walker made it 2-0 on 65 minutes and Iain McDonald added a third with 15 minutes remaining.Chris Lawrence made it 4-0 on 80 minutes, although there was some consolation for Aberdour when Ruairidh Reid finished well a couple of minutes later. Angus Thorburn battled to get the ball to Reid and his powerful strike from just outside the D gave the keeper no chance.Bute were sharper on the day and they deserved the win but the final scoreline was a little harsh on Aberdour in what was only their second league defeat of the season.Bute now leap-frog Aberdour into second place in the league on goal difference and the Islanders have a game in hand.Kilmory 1 MacRae Park was in perfect condition to host the local derby between Kilmory and the Inveraray second team.A large crowd gathered to watch two teams filled with youth and experience.Kilmory started with top scorer Alister MacArthur in defence and they had young Andrew Innes up-front, supported by the more experienced Hal Jones.Inveraray went with a mature forward line which included Euan McMurdo, John MacKenzie and Neil Campbell but their back five were all aged under 18.But it was across the centre line where all the action happened in the first half.Referee Alex MacVicar had a busy afternoon and David Macpherson was first into the book for a cynical challenge on Sandy Leiper.It wasn’t long before Leiper joined him, yellow carded for a late swing on his fellow winger, young Ruaraidh Graham.Duncan MacBrayne was next to fall foul of the official for persistent fouling.In-between all the yellow cards, Alister MacArthur was dictating the play from the Kilmory defence, with young Hamish MacLennan doing the same for Inveraray and the first half ended scoreless.Inveraray came out the traps the quickest in the second half. A long range effort from David Macpherson was easily saved by the Kilmory keeper, but Neil Campbell was quickest to react and slot the rebound home to open the scoring on 48 minutes.Inveraray added a quick second following a well-worked set-piece routine on 56 minutes. Euan McMurdo’s free-hit found Campbell Watt, whose movement caused the Kilmory defence problems all afternoon, and he made 2-0 with fine finish.The goal sparked life into Kilmory who pulled one back on 65 minutes when Hal Jones blasted home an unstoppable shot from the edge of the penalty area to make it 2-1 and it was game on.After getting themselves back in the game, Kilmory’s discipline let them down soon after, with both Duncan MacBrayne and Sandy Leiper receiving their marching orders from referee MacVicar within minutes of one another.Inveraray capitalised on their two-man advantage and former Kilmory player David MacAllister scored his first goal for his new club on 69 minutes to make it 3-1.Euan McMurdo finished the day’s scoring off with a well-constructed goal to make it 4-1 with 15 minutes remaining.Inveraray will be happy with their league first win of the season, while Kilmory will be disappointed with the result and the fact that they will be missing two influential players over the weeks to come.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"graham love is leaving macpool","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 20/07/18, 2:20 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowGraham Love is moving on from Lochgilphead\u0026#8217s MacPool at the end of July.MacPool will be looking to recruit a new pool manager after the summer.

It was difficult to hold the bottom at times, however, we managed to hook into dab, plaice, grey gurnard, haddock and a good haul of thornback rays to bring our species tally for the day to five.All in all a decent day’s fishing given the rough conditions. We returned to harbour a tad battered and soaking wet.Day two was almost as windy as the first day, however the rain kept away which was a bonus.Conditions were still far too rough for fishing the deep so we started off on the soft ground for flats but the spurdogs had other ideas. Everywhere we went \u0026#8211 singles, doubles, trebles \u0026#8211 there was just no getting away from them despite Robbie’s best efforts.I have never seen so many chunky spurs, with the best of the day tipping the scales at 14lbs 8oz.Needless to say a fair number of rigs were wrecked, leads snagged and lost on the rough ground, and quite a few fish dropped. On the plus side there were a few PBs and a couple of new club records set.In between the spur attacks, we picked up a few decent dab, plaice, cod, grey gurnard, red gurnard and coalfish (coalies) to take our species count for the day to eight.Despite the rough and tumble we enjoyed the trip and the opportunity to catch some decent fish. Hopefully the weather will be kinder next year and we’ll get to drop a line out in the deep water marks which hold so many more species.The combined scores over two days:Nikki Thompson 185%***********************It was no surprise to find ourselves fishing in the pouring rain yet again. We don’t seem to have much luck weatherwise, but at least it was relatively calm out of Oban with only the slightest breeze.We headed out on board the ‘Laura Dawn’ in search of fresh bait but despite several drifts the mackerel eluded us.With the big tides, skipper Ronnie suggested we fish the rough ground and reefs for pollack and coalies. The plan was to play around here until the tide eased off enough to drop the anchor.It was pretty desperate though with only a few miniscule whiting to show for our efforts. The incredibly rough ground and fast drift were challenging to say the least and most of us left a fair amount of tackle and lead stuck fast to the seabed.Enough was enough, so we decided to head for deeper water and anchor up even though the tide was still pretty strong, resulting in some horrendous tangles.It proved to be a sensible move from a fishing point of view though, with reasonable sized spurs hooked on the very first drop. More spurs, spotty dogs and a couple of bonus thornbacks were taken throughout the afternoon.It was nip and tuck right to the end with just one fish separating the top three placing.Final scores:\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"rock from rest and be thankful be reused in new project","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 26/07/18, 12:26 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowA new innovative method to help mitigate against potential landslips is being rolled out in Glen Kinglas near the Rest and be Thankful.The ongoing £1.84 million catch-pit works at the Rest and be Thankful involve digging and constructing three large ‘pits’ at the bottom of the slope that are designed to collect materials and run-off from a potential slip. The project has produced around 18,000 tonnes of usable rock, which has been stored temporarily, and designs have now been completed to reuse this material as additional protection for the A83.The material will be used in the construction of landslip mitigation bunds above streams along Glen Kinglas, some three to four miles from the Rest and Be Thankful. These bunds will form a constructed embankment of material initially across six individual water channels next to the roadside that geotechnical engineers have assessed to have the potential to deposit debris onto the trunk road should a landslip occur. The bunds will reduce the risk of debris reaching the roadside.The bunds will be up to 10 metres high in some sections and have the combined capacity to contain over 1,000 tonnes of debris should a landslip occur.Teams from BEAR Scotland have been working closely with the landowner and specialist sub-contractor to develop this sustainable approach to protecting the A83 for the long-term benefit of users of this important route.This sustainable method allows BEAR Scotland to maximise the benefit of the material being excavated from the Rest and be Thankful while minimising the overall cost of these works to the public purse via these projects which are being funded by Transport Scotland and the Scottish Government.As the works are focussed initially within six watercourse channels there will be short lengths of traffic management for approximately two to four weeks in each location. The A83 will remain open but it will be necessary for temporary traffic signals to be in place for the safety of road workers and road users.  The project will move in phases along this stretch of the A83 as the works progress.Real time journey information is available from Traffic Scotland on their website: trafficscotland.org\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"tarbert golf club is looking for players","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 26/07/18, 12:32 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowSort that swing because Tarbert Golf Club is holding its James Mundell Memorial gents open.On Sunday August 5 players will compete at Glenralloch for various gross and net prizes between £20 and £60 and, of course, for the coveted James Mundell Memorial trophy.So book your place for a chance to win.Tee off times are 7.50am to 9.10am, 10.45am to 12.05pm or 1.40pm to 2.50pm.To book, call 01880 820565 and entry fees are £15.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"teenie takes the title in myargyll","story":"\t\tSandy NeilUpdated: 26/07/18, 9:24 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowA competition capturing #myargyll has been won by Teenie Wilson, an amateur photographer on the Isle of Lismore, who took this stunning image before an evening’s fishing at Port Ramsay, as the sun set over Glensanda quarry in Morvern.The competition, run in in association with Wyvex Media and Argyll and the Isles Tourism Co-operative, sought to recognise why you think our region is such a fantastic place to live, work and visit through photography, video and prose.Teenie, who runs the Lismore Post office and shop with her husband David, took up the hobby, which they share, two years ago.‘I love it,’ she said: ‘It gets me out. I take the camera wherever I go. I always keep my eye open for the right shot. With a good camera you can’t go wrong.’One summer evening last year, Teenie said their neighbour Duncan Black, a retired seaman, had asked if she wanted to go fishing. ‘I was waiting for him to bring the boat in,’ she recalled. ‘I thought it would make a great shot. We caught 40 fish that night. When I downloaded it, I thought ‘wow’.’‘Wow’ indeed, because it was voted the best from hundreds of brilliant photographs sent in by you – you can still enjoy them all by visiting #myargyll.‘I am chuffed,’ Teenie said. ‘I am not very confident in my own work \u0026#8211 everybody tells me they are good. This has given me a huge boost.’Thanks to her winning photograph, Teenie has won an autumn break for two on Islay, featuring an overnight stay at the Machrie Hotel, dinner and B\u0026ampB in Bowmore’s Harbour Inn, a tour of Islay’s newest distillery, Ardnahoe, a boat trip with Islay Sea Adventures, travel via Hebridean Airways, based at Oban Airport, a night at the Falls of Lora Hotel in Connel, and an Oban walking tour.Teenie said: ‘I am taking my sister, because she persuaded me to enter the competition.’Teenie also runs the island’s photography club and has just been awarded £1,000 to set up a junior one this winter.The runner-up was Alan Frew from Helensburgh. He was surprised but absolutely delighted with his achievement.His stunning picture was taken at Carsaig jetty, near Tayvallich.He said: ‘My son Aidan is an avid BMXer and wanted a picture of himself jumping.

The Honest Men were relegated at the first time of asking in the second tier in the 2016/17 season when they finished bottom with 33 points. But former Ayr hitman and manager, Roberts, reckons being part-time was what held them back. Marko, who played second tier football with Ayr under Brian Reid, said: “I think Ayr will be fine, I really do. “Being full-time in that league is a massive thing. “The last few times Ayr have been in that league it has been very difficult to compete with the full-time teams. “But the fact they have got that now will make a big difference and I don’t think they will have any issues staying in the league. “When I was there under Brian Reid, being part-time was what held us back. “You didn’t have enough time to go and work on things on a daily basis but Ayr will have that now.  “You can beat any team in a one-off game but over the course of a season of 36 games it’s difficult to compete. “But the fans should be excited this time as there should be no problem – Ayr can even start looking up rather than looking down.” Roberts, who hit the net 43 times for Ayr, was more than impressed with Ayr’s impressive goal-scoring form last season as they topped League One, pipping Raith on the final game of the season. He said: “I thought they were really good to watch. “You always thought they were going to score every game they played. “And I don’t mean just scoring one, you always thought they’d grab three or four. “Sometimes they were left open all over the park – but they had too much quality up front and that’s the reason they went up. “Fair play to them as they had three really good strikers in Shankland, Moore and Moffat.” Roberts added: “The way the league was won was certainly a bit of a way to win it.  “I’ve been in teams that have won titles and been promoted with five or six games to go, which gives you a great feeling of accomplishment, but there’s nothing more exciting than winning the title in the last 10 minutes of the season. “Both teams had the chance to run away with it but kept faltering.” Roberts managed Ayr for three years before getting sacked, He then had a player/coach role at Clyde for a season. He has now gone back to playing at Junior Cup finalists Hurlford United. But he insists that his managing days aren’t over.  He said: “I won’t give up on it, I just wanted to play again for now. The best days of your life are when you’re kicking a ball and I am still fit enough.  “Any manager who tells you they prefer coaching is talking rubbish. When you’re out there playing it’s  just great.  “I do want to get back to managing eventually though, but it’s all about finding the right club and what suits my life at the minute.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"mayboles christmas celebrations in jeopardy","story":"NewsMaybole\u0027s Christmas celebrations in jeopardyThe community association organises a Christmas lights switch-on ceremony, as well the summer gala day.Share\u0026nbspByAyrshire Post11:18, 25 JUL 2018NewsMaybole Christmas lights switch on (Image: David Kiltie)Get daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe town’s Christmas celebrations will be in the ice box this year after a community group agreed to freeze itself for six months. Maybole Community Association will not meet again until January, by which time the festive fun will be over. The group organises a Christmas lights switch-on ceremony, as well the summer gala day. But members could not form a committee at an extraordinary general meeting (EGM). A statement issued after the meeting states: “Following the EGM held by Maybole Community Association on Thursday, July 12, 2018, regrettably no one came forward at the meeting prepared to be an office bearer, knowing that the present committee were standing down. “The decision was therefore made at the meeting for all activities of the association to be frozen and put on hold for a minimum period of six months and a maximum of 12 months and will be reviewed again at that time. “No business will be conducted during that timescale. This decision means that there will be no Christmas lights switch-on and potentially no gala next year.” Outgoing chairperson Senga Mason had been in her role for three years and took over after a similar committee crisis.  She said: “People didn’t come forward for the main committee roles and there’s far greater pressures on people’s time now than there was 40 years ago.” Mrs Mason’s connection to the group, founded in 1975, goes back to 1978. Maybole Gala Days in days gone by featured lorry floats and impressive bunting displays across the High Street. But Mrs Mason pointed out: “Health and safety rules meant the end of using lorries, which in any case are normally needed 24/7 by operators. “Even for simple things like bunting you need permits and a cherry picker to put it up. “Rules are in place for a reason and we have to abide by them.” Community association members are also upset at what they saw as unfair criticisms made on social media following this year’s Maybole Gala Day on June 9. A switch-on ceremony in Maybole can only now be saved if another group of volunteers steps forward. If the community association decides to wind up in January its assets - cash, tables, chairs and gazebos - would be dispersed to other groups in the town.

And United proved that underdogs can upset the odds by finishing sixth and leaving Aberdeen, Dundee United, Dundee and St Johnstone in their wake. It was a stunning effort but McSherry, who was signed by Ally MacLeod on a free from Kilmarnock, reckons Ayr can once again confound the pundits and enjoy a great season. United kick off the league at home to Partick Thistle on August 4 and midfielder turned publican McSherry expects them to be up for the challenge. He said: “Consolidation should be the aim but there is no reason why Ayr can’t rise again and enjoy the good times that we enjoyed in the 70s.” An old team picture that surfaced in McSherry’s Wee Windaes got punters rewinding the years and reliving past glories. It was taken at the start of season 1975-76 and showed Ayr in their change kit of Barcelona strips. Proudly standing tall are, back row – Davie Wells, Alex McAnespie, Ally MacLean, Hugh Sproat, Rikki Fleming, John Murphy. Middle row – Alex Ingram, Gerry Phillips, Johnny Graham, Johnny Doyle, Hugh Cameron, Jim McSherry. Front row – John Dickson, Danny MacDonald, Davie McCulloch.   Jim recalled: “No one could work out why the team weren’t in their usual black and white if it was an official  team picture.  “We were also puzzled why there were 15 players in it, including two goalkeepers. “Then one of my regulars, Stephen Robb, came up with the answer – it was taken before a pre-season friendly.  “We wore it in a 7-2 defeat at home to Celtic and it was never seen  again. I think it was binned as a bad omen.  “These were good times at Ayr and the team was loaded with some great players. “We were the only part-time team in the Top Ten and were quoted at 66/1, which seemed about right given the teams we were up against. “I remember Ally signing me on the wall at Central Station and then telling me to look out my passport. “He told me ‘You’re going on tour to Canada next week’. It was quite a start to my Ayr career.” Only three months into that season, Ally was lured to Aberdeen and replaced at the helm by Alex Stuart who quickly appointed McSherry as captain. Ayr sealed safety with a last-day 2-1 win over Motherwell, who were bossed by Willie McLean and Craig Brown. Gerry Phillips got a dramatic late winner to spark euphoric scenes at a packed Somerset. The second season of top-flight football saw Ayr again more than hold their own.  They finished eighth in the table on 30 points, three ahead of Hearts and a distant 13 more than rock-bottom  rivals Kilmarnock.  Season 1977-78 marked Ayr’s third campaign in the top flight, a remarkable achievement considering they stayed part-time. Robert Connor, Ian McAllister, Derek McCutcheon and Iain Sim were called up from Ayr United Boys’ Club. But Ayr were always up against it and their life in the Premier League ended when they finished second-bottom on 24 points and were relegated along with Clydebank. Now as a new league season beckons with renewed optimism and a totally full-time structure, it’s time to dream again.

Ayr United head to Firhill to take on Partick Thistle today knowing that a win will be enough to top the group and put them into the hat for the knockout stages. The Honest Men beat Morton 3-1 in their first group game before beating Albion 2-0 on Saturday. McCall’s side then hammered Stenhousemuir 5-0 at Somerset Park on Tuesday. And McCall, who will head to his old stomping ground on Saturday, said: “It’s a good game against a team in the same league as us. “They are fancied to be challenging for the league title, so it will be a good gauge for us to see where we are at. “I don’t think the game will have any similarities to the league opener though, but if there is a place up for grabs in the last 16 then we are going to go for it.” The Betfred Cup format has come under scrutiny from a number of players and managers involved in the game.  But McCall has gone against the grain and offered his support for the group stage style. He said: “I think it’s good and I like it. “I like the games that actually mean something, rather than meaningless friendlies which I hate. “With this format it means you only need three pre season friendlies. “And we have done well in the opening couple of games so that momentum will hopefully stick with us going into the league campaign.” Ross Docherty has been back in full training for the past week, with Chris Higgins set to join back up with the squad next week. •The Ayr United open day will take place this Sunday from 12pm. Fans are welcome to join the party at Somerset where they can meet their heroes amidst a whole host of fun events. The players and managers will be there along with a Stagedoor BBQ, Mancini’s ice cream and a kids v adults match to soak in, plus plenty of more fun activities.

Thirty of the 32 Scottish local authorities have at least one Citizens Advice Scotland centre. But South Ayrshire is believed never to have had the help and rights championing service. Inverclyde is the only other area which does not have a CAB. Now a summit has been staged within Ayr County Buildings to state a case for having the service here. The steering group of councillors met on July 12 and one source said: “There is a definite anomaly here and the question should be asked why there is not a citizens advice bureau here. “I believe need has never been greater, with increasing consumer debt and other problems.” Councils have a duty to provide the advice, but South Ayrshire Council use their own staff to give it. They work out of the Wallace Tower in Ayr, but critics insist that because they are not independent, the advice cannot be of supreme impartiality. The source added: “Often people are coming in to say they cannot pay council tax or rent. “So far from being not involved, the Council is in fact the creditor. “A push is on to finally set up a proper service for the people of South Ayrshire. “There are a lot of odd things about the South Ayrshire model, not least who is informing it on a national basis. “It is a mystery why South Ayrshire Council should or can be operating an advice centre. “They are conflating advice with information.” Citizens Advice Scotland is a registered charity, helping 300,000 people a year from a total of 61 centres. It is often a place of last resort for people having difficulties in their lives, including being weighed down by debt. And the organisation also lobbies for change in government policy where it has identified hardship being caused. All local Citizens Advice Bureaux are managed by an independent board of directors and all bureaux are members of Citizen’s Advice Scotland.  A South Ayrshire Council spokesman said: “We are committed to supporting our communities  and our people, particularly those in need.  “Through our Information and Advice Hub we already provide services which deal with income maximisation, debt and money advice and consumer information.” The umbrella body Citizens Advice Scotland refused to comment.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyrAyr NewsTaxes"},{"url":null,"title":"amythyst-set-to-sparkle-in-selkirk","story":"IN case you missed Amythyst Kiah\u0027s previous two headline slots at the String Jam Club, you have the opportunity to make it third time lucky.\nDescribing herself as a Southern Gothic, alt-country blues singer/songwriter, Amythyst is one of the most incredible singers the musically-savvy County Hotel audience has ever heard.\nBased in Tennessee, her commanding stage presence is only matched by her raw and powerful vocals -

of their shops lying empty, and 13% of Jedburgh\u0026rsquos shops are also going spare.\nPeebles, Kelso, Duns, Melrose and Eyemouth have all kept their proportion of empty shops in their town centres at 8% or below, though.\nThe purpose of the town centre core activity area pilot study is to suggest updating the council\u0026rsquos planning policy in a bid to save the region\u0026rsquos high streets.\nIn it, lead planning officer Charles Johnston says: \u0026ldquoRetailing patterns continue to fluctuate, and the role of town centres is changing\u0026nbsp for example, the increase of online shopping and competition from larger national retailers.\n\u0026ldquoThe impacts of the current challenging economic climate are being felt across the country, and these trends are not unique to the Scottish Borders.\n\u0026ldquoPlanning policy must adapt to these changing circumstances.\n\u0026ldquoIn recent years, the council has amended its town centre policy in its local development plan to adapt to such changes, and whilst these changes have helped, it is acknowledged that a further review of relevant planning policy could be tested via this pilot study.\n\u0026ldquoThere are specific immediate concerns regarding Hawick and Galashiels, where reduced footfall and vacancy rates have had a detrimental impact on how these town centres have performed.\n\u0026ldquoThis is of particular concern as Hawick and Galashiels are the two largest towns within the Borders and have a strategic economic and social significance for the region.\nThe report recommends the council tries out pilot schemes in Hawick and Galashiels, either scrapping or altering their core activity area status marking out the boundaries of their commercial centres to allow a greater range of activity to take place within them.\nPlanning permission is usually only granted in such town centres if proposals are for business use in keeping with the surroundings of the sites in question, but\u0026nbspabolishing core activity area status would allow non-commercial enterprises to occupy empty high street properties.\nIn Hawick, the report says, a radical approach is needed, so it recommends councillors to vote to abolish the core activity centre there altogether.\n\u0026ldquoReducing the core area completely would, in essence, allow a greater number of other uses within the town centre, it says.\n\u0026ldquoWhilst there is the threat that complete removal of the core activity area may cause longer-term footfall issues, it is considered that some significant action is required in Hawick.\n\u0026ldquoTo implement this as a test case via a pilot scheme would seem an appropriate course of action in the circumstances.\nIn Galashiels, it is recommended that core activity area is retained but that the scope of activity allowed be expanded to include professional service businesses, non-profitable institutions and leisure activities.\nThe outcomes of those proposed pilot schemes in Hawick and Galashiels would then be used to draw up similar proposals for other towns.\nFootfall figures % change from 2007 to 2017:\nHawick

During this time there were three railway stations in Peebles \u0026ndash one where Tesco now stands, which was then extended to create a line to Galashiels the second in Dean Park and the third on Caledonian Road, serving travel to the west and Glasgow.\nThe rail link not only encouraged thousands of visitors, with The Hydro having its own spur, but underpinned the huge expansion of the weaving industry by providing fast, cheap links to world markets.\nUntil now there has been little recognition of the influence of the railway on the development of Peebles and, while some evidence can still be found in the Viaduct Bridge over the River Tweed and the railway tunnel connecting the bridge to the town, much has been lost.\nBut now railway enthusiasts are steaming ahead with plans to establish a museum which will house artefacts and photographs of historic trains during their journeys through Peebles.\nThe PCT is now hoping to gauge if there is an appetite amongst the people of Peebles for the museum.\nFurther investigations will have to be carried out, as it is believed the building is owned by Scottish Borders Council.\nIf the railway museum is given the green light, funding will be sought for the renovation of the old railway building. PCT chairman Lawrie Hayworth said: \u0026ldquoThis a really exciting project which can help us all have access to this important period in the town\u0026rsquos history, a period of rapid local transformation akin to the wider impact we see today with global internet access.\n\u0026ldquoThis should also boost visitor numbers to Peebles and provide economic benefit to the town. It is important to safeguard our heritage for future generations, and recognise the influential role the railway has played over the years.\nIf you would like to be involved in the project, contact PCT co-coordinator Alex Wilson at admin@peeblescommunity.org\n"},{"url":null,"title":"locals-saddle-up-for-newtown-st-boswells-farmers-show","story":"THE Newtown St Boswells and District Farmers \nShow\ntook place at St Boswells Auction Mart on Saturday.\nThe supreme winner of the show judged by Mr and Mrs Doddie Weir went to the hunter champion, the evergreen Fusilier, owned and ridden by Gillian McCowan.\nReserve supreme was Clive Storey\u0026rsquos Masquerade, who stood overall in the Coloured Section.\nDi and Joanna Walton judged the Ridden Hunters and their reserve was the runner up in the hunter class, Silver Dream Spirit, ridden by John Wilson from Selkirk.\nMorean Hamilton placed the In Hand Hunters and chose the winner of the two-year-old class as her Champion, West Country Lady Guinevere \u0026ndash a home bred filly owned by Sally Burns from Hawick.

The questions are:\n\u0026ndash Are my partner and I a \u0026lsquogood fit\u0026rsquo?\n\u0026ndash Do we have a strong basis of friendship?\n\u0026ndash Do we want the same things in our relationship

relationship is different, and it is important that couples build relationships that are meaningful to them, but we found thriving relationships share some fundamental qualities.\n\u0026ldquoMostly the couple have chosen a partner with whom they are a \u0026lsquogood fit\u0026rsquo and have ways of successfully navigating stressful times.\n\u0026ldquoThese 10 critical questions can help people

research in schools as an educational tool and pre-intervention measure.\n\u0026ldquoIf as a consequence of this, fundamentally incompatible partnerships are prevented, it will have been money well

during this period, and 10 other couples in same-sex and opposite-sex relationships, who had been living together, married or in a civil partnership for at least 15 years.\nThe lawyers and judges identified four common reasons for relationships to break down.\nThese are incompatibility, unrealistic expectations, failure to deal with issues and failure to nurture the

More of the same please.It was a good day for the Argyll favourites. A positive start which should continue at Kintyre Park against Pollock under 19s tomorrow with a 2pm kick off.

well-drilled, energetic and highly skilledPollock U19s.The visiting team had enough potential to produce players for the higher echelons of the game in the not too distant future.Coached by our Campbeltown\u0026#8217s Stuart Crossan, the Glasgow side impressed with their quick possession football and a willingness to close space, during a frantic opening quarter of a highly entertaining match, at the wonderfully prepared Kintyre Park.The visitors immediately seized the initiative using the ball effortlessly as they imposed their own brand of football across the full width of the park.The Campbeltown favourites were in no mood to play second fiddle and, after adjusting to Pollock’s enthusiastic start, the Pupils created a number of opportunities as Souden and Barr tested the defence down the flanks.The Pupils midfield and central defence dug deep to rest the initiative from their stubborn opponents, but gradually the pendulum swung as the home side played their way into the match.It was a fascinating encounter between two well-matched sides, a game enjoyed by what was a sizable crowd for a friendly fixture.The partisan home support were soon on song when the mercurial Sary Rhama broke free behind Pollock\u0026#8217s defence, a fleeting glimpse of goal before he was unceremoniously brought down from behind.Taking the penalty kick himself, the Pupil’s striker drove the ball straight down the middle to give the home side a slender advantage with 29 minutes on the clock.The pace was unrelenting, and the visitors were rewarded when the Pupils failed to clear their lines from a corner.In the ensuing play, the ball was skilfully carried to the touchline, before an accurate cutback found the incoming forward who drove the ball home at the second attempt beyond Ferguson.One each at half-time was a fair reflection, with neither side gaining the ascendancy.Both sides made a raft of changes in the second period.Pupils ‘blooded’ seven graduates from the under-16s eleven during the game.Pick of the day was an acrobatic scissors clearance from young Ross Brown,  saving the situation with a last ditch goal line clearance.Shortly after, the home side raced up-field to claim victory with a fine goal from player of the match, Ryan McConnachie.Instrumental in both defence and attack, Ryan controlled the ball expertly in the box, deftly shifted its position, before stroking the ‘leather’ beyond a stranded goalkeeper for a brilliant winning goal.A top drawer finish if there ever was one!Tomorrow Campbeltown Pupils bring top quality opposition

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.

A planning application for the substation by Inch Cape Offshore Limited (ICOL) was called in by Scottish Ministers in a controversial move in April and will now be decided by the reporter instead of the council.  ICOL wants to bring offshore energy from a planned windfarm off the Angus coast onto land at Cockenzie by building the substation on the footprint of the former power station.  A previous planning application siting the substation further inland had been given planning permission but that permission lapsed instead of renewing it, ICOL decided to pursue a new site.  In its argument to Scottish Ministers, the council will state that the substation is \u0026ldquonot the best use of the land and point out that planning permission had been given at another site.  Councillor Norman Hampshire said: \u0026ldquoBecause of the location, we have to recommend it should be refused. We have done a lot of work to move this proposal forward and this action jeopardises that.  \u0026ldquoI think if everybody had worked together we could have got a development on a site the council, developers and communities could have supported.  Earlier this month, representatives of ICOL were challenged by Prestonpans Community Council to name any independent party that support the planned location of the substation.  Brian Weddell, community council chairman, told the ICOL representatives that there had been no public consultation about the new site.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are against it, Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council are against it, East Lothian Council and Scottish Natural Heritage are against it.  \u0026ldquoShow us anyone, apart from Inch Cape, who think it is a good site.  Ian Johnson, ICOL project manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe are naturally disappointed that East Lothian Council officers have recommended refusal to the application on the grounds that it could prejudice future development of the area. ICOL have been and will continue to work with the council to look at options to reduce the footprint of the site and ensure that other potential future developments can co-exist next to the substation.  However, he made it clear there were no plans to consider an alternative site, telling the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe have no intention of moving the proposed site of the onshore transmission works again.

They also found five secondary tumours at the top of his spine.  By the age of 13, the brave teenager had completed a high dose of radiotherapy to his brain and spinal cord following a biopsy.  Despite his health challenges, Paul, who is now 30, received a Bachelor of Engineering with Honours in Computer Systems and Networks degree at a graduation ceremony at the Usher Hall last week.  His family, including mum Angela, 52, and sisters Laura, 34, and Aleigh, 21, were filled with pride to see him receive his degree.  He was also awarded the Rob Kemmer Prize, receiving \u0026pound100 in recognition of his \u0026ldquooutstanding achievements on his individual programme of study.  Paul, of Burns Wynd, is now planning to return to Napier after the summer to complete his Master\u0026rsquos Degree.

Angela revealed that Paul was a pupil at Musselburgh Grammar School when his condition was first diagnosed.  She said: \u0026ldquoPaul was having trouble with his eyesight and the school contacted me to say they thought it was getting worse.  \u0026ldquoIt was when he was referred to the Eye Pavilion in Edinburgh they discovered the tumours were the cause of it.  \u0026ldquoHe had multifocal germinoma tumours and secondary cancer caused the spinal lesions.  Although the radiotherapy cured his tumour, it had other detrimental effects.  Paul is registered blind as a result of the radiotherapy to his visual nerves and also has a curvature of the spine.  The pituitary gland in his brain has failed completely, so he needs to take hormone replacements and he also finds it difficult to open his jaw, which is thought to be due to scar tissue following radiotherapy.  It was when he was working as a volunteer at Musselburgh Citizens Advice Bureau that Paul first became interested in developing his computer skills, attending both Edinburgh College and Napier for four years.  Angela said: \u0026ldquoPaul doesn\u0026rsquot have an assistant at Napier and he travels there independently.  \u0026ldquoHe has some vision out of the side of one eye and the centre of the other.  \u0026ldquoThe university helped with extra large screens for him and giving him more time his teachers are all delighted for him.

It took a while to get here from secondary school.  \u0026ldquoI am looking forward to returning to Napier for a year to do my Master\u0026rsquos Degree. They have given huge support.

The artwork will be completed with a series of stainless steel arrows installed at different locations around Musselburgh. They are expected to be installed later this summer and will form a trail around the town to areas of cultural, historical, natural and community significance, supported by a Global Treasure App organised by Musselburgh Area Partnership.

WHAT do we remember of our childhood in our later days? Think for a moment of the key happy memories which have framed your childhood. They are often simple ones involving play outside. Sadly, research is showing that children are increasingly less able to explore and play in the outdoors.  There are various reasons for this and there is a horrible irony at the centre of it. We have become far more obsessed with material things, it\u0026rsquos all around us. We are literally buying into the idea that happiness is about purchase and we are passing this on to our children.  It\u0026rsquos in our brains that the economy needs us to spend our money on things we don\u0026rsquot need. We are fed an ideology that spending money on stuff is not just a pleasure but a civic duty. It keeps the economy going and makes us all prosperous. That\u0026rsquos what we are made to believe.  But the result is that more than ever, for our children and ourselves, we are enslaved to the interests of corporate profit at the expense of what really matters: simple time to be and enjoy free pleasures.  These were my thoughts as I set off for the second of this summer\u0026rsquos journeys of discovery. I didn\u0026rsquot share them at the time, and of course I stopped thinking about them as the magic of the wood engulfed us.  We began our journey amongst yew trees which surrounded the ancient kirk of Garvald. It was a scorching day and the shade of trees was such a relief. The plan was to spend the day exploring the wood and discover Stoneypath Castle.  Garvald Kirk has a simple beauty. While parts of its wall are 800 years old, it has been subject to renovation and alteration over the last 200 years. There is a welcoming atmosphere inside and I reflected that when not being used for services it would make a perfect storytelling venue.  By the door there is a reminder of how religion can change its spots. A set of jougs hangs on the wall: an iron collar and chain once used to humiliate and degrade \u0026lsquosinners\u0026rsquo by chaining them up. The victims of this would have been mainly young women who became pregnant out of wedlock.  It\u0026rsquos right that it remains there, I think, as a reminder that religion can be used as a justification for intolerance, hate and cruelty as well as a source for love and compassion. The choice of which version to adhere to is a human one.  We followed the rabbits which scattered from the kirkyard into the wood. I was surprised that the Papana Water, which flows through the wood, was so full given there had been no real rain for weeks  It\u0026rsquos impossible to be bored in a wood. Hours were soaked up under the cooling shade of the tree canopy. It was quite simply a day of utter magic. We had our picnic under the shade of two giant Scots pine trees with the sound of running water in the background. It was the only real quiet moment in what would be hours of constant play. The kids just sat for a while, listening to the running water, and looking up at the trees. It was a communion of simple joy.  The walk isn\u0026rsquot so long in distance but it took us around five hours to complete. It could be done in 20 minutes or less if you just walk. But we didn\u0026rsquot just walk, we explored. There are three bridges which cross the Papana. Each one had a different attraction. Shoes were soon off and clothes got wet but the heat meant none of this mattered. A new game was devised when our youngest, Lewis, tried to use a piece of half-eaten banana as a substitute for a stick while playing \u0026lsquoPoohsticks\u0026rsquo . The girls rushed into the river to reclaim it, but then came up with a new game \u0026lsquohunt the banana\u0026rsquo.  After spending time at various points by the river, getting wet and discovering lots of things, we finally reached the walk\u0026rsquos end: Stoneypath Tower. It suddenly appears above the trees as if out of a fairy tale, its newly restored red walls and parapets a contrast to the green we were surrounded by.  There is much history in the castle, but then again there is history in the woods and hills.  As we headed back to Garvald the kids were quieter, tired by adventure, but in a joyful way. The image of my kids standing in the water, playing and searching for fish seemed to symbolise something immemorial: a powerful and simple truth that what we really need is an immersion in nature, not stuff that hijacks our wellbeing in the name of profit.  We surely stepped on the footprints of Robert Neillans on our return. He was a well-known cooper who lived in Garvald over 200 years ago. Perhaps he came foraging here, I thought. As the water sparkled in the sunshine I reflected that the making of \u0026lsquoillicit whisky\u0026rsquo was once common hereabouts and that Robert was, according to local historian Irene Anderson, one of those involved.  We walked past the house he built on the banks of the Papana when we returned to Garvald. What tales this village could tell!  We\u0026rsquod been \u0026lsquoaway\u0026rsquo for a total of nearly six hours in a magic place. But we\u0026rsquod met only one person walking her dog. In one sense that was a joy, and the absence of litter was another.

Taylor Wimpey East Scotland has teamed up with Mactaggart and Mickel Homes \u0026ndash both of which are already building on the adjacent Letham Mains site, where more than 800 homes are being built \u0026ndash for the plans on Haddington\u0026rsquos south-western edge.  The early proposals, which will be unveiled to the public later this year, show about 300 homes, with a quarter of those being affordable.  Included in the plans are provision for roads and drainage infrastructure, off-site road improvements, as well as land being set aside for play areas and open space.  The Proposal of Application Notice (PAN) is the first step in the planning process, with the idea of housing on the site, off the A6093.  The land outlined for the development is identified for housing in the new Local Development Plan and, according to the developers, will be designed to integrate with the Letham Mains development.  The public exhibition will give both housebuilders the opportunity to share their proposals for the development with members of the public and other interested parties, and for feedback to be passed to the developer.  A detailed planning application is expected later this year.  Joanne Casey, director of Mactaggart \u0026amp Mickel Homes, speaking on behalf of both developers, said the PAN allowed the developers to \u0026ldquobegin the important process of community engagement.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe are fully committed to a detailed programme of engagement with local communities throughout the lifetime of our developments.  \u0026ldquoFor large-scale development projects like this one at Letham Holdings, we are especially keen to fully engage as early as possible in the overall process to allow us to understand and consider the views from as many stakeholders as we can.  \u0026ldquoWe will hold a joint public consultation event during the next few months and we would like to take this opportunity to encourage all interested individuals to become involved.  \u0026ldquoThis event will allow the local community to share their views so that we may consider these as we develop our emerging development proposal in order to make a detailed planning application around October this year."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8064331.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"east-lothians-chief-nurse-takes-on-health-director-role","story":"  Alison Macdonald has been appointed to replace David Small, who left the post last month to take up a new role as director of primary care transition with NHS Lothian.

The 63-year-old passed away on March 2, having been minister at St Mary\u0026rsquos Parish Church for more than a decade.  Now her sister Susan Gibson, along with daughters Laura Burgess and Elaine Macrae, will be joined by nieces Clare Furze and Kara Wallace and granddaughters Ciara Burgess and Isla Burgess in the running-themed fundraisers.  Susan said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom the runner in the family and I have always done a fundraising event every year.  \u0026ldquoJennifer was a great supporter, she was not a runner herself but she would tease me about the time I had done at the event.  \u0026ldquoShe was a huge supporter and always contributed generously to what I was running for.  \u0026ldquoAfter she had the terminal diagnosis, one thing we talked about was that I would organise some kind of running thing for the family.  \u0026ldquoIt was her choice to go with Edinburgh Maggie\u0026rsquos Centre because she had such amazing support there.  The charity, which has been based in Edinburgh since 1996, offers support to people with cancer and their family and friends.  The centres offer not only practical advice about benefits and eating well but qualified experts provide emotional support and the centres offer a chance to meet people or simply sit quietly with a cup of tea.  Team Jenny, which includes seven-year-old Isla, will in varying combinations be clocking up nearly 200 kilometres of timed runs throughout the summer.  Originally, the plan was for the seven family members to take part together in the same event.  However, with the family spread out in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Coleraine, it proved impossible.  Instead they are taking on half a dozen different events before combining both the distance and fundraising totals together.  Elaine, 32, has already completed the Baker Hughes 10k in Aberdeen, while Kara, 28, and her husband, Duncan, will be joined by Clare, 32, Elaine and Susan at the Run the Blades event at Whitelee Wind Farm, near Eaglesham, this month.  Meanwhile in Portrush, Northern Ireland, Susan will join Laura, 36, together with her daughters Ciara, 13, and Isla, at the Portrush Park Run.  Clare, Elaine, Kara and Susan will all take part in the Great Aberdeen Run 10k next month before Susan\u0026rsquos attention turns to the Scottish 10k, which starts and finishes at Musselburgh Racecourse in September.  Finally, Elaine and Susan will take on the Great Scottish Run Half Marathon in Glasgow, with Laura\u0026rsquos husband Barry competing in the Belfast City Half Marathon in September.  The family set an initial fundraising target of \u0026pound1,000 before increasing that to \u0026pound3,000 but both have already been smashed, with nearly \u0026pound5,000 already raised.  Susan said: \u0026ldquoIt is amazing.  \u0026ldquoPeople are just so incredibly generous and I think that is a measure of Jennifer and Maggie\u0026rsquos and the affection and respect people have for Maggie\u0026rsquos.  \u0026ldquoWe are very fortunate it is a very close family.  \u0026ldquoJennifer was very caring, had a great sense of humour and she was honest.  \u0026ldquoYou could always depend on her \u0026ndash it might not be what you wanted to hear but what you needed to hear.  \u0026ldquoShe had that ability to be completely honest without ever being harsh or unkind.  \u0026ldquoShe was incredibly supportive of the family and everybody in it.

Mrs Reid, known as Kit, told how she exchanged early memories of her nursing career and the transition into the NHS with the royal guest.  She said: \u0026ldquoMy first pay was two pound notes and a 10 shilling note. The week before national health it was seven (shillings) and six (pence).  Mrs Reid, of Haddington worked as a nurse from 1946 until 1952 and spent some of her career at Edinburgh\u0026rsquos Royal Hospital for Sick Children. The grandmother of five, with triplets in Seattle and a grandson in Saskatchewan, Canada, and a further grandson at the University of Edinburgh, said: \u0026ldquoThe Duke was absolutely normal.  \u0026ldquoHe spoke to me and asked various things about the work I had done.  \u0026ldquoObviously he had been briefed because he asked me about the pay and for what felt like a long time he spoke to me.  \u0026ldquoHe was just so charming \u0026ndash it was the thrill of a lifetime, the whole thing.  \u0026ldquoI met so many wonderfully interesting people \u0026ndash people from Orkney and Shetland, from all over Scotland, with their own stories to tell.  \u0026ldquoIt was just absolutely wonderful \u0026ndash I even got to walk on a red carpet.  Mrs Reid said that the NHS had made a massive difference to the way of life across Scotland and said she was \u0026ldquoall for the NHS.  The 90-year-old, who also met Scotland\u0026rsquos new Health Secretary Jeane Freeman MSP, added: \u0026ldquoMy first memory of work was the knowledge that the hospital was getting much busier and there were more children coming in and going out cured. Before that, the parents couldn\u0026rsquot afford medical help and were leaving it too late for their children to come in and many of them didn\u0026rsquot make it.  \u0026ldquoAlso I remember saying to the sister I was working with at the time: \u0026lsquoThe parents coming in now have lost their terribly haunted look because they know now they can bring their children in.\u0026rsquo  She told how the nurses had to live on-site in those days and would therefore tend to give up work when they became married.  Mrs Reid added: \u0026ldquoWe weren\u0026rsquot allowed to live out of hospital, we had to stay in the nurses\u0026rsquo homes.  \u0026ldquoI loved it \u0026ndash I loved the camaraderie, I loved the company, I loved everything about it.  \u0026ldquoIt wasn\u0026rsquot all drudgery and hard work, we had lots of fun into the bargain.  The evening reception, attended by 700 people, was one of a series of events taking place around the UK to mark 70 years since the health service was founded.

Her dad Stan mounted the first major expedition to the caves, in the Andes Mountains in the east of the country, alongside astronaut Neil Armstrong in 1976.  Eileen, 31, will return to the country where she was born as part of a team including Mercury-nominated artist, producer and collaborator Jon Hopkins and neuroscientist Mendel Kaelen, as well as photographers, architects and filmmakers.  Eileen said: \u0026ldquoAfter a 10-year solo adventure into the depths of the Legend of Tayos and my father\u0026rsquos work, it is a real honour to be joined in this quest to protect the caves by such an inspiring group of fellow explorers with a collective knowledge and talent beyond anything I could have imagined was possible.  \u0026ldquoI am excited to be part of the efforts to continue what my father and Neil Armstrong started back in the 1970s and have renewed hope in the efforts of protecting these precious, beautiful and fragile environments from devastating destruction.  The trip, which costs about $50,000, is an eight-day creative expedition and will result in experiences, observations and documentation transformed into an exhibition in 2020. It is hoped the exhibition will shine a light on a drive to make Cueva de los Tayos\u0026rsquo unique and endangered ecosystem a UNESCO World Heritage site.  Eileen, who was born in the country\u0026rsquos capital Quito, moved to Dunbar in 1997, with mum Janeth working in Cherrytrees Nursery.  A small display of Ecuadorian items has been created in BeGreen Dunbar\u0026rsquos shop window on High Street as part of the donation campaign to fund the trip.

The move was greeted with concern from councillors, who shared parents\u0026rsquo fears over the future of the service for families using Wee Scones, which provided nursery places for 45 children.  The nursery will now be run by Jacqueline Robertson, who has operated childminding service Precious Memories in Tranent for seven years.  Jacqueline announced plans to close Precious Memories last Friday as she confirmed she would be taking on the manager role at Wee Scones.

The crew chose East Lothian due to its great surfing beaches and its film charter \u0026ndash an agreement between council departments to work together to accommodate film requests in the East Lothian area wherever possible.  In past years, East Lothian has been the backdrop for films including The Railway Man, starring Colin Firth and Nicole Kidman, and Steven Spielberg\u0027s The BFG.

The projected top seven routes for Friday are:  \u0026ndash Heathrow to Dublin  \u0026ndash Heathrow to New York  \u0026ndash Heathrow to Frankfurt  \u0026ndash Gatwick to Barcelona  \u0026ndash Gatwick to Malaga  \u0026ndash Gatwick to Majorca  \u0026ndash Gatwick to Faro  More than 15% of the flights departing from and arriving to the UK will be going through Heathrow (around 1390 flights), while Gatwick will have around 940 flights and Stansted around 670 flights, the second and third busiest airports respectively.  Manchester airport will handle around 700 flights, while Birmingham is predicted to manage 380 flights. Scottish transport hubs Glasgow and Edinburgh are expected to manage 320 and 440 flights respectively.  Nats predicts the busiest time of day will be 6.40am to 7.40am, with up to 660 aircraft filling Britain\u0026rsquos skies in this hour alone.  Jamie Hutchison, director at Nats\u0026rsquo Swanwick control centre in Hampshire, said: \u0026ldquoWith hundreds of thousands of people setting off on their holidays today, Britain\u0026rsquos air traffic controllers will be working harder than ever to ensure everyone can get away safely and on time.  \u0026ldquoOver the past 12 months we have seen an extra 700,000 flights in UK airspace and further growth is expected over the coming years.  \u0026ldquoAirspace is the invisible part of our infrastructure just like our roads and railways, it means we can get where we want, when we want.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos for this reason that Nats is launching the #SkyByNumbers campaign, to raise awareness of the role airspace plays in every part of our everyday lives.  \u0026ldquoAirspace is vital, not only in getting us from A to B, whether that\u0026rsquos for business or pleasure, but also in bringing everything from coffee and chocolate to flowers and fruit direct to our shops and tables every day.  The busiest summer day for flights coincides with travel retailers, airports and airlines joining together to unveil a summer passenger awareness campaign to encourage people to fly responsibly.  The One Too Many campaign was launched on Friday by the Aviation Minister, Baroness Sugg.  It reminds passengers of the costs of drinking to excess when travelling by air.

The campaign will be rolled out via a national Facebook and Instagram social media campaign and in nine pilot airports across the UK.  Baroness Sugg, said: \u0026ldquoDisruptive passengers have the potential to ruin other people\u0026rsquos flights, and this campaign is an important new step to ensure all passengers are aware of the consequences they face if they behave disruptively after drinking before or on board a flight.  \u0026ldquoI am pleased to see the industry come together to ensure the experiences at our airports and on flights remain positive for everyone."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8125706.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"10-critical-questions-for-any-relationship","story":"  Long-term relationships last when they are built on friendship, respect, realistic expectations, shared interests and humour.  Evidence from couples, as well as family lawyers, mediators and judges has helped identify the 10 key aspects of a relationship which other couples can use to reflect on to see if they are likely to thrive and stand the test of time.  Continuing to ask the 10 critical questions can also help couples build their relationship. The questions are:  \u0026ndash Are my partner and I a \u0026lsquogood fit\u0026rsquo?  \u0026ndash Do we have a strong basis of friendship?  \u0026ndash Do we want the same things in our relationship and out of life?  \u0026ndash Are our expectations realistic?  \u0026ndash Do we generally see the best in each other?  \u0026ndash Do we both work at keeping our relationship vibrant?  \u0026ndash Do we both feel we can discuss things freely and raise issues with each other?  \u0026ndash Are we both committed to working through hard times?  \u0026ndash When we face stressful circumstances would we pull together to get through it?  \u0026ndash Do we each have supportive others around us?  The study, which was conducted by the University of Exeter, has been supported by Baroness Shackleton, a famous divorce lawyer, who has represented the likes of the Prince of Wales, Sir Paul McCartney and Liam Gallagher.  Professor Anne Barlow, who led the research, said: \u0026ldquoOf course every relationship is different, and it is important that couples build relationships that are meaningful to them, but we found thriving relationships share some fundamental qualities.  \u0026ldquoMostly the couple have chosen a partner with whom they are a \u0026lsquogood fit\u0026rsquo and have ways of successfully navigating stressful times.  \u0026ldquoThese 10 critical questions can help people as they decide if they are compatible with a person they are considering sharing their life with and flag the importance of dealing with issues when they arise as well as of nurturing the relationship over time.  Baroness Shackleton said: \u0026ldquoWearing my \u0026lsquoprofessional hat\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash as a divorce lawyer for over 40 years \u0026ndash more than 50% of the people consulting me about divorce have said they realised either before or very soon into their marriages, that they were fundamentally incompatible with their partners.  \u0026ldquoWearing my \u0026lsquoeducational hat\u0026rsquo, as a former school governor, I am acutely aware that whilst there is much school directed education on \u0026lsquosex\u0026rsquo, \u0026lsquodrugs\u0026rsquo and \u0026lsquoalcohol\u0026rsquo, there is little or none in relation to the most important decision a person makes \u0026ndash namely with whom you settle down and have children.  \u0026ldquoFinally, wearing my \u0026lsquophilanthropic hat\u0026rsquo and seeing the untold grief children suffer when their parents separate, I felt it time to sponsor a project exploring just what makes a relationship successful and how best to maximise the chances of it succeeding, the idea being to present the resulting research in schools as an educational tool and pre-intervention measure.  \u0026ldquoIf as a consequence of this, fundamentally incompatible partnerships are prevented, it will have been money well spent.  The experts interviewed 10 divorce lawyers/mediators and two judges to ask them the key reasons relationships fail.  They also interviewed 43 couples married for 10 years, or who had separated during this period, and 10 other couples in same-sex and opposite-sex relationships, who had been living together, married or in a civil partnership for at least 15 years.  The lawyers and judges identified four common reasons for relationships to break down.  These are incompatibility, unrealistic expectations, failure to deal with issues and failure to nurture the relationship."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8116099.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"what-the-papers-say-july-27","story":"  The Times leads with an investigation into social networking site Facebook, with the paper claiming that anti-Semitic posts are allowed to remain on the site despite being flagged.

For those who can\u0026rsquot make it to an event, there will be a webinar available where you can learn more about what a deposit return scheme could mean for Scotland.  Under a deposit return scheme, customers pay a small deposit when they buy drinks in, for example, a bottle or a can, and then get the deposit back when they return the empty container for recycling. A public consultation on a deposit return scheme for Scotland was officially opened by the Scottish Government last month (Wednesday 27 June, 2018).  Cabinet Secretary for the Environment, Climate Change and Land Reform, Roseanna Cunningham, said: \u0026ldquoA deposit return scheme will provide a new secure source of high quality material which will create opportunities to develop our recycling infrastructure in Scotland and create jobs. This will also improve the availability of recycled material for use in the production of bottles and cans in future.  \u0026ldquoI would encourage everyone with an interest to provide their views on how this scheme can meet Scotland\u0026rsquos needs and help us tackle our throwaway culture.  Iain Gulland, Chief Executive, Zero Waste Scotland, said: \u0026ldquoPeople will make this scheme a success \u0026ndash for our environment and our economy. The Scottish Government and Zero Waste Scotland have committed to designing the best possible deposit return scheme for Scotland. We want it to work for everyone \u0026ndash and that\u0026rsquos why we\u0026rsquore calling on as many people as possible to have their say.  \u0026ldquoWith thanks to support from a wide range of partners we are delighted to be out and about this summer, on behalf of the Scottish Government, visiting a wide range of events and locations across the country \u0026ndash from border towns to Inverness \u0026ndash asking everyone for their views on how a deposit return scheme could work best for them.  Following a successful first event at Glasgow Fort in June, Zero Waste Scotland will be at some of the country\u0026rsquos top events and attractions this summer \u0026ndash including ButeFest, the European Open Water Swimming Championships (part of Glasgow 2018), Edinburgh Mela, and Aviemore Triathlon.  The current programme of public engagement events is as follows:\u0026nbsp  July 25: Deep Sea World, North Queensferry  July 27-29:\u0026nbspButeFest, Isle of Bute  August 1: Scottish Seabird Centre, North Berwick  August 11:\u0026nbspEuropean Open Water Swimming Championships, Balloch  August 12: Aviemore Triathlon, Aviemore  August 22: St Enoch Centre, Glasgow  August 25: Peebles Market  August 31:\u0026nbspDundee Food and Flower Show  September 1 -2: Edinburgh Mela  September 5: Eastgate Shopping Centre, Inverness  September 14 - 16: Perth Food and Drink Festival  Members of the Zero Waste Scotland team will be at Deep Sea World on Wednesday, July 25\u0026nbspfrom 10am to 3pm to ask visitors and staff about choices such as the level of deposit which products should have a deposit on them where they should be able to take their empty drinks containers to get the deposit back and whether they\u0026rsquod welcome the option to donate the deposit in certain circumstances \u0026ndash for example to charities, schools or community groups.  Zero Waste Scotland staff will also be available to chat through four hypothetical examples of how Scotland\u0026rsquos deposit return scheme could work \u0026ndash which are based on 12 main factors to be considered when designing a deposit return scheme. These examples aim to help people understand how different factors of a deposit return scheme could vary to create different scheme designs with different outcomes for Scotland.  Full details on the main factors and examples are available to view as part of the public consultation on the Scottish Government website: https://consult.gov.scot/environment-forestry/deposit-return-scheme.  Fraser Edwards, Sales and Marketing Manager, Deep Sea World, said: \u0026ldquoWe are delighted to welcome Zero Waste Scotland to Deep Sea World to engage with our visitors and gather people\u0026rsquos opinions on a deposit return scheme for Scotland. From news coverage and documentaries to community action groups and social media, it is evident that we need to make a change to the materials which our goods are packaged in and how we dispose of them. At Deep Sea World, we aim to educate our visitors on the importance of protecting our oceans and reducing single-use plastics.  \u0026ldquoAs a business and as individuals, we know that it can be challenging when looking for alternatives to traditional plastic packaging. Measures such as a Scottish deposit return scheme however make it easier for all of us to take these positive steps for a cleaner, more sustainable future.  Zero Waste Scotland research shows over 64,000 tonnes of plastic food packaging and plastic bottles is thrown away into household general rubbish bins and sent to landfill every year in Scotland, costing the country a staggering \u0026pound11million each year. Meanwhile evidence shows countries with deposit return schemes operating overseas can reach over 90% recycling for targeted drinks containers, such as bottles and cans.

This compares to 186 last year, 159 the year before and 128 in 2015.  Ken Muir, chief executive of the General Teaching Council of Scotland (GTCS), said applications were \u0026ldquofalling off a cliff and placed the blame firmly with Brexit.  He told Holyrood magazine: \"Having maintained numbers pretty high from the EU, they are falling off a cliff, and that\u0027s absolutely down to Brexit.  \"Particularly from three countries in the EU, Greece, Poland and Spain, we get a good number of applicants, followed by the Republic of Ireland it has to be said \u0026ndash those four are our big hitters, and those numbers have dwindled to next to nothing.\"  The overall number of applicants from outside Scotland has also plummeted, with only 126 in the first half of 2018 \u0026ndash compared to 598 last year and 614 the year before.  A spokeswoman for the EIS \u0026ndash Scotland\u0026rsquos biggest teaching union \u0026ndash insisted teachers from other countries \u0026ldquoare a valuable part of the Scottish education workforce, reflecting the society we live in.  She added: \u0026ldquoThis reported drop in applications can only exacerbate the ongoing teacher recruitment crisis.  Research by the Herald last summer showed there were more than 700 unfilled teacher vacancies before the start of term, with the shortfall blamed on a rise in numbers quitting the profession early and historic under-recruitment.  And earlier this year it emerged a teaching post in the north of Scotland had\u0026nbspbeen advertised six times by desperate council bosses \u0026ndash attracting just two applicants.  The latest figures came as teaching unions threatened to strike later this year amid an ongoing dispute over pay.  Scottish ministers said\u0026nbspthe dramatic drop in EU teachers demonstrated the urgent need for migration powers to be devolved, allowing Scotland to tailor policies to its needs.  Deputy First Minister John Swinney said: \u0026ldquoThese figures show the stark reality of Brexit. Already highly-skilled and hard-working EU citizens are thinking twice about choosing to live and teach in Scotland which will not only have a negative impact on the education workforce but our economy and society as a whole.  \u0026ldquoLast year we had citizens from almost every EU member country applying for GTCS registration but, so far this year, citizens from just six countries have applied to live and work in Scotland. And the head of the GTCS \u0026ndash the independent body that registers teachers \u0026ndash has today made plain that Brexit is driving this slump.  Scottish Labour\u0026rsquos education spokesman Iain Gray branded the figures \u0026ldquodeeply worrying.  He said teacher numbers had already plummeted under the SNP Government, and referenced a survey published last month which found a majority of teachers would not recommend the profession to others.  He added: \u0026ldquoA collapse in the number of applications from abroad as a result of the Tories\u0026rsquo shambolic handling of Brexit will only make this SNP teacher recruitment crisis worse.  Ross Greer, the Scottish Greens\u0026rsquo education spokesman, said teachers are \u0026ldquooverworked and under-resourced, adding: \u0026ldquoThis is yet another way in which Brexit, which Scotland overwhelmingly rejected, is already damaging our society.  A UK Government spokeswoman said: \"We deeply value the contribution of all EU citizens working in the UK\u0026rsquos education systems, they are vital to the future of our children and valued members of society.  \"After we leave the EU, we will have in place an immigration system which works in the best interests of the whole of the UK, including Scotland.  \"Freedom of movement will end and we be will creating an immigration system that delivers control over who comes to the UK, but that welcomes the brightest and best who want to work hard and contribute.\""},{"url":null,"title":"theresa-may-public-should-be-reassured-and-comforted-by-government-stockpiling-in-case-of-no-deal-brexit","story":"  The Prime Minister\u0026rsquos remarks came after Simon Coveney, the Irish deputy premier, dismissed talk of a no-deal as \u0026ldquobravado and warned Britain that it \u0026ldquocould not afford to crash out of the European Union without an agreement.  In an interview with 5 News, Mrs May did not deny stockpiling was happening and insisted the Government was being \"responsible and sensible\" while still trying to get a good deal with Brussels.  Her comments came as Philip Hammond, the Chancellor, on a visit to Belfast, also insisted no-deal contingency planning was a \u0026ldquosensible and responsible thing for a government to do and large businesses that are importing or exporting large volumes of products or produce will be making contingency plans.  He added: \u0026ldquoAnd we would encourage them to do so and work closely with them as they are putting those plans together.\"  Earlier this week, Matt Hancock, the UK Health Secretary, told MPs he had asked officials to \"work up options for stockpiling\" by the pharmaceutical industry while his Cabinet colleague Dominic Raab, the Brexit Secretary, said the Government would also take steps to ensure an \"adequate food supply\".  The PM said: \"Far from being worried about preparations that we are making, I would say that people should take reassurance and comfort from the fact that the Government is saying we are in a negotiation, we are working for a good deal - I believe we can get a good deal - but...because we don\u0027t know what the outcome is going to be... let\u0027s prepare for every eventuality.  \"This is not just about stockpiling. That concept, what it is, is about making sure that we will be able to continue to do the things that are necessary once we have left the European Union, if we leave without a deal.\"  Her comments came as a new poll suggested trust in her ability to handle Brexit was falling quickly.  An ICM poll for  found she had an eight-point lead over Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn over who could be trusted to negotiate a good Brexit deal down from 16 points in January and 34 points before the 2017 General Election.  On the parties\u0026rsquo standing, it put Labour on 41 per cent, up two points from a fortnight ago, Tories down one point on 40 per cent, with Lib Dems on eight points, Ukip on five and the Greens on three.  Earlier, Mr Coveney made clear Dublin would back any request from the UK for an extension to the Article 50 process to give more time to negotiate its withdrawal from the EU.  While he said there was still time to reach agreement by October, he called for an \"intensification\" of the talks at official level over the summer to resolve outstanding differences.  The Irish minister warned that certain elements of the UK negotiating position as set out in the UK Government\u0026rsquos Brexit White Paper would be difficult for Brussels to agree to although he noted that the document had made negotiations \"easier\" by backing away from earlier red lines.  Mr Coveney dismissed suggestions that amendments to the Brexit legislation had forced on the PM by Eurosceptic backbenchers would prevent agreement on a \"backstop\" arrangement for the Northern Irish border.  His remarks came ahead of a meeting on Thursday between Dominic Raab, the Brexit Secretary, and Michel Barnier, the EU\u0026rsquos chief negotiator, and Mrs May\u0026rsquos trip to Salzburg on Friday for talks with her Austrian counterpart.  On Tuesday, the PM confirmed that as the Brexit talks entered their final weeks she was taking personal charge of them with Mr Raab \"deputising\" for her in Brussels.  Tory Eurosceptics voiced concerns that the Brexit Department had been \u0026ldquosidelined by No 10 and Mrs May\u0027s Europe chief adviser Olly Robbins, amid increasing speculation that divisions within the Conservative camp could result in a no-deal Brexit.  In a separate development, Lord Trimble, the former First Minister of Northern Ireland, warned that any attempt by the Irish Government to impose post-Brexit tariffs on trade with the UK would lead to an upsurge in smuggling at the Irish border.  The Conservative peer said an increase in smuggling would have the \"delightful\" side-effect of diverting criminal elements away from paramilitary activity by giving them something more useful to do.  But he said the better solution would be the removal or reduction of tariffs across the whole British Isles.  The former leader of the Ulster Unionist Party called on Dublin to press Brussels for a British Isles exemption from the requirement to collect tariffs on trade with countries outside the EU.  \"It\u0027s in its own interests for them to speak to the EU about tariffs and about the reduction or elimination of tariffs within the British Isles.  \"That would be a huge step forward for everyone and it would solve all the other problems, including the problems that have been manufactured by people over the course of the last year or so,\" added Lord Trimble."},{"url":null,"title":"theresa-may-pledges-post-brexit-farming-industry-fit-for-the-future","story":"  The Prime Minister will set out the UK Government\u0027s plans for a post-Brexit farming policy, explaining how the EU\u0027s Common Agricultural Policy subsidy system based on land farmed will be replaced with a system of public money for public goods.  She will make clear to local farmers and food producers that she is committed to safeguarding animal welfare, supporting the production of high quality produce and protecting the farmed environment.  \"Leaving the EU presents us with a unique opportunity to transform our food, farming and environmental policies so we can have a healthy and prosperous agricultural industry that is fit for the future and helps us to leave the environment in a better place than we found it.  \"Scrapping the Common Agricultural Policy and introducing a simpler system which provides funds in return for public goods, like improving water quality, reducing emissions and planting wild flower meadows to boost biodiversity, is fundamental to our new approach, Mrs May declared.  \"I want to make the most of the freedoms provided by Brexit to design a new scheme that is less bureaucratic and does away with the overly prescriptive information farmers currently have to provide to apply for grants.\"  In a roundtable with farmers, landowners and agricultural organisations in Llanelwedd, the PM will also reiterate her commitment to maintaining current funding levels until the end of this Parliament to ensure farmers have the certainty they need to plan for their business.  She added: \u0026ldquoThis Government is committed to supporting the half a million people who work in agriculture and growing our world leading food and drinks sector, which contributes over \u0026pound100 billion to the UK economy. But we also need to protect the farmed environment for future generations."},{"url":null,"title":"david-pratt-peaceful-election-handover-possible-so-long-as-pakistan-military-get-their-man","story":"  After Pakistan went to the polls in a general election yesterday, the ballot and its aftermath continues to be marred by endless and increasingly bitter allegations of malpractice and manipulation.  Violence, bombings, corruption, and above all the ubiquitous and pernicious influence of the military and intelligence services have always made elections in Pakistan fraught affairs.  Yesterday\u0026rsquos vote was no exception with the election getting off to the worst possible start. In thewestern city of Quettaa suicide bomber killed at least 29 people near a polling station, marking the beginning of a divisive election contest pitting cricket hero Imran Khan against the party of jailed ex-Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.  With so much at stake and given Pakistan\u0026rsquos\u0026rsquo past election record, it would have been too much to expect this poll to be violence free.  No prime minister in the country\u0027s history has ever completed a full five-year term in office. With the polls now closed and if things continue to run smoothly, then it will only be the second time there has been a civilian-to-civilian handover of power after a full term. The first was in 2013.  But even with voting now finished many Pakistanis stillexpect an acrimonious election aftermath. True to historical form, the country\u0026rsquos military top brass and shadowy influential security service, the Inter-Services Intelligence Directorate (ISI), have consistently made their presence felt throughout the election campaign. Few expect that to change.  For months running up to the election, accusations have grown that the military and ISI were the hidden power behind Mr Khan\u0026rsquos bid to become Prime Minister.  Pakistan watchers point to themilitary\u0026rsquos guiding hand being visible in the partisan judiciary that went after ex-Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif who now languishes in jail with his daughter.  Sharif\u0026rsquos accusation, made earlier this year, that the Pakistani army facilitated the deadly 2008 terrorist attack in the Indian city of Mumbai, is widely believed to have crossed the line, one that a pliant Pakistan media dubbed as \u0026ldquotreacherous.  For decades Pakistan\u0026rsquos military leadership has regarded itself as the custodian of the nation, one still defined by its birth in the bloody partition of the Indian subcontinent in 1947.  While the military has denied it has backed any particular candidate in this latest vote, observers have warned that the security forces have helped promote candidates running for Mr Khan\u0026rsquos PTI party, and moved to silence its opposition.  Most analysts are convinced that the military\u0026rsquos favourite is Mr Khan or the \u0026ldquoladla\", or spoilt child, as he has been dubbed by by his opponents.  The fact that almost 400,000 troops were deployed at polling stations yesterday to prevent terrorist attacks only further raised suspicions as to the army\u0026rsquos intentions.  \u0026ldquoThe so called soft creeping coup which was conceived by the deep state and midwifed by the judiciary during the last few years has not only culminated in full fledged authoritarian control but has also acquired some hard dimensions, warned Afrasiab Khattak, a former Pakistan senator and political analyst in Pakistan daily newspaper The Nation before yesterday\u0026rsquos vote.  Others shared his concern including the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) who warned of \u0026ldquoblatant, aggressive, and unabashed attempts to manipulate the outcome of the elections.  According to independent international election observers, many were unable to gain visas until days before the vote. Typically such monitoring officials are usually in a country for weeks ahead of any polling day.  \u0026ldquoWe have never had a situation like this in any of our 150-plus missions, Dmitra Ioannou, the deputy chief observer for the EU observation mission, was quoted as saying.  Pakistan is voting at a time when its foreign relations are the most damaged they have been in decades. Currently the US and Afghanistan accuse Islamabad of allowing Taliban militants and itscohorts, like the Haqqani group to operate out of sanctuaries in Pakistan. Also within the region meanwhile a standoff with archrival India over the disputed region of Kashmir grows ever more tense.  Just last month Pakistan was also placed back ona terror financing watch list. Pakistani officials attending a meeting in Paris had tried in vain to persuade the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) to keep Pakistan off a list of nations with inadequate controls to prevent terror financing and money laundering.  Pakistan was included on the watch list for three years until 2015, and FATF has now told the Islamabad government what needs to be done, in order for it to be taken off the list again.  For some time now Mr Khan despite hispast as an Oxford-educated, globetrotter has kept up a consistently anti-Americanism rhetoric in his political campaigning.  In doing so he has constantly thrown down the gauntlet to other Pakistani leaders for allowing the country to be used as a \u0026ldquo hired gun by Washington.  Should the Pakistan military have been supporting his election campaign to the extent many believe then he will doubtless now have to tone down his criticism of Washington, leaving him kowtowing to the Pakistan army in foreign-policy matters.  The country\u0026rsquos military and intelligence establishment has long been the main beneficiary of security aid before its love affair with the US turned somewhat sour.  To that end now Pakistan\u0026rsquos generals are keen to salvage their relationship with the Washington and the Pentagon.  For the moment few expect the post election period to be anything other than an even more intensified struggle for control of the government. For decades now many analysts have warned that the military\u0026rsquos role in Pakistan\u0026rsquos volatile politics has only left the country in a permanent cycle of tumult and economic stagnation.  Whatever political manoeuvring now lies ahead among the country\u0026rsquos leaders, real power openly or otherwise will almost certainly stay in the hands of the Pakistan\u0026rsquos generals not any political party or Prime Minister. It seems for now the era of \u0026lsquohard coups\u0026rsquo has been replaced with a \u0026lsquosilent coup\u0026rsquo period."},{"url":null,"title":"primal-scream-to-headline-va-opening-celebration","story":"  The group are expected to perform in front of thousands of fans at the 3D Festival in the Slessor Gardens in September.

He added that \"if God wills, we will set an example\" and promised to build a \"new\" Pakistan.  Pakistan\u0027s election commission has not yet released official, final results but Mr Khan has maintained a commanding lead according to projections by many television stations, though it is unclear if he will have to form a collation government.  Mr Khan\u0027s message of a \"new\" Pakistan resonated with young voters in a country where 64% of its 200 million people are below the age of 30.  More than a dozen TV channels in Pakistan, based on official but partial counts, are projecting that Mr Khan\u0027s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party is getting as many as 119 seats of the 270 National Assembly seats that were contested.  The remainder in the 342-seat Lower House of Parliament includes reserved seats for women and minorities. Voting for two seats was postponed after one candidate died during the campaign and another was disqualified.  But before even half the votes were counted, Mr Khan\u0027s leading rival Shahbaz Sharif, who heads the Pakistan Muslim League - the party of jailed ex-prime minister Nawaz Sharif - rejected the vote, generating fears that the losers could delay the formation of the next government. Television projections give his party about 61 seats.  Mr Sharif said that \"our democratic process has been pushed back by decades,\" adding that \"had the public mandate been delivered in a fair manner, we would have accepted it happily\".  Complaints have also emerged from the independent Human Rights Commission, which issued a statement saying that in some places women were not allowed to vote.  In other areas, it said \"polling staff appeared to be biased toward a certain party,\" without naming the party.  In the days before Wednesday\u0027s election, leading rights activist IA Rehman called the campaign \"the dirtiest\" in his country\u0027s troubled journey toward sustained democracy.  Analysts have expressed concern that disgruntled losers could create instability for the incoming government, which will face mounting challenges - including a crumbling economy, a crippling debt and a raging militancy.  As voting got under way on Wednesday in the south-western city of Quetta, the Baluchistan provincial capital, militants sent a suicide bomber to a crowding polling station to carry out an attack that killed 31 people.  The election, in which Pakistanis voted for the National Assembly, the lower house of parliament, and the four provincial assemblies, marked only the second time in Pakistan\u0027s 71-year history that one civilian government has handed power to another in the country of 200 million people.  Yet there have been widespread concerns during the election campaign about manipulation by the military, which has directly or indirectly ruled Pakistan for most of its existence. The military had deployed 350,000 troops at the 85,000 polling stations.  Pakistan\u0027s military spokesman General Asif Ghafoor called accusations of interference \"malicious propaganda\".  Throughout the night and into Thursday, Mr Khan\u0027s supporters celebrated outside party offices countrywide. Most of the revellers were young men, who danced to the sound of beating drums draped in Tehreek-e-Insaf\u0027s black and green-coloured flags."},{"url":null,"title":"facebook-releases-documents-revealing-scale-of-pro-brexit-social-media-ads","story":"  The details came as the social media giant saw more than \u0026pound80 billion wiped off the value of its shares amid a warning of slowing user and sales growth.

Five of the nine Vote Leave adverts which, were viewed some two to five million times focused on immigration.  Of those, two identical adverts stressed plans for Turkey to join the EU with an image showing a large red arrow sweeping across Europe from Turkey to the UK.

We already send \u0026pound350 million to the EU every single week. Shouldn\u0027t we spend our money on our priorities instead? Vote Leave Day - Thursday 23 June. Is This Good News? Click No! Vote Leave.\"  At the time, negotiations for Turkey to join the EU had completed one of 35 \u0027chapters\u0027 of legislation and as a member the UK would be able to veto any plans.  Another popular advert claimed more than five million \"new immigrants\" were heading to the UK, the figure appears to be based on the highest possible projection of EU immigration to the UK by the Office for National Statistics at the time.  Three identical adverts which were seen by between two and five million people urged voters to \"spend our money on our priorities like the NHS\", citing the disputed figure of \u0026pound350m per week sent to the EU.  As one of the figureheads of the campaign, Boris Johnson featured heavily in many of the more widely-seen adverts.  In two, the former Foreign Secretary is quoted talking about immigration and in a third he is pictured in front of a Vote Leave lorry with a caption urging people to vote for Brexit.  Adverts ranged over a number of subjects from protecting polar bears to banning the sale of whale meat. Other messages accused the EU of wanting to \"ban tea kettles\" and \"kill our cuppa\".  Vote Leave paid for significantly more Facebook advertisements around the EU referendum than the other campaign groups in the documents released to a House of Commons committee inquiry into fake news.  However, one advert from BeLeave published the week before the referendum was seen by more than five million people, more than any other adverts released by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport.  It read: \"Being under EU rule is severely restricting our ability to grow and reach our full potential as a great nation. It is time we take a stand for Britain. Let\u0027s vote to leave the EU on 23 June so we can have a clear and prosperous future! BeLeave in Britain! BeLeave\"."},{"url":null,"title":"theresa-mays-brexit-customs-plan-could-create-1bn-smugglers-paradise-claims-pro-eu-group","story":"  After Michel Barnier, the EU\u0027s chief negotiator, blew a hole in the Prime Minister\u0027s key customs proposal - the Facilitated Customs Arrangement - making clear the EU27 would not allow a non-EU member to collect its tariffs, the People\u0026rsquos Vote also picked fault with the UK\u0027s customs blueprint.  It claimed, given there would be no border checks, then smugglers would be free to transport goods in and out of Britain without controls on whether or not duties had been paid.  Consequently, the campaign said false claims about the final destinations of goods could enable smugglers to import into Britain without paying tariffs and then transfer those goods to the EU, thus evading duties that applied there.  \u0026ldquoThe Government is already in a total mess over its fantasy customs plans and this shows the serious consequences that the Brexit chaos has for our country, declared Labour\u0026rsquos Wes Streeting, a leading supporter of The People\u0026rsquos Vote.  \u0026ldquoThe UK has a proud track record in tackling organised crime. For Brexit to make it easier for people to illicitly smuggle goods across our border and not pay their way is simply unacceptable, insisted the London MP.  The backbencher added: \u0026ldquoNobody in Britain voted for the return to a golden age of smuggling. As new facts about Brexit come to light every day, it is clearer than ever that people need to be given a vote on the final deal.  The People\u0026rsquos Vote calculated the \u0026pound1bn Brexit bonanza figure by listing various goods and foodstuffs, which have varying EU tariffs, contrasting them with a zero-rated UK tariff, and then working out how much smugglers could potentially save.  For example, if EU tariffs were evaded: the \u0026pound1bn EU import value of men\u0026rsquos and boys\u0026rsquo shirts from China would produce a \u0026pound132m Brexit bonanza \u0026pound4.6bn of footwear also from China a \u0026pound506m bonanza \u0026pound324m beef from Argentina a \u0026pound41m bonanza and \u0026pound1.8bn of coffee from Brazil a \u0026pound109m bonanza. With other items, the campaign group calculated the total could be \u0026pound1.07bn.  Meanwhile, Lord Price, the former International Trade Minister, warned that a no-deal Brexit would put up the cost of basic foodstuffs \u0026ldquopretty significantly.  Mrs May told farmers and food producers at the Royal Welsh Show in Powys on Thursday that Brexit offered a \"real opportunity\" for Britain\u0026rsquos farming industry.  She and her senior colleagues have insisted the public should be comforted and reassured that the UK Government is taking \u0026ldquosensible measures to stockpile food and medicines should Britain crash out of the EU without an agreement.  But Lord Price, a former managing director at Waitrose, made clear a no-deal Brexit would push up the cost of fruit and vegetables, meat and dairy products because they could not be stockpiled.  Noting how 80 per cent of vegetables consumer in the UK came from Europe, the Conservative peer, who left the Government in September, said: \"What you will see is rather than a pinch on supply - although that is highly likely - is a pretty significant increase in the cost of fruit and veg, the cost of meat and the cost of dairy products.\""},{"url":null,"title":"fuelgood at garioch sports centre","story":"        A free FuelGood driving course is to be held at the Garioch Sports Centre in Inverurie.

Following its March launch at Mackie’s of Scotland’s 19.2 parlour, fans had been going nutty for the ever-flowing tap, consuming more than 5kg in the first week.                                                    But the Aberdeen parlour has now said goodbye to the dessert topper – which was being outperformed by its neighbouring ever-flowing chocolate tap, dispensing Mackie’s own milk chocolate – made just 19.2 miles away on the family farm.

It really did create a buzz online and off and gave customers an extra special element to top their desserts with.        “It’s one of those naughty treats that actually has health benefits, and fans were going nuts for it when it launched in March.“However, we have chosen to replace the tap as we want to ensure that enjoyment of the parlour is available to all.

The others were Scolpaig on North Uist and Unst in Shetland.All three were assessed by independent consultants with specialist knowledge of the space sector.Each one met key criteria, including the ability to stage north facing launches over the sea into both polar and sun-synchronous orbit.However, the business case for Sutherland was judged stronger overall, including being successfully awarded UK Space Agency funding for its proposals in collaboration with potential launch operators.HIE chief executive Charlotte Wright said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore very clear that we want to work with others to ensure the benefits of a spaceport in the Highlands and Islands are not confined to Sutherland, but extend well beyond.\u0026ldquoA central part of our approach as we develop this project will be to explore opportunities throughout our region.Friday 27 Jul 2018 2:36 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Vet finds Major mess on record paddle run","story":"A VET caused a bit of a splash when she swapped her stethoscope for a paddleboard to complete a memorable Land\u0026rsquos End to John O\u0026rsquoGroats journey.Cal Major was paddling along the seas, rivers and canals of Britain in order to raise awareness of plastic pollution in our waters and to also raise money for mental health charities the Samaritans and Vetlife.The 30-year-old completed her momentous journey inside 59 days \u0026ndash as she\u0026rsquos the first to do this by paddleboard, she is now the official world-record holder.Cal, who hails from North Devon, is keen to highlight not only the untidiness of plastic litter left on our beaches and in our seas but also the damage it can do to both the sea wildlife and the environment.She found many examples of plastic pollution along the way to John O\u0026rsquoGroats and hopes people will give more though to their use and disposal of plastic products.\u0026ldquoThere was plastic wherever I went. I found countless deserted and remote beaches piled high with it \u0026ndash plastic bottles, cotton-bud sticks, fishing gear, plastic bags, she said.\u0026ldquoThe worst-affected beaches in Scotland were on the west coast. On the east coast there was noticeably less on the beaches, but I was still paddling past beaches with nesting birds that had multicoloured plastic littering them.\u0026ldquoPaddling up the north-east coast, and particularly around Duncansby Head, I picked up several large plastic bags.\u0026ldquoThe inland canals were the worst affected. One morning in Wigan I counted 691 plastic bottles just in the first hour of paddling.Cal admitted that the marathon paddle was not without a scary moment or two.She added: \u0026ldquoThe Mull of Galloway paddle was one of the more terrifying moments. Storm Hector was approaching, so I had just one window to get around the Mull.\u0026ldquoI set off at 11.30pm, just as it had got dark, and paddled 14 miles across Luce Bay.\u0026ldquoThe darkness made it very hard to navigate so I used GPS and, once I could see lights on the opposite landmass and the lighthouse at the Mull, I focused on that.\u0026ldquoWith the Isle of Arran, I set off with a five-hour window to get to Arran before a storm was due to come in.\u0026ldquoThe winds were strong the entire time, mostly behind me but enough of a crosswind to make the paddling incredibly challenging and painful. When I was 12 miles across, the waves were almost as big as me and the storm came in early. I was very scared and felt very alone \u0026ndash panic was starting to set in.\u0026ldquoOnce I was within a mile of the island, and knew I was safe, fear turned to exhilaration, and the feeling of being propelled along by 20-30 knot winds was incredible.Friday 27 Jul 2018 2:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Wick River green slime passed safe for canines","story":"THE Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa) has allayed fears that an algae that has appeared on the surface of Wick River is harmful.Dog walkers in Wick had voiced concerns about the \u0026ldquogreen slime following the poisoning death of a dog by blue-green algae in the River Conon in Ross-shire last week.A spokesman from Sepa said that officers had confirmed the presence of enteromorpha in Wick River.\u0026ldquoEnteromorpha is a type of green algae\u0026nbspwhich, unlike blue-green algae, is not harmful.

It has been credited with helping some people to turn their lives around.Confirmation that Mr Harper, who has also sold on the streets of Inverness, had found a successful new niche for himself came when he was handed a Scotland\u0026rsquos Top Seller accolade.Mr Harper, who has overcome major health challenges, averages around 160 copies a week. He has been selling the magazine on and off since it was launched back in 1991.The secret to his success is fairly straightfoward, he believes: \"I speak to everybody who walks past me.

The organisation\u0026rsquos chairman, Tony Vandyke, says the money will be used to complete the first stage of an extensive revamp ahead of proposed further work in the next five years.\"We are going to use the money for things like replacing the handrails and changing the electrics and lighting,\" he said. \"These are vital upgrades. It will also enable us to start some engineering works.There are some issues regarding the age of the harbour. Part of the stonework has shifted and needs some work. We have got to do a new support leg for the bridge.\"But the funding allows us to forge ahead with the things we need to do. It\u0026rsquos not a fix for everything, because we have concrete which is now over 100 years old and is past the end of its useful life. However, it\u0026rsquos important for us to preserve everythng we can.\"All of the help and funding we have received will give us a more modern harbour that is safer. The SSE funding will be spent over the next two years. After that we are embarking into major works which will require more extensive funding.\"Mr Vandyke says the local community has played a major role in helping to secure the future of Cromarty Harbour, which has existed in some form for over 200 years.He added: \"We would like to thank the community because their support has been so strong. The harbour has been there for 200 hundred years.

As a result, Newton Road will be closed from July 19 at 7am to July 22 at 11am. And Dingwall No.1 in Craig Road will be shut from 7am on August 2 to 11am on August 5.Final installation and testing of the new barriers will also require fortnight-long road closures at both sites \u0026ndash Dingwall Middle from October 15 to 29 and Dingwall No.1 from October 29 to November 12.David Dickson, infrastructure director for Network Rail Scotland, said: \"These level crossing upgrades represent a significant improvement for rail and road safety.\"Our consultation work with the local community earlier this year indicated support for these improvements and we look forward to seeing them delivered.\"Our aim is to deliver this work with as little disruption as possible, however, we will require two short closures this summer plus two week road closures for each crossing to install and test the new equipment this autumn.\"Train services are not expected to be affected by any of the works.Friday 27 Jul 2018 2:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The first is the cinema, which would be built on land close to the ferry slipway and next to an existing boat storage shed.It would seat roughly 30 people and host weekly screenings throughout the year, rising to twice a week in the summer. It would also be used to help house Cromarty\u0026rsquos growing film festival, which attracts fans and famous faces from across the country every autumn.Cromarty Estate also plans to build an office hub alongside the cinema in a bid to cater for growing business demand in the town.A statement submitted by Cromarty Estate said: \"Cromarty has a thriving entrepreneurial community but this is not matched by suitable office accommodation, with the result that many find themselves having to move their business bases from Cromarty to Dingwall, Tore or Inverness when they outgrow their own homes, with the resulting loss of employment opportunities in the town.\"Addressing this need... will make Cromarty a more balanced and sustainable community.\"Film society trustee Tanya Karlebach said the group was \"really excited\" to reach this milestone and the move would help increase the frequency of screenings in Cromarty.She added that there is still some fundraising to do before the \u0026pound240,000 cost of the venue is covered, but that by lodging the application now, they are hopeful permission will be in place to begin as soon as the target is met.They hope to hear about their remaining grant applications and other fundraising by late autumn.She added the society had opted for a new-build because none of the existing sites in Cromarty were suitable for conversion. They would also have cost more to take on than building a cinema from scratch.\"We hope the community is supportive,\" she said. \"We\u0026rsquove had positive feedback so far and it\u0026rsquos in a great location down by the ferry.\"A survey of Cromarty residents found that 82 per cent backed a cinema in the town and the same number would go to more screenings if the venue was better than what is currently on offer.The plans for the cinema and office hub have won support from a leading Highland business figure.David Richardson, the Federation of Small Businesses\u0026rsquo Highlands and Islands development manager, said the organisation \"wholeheartedly supports locally-managed collaborative ventures that make our small rural communities even better places to live, especially for the young people and families that we desperately need to retain and attract.\"Cinemas appeal to all ages and to locals and visitors alike, and they can also be great social hubs.\"Equally, the presence of purpose-designed office space can do much to encourage would-be entrepreneurs to take the plunge and start new businesses existing small business to expand and to attract businesses from outside to relocate.\"It approved the buildings would feature dark metal cladding to the walls of the cinema, with timber cladding on the office hub.Construction could start as early as spring next year.To donate to the cinema project go to www.justgiving/crowdfunding/cromartycommunitycinemaFriday 27 Jul 2018 2:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The utility giant said underlying earnings at its generation and supply unit had soared by more than 300 per cent to £165.8 million in the six months to the end of June. It added that the  division had “recovered” from a poor performance in 2017.            Average customer consumption increased by 4 per cent year-on-year over the period, which was mainly due to cold weather from the Beast from the East around late February and March.            Customer numbers now stand at about 4.9 million, down from the five million reported at the end of the first quarter of 2018.The latest figures come after the Big Six energy company, which is owned by Spanish multinational Iberdrola, increased prices in a move that hit some 950,000 households.The firm hiked its standard variable gas and electricity prices for around a third of its customers from 1 June, with impacted households facing an average increase of 5.5 per cent.ScottishPower attributed the rise to an increase in wholesale energy costs, alongside costs associated with upgrading meters and delivering electricity from low-carbon sources.The firm has been investing in wind power, having completed a £650m project to build eight wind farms north of the Border.            Over the first six months of 2018, ScottishPower also started construction on a major offshore wind farm in East Anglia, the East Anglia ONE project.Underlying earnings at the ScottishPower Renewables business rose 27 per cent to £205.1m while they nudged up 3 per cent to £399.9m at the SP Energy Networks division.The group has also completed the installation of one million smart meters. It is working with four installation partners across the UK, installing at peak 2,700 meters per day with a UK-wide workforce of more than 500 people.ScottishPower chief executive Keith Anderson said: “Everyone knows that installing smart meters hasn’t been plain sailing for suppliers. Challenges have been overcome, with more to face, but it is a major achievement to reach one million installations.            “The potential for customers to reduce consumption and save money is only one benefit. As the energy industry becomes fully digital in the years ahead, the new meters will be a vital cog in a smart network that supports electric vehicle charging, manages locally produced renewable energy and even the storage of electricity at home.”On the half-year results he noted: “All of our business areas are performing in line with expectations. Our investment in onshore wind last year has seen an increase in electricity generated, and excellent progress has been made on delivering the £2.5 billion East Anglia ONE project.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4774174.1532601783!/image/image.jpg","title":"end of era as john menzies offloads distribution arm","story":"        Logistics group John Menzies has entered into a conditional agreement to sell its print media division Menzies Distribution to investment funds managed by \u0026#8220transformational\u0026#8221 private equity investor Endless LLP in a \u0026#16374.5 million deal.

And not in a good way. This kind of heatwave is no laughing matter. Having been brought up in Glasgow, I am not equipped to deal with this.             I know my parents are Indian, but they came here to escape this kind of godawful evil weather. Cats and dogs are begging to be shaved it’s so bad. And the heat has clearly affected British politics because it has gone into meltdown.            MPs head off for their summer break this week and some of us would normally say it was “well deserved”, but they haven’t covered themselves in glory and leave behind what can be only be described as a genuine political crisis.Brexit has trapped us in a what Danny Dyer brilliantly described as a mad political riddle where the business of running the country has effectively ground to the halt. Although to be fair that hasn’t just happened this parliamentary term. Government ministers, advisers and the civil service haven’t had the bandwidth to focus on the rather difficult day job of running the country since David Cameron called the EU referendum because the toxic politics of the campaign took over. Ironically for a campaign which was dominated by the slogan “take back control”, domestic British politics has spun out of control. We have huge problems the length and breadth of these shores which need the best brains, focus, hard-work, determination and good faith – from funding gaps in the NHS to the lack of opportunities for young people to housing and infrastructure – and sadly our most of our leading politicians seem to be woefully lacking all these qualities.The Conservatives are the equivalent of a circular firing squad and are so busy fighting over Brexit and jostling for who will succeed Theresa May, who will be out the door faster than you can say “strong and stable” once some deal is done on Brexit – although, her words “no deal is better than a bad deal” are proving to be rather prophetic. READ MORE: David Mundell: There’s no alternative to the Brexit White Paper            A ‘no deal’ and crashing out of the EU on WTO terms is now a growing prospect. If this happens, it won’t be because the EU won’t accept a deal, it will be because hard-right Tory Brexiteers won’t. After Chequers, she sent Ministers out on the airwaves to say that this was the absolute, final Cabinet position, then the very next day she gave in to Jacob Rees-Mogg. With this kind of the steel, I bet the EU are sh****** themselves. She then conceded that she would have to probably give way to the EU on further areas, which is true but how do you think the hard-right in her party are going to take those concessions? They are emboldened, and they will not give way. They never have. Ever since the days of John Major, who was out over the weekend calling for a second referendum.I am much more sympathetic to this notion now, but it won’t magic away all the problems – it would simply unblock the Brexit impasse we have in Parliament. What would the question or indeed questions be? How many options would have you have? Would you even include the option to overturn the decision and remain in the EU or would that be seen as undemocratic and unfair? And remainers like me might get a nasty shock – a second referendum may deliver an even bigger margin for leave because, if people hated Westminster in the run-up to the referendum, you can bet your bottom dollar they would want to give it an even bigger two-fingers after two years of arsing around.But it may be the only option if politics can’t find a way though. To give you an idea of how messed up the Government’s Brexit plans are, yesterday it was announced that the Brexit Department will no longer be negotiating Brexit. You literally could not make this stuff up.READ MORE: Food safety controls under threat from no-deal Brexit            Speaking of which, a special mention must go to Vince Cable, leader of the Lib Dems who last week managed to miss a critical vote on Brexit because he was allegedly at a dinner discussing setting up a new party to stop Brexit. Former leader Tim Farron also missed this important vote because he was busy making a speech about homosexuality and the church. It’s great to see the political titan whose only contributions to the last general election was the phrase “smell my spaniel” and a massive row about gay sex is back out there on his “it’s a sin” tour.But things took a more sinister twist when the deputy leader of the Lib Dems, Jo Swinson, was swindled out of her vote at a knife-edge moment because the Tories basically lied to her. She has just had a baby and is still on maternity leave. Julian Smith, the Tory Chief Whip, promised she would be “paired” with MP Brandon Lewis during a crucial Brexit vote. This is an arrangement where if an MP is sick or they can’t be in parliament for an important vote, their “pair” from the opposing party agrees not to vote so that they cancel each other out. It’s based on trust and honour ... Lewis then broke that promise and voted. This is outrageous. The Tories are saying this was an innocent mistake. Do me a favour. We weren’t born yesterday like Swinson’s baby! Lewis and Smith clearly lied, and should be sacked. It’s polite to give up your seat for a pregnant woman – they should be made to give up theirs. Permanently. What a low moment for politics.And don’t look to Labour for any comfort on Brexit. Yesterday Corbyn showed his true Eurosceptic heart by making a speech where he tried to sell us the economic “benefits” of Brexit, which got praised to the rafters by the Leave campaign. He also has a massive bridge to sell you, with a unicorn waiting for each and every one of you on the other side. So, the chances of Labour blocking Brexit or backing a second referendum or a ‘people’s vote’ are pretty slim. Mind you. They have bigger fish to fry right now. Like picking the mother of all rows with the Jewish community over anti-semitism and trying to make communism fashionable again.I really do despair. Never have we needed better politics.

I have long considered myself an avid radio listener. It is a habit ingrained by weekend afternoons in my grandfather’s kitchen, where after a daunder back from the bookies, we would gather round the wireless and listen intently to proceedings from Ascot or Newmarket, where the rising pitch of the commentators vied for attention with the rush of hooves and the desperate, hopeful shouts of the crowd.            I should probably count myself lucky that I never developed an affinity for the gee-gees as a consequence, but I will always be grateful for that early introduction to a medium that felt more immediate than television ever could.            Growing up with one foot in the analogue age, I kept the flame burning, and with the advent of the internet and the proliferation of digital radio stations, my habit became hopelessly and permanently entrenched. I have lost count of sleepless hours given over to Ira Glass and John Hockenberry on National Public Radio’s Talk of the Nation, discussing obscure issues in a distant country in a way that felt relevant and intimate.Glass, of course, went on to create This American Life, a radio show which morphed into one of the world’s most popular podcasts. Even today, each episode is downloaded by around 2.5 million people. If that particular show’s success is well established, it would appear the popularity of its medium has yet to peak. The latest analysis by Rajar, the official body in charge of measuring radio audiences in the UK, shows that as of this spring, some six million adults across Britain listened to at least one podcast a week.That number might appear relatively small – just 11 per cent of the population – but when you assess it the proper context, its scale – and growth – is really quite something. Only last year, the number stood at just 4.7 million, and the number of people now downloading podcasts now outstrips the reach of BBC Radio 5 Live. READ MORE: From football to knitting: the rise of the Scottish podcast            Such statistics have led to 2018 being hailed by the BBC as the year of the “podcast boom”. Such a bold prophecy may be intended as self-fulfilling, at least on the BBC’s part. In March, the corporation announced the appointment of its first-ever podcast commissioner, Jason Phipps, and it clearly believes it can build on the 240 million annual downloads of its programmes. It, along with other broadcasters and media companies, faces a stern challenge in attracting a younger demographic who do not consume their media via linear channels, and podcasting is one the most obvious areas to focus on. Recent research by Acast, one of the main competitors to iTunes as the world’s leading podcast platform, found that two thirds of listeners are aged between 16 and 34. What is more, nearly a fifth of them have only started listening in the past six months. The success of the BBC’s evolving podcasting operation alone will not solve that problem, but it is a start.            It is hard, however, to see the projected ‘boom’ coming to pass. Podcasting is hardly a new, emerging medium. In one form or another, it has been a staple of our media diet for well over a decade. iTunes first started collating a directory of podcasts as far back as 2005, when the term was named as the Merriam Webster dictionary’s word of the year. Within the space of 12 months, the comedian, Ricky Gervais, helped propel the medium into the public consciousness, with millions of users downloading his comedy shows.  For a good few years, the podcast charts were dominated by such high-profile figures looking to emulate Gervais’s success. And while the podcasting world is still inhabited by any number of celebrities, its greatest treasures are to be found elsewhere. READ MORE: Podcast tells gory tale of Scottish crime writer’s lifeIn the past few days, I have listened to a 50-minute documentary about the economics of US dentistry, an hour-long interview with Kenney Jones, the former drummer with the Small Faces, and a two hour-long show devoted entirely to the 1978 arcade game, Space Invaders.Slowly but surely, such esoteric listening choices have displaced live radio as my audio go-to. I subscribe to more than 70 different shows, and on an average week, I will listen to around 12 hours of programming. Over the past year, the lion’s share of this has consisted of podcasts which focus on US politics, such as FiveThirtyEight, Pod Save America, Trumpcast, Trump Inc, all of which provide incisive takes on the Trump administration.            But so too, my podcast diet is supplemented by an ever-widening spectrum of programmes that embrace niche subjects. On the one hand, it includes the likes of Trade Talks, a weekly insight into international trade deals, and The Tip Off, which interviews leading journalists about how they came across some of their biggest stories. On the other hand, it takes in Wrestle Me, where comedians Marc Haynes and Pete Donaldson revisit every WrestleMania event from 1985 onwards in chronological order, and Cult of Geshcast, in which two Glaswegian friends, Gavin Spence and Phillip Maddison, discuss various cults and sects through the ages. These are my niche interests, but whatever you are interested in, or even curious about, chances are there is a podcast out there for you. There might not be a boom in 2018, but with the bewildering choice of programmes out there, it’s hard to see how podcasts will fail to become an increasingly prominent part of our media landscape."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4774013.1532550395!/image/image.jpg","title":"strictly come dancing sensation ed balls on his newest tv show","story":"        Ed Balls is discussing the dos and don\u0026#8217ts of donning a leotard.                No, he’s not referring to his Strictly Come Dancing days (in case you missed it, he was the unexpected star of the 2016 series).            The former politician, 51, actually wears a skimpy Union flag number to enter the wrestling ring in new BBC Two show, Travels In Trumpland With Ed Balls.            “I’m not someone who previously had bikini line concerns, but they wanted me to wear a really tight-cut leotard, and I thought it would be unflattering,” quips the Norwich-born father-of-three, who’s married to Labour MP Yvette Cooper.“I got a pair of black boxers under it. Had I only worn the bikini line, that might have ruined it for the viewer…”He decided not to shave his legs and torso, like his fellow wrestlers did, either.“My kids think dads should be embarrassing but that I substantially overachieve,” he adds with a grin.“I could explain to my 13-year-old why it was important to do the wrestling, but if I’d have been waxed and shaved, she would have said it was too much.”            The factual entertainment series sees the ex-shadow chancellor walk in the shoes of a variety of supporters of US President Donald Trump, to try and understand why they voted for him.“Lots of people will assume they’re either deluded and don’t understand, or extreme and dangerous, but we just met really nice, ordinary people,” he says.“I thought that after the first year Trump would be losing support, but we didn’t find that at all and it wouldn’t surprise me at all if he won a second term.”The three episodes look at different issues facing Americans, whether that’s the gun control movement or immigration policies, and how they feel about their country since former reality star Trump was elected in 2016.            “I thought he’d drop the wild persona and become a more reasonable, centrist president but he hasn’t at all,” Balls notes.“You assume it can’t get worse, and it does.”As well as being an insightful and entertaining series, what might surprise viewers is how emotional it is to watch at times.In the first episode, Balls stays at a farm with a group of war veterans, and as well as hearing their thoughts on Trump, he joins them round a campfire for a toast to friends who lost their lives in service.And he asks to toast to Labour MP Jo Cox, a mum-of-two who was murdered by a far-right extremist outside her constituency surgery in Birstall, near Leeds, a week before the EU referendum.            “The only thing which felt comparable to me was Jo, who I knew very, very well,” Balls confides of the moving scene. “I did a lot of campaigning and fundraising with her.“From a personal point of view... Jo losing her life is a terrible thing, obviously, but I’m somebody who has three kids, and a partner who does exactly the same kind of surgeries every Friday, so it could absolutely have been us.“I could both think about what it’s like to be Jo but also think about what it’s like to be her family.”Balls agrees that competing on Strictly – on which he won fans over with his memorable salsa to Gangnam Style – showed the public a different side to him.“People kept saying to me, ‘We always knew you were a politician but it’s great to see you’re a human being as well’.”With presenting this documentary series taking him out of his comfort zone once again, he says we can expect to see even more of his personality.“It’s impossible to be in a character for so many hours [of filming] each day, so it’s impossible to conceal who I am.” Did he look to an experienced interviewer like Louis Theroux for inspiration?“I took a decision that I shouldn’t watch anyone else doing this kind of thing until we had made the first episode. I didn’t want to try and be someone else.“If you asked me what the genre is, it’s a mix of old-style, early Louis Theroux meets The Real Marigold Hotel and little bit of Ruby Wax.“I tried to let the characters do the talking. I reveal my opinions to camera but not to the people I’m with.”It was the 2015 general election when Balls lost his seat in the Morley and Outwood constituency, in West Yorkshire.And he doesn’t seem to envy those currently working as an MP.“I’m regretful politics is so chaotic at the moment, and I look back at better times wistfully,” he says.“But if you said to me, ‘You could be in Parliament or you could do this show at the moment’, I’d definitely choose this show.”"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006. Construction began in 2016 and is expected to be completed on schedule in late summer.\nLocated at Seafield the new centre is just a short distance from the long-standing Eric Gray Centre. Once opened the centre will provide specialist assistance for adults with complex care needs and learning disabilities.\nThe building has been designed by Richard Gibson Architects and construction is being led by DITT. The drone footage was shot by Nick McCaffrey.\nThe centre does indeed look good and is on schedule well done DITT , the clients and staff are all looking forward to being in the building. It has taken many years to reach this point  and is much needed.\nI wonder what, if any, proof you have that clients and staff are looking forward to being in the building? If you do have some proof to justify your claim, are they looking forward to being in before or after completion?\nGeorge Dickson\nI have along with other parents of clients that currently use the Eric Gray Centre worked hard, and against many obstacles to finally see the realisation  of a much needed new building where all clients who are at this moment in different buildings due to there being not enough space in the old building and facilities that have run there course in time. It has been a long journey for some and a hard fight to gain the ground and then keep it  for the new building. The building will provide not only better facilities and space but will also give staff the help in coordination and equipment to do there job under one roof with less strain and expense to all.\nI also claim nothing but most people that have lived in Shetland for the last 10 years will be aware of the problems associated with the Eric Gray building, whether directly involved or not although the thinking and planning of a new building goes farther back than that.\nSome parents and staff have had a look through the new building at different stages of build, and everyone to my knowledge was impressed. I like many other parents and carers look forward to the day its complete and our daughters and sons can enjoy the help and encouragement from staff to live their lives to the best of their ability.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"more seabirds entangled but fishing industry not always to blame says tour guide ","story":"\nDarron Smith cuts free a gannet.

It’s manufacture uses up valuable natural resources but this is a result of human exploitation. This begs the question, why are humans capable of natural behaviour and unnatural behaviour in what seems to be equal measure?  Is it normal and natural to drive cars, fly in ‘planes, build tower blocks, dig for coal, aim to fly to distant planet ? The list is endless. According to the experts, global warming and ice ages have occurred many times and certainly before life as we know it existed.  We are worried about what are threats to our welfare only because it is a seemingly an alien threat . Surely, if we are able to stand outside ourselves, we are now caught up in a “ normal” event. And in our short sighted stupidity we are adding to the dangers. But not causing them.I would venture to suggest that long after life has ceased on  this planet there will still be episodes of change which will also be natural and normal except there won’t be anyone around to grumble, fret or lead campaigns !!\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 20 ","story":"As I write this all the teams have played at least one match at the World Cup, with hosts Russia and Uruguay becoming first to qualify for the last 16 from group A.\nOn the whole it has been a decent tournament so far, helped by a few shocks along the way and some memorable goals, although perhaps the less said about the commentary and punditry the better.\nFew would have expected Germany to lose to Mexico, or Argentina to be held by Iceland. One of the most remarkable performances in the latter game came from Kari Arnason, recently deemed not good enough by Aberdeen but still able to do a pretty fair job on shackling Lionel Messi.\nThe introduction the Video Assistant Referee system, or VAR as it is commonly known, has caused a few talking points. There was the decision to allow Diego Costa’s first goal for Spain against Portugal, and also to award penalties to France and Sweden against Australia and South Korea respectively.\nThese “assistants” are apparently not even at the game. They are sitting in a office somewhere in Moscow, but bizarrely kitted out in full referees’ uniform!\nWhy on earth they didn’t disallow Switzerland’s equaliser against Brazil is beyond me, however. Everyone seemed to notice Steven Zuber’s push on his marker before making room for himself to head the ball home.\nEveryone that is except the boys in black in Moscow. The ITV panellists were unanimous in their opinion that the goal should have been ruled out. Even Roy Keane, who used to think decapitation was just about permissable, appeared to agree with the others.\nOkay, so we will mention the commentary and punditry. Apart from Keane and Slaven Bilic – I loved it when he said he couldn’t really care less about whether the Swiss leveller should have been allowed or not – there is really no-one who comes with an opinion which makes you think.\nMost of the time they are prattling on about how far England are likely to go, even when the focus is on an entirely different group. And surely it is high time Gary Lineker was pensioned off. His pathetic attempts at puns, which could have been written by a five-year-old, had their day a long time ago.\nMeanwhile in our office “World Cup Sweepstake”, which requires the entrant to basically predict the results all the way through the competition, things aren’t going too badly. Despite obviously getting the Argentina/Iceland and Germany/Mexico games wrong, plus a few others, I remain in contention on the leaderboard.\nSo what about the last 16? I will still stick with the Germans and Argentinians as surely they must improve. My line-up is: Russia v Portugal, Spain v Uruguay, France v Argentina, Croatia v Denmark, Brazil v Sweden, Belgium v Japan, Germany v Switzerland and Senegal v England.\n: : : : : : : :\nThere has already been a healthy entry for our competition to name Shetland’s greatest football team of the past 60 years, but potential selectors still have a week and a half to make their minds up.\nThe main prize, a return trip for two people with car and cabin courtesy of NorthLink Ferries, is definitely not to be sneezed at. And there are also leather footballs from Cee \u0026amp Jays Intersport for the runners-up.\nSo whether you are a subscriber to the theory that the best players all hung their boots up decades ago, or you believe the standard of today is much better than yesteryear, get your thinking caps on and have a look at the details above. If the price of a stamp puts you off just email your entry to editorial@shetlandtimes\n: : : : : : : :\nEven those who detest cricket most may have raised a modest eyebrow last week when the Scottish team shocked England with victory in a one-day match at Edinburgh.\nReaders, whether they follow the game or not, may be interested that there was actually a player in the home side’s ranks with Shetland connections.\nA glance at the Scottish team sheet may suggest possible contenders – how about Michael Leask, Mark Watt or even Dylan Budge for instance?\nBut it was none of those. The cricketer with roots connected to these parts was none other than the man of the match himself – batsman Callum MacLeod whose magnificent 140 not out was largely responsible for Scotland’s thrilling win.\nMacLeod’s father Donald attended the Anderson High School in the late 1960s and early 70s. He was a goalkeeper himself, playing for the Ness United team in the Shetland under-18 competitions.\nHe went on to make somewhat of a name for himself as a photographer, working for The Press and Journal and The Scotsman at times before establishing his own business.\nMacLeod (junior) has obviously usurped any success attained by his old man, however. Even before his recent moment of glory he has been an established international batsman, making several centuries at one-day level.\nHe has been good enough to play grade cricket in Sydney, which is no mean feat, has had stints at English counties Warwickshire and Durham and has just signed a contract with Derbyshire.\nIt is going on half a century since I last saw Donald MacLeod, but I know a certain former Whitedale goalkeeper who keeps in touch. If he happens to read this he’ll maybe pass on congratulations from me, and I’m sure a few others, to the family.\n: : : : : : : :\nTwo weeks ago I suggested that having clubs competing in a local league structure could be of great benefit to preparation for junior inter-county sports such as hockey and netball.\nWhile there is no regular junior league set-up in the isles for hockey, it has been pointed out that in netball this exists for primary school-aged players upwards.\nThe sport appears to be thriving at the various age levels, with under-13 and under-17 squads regularly competing on the mainland with success.\nThe Anderson High School team has also regularly sent a team to compete in the Scottish Schools Open competition, where they have performed with distinction over the past few years.\nThe AHS team also plays in division one of the senior netball leagues, while a feeder team called “Hotfooters” was created to provide easier access for youngsters to join the league.\nAccording to the organisers there have been over 1,000 competitive matches in Shetland and 32 competitive matches away from the isles for juniors this season in various leagues and tournaments.\nCoach Sanna Aitken says: “Of course it is disappointing that we lost the junior inter-county this year \u0026#8230 the girls were really gutted.\n“As a coach, I am delighted that the netball continues to be really competitive [with] an incredibly high standard of match demonstrating the hard work and success of the sport and junior set-up in both isles.\n“I am confident when saying the loss was nothing to do with any weaknesses in the local league structure. It just didn’t go our way on the day. Only two years ago it went Shetland’s way where we won on Orkney’s home turf. It’s always a great competitive game.”\nI am happy to set the record straight on this.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"\n\nMarc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August.

It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People 2018.”\n\n\nAre they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be done\nI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of life or some other pointless title.\nOver the years art has very much lowered its standards significantly to make and justify it becoming more commercially viable\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called \u0026#8216 limited edition rubbish \u0026#8216.\nI would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.\nNo doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and life experience\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230..despite the fact everybody else looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.\nLove the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildlife centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildlife centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientific, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin (tin shed). Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions (£16?), Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"rubber duck wins first bergen lerwick leg of shetland race ","story":"Espen Børresen (left) and Morten Offendal celebrate their victory.

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward. This has been going on for far too long in most levels of football, and thankfully the days of pundits uttering the words “part and parcel of the game” will now be over.\nGrabbing someone in a bear hug is not football – never has been and never will be. I recall a European match some years ago when Glasgow Celtic should have had about six penalties but the referee gave none.\nWhat this needs now is for officials to be in accordance with one another. But sadly, and I can envisage a few whistlers spluttering over their cornflakes at this, the words “consistent” and “referees” are an oxymoron as far as I\u0026#8217m concerned.\nOn the subject of the English progression in the tournament, it has once again thrown up the perennial question of whether Scottish people should support their oldest rivals.\nThere are no doubt many north of the border who would find the prospect of England winning the World Cup a terrifying one. They could even be in the majority. A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way. I have always supported them when Scotland are not involved, and in recent years that has become the norm.\nA few issues do bother me, such as the constant gormless look on Kane’s face and the insistence of manager Gareth Southgate on dressing as if he was taking part in the World Snooker Championships. Someone should tell him that waistcoats are the most pointless item of clothing known to man.\nBut hey, most of it is good. I particularly enjoy the ITV panel and even Ian Wright is growing on me!\n: : : : : : : :\nIt is just over a month since the tragic death of former Aberdeen footballer Neale Cooper and I would like to add my own tribute to the many which have been paid to such a popular man.\nThe late Neale Cooper made a memorable trip to Shetland.\nAt just 19 he was the youngest member of the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup side which defeated Real Madrid in the final at Gothenburg in Sweden.\nAlong with that memorable triumph he was in the team which won two Scottish league titles, four Scottish Cups, a league cup and the European Super Cup, all achieved before he was 24.\nHe later played for Aston Villa, Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline and Ross County, where he later became manager.\nIt was in the summer of 1999, when Ross County were invited to Shetland as guests for Scalloway’s centenary celebrations, that I had the privilege of meeting Cooper.\nThere was a gala dinner in the village hall after the friendly match where County defeated Scalloway 8-2, and he agreed to give me time for a short interview. But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words. Colleagues, writers and others have pointed out what a humble, friendly and likeable character he was.\nThey are absolutely correct. I’ve meet a few well-known footballers over the years but I have no difficulty in stating that Neil Cooper was the nicest one of them all.\n: : : : : : : :\nCyclist Chris Froome is now free to go for a record-equalling fifth Tour de France win after his anti-doping case was sensibly dropped.\nThe Team Sky rider had been under investigation by the sport’s world governing body Union Cycliste Internationale but proceedings were closed on Monday.\nFroome, who is bidding to move level with Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, Jacques Anquetil and Miguel Indurain as the only five-time winners of the tour, has been under intense pressure since an amount of the asthma treatment salbutamol was found in his system.\nGet off this guy’s back and give him a break, I say. Just because he’s the best cyclist in the world does not mean he’s benefiting from a performance-enhancing drug.\n: : : : : : : :\nWith all the buzz of the World Cup an annual competition in southwest London has almost been forgotten about.\nYes, Wimbledon is in full flow once again and the British competitors are as usual struggling to make it into the second week.\nAndy Murray was probably sensible to withdraw, citing that he was not quite ready for five-set matches after his hip operation. There were signs at Queens and Eastbourne, however, that he may be able to scale the heights once more.\nThere is of course a capable replacement in Kyle Edmund, who is seeded having reached the Australian Open semi-finals earlier this year.\nEdmund’s half of the draw looks fairly open, and he could well still be involved come Monday. But of course anything can happen, and by the time you read this he could be gone.

On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois (Belgium) Benjamin Pavard (France), Raphaël Varane (France), Diego Godín (Uruguay), Ivan Strinic (Croatia) Ivan Perisic (Croatia), Luka Modric (Croatia), Jordan Henderson (England), Eden Hazard (Belgium) Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal), Edinson Cavani (Uruguay).\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"blue green algae found in tingwall ","story":"Another loch has been found to contain blue green algae, this time the Loch of Griesta in Tingwall.\nNotices will be posted next to the loch warning against contact with the algal scum.\nThe SIC\u0026#8217s environmental health department received notification of the discovery from the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency.

Duncan (24), a former Kingussie High School pupil, has just returned from his dream adventure to the United States with a team of fellow meteorologists.\nHe got up close and personal with several tornadoes and massive electric storms during the trip of a lifetime which started on May 19, with the quartet returning on Saturday.\nThe daredevil and talented photographer captured breathtaking snaps of the huge storms as they crossed Nebraska, Kansas, Colorado and Texas.\nScott told the Strathy: \"The four of us flew out to Tornado Valley in the hope to witness some of the planet\u0027s most extreme weather.\n\"We decided to put our meteorological skills together and chase the storms ourselves.\"\nThe group of Reading University graduates rented a car and travelled 7000 miles over the course of the three weeks.\n\"We do it for the buzz as we all have a passion for extreme weather and it is also a great way to hit the open road and explore new states,\" he added.\nHe agreed that it can be a dangerous hobby but not for the reasons you would think.\n\"People often think tornadoes are the main concern but lightning, giant hail stones and flash flooding are often the hazards that prove most deadly,\" he said.\n\"Careful planning before and during a storm chase is absolutely essential.\"\n\u0026nbsp\nScott now works for MetDesk, a UK-wide weather service, and he took those skills across the Pond with him.\nThe friends used the latest weather model data, satellite and radar observations and invested in a portable internet device to ensure they had the best chance of remaining connected to signal while on the move.\nScott said it is incredibly important that the driver can access accurate directions quickly when faced with dangerous and often changing conditions.\nAlthough they had a few close calls, they managed to avoid getting themselves into \"major trouble\" by knowing when to back off and take shelter.\nThe Newtonmore man explained: \"We avoided driving through storms with tennis ball sized hail stones and 70mph straight line winds.\n\"But at one point we did have to take shelter in a gas station freezer room \u0026ndash the strongest room in the building \u0026ndash due to a tornado with confirmed flying debris just upwind of us.\"\nScott admitted that storm chasing is not for the faint-hearted but that \"it is an experience\" and in the US it is becoming an increasingly popular attraction.\nBecause the adventurers did not know where they would end up at the end of the day, accommodation had to often be found late and in an obscure towns in the middle of nowhere\nScott, who is now safely back in Hertfordshire where the weather is rather less dramatic, added: \"That alone makes the trip more exciting as it holds an incredible depth of freedom.\"\nTornado Alley is the name of the area in the United States where tornadoes are most frequent.\nThe term was coined in 1952 as the title of a research project to study severe weather in areas of Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, South Dakota, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Nebraska, Colorado, North Dakota, and Minnesota.\nFriday 27 Jul 2018 2:38

Even with the introduction of new flights our air connections remain some of the most fragile across these isles.\n\u0026ldquoThe Smith Commission was very clear when it stated that: \u0026lsquothe power to charge tax on air passengers leaving Scottish airports will be devolved to the Scottish Parliament.

However, the six houses are to be built on what was a King George V Playing Field, which was set aside and protected in 1962.\nFor anyone to build on this land they must notify and obtain the consent of Fields in Trust, a charity that acts to protect all KGV land. Even though the comhairle took over the management of the land in 1984 they must still obtain the trust’s consent.\nThe Barra Sports Forum have been pressing the comhairle for years to transfer a piece of derelict land near the Co-op, which is adjacent to the KGV area, for use as an all-weather pitch.\nA spokesman said: “The sports forum urge the comhairle to fulfil their legal and moral obligations to the people of Barra and Vatersay to protect the sports and recreation land in Horve by righting this wrong: firstly, by filing for a change of land use to Fields in Trust from ‘sports and recreation’ to ‘housing’ and secondly, by transferring an equivalent area of land to the KGV playing field in compensation for land lost to housing. Only by doing this will the comhairle avoid the danger of stalling the desperately needed new housing that helps secure the future of our islands.”\nRichard McKeever of Fields in Trust the charity recognised that that “sometimes it may be necessary” to change the use of recreational land.\nHe added: “As part of our protection, we have a responsibility to ensure the local owners and managers of these spaces seek our consent to undertake any changes regarding land ownership, land transactions, erection of buildings and structures \u0026#8211 and that proposed changes fit with the purpose of the protected space and benefit its recreational use.

Having beaten Juniors twice already this season \u0026#8211 2-5 and 0-6 \u0026#8211 Jamie MacGregor will have faith that his team can make it a hat-trick of success and book their place in the final.\nIn their last semi-final outing, Mallaig defeated Sleat and Strath 10-8 in an incredible game to secure their place in the GF MacRae Cup Final. The blues, however, will be keen to avoid a repeat of their performance in the final which saw Kyleakin run out 4-1 winners in a disappointing and underwhelming showing by Mallaig.\n\n \u0026#8220Another tough game for us, but it’s the type of games we wanted to be involved in at the start of the season. We now have a great opportunity to make a second cup final this season.\n\u0026#8220The season, in general, has been a learning experience but a very enjoyable one. The lads have picked up a lot quite quickly and we have had some good wins this season especially on our travels. It’s good to be back playing at home especially in such a big game, especially after being away for so long\n\u0026nbsp\nWith four wins from their last five matches in all competitions, and 37 goals scored in the process, Juniors have really hit their stride and will approach their third meeting with Mallaig with great confidence.\nNow just four points point off leaders Sleat and Strath with one game in hand, Phil McCaherty will hope his team can transmit their impressive league form into today\u0026#8217s cup match against the only side who have beaten them domestically this season.\nWhile Juniors\u0026#8217 recent free-scoring display will have given Mallaig some food for thought in their preparations for the match, the Portree side must avoid the lapses in concentration which cost them in their heavy defeats at home against Mallaig in the league and Loch Ness in the Highland Amateur Cup.\n\nIt\u0026#8217s a tough task for us away to Mallaig who have beaten us twice already 5-2 and 6-0. We are going with the same squad (minus Angie MacPherson and Paul MacKinnon) that played GA United in last round, with Nick Flanagan added for goalkeeping duties to free up backup goalie Will Brown to his normal defensive duties. I am hoping that David Potter doesn\u0026#8217t get lost this week!\u0026#8221\n\nIt\u0026#8217s been a fantastic season so far for the Broadford-based side who are the current league leaders, joint top scorers, and have the meanest defence to boot.\nWith an average of 5.2 goals a game in the league, Sleat and Strath have developed a ruthlessness in front of goal and appeared to have a strong belief when they take to the pitch that they can beat any team whether it be at home or away. Their most recent win in which they turned a 3-0 lead at half-time into an emphatic 12-0 victory in last week\u0026#8217s quarter-final tie against much-improved Glenelg is evidence they have the weapons to transform a tight match into a comfortable victory.\nHaving put in impressive defensive displays against both Kyleakin and Portree Juniors in the league, DL MacKinnon\u0026#8217s team have proven they can stand firm when required against tough opponents. That said, he will still be mindful of his side\u0026#8217s loss in their last semi-final encounter against Mallaig \u0026#8211 in what has been their only defeat so far this season \u0026#8211  and will be keen to avoid missing out on a second final.\n\n \u0026#8220It\u0026#8217s going to be a battle at our tight pitch. Key to the result will be our ability to defend set plays, which is not our strong point as we are a very small team. If we can keep Gordy (Mccarroll) and Innis (Thompson) quiet we will hopefully cause them problems with our pace.\u0026#8221\n\u0026nbsp\nWith Sleat and Strath having burst out of the blocks in the league and new boys Mallaig also making their mark, it is perhaps easy to overlook the fact that Kyleakin is not only very much in contention for the league title but have already won a piece of silverware this season with a convincing victory over Mallaig in the GF MacRae Cup.\nWith 22 goals in their last three matches, which included their 10-2 quarter-final win over Kyle, the reigning league champions know how to win games, and ultimately trophies. As well as being well-deserved, their 4-1 victory in the GF MacRae Cup Final against Mallaig was a superb example of game-management against difficult opponents on a big occasion.\nAlthough Kyleakin have put themselves in a good position to challenge on all fronts, they will have to address their inconsistency this season which has seen them held to draws recently by Glenelg and GA United.\nWith back-to-back matches coming up against Sleat and Strath in the cup, then the league, the reigning champions will look to draw on their past successes in the big games.\nBy Adam Gordon\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/web-ad-sales.jpg","title":"recruitment highlighted as a priority at first emergency services","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\nRepresentatives of all the emergency services on Skye held their first ever partnership meeting in Broadford last week to discuss how they can support each other.\nPictured (left to right) are Dave Philips from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, Nick Mort from the British Red Cross, Station Manager Mike Colliar from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, Sgt Andrew Shaw from Police Scotland, Neil Urquhart from Skye Mountain Rescue, Inspector Lynda Allan from Police Scotland, Area Service Manager Alan Knox of Scottish Ambulance Service.

This was subsequently delivered in a letter to the Belfast Headquarters of BBC and RTÉ. \nSinéad Ennis said she will be meeting with RTÉ’s new Head of Sport in the coming days and has called on them to “put measures in place” to end the disenfranchisement of sports fans in the north.”\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27417  ","story":"Declan Kearney addressing The Ard Fheis.\n Declan Kearney\nSinn Féin National Chairperson\nMutual respect and parity of esteem apply equally to our shared Orange and Gaelic cultures, unionist and Republican traditions, and British and Irish identities. - Declan Kearney\nEnsuring that facts should not get in the way of repeating misrepresentationswas a thought which struck forcefully when I read Nelson McCausland’s recentarticle on Orange culture.\nNelson repeated his view that Sinn Féin is prejudiced against the Orange Order,and again ridiculed our commitment to equality, respect and reconciliation.\nHe deliberately and falsely characterised the actions and words of myself andother Sinn Féin leaders.\nThe fact is Orange culture is an integral part of Irish society.

There are many, many more people who have no sight at all. \n  \n“I’ve done training with a guide dog so that I will be ready when the time comes but I’m not at that stage yet.”\n  \nBrian’s latest sponsored walk went ahead in early July and saw around 50 people joined in at very stages of the 13-hour hike.\n  \nIn the previous two years, Brian’s efforts have brought in almost \u0026pound10,000 and he is hopeful that his latest walk will be the best fundraiser yet.\n  \nBut it is not only about raising funds for Brian.\n  \nHe believes that the charity needs to be highlighted for the vital work it does in providing guide dogs.\n  \n“These animals are trained to the highest degree so that a blind person can put their full trust in thedog.\n  \n“That is the real key factor.

It requires a cut and lift once a year in September where the meadow is mowed and the cuttings are lifted which prevents the grass from taking over. The school has achieved so much by doing less and spending no money.\n  \n“The principal, Mrs Lutton has been very supportive of the initiative and the groundsmen have ensured the meadow is looked after in the proper way.”\n  \nRachael said the meadow has been such a success that the school has agreed to extend its size. \n  \nRachel added: “These flowers have been lying dormont in the soil for years waiting for an opportunity. We now have over 20 of these rare flowers after just two years of changing the mowing regime.”\n  \nOther wildflowers found in the meadow include Self-Heal and Birds Foot Trefoil.\n  \nRachael continued: “We would love to see Ballymena schools become a showcase for meadow creation. \n  \n“Council has planted quite a lot of wildflowers around the town and it would be great to see less mowing and more and more of these wonderful meadows.” \n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/spb27-22-jpeg.jpg","title":"65134  ","story":"    \nTHE Vice Chair of the North Antrim Young Democrats, Ballymoney man Mr Timothy McLean has come out in support of the party leader Arlene Foster. \u0026#160\nLast week DUP party stalwart of some 40 years Alderman John Finlay blasted Mrs Foster in an open letter for attending a GAA final on Sunday.\nTimothy McClean, son of Cllr Alan McClean has responded to Alderman Finlay\u0027s comments with the following statement.\nMr McLean said: Arlene Foster has never asked Councillor John Finlay to abandon his conscious or his deeply held beliefs.

Creating an atmosphere where all people can thrive in peace is the surest way to secure our precious Union.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ? \"https://ssl.\" : \"http://www.\")    document.write(unescape(\"%3Cscript src=\u0027\" + gaJsHost + \"google-analytics/ga.js\u0027 type=\u0027text/javascript\u0027%3E%3C/script%3E\"))    \n    \n    var pageTracker = _gat._getTracker(\"UA-4764369-20\")    pageTracker._initData()    pageTracker._trackPageview()    \n      \n\n      \n              \n  \n    \n  \n\n      \n  \n\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/wk19-004cr.jpg","title":"65135  ","story":"    \nTRIBUTES have been flowing in for iconic Ballymoney historian Mr Alex Blair who passed away suddenly at his Lisboy Road home, Kilraughts on Saturday.\nDescribed by one of his many friends as a big man, a private man, a very friendly person the retired Dalriada teacher wore many hats in the town and wider afield.\nHe was a writer and lecturer, the confidante and biographer of the late Mollie Holmes, a traveller and raconteur who had decades long associations with Ballymoney Drama Festival and the Ballymoney Agricultural Show.\nThe Service of Thanksgiving for his life takes place in Kilraughts Presbyterian Church tomorrow (Wednesday) at 11.30am. The house is strictly private.\nFriend and Chairman of Ballymoney Drama Festival, Mr Mac Pollock said: He was a big man in every way, a very private man though he had many public faces he was a very friendly person, was genuine and had many long-standing friendships.

Noel McClean had cut short his holiday in Scotland and returned home when he heard\u0026#160 the news.\nSpeaking to a packed church at the Service of Thanksgiving Rev. McClean said Alex\u0027s death had, shocked the entire community, not only locally but far and wide.\n\u0026#8220We will never see his face again or benefit from his conversation and all the stories that made Alex such a legendry figure with such a wealth of knowledge.\nAfter Rev. McClean\u0027s tribute (see adjoining page), the Rev. Stanley Stewart of Castlerock said a prayer on behalf of the family, his wife Valerie being one of Alex\u0027s closest relatives.\nRev. Stewart said that: Alex had a long life, lived well, and had been a great supporter of the community through his lifelong involvement in many organisations and though his many friendships.\nOne of the many mourners at the service, was Mr Donal O\u0027Hanlon Chair of the Newpoint Players, Newry who have performed at the Ballymoney Drama Festival for 30 years in a row.\nMr O\u0027Hanlon said: We have attended 30 festivals on the trot and the linch pin for us in that was Alex as secretary.\n\u0026#8220Whether there was good adjudication or bad Alex was always there in the tea room to give support and say all that was good about the performances.\nSpeaking from London, Director of Newpoint Players Sean Treanor added Ballymoney will never be the same without him, especially at\u0026#160 festival time.

It was the first time he had competed since withdrawing from the Isle of Man TT Races back in May.\nDunlop was a revered competitor who had more than one hundred wins to his name at both national and international level. 15 of those came at the County Dublin circuit which ultimately claimed his life on Saturday afternoon during practice for the Open Race.\nWhyte said that after some lacklustre seasons where fans only got to see sporadic glimpses of his ability shine through, 2018 looked set to be the start of something special as Dunlop joined forces with Tim Martin in the Superstock and Superbike classes. \nThe team was being built around Dunlop, with Martin ending his sabbatical from the sport after just one year.\n\u0026#8220Tim threw everything he had at it for William, Whyte told Chronicle Sport.

Universal Credit is definitely a part of that, I am in no doubt about that. We have been dealing with people who have said that they are in need of help because of Universal Credit. \nThe figures cover the six month period May to October 2017 and the period January to May 2018 with an average of 30 vouchers a month dealt with in the first period, jumping to 38 in the second.\nPeter acknowledges that these figures are from quite a small area over a limited time \u0027but something must have triggered it.\u0027 He said:There is an unmistakable trend, more people are needing help after Universal Credit. It\u0027s eight more families who need our help every month in a small town like Ballymoney.\nThe Trussell Trust, which compiles UK wide Foodbank figures, say that increases of over 50% are common in areas where UC has been rolled out for a year or more.\nThe Chronicle asked the Department of Communities, who rolled out UC, to comment on the issues raised, with a spokesperson saying: \n\u0026#8220People use food banks for many and varied reasons and it would be misleading to link them to any single cause.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ? \"https://ssl.\" : \"http://www.\")    document.write(unescape(\"%3Cscript src=\u0027\" + gaJsHost + \"google-analytics/ga.js\u0027 type=\u0027text/javascript\u0027%3E%3C/script%3E\"))    \n    \n    var pageTracker = _gat._getTracker(\"UA-4764369-20\")    pageTracker._initData()    pageTracker._trackPageview()    \n      \n\n      \n              \n  \n    \n  \n\n      \n  \n\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/jbllegiofdoolfna1.jpg","title":"65370  ","story":"    \nARMOY Road Races Clerk of the Course Bill Kennedy says this weekend\u0027s 10th anniversary event is a \u0027massive milestone\u0027 for organisers.\nRace Week continues apace until this weekend with practice on Friday and Race Day taking place on Saturday.\nIt\u0027s been a massive achievement for the club, said Kennedy.

This is because Cameron’s health has declined over the last few weeks and we have just been fully focusing on giving Cameron everything he needs at this time.\n\n“It is with the greatest of pains in our heart that we share his journey is near over. We don’t know how long we have left with our beautiful boy but although he is sleeping mostly now he still is fighting with all his might when he is awake. He is in no pain and is just restful. We plan to be at home surrounded by family where he will be happy.\n\n“We can’t thank you all enough for everything you have done for our sweet boy. Because of the love, help and support we received Cameron’s life was greatly extended and in those times he had amazing days that we where so blessed to be apart of.\n\n“We hope to honour Cameron by continuing Cure4Cam. He has spoke of things he wants us to do in his charity and we hope we can do him proud by helping other kids with cancer and funding help and awareness for DIPG as well as much more.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAll the time in the world would not be enough with our amazing son. But we are thankful and honoured to have had the time we have had. We are filled with pride on the young man he has become. He fought this battle with more strength and courage than we could have.\n\nAs our hearts are shattering we ask for prayers. Prayers for Cameron in all that he needs right now, for his sisters and for us and our whole family. \n\n“We are going to take some time out.

It’s important that we show solidarity with the LGBTQ+ community and send a clear message that inequality and discrimination of any kind is simply not tolerable.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAfter the meeting the DUP issued a statement accusing Sinn Fein of hypocrisy.\n\n“The DUP outrightly condemns any act of hate or violence against any member of the community.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nDeputy Lord Mayor, Paul Duffy\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\n“The motion before the Council on Monday night was divisive as there was a significant element of hypocrisy given that Sinn Fein proposed a motion which focused heavily on hate crime, yet the IRA, which by Sinn Féin’s own admission has been inextricably linked to that party, committed some of the most heinous crimes during ‘The Troubles’ for which members of IRA have not been held responsible. \n\n“The families of victims of IRA violence deserve the greatest respect and the ultimate show of remorse for crimes committed against these victims by the IRA would see Sinn Fein ask specifically that those members of the IRA who committed murder and other acts generated by hatred, come forward to face the courts. All other attempts at deflection under the so called banner of ‘equality’ by Sinn Fein will be highlighted by our DUP council grouping.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“The motion appears to have been submitted very late in the day and the implications of such a motion are far reaching. Due process hasn’t been followed, no call for an equality impact assessment as is custom and practise when displaying flags and emblems and we are going against our policies and procedures.\n\n“We as a party fear that this result will open the floodgates for all groups to suggest flying all types of flags from civic buildings, we would argue very strongly that official local authority flagpoles should only be used to fly the nation’s flag or indeed the armed forces flag which incorporates the Union Flag. \n\n“These are the reasons we objected in the strongest possible terms to any other flag being flown and are somewhat dismayed and astounded that only the DUP and Independent councillor David Jones voted against such a haphazard and unprofessional approach. We will on this occasion have to consider taking legal advice and utilising the call in process.”\n\nFollowing the meeting Cllr Jones said: “I opposed the Notice of Motion. My reasons were quite clear. I have no issue or problem with the LGBTQ+ community. Where I have a major problem is such a motion being proposed by Sinn Fein while over a period of thirty years their military wing, PIRA, carried out the most heinous indiscriminate murders on people no matter their sex, religion, colour, age or sexual orientation and have to date offered no remorse or apology for their actions. I do not believe Sinn Fein should be seen as s of minority groups, no matter who or what that group may be.\n\n“During a fractious debate members of Sinn Fein attempted to shout me down. They went as far a proposing a Motion of Censure on me to stop me from speaking at the meeting but following a vote this Motion failed.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“At the close of the debate and despite a rejected amendment being proposed the Sinn Fein Notice of Motion was passed. I and the DUP voted against while the UUP did not vote.\n\n“Once again I feel this shows the desperation of Sinn Fein to latch onto an issue they believe will show them to be the defender of a minority. No doubt they will say I am biased against the LGBTQ+ community. I totally repudiate this. I have worked with, socialised and have friends from the LGBTQ+ community. When I spoke to some of them before last nights meeting and I explained my reasons for not supporting the Sinn Fein Notice of Motion they were equally scathing of it saying they did not want to be used by a political party to bolster their image.”\n\nCllr Catherine Nelson proposed Cllr Jones be censored but this failed due to support from both UUP and DUP members. \n\nCllr Duffy said: “His disregard for the authority of the Mayor fell well short of the behaviour expected from members in the chamber.\n\n“In dredging up the past he used it as an excuse to deny this gesture of solidarity to members of the LGBTQ+ community. I am delighted our motion passed despite his opposition. We will be the first council in the North to fly the rainbow flag and that is something to be proud of.\n\n“I urge members of our local LGBTQ+ Community, and their families, to join me this coming Tuesday night for a celebratory event during Pride Week in Craigavon Civic Centre 7-9pm.”\n\nThose who are interested in attending the event are asked to contact the Lord Mayor’s Office on 028 3752 9633 as they need to know numbers for catering purposes.\n            \n

agent owen becomes secret agent","story":"\nMove over Tom Cruise, there\u0026#8217s a new Mission Impossible star in the making - Portadown Estate Agent Owen Matchett.\n\n                \nAnyone who follows the Williams Estate Agents Facebook page will know only too well they are given to more ‘off the wall posts’.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                \n\n\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nWell next week they are set to scale new heights of daring to promote the agency - by ‘dangling upside down from a helicopter’ in a Mission Impossible spoof video.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nEstate Agent Owen will transform into a Secret Agent - resplendent in full tactical gear - for the movie skit as he tries to place a sold sign on one of his properties.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nThrow in a some stunt driving and a 30 foot fall into an air bag and you have the perfect recipe for an eye-catching and fun video.\n\nExplaining the thinking behind the video Owen said: “A few years ago we did a James Bond skit for the movie Spectre coming out. It got 18,000 views. With Mission Impossible coming out this week, I thought I’d do a bit of a spoof,”\n\n\n   \n                 \n                \n\n\n\nFilming took place at Todd’s Leap in Ballygawley over the weekend and speaking before his movie moment Owen said: “I’m going to go for it big time, I’m just hoping people will find it amusing and entertaining.\n\n“It will involve a high speed helicopter chase, high speed rally driving, abseiling and me jumping 30ft into an airbag.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAnd, while we don’t want to give away the ending, the concluding message is ‘At Williams, no mission is impossible’.\n\nBut Owen’s exploits won’t just be confined to Facebook, as while he is being filmed doing his stunts a TV crew will be along to film him being filmed for a TV slot (that’s nearly as confusing as a Mission Impossible plot).\n\nThe company had approached Owen after they saw his James Bond spoof and had asked him, if he was doing something similar, to invite them along so they could cover the story.\n\nOwen went on to say: “I do these videos thinking outside the box, something a bit different from what other agents might do with housing market figures and such. I don’t do that type of thing.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“I’m a bit of a movie buff and love action movies and hopefully people will get a laugh and some enjoyment out of it.”\n\nThe video will be released on the Williams Facebook page next week - along with details of a competition to win a family day pass to Todd’s Leap.\n\nAnd to conclude in Mission Impossible style: This message might not self destruct but it is tomorrow’s chip paper!\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8572863.1531997113!/image/image.jpg","title":"lockhart hails donaghcloney success","story":"\nDUP MLA Carla Lockhart has congratulated Lower Iveagh West Orange District on a successful Twelfth July week and parade. \n\n                \nThis year Donaghcloney hosted the demonstration and large crowds flocked to the town.

I want to congratulate the officers of Lower Iveagh West Orange District and their organising committee, Donaghcloney Linen Greer Association. I know many hours of planning and preparation went into this event but to good avail.

And just before the youngsters left the nest to take to County Antrim skies, Aidan led a team of birders to ring them. It was a marvellous occasion for all who took part. These participants now share a special bond, a fellowship of the rings not unlike that from the famous trilogy Lord of the Rings itself.\n\nIn April, Aidan was overjoyed to see his first barn owl when, after a three-hour stake-out of the old cottage with Dúlra, one emerged like a ghost from the window and out over the shimmering, moonlit lough. That night one of the most significant barn owl projects was launched – if the birds successfully bred, Aidan determined to ring the chicks, setting in motion a structured, monitored process to analyse the population of one of our most threatened birds, one which was on the verge of extinction in Ireland.\n\n“Now that they have rings, these chicks have become dots on the map of barn owls in the world,” said a proud Aidan. “They are five ambassadors who will contribute to a national scientific study of these birds in Ireland.\n\n“And I want the public to help us. These five birds will leave their nest by next Friday and set out to make lives for themselves. Their territory will be from Hannahstown right out to Lough Neagh. We want people to look out for them. If anyone sees one, we want to know. \n\n“You’ll often see an owl in your headlights, and if you also see a flash of metal on their legs, then it’s one of ours. And we want to know about it especially if you see one of them hurt and in need of help.”\n\nThe team weighed and measured the chicks, discovering that four of them were male. “That’s four new territories for breeding barn owls next year,” Aidan said.\n\nAidan and pals – including Belfast Media Group editor Robin Livingstone – set out to ring the chicks in a slick operation.\n\n“This was all about planning,” said Aidan. “We wanted to keep disturbance to a minimum so we had it all worked out beforehand.\n\n“Everyone knew their job, be it climbing the ladder to the nest, weighing the birds, writing their details in the log book, putting on the rings. And everyone was caring and sensitive of the brood. We only spoke when we had to and were gone as soon as possible.\n\n “Adult owls leave their chicks alone in the nest, so the two parents were sleeping in the chimney pot when we went to the nest in the rafters and they weren’t disturbed at all. Owls could teach us a lot – once the chicks are four weeks old the parents sleep in a different bedroom. They know they’ll not get any peace with the young ‘uns playing and constantly pulling at them because they want the bird equivalent of McDonald’s and Pizza Hut. \n\n“The parents go somewhere else so they can get a good night’s sleep rather than stay with their teenage brood.”\n\nThe chick with Aidan is about 40 days old – owls incubate their eggs as soon as each is laid, unlike garden birds who wait until all the eggs are laid before they incubate to ensure they all hatch together – so the five chicks are all different ages and weights.\n\n“This was pretty special for me,” said Aidan. “Despite a lifetime of birdwatching, I’d never seen a single barn owl until this year. To see five chicks in a single nest is phenomenal. This is one of the biggest broods ever recorded, and shows that the birds here are healthy and finding plenty of food.”\nThe old abandoned cottage is on land belonging to the owner of Randox Laboratories Dr Peter Fitzgerald, who is said to be delighted that barn owls have chosen to nest there and is backing the study of the chicks.\n\nAidan added: “There may be only a couple of pair of breeding barn owls in the whole north of Ireland, so these chicks are precious and represent hope that they can make a comeback. A big congratulations is due to everyone concerned.”\n\n* If you’ve seen anything interesting or have any nature questions, you can text Dúlra on 07801 414804.\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"internet sensation set to go on stage","story":"                                                                                                  \t                \t\n\nA WEST\n Belfast comedian whose parody of chart hits from the likes of Ed Sheeran – which has seen him go ‘viral’ on the internet – is about to headline his own show such is the demand to see him live.\nBrooke’s Paddy Rafferty, known to fans as Paddy Raff, will perform at the Foundry Club, formerly the Stiff Kitten, in the city centre on Friday July 27. The 34-year-old told the Andersonstown News how he had always been performing skits and his own take on songs throughout the years and decided that 2018 was his year to try his hand at stand-up.\n“Even back at school I would always try and change the lyrics of songs, whatever was popular at the time. The ability to flip lyrics dead quick always came naturally to me,” he said.\nPaddy explained how he started to play guitar in his teens and began to use his talent to create comedy videos which he has since posted on his social media Facebook page and which now have received thousands of hits.\n“I have my own take on Ed Sheeran’s ‘Galway Girl’ – I do ‘Broadway Girl’ and instead of Fountains of Wayne’s ‘Stacey’s Mom’ I sing about Stacey’s Ma. I’ve only really been performing since March but it has really taken off and it’s going really well.”\nPaddy said he is really looking forward to performing at The Foundry – which is already approaching a sell out.\n“I have always been a big fan of Billy Connolly, who funnily enough used a guitar as well in his early gigs. I’ve always loved stand-up comedy and never for a minute thought I’d actually be up there doing it myself.\n“It’s great to know that people will be coming next Friday to see and hear my stuff, I’m not being complacent, I’m putting the work in so it’s going to be a great night for everyone coming along.”\nPaddy will play The Foundry on Friday July 27.

A petition is to be opened ,which, if signed by 10 per cent of the North Antrim electorate will lead to a by-election and Mr Paisley being forced to stand down.\nSir Kevin Barron, chair of the Standards Committee, who delivered the findings, concluded that Mr Paisley was guilty of \u0026#8220serious misconduct and his actions were of a nature to bring the House of Commons into disrepute\u0026#8221.\nIn response, the DUP have suspended Paisley “pending further investigation into his conduct.”\nSinn Féin North Antrim MLA Philip McGuigan said the DUP cannot dismiss the fact that its Mr Paisley lobbied in defence of a regime with a shocking human rights record.\n “Much of the focus of the Ian Paisley scandal has revolved around his failure to declare two lavish family holidays paid for by the Sri Lankan government,” he said.\n“That is understandable given the focus on integrity in government following the DUP’s involvement in a number of scandals including RHI, Nama, Red Sky and dark money for Brexit.\n “These have all severely damaged public confidence in the political institutions but this latest scandal also calls into the question where the DUP stands on fundamental questions of human rights.\n“Amnesty International has said that serious human rights abuses were committed with impunity by the Sri Lankan regime during the conflict there.\n“Yet, after receiving his gifts from the Sri Lankan government, Ian Paisley actively lobbied the British Prime Minister to oppose a United Nations resolution to establish an international investigation into the human rights abuses in Sri Lanka.\n“Does the DUP leadership really believe that it is acceptable to dismiss the fact that one of its MPs lobbied in defence of a regime that carried out mass murder, war crimes and gross human rights abuses?\n“This is a litmus test for the DUP leadership and If Ian Paisley does not do the right thing and voluntarily resign, his party should compel him to do so.”\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"ms decision to close lisburns bow street mall store described as a blow to city centre","story":"                                                                                                  \t                \t\n\nSDLP MLA Pat Catney\n has said the loss of the M\u0026#038S Simply Food store in Lisburn’s Bow Street Mall is “a blow” to the city centre, to staff and shoppers.\nIn a statement Marks and Spencer said it had opted not to renew its lease on the Simply Food store but that no jobs were at risk with staff having been advised that all existing employees at the Lisburn branch will be redeployed.\nThe closure of the food store, which has been open ten years and employs 40 staff, will further add to the many already shuttered and empty retail slots in the complex following the liquidation of its anchor tenant BHS.\n“Any loss of business in Lisburn is a drain,” said Mr Catney. “Any business closure makes it more difficult for retailers to build their product up,” he said. “It’s the old saying – there’s no point going to market if there are only two stores in it. We need to be working to lift, build, Lisburn city centre up together.”\nMr Catney told Daily Belfast that the issue of paid city centre parking is taking a heavy toll  as shoppers are choosing to travel and spend their money elsewhere.\n“I personally don’t like the paid parking from a trading point of view, the parking attendants are very, very strict and I’m calling upon the city centre management from us as MLAs to really look at a strategy that will lift where we work in the city.”\nMr Catney described as “disappointing” the fact the Belfast Rapid Transit (BRT) scheme was not rolled out to Lisburn. “You have this Glider bus running from West to East in Belfast that could’ve pulled on out here. This is a commuter town, there are so many developments being built here with a lot more young people and families moving here so I would’ve liked to have seen that considered.\n“I will be contacting Translink over the coming days to request that bus services to Sprucefield shopping centre are frequent enough for those consumers who previously used to shop at M\u0026#038S in the town centre.”\nThe M\u0026#038S Simply Food store is expected to close its doors in the autumn. \n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"name change opposed by belfast celtic society","story":"                                                                                                  \t                \t\n\nPLANS\n for Sport and Leisure Swifts to change their name to Belfast Celtic suffered a setback yesterday with the news that the Belfast Celtic Society has voiced their opposition to the move. \n\nThe Glen Road Heights outfit announced its intentions to change their name in a statement issued on social media earlier this month, with the aim of “improving the club and improving the footballing prospects for young people in West Belfast”. \n\nHowever, despite approaching the society prior to making their announcement, Sport and Leisure’s plans have been met with opposition from the Belfast Celtic Society. \n\nHaving distanced themselves from the name change in a previous statement, primarily due to their status as a charitable organisation, the Belfast Celtic Society held a full committee meeting yesterday morning (Wednesday) to discuss the matter. \n\n“The Belfast Celtic Society again reiterates that it had no involvement in this venture,” a spokesperson said. “The Society was only made aware of the development 48 hours before the public announcement. \n\n“The Society was surprised by this announcement and the reaction received from both our membership as well as the general sporting public has been overwhelmingly negative. \n\n“Since its foundation almost two decades ago, the Society has been approached on more than one occasion to endorse and support a range of commercial enterprises with the intention of exploiting the name of the club for commercial gain. \n\n“Over this period, our standard response has been that this is contrary to the constitution of the society which is regulated by the Charity Commission.” \n\nThe Society also expressed its concern that the families of the former players of Belfast Celtic were not consulted prior to the announcement. \n\nThe Belfast Celtic Society also claim that the trademark registered by businessman Anthony John Bonnar earlier this year is a new company and is not linked to the old Belfast Celtic Football and Athletic Company. \n\nHowever, speaking to the Andersonstown News, Sport and Leisure chairman Jim Gillen said that while he was disappointed the Belfast Celtic Society hadn’t supported the name change, he stressed that the club will be moving forward with their plans regardless. \n\n“We have everything in place. As of yet, the IFA (Irish Football Association) has yet to rubber-stamp it,” said Gillen. \n\n“We have to go ahead with it. We informed them (the Belfast Celtic Society) and we spoke to a few members. They seemed to think it was a good idea. They’ve obviously put it to their full committee and they have given a different outlook. There’s nothing we can do about that other than trying to change their mind. \n\n“We would like to go ahead with their blessing and indeed the blessing of everybody in West Belfast. We’ll stay positive on what we are trying to achieve.” \n\nSport and Leisure Swifts are set to play their first game of the new season against Armagh City on Saturday, August 18 and are hoping the name change to Belfast Celtic will be approved by the IFA before that fixture.\n"}]
