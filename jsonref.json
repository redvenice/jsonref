Motoring groups welcomed the possibility of a 60mph limit.Steve Gooding, director of the RAC Foundation, said: ‘Few things irritate motorists more than roadworks when there’s no sign of activity, or are as frustrating as seeing that the road ahead is clear but to be stuck at 50 miles per hour.‘Motorists might well ask whether every effort has been made to get road improvement schemes accelerated to take advantage of lockdown traffic volumes, and whether schemes are being managed in a way that minimises disruption.’Nicholas Lyes, head of roads policy at the RAC, added: ‘Drivers need to prepare themselves for many years of roadworks ahead.‘When it comes to new stretches of smart motorway, they can only hope that all the years of works and reduced speed limits are worth it in terms of increased capacity. Worryingly though, drivers tell us they have serious concerns about how safe these motorways are.’A Highways England spokesman said: ‘We understand people get frustrated with roadworks.‘That is why we have been carrying out these further trials to look at where we can increase the speed limit to 60mph in different types of roadworks and in different ways – such as 247, or when there is less activity on site, or on the side of the road furthest from road workers.’"},{"url":null,"title":"Baby boy born lockdown 23 weeks weighing just 1lb set home","story":"Share this articleLockdown baby boy born seven inches long at 23 weeks set to go home after winning his battle for life"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9937953b19ee816b90f0918cff13af8dfccc49c1/0_33_2946_1769/master/2946.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=9a4dfbb79c5e06e895e6124e1586f8f6","title":"amanda staveley in tears after barclays lawyer accuses her of engaging in a hustle","story":"Businesswoman is seeking £1.5bn from bank in high court action over £2bn Qatari loanA businesswoman embroiled in a £1.5bn high court battle with Barclays broke down in tears after bank bosses accused her of engaging in a “hustle”.Amanda Staveley has made complaints about bank bosses’ behaviour when negotiating investment deals during the 2008 financial crisis.Staveley said Barclays agreed to provide an unsecured £2bn loan to Qatari investors. But she said that loan was “concealed” from the market, shareholders and from PCP Capital Partners, the private equity firm she ran. PCP is suing the bank and wants £1.5bn in damages.Staveley said PCP was owed money for the work it did. Barclays disputes the claim and says it is “made of sand”.Mr Justice Waksman began overseeing a trial in London two weeks ago, which is due to last two months.A barrister leading the bank’s legal team on Friday spent 29 minutes putting Barclays’ case to Staveley.Jeffery Onions QC suggested Staveley had seen an opportunity to “insert” herself into negotiations, had effectively engaged in a “hustle”, was prepared to “lie” in order to extract money she was not entitled to, wanted fees that were “commercially ridiculous” and had exaggerated the nature of her relationship with a Middle Eastern sheikh.Staveley denied his suggestions and then started crying.A lawyer leading PCP’s legal team said Onions’ suggestions were an “extraordinary and bizarre 29 minutes”.Joe Smouha QC told the judge that what Onions had said was “ridiculous”.Onions suggested to Staveley: “You saw an opportunity to insert yourself into the Barclays’ transaction and engineered a place for yourself. You were effectively engaged in what might colloquially be described as a hustle.”He suggested Staveley was “somebody who was prepared to lie and rely on false documents to extract money you were not entitled to”. Onions alleged she had brought the claim because she thought Barclays would settle.But Staveley said she did not accept Onions’ suggestions and did not agree with them.Staveley, who in recent months has been involved in brokering a deal that could give a Saudi consortium control of Premier League football club Newcastle United, has given evidence over six days.The judge has heard how PCP’s claim arose out of the recapitalisation of Barclays in October and November 2008.Staveley said PCP introduced a Middle Eastern investor, Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al-Nahyan of Abu Dhabi, to Barclays and he “subscribed” to invest £3.25bn. But she said PCP had been induced to invest on “manifestly worse terms” than investors from Qatar.In February, three former Barclays’ bosses were cleared of fraud over a £4bn investment deal with Qatar at the height of the banking crisis.The Serious Fraud Office had alleged that lucrative terms given to Qatar were hidden from the market and other investors. But Roger Jenkins, Thomas Kalaris and Richard Boath were acquitted by jurors after a trial at the Old Bailey."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5daa31b869392b876507bd8ff18202bd59f99d0b/0_223_4751_2853/master/4751.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c52715db1b9792e5534af93b4895c97f","title":"ministers extend ban on evicting uk high street firms until autumn","story":"Code of practice also set up to aid landlord negotiations amid lockdown falloutA temporary ban on the eviction of high street businesses for non-payment of rent has been extended by the government until the autumn.The moratorium on evictions was extended on Friday from 30 June to the end of September. The government also published a code of practice to marshal increasingly tense negotiations between landlords and tenants as both sides grapple with the extreme financial pressure created by the coronavirus shutdown.Next Wednesday is the latest quarter day, when retail and hospitality chains are required to pay three months’ rent. However, many businesses have severe cashflow problems after being forced to shut their doors during the lockdown.Only about half the rent due on the previous quarter day in March was paid. Landlords expect even less to arrive in their bank accounts this month, a shortfall that is putting the finances of property companies under strain too.Robert Jenrick, the communities secretary, said the government was extending measures to prevent struggling companies from eviction over the summer. The new code, he hoped, would “help unlock conversations on rent and future payments whilst ensuring best practice is displayed across the board as we confront the challenges of this pandemic”.The window that prevented landlords from taking legal action against tenants who had not paid their rent (unless the amount owed is 189 days or more) has also been extended until 30 September. Landlords are also prohibited from sending their tenants statutory demands, a formal request for payment or winding-up petitions – legal notices usually sent by a creditor requesting the courts close a company that owes it money – until the autumn.Property owners have complained that some tenants are exploiting the emergency measures to renege on rent. The code, which is voluntary, states that tenants should “continue to pay their rent in full if they are in a position to do so” and that others should “pay what they can”. Landlords should provide support if they are able to, with both sides encouraged to be transparent about their finances.The code outlines options that could be pursued to break the deadlock between landlord and tenant, including offering rent holidays or switching to a monthly rather than quarterly payment schedule. Landlords could also draw from rent deposits on the understanding that they would not need to “topped up” in the short term. Any reduction in service charges should also be passed on to tenants, it suggests.Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, the industry trade group, said the lockdown had created a “gaping hole” in many retailers’ finances. These woes had been exacerbated by continued rent demands on stores that were closed, she said.The code did not provide a solution for businesses who were “simply unable to pay what is being demanded”, according to Dickinson. She said: “Without further action, both retailers and landlords remain in a precarious situation that could lead to substantial numbers of redundancies as soon as tenant protections expire.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f65f04fe8f24007254a70bdd5fd2103549638233/14_392_6680_4008/master/6680.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=325f2891f718c2b1eb01576145f00882","title":"the 12 per cent rise in uk retail spending should come with note of caution coronavirus","story":"Jump seems consistent with idea of V-shaped economic recovery but is too soon to tellNor should retail sales be confused with consumer spending. Retail sales are the goods that people buy, either in the shops or online. Consumer spending includes services such as eating out in restaurants or staying in hotels – and those bits of the economy remain shuttered.Retail sales account for only about a third of overall consumer spending and there is, as Samuel Tombs of Pantheon Consulting notes, every possibility that some of the money that would have been spent on services was instead spent on retail goods. He gives the example of people using the money saved from gym memberships to buy fitness equipment instead.Back then, of course, the debt ratio was coming down from the much higher levels caused by the borrowing during the second world war. Record levels of peacetime borrowing and a rising debt ratio make the treasury uncomfortable, which is why the furlough scheme is being tapered from the start of August and will be wound up in October.The big unknown is whether households are going to carry on spending as the wage subsidies are removed and unemployment continues to rise.

I had only recently passed my driving test and I didn’t yet have any idea how long driving took – I basically thought I was in a Harrier jump jet. I made myself so late for some unmemorable obligation that I was trying to do my mascara while driving, missed a give-way line until seconds before, braked suddenly and got rammed from behind by a driver whose fault it categorically was not (whatever the rules say).I got towed to a garage, was super-late for whatever it was I had been rushing to, left whatever I had bought in the boot of my totalled vehicle and never saw it again, got given a replacement car and ran out of petrol in the fast lane of a lesser-spotted five-lane segment of motorway and, narrowly escaping with not only my own life but also those of most of my siblings, had to get towed again. What were the chances, I railed to the skies, that in what was already the worst week of my life I would also end up on the back of a flatbed truck on two occasions?Here is some crucial wisdom, from one middle-aged adult to any adults who are slightly younger or have had a less mishap-strewn life: the chances were really high. When something like this happens, it is neither karma nor coincidence: it is you. You are having the problems because you are the problem. It is like “You are not stuck in traffic, you are traffic”, only worse, because at least then there are other people suffering with you. It is nature’s way of telling you that you are tired and you should stop doing things, only, because nature is an incredibly quiet and subtle messenger, you will already have mucked a bunch of stuff up before you hear her.I took it to my reputable local computer-mender, where they were signalling their one-person-at-a-time coronavirus policy by keeping their security shutters half-drawn, so you had to crouch down to get in, like the lift in Being John Malkovich. I managed that perfectly, even gracefully, on the way in and we had a nice catchup – I know them pretty well from all the times I have smashed my phone – and talked a bit about water damage, until one of them said: “Why does it smell like beer?”I noticed, on my return, that the ceiling in the living room was wet and chalked this up to yet more beer, soaking through the floorboards. This was a complete overestimation of how much damage the last dregs of a single beer bottle can do, not to mention a radical misunderstanding of the layout of the house, in which the bedroom is not above the living room.It transpired a day later that there was a leak, which had by now done all the damage in the world. The ceiling was sagging like a hammock and there was the ominous smell of plaster that really wanted to succumb to gravity. “Definitely don’t sit underneath it,” said the plumber who arrived the next day. I thought: “Huh, what kind of idiot does he take me for?” But when it came to the bit where he disappeared for parts, and I tried and failed to find my phone so I could pay him, it turned out – this bit of deductive reasoning took a really long time – that I had stored my phone, carefully, at the bottom of the outdoors recycling bin.I saw, or thought I saw, a lot of thoughts running across his face: who does that? Is this some elaborate grift, where she borrows my phone to find her own, then somehow escapes with my van and all my tools that I don’t leave in there overnight? Or is this simply a person in a high state of tension because parts of her house are falling down?It is just enough, is what it is. This isn’t nature’s way of telling me to sleep more. This is nature’s way of telling me to stop saying: “Fine, actually – I don’t mind it,” whenever anyone asks me how lockdown is going. Because the true answer is something different from that, something that does not sound like words, just a string of consonants, not even looking for a vowel."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a30f20be081e43a27ca5a96b11934998a8a99de/0_113_3088_1853/master/3088.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef1aad203a1c88b0482731beeb1ba3fc","title":"labours electoral postmortem is sobering but we need the party more than ever","story":"There are many things to learn from the report on Labour’s defeat, including that the UK needs its transformative politicsThe postmortem into the Labour party’s defeat compiled by Labour Together – a joint enterprise straddling different strands of the party – is as impressive as it is sobering. Labour lost votes across the board, but particularly in working-class communities that the party was founded 120 years ago to represent. A combination of Jeremy Corbyn’s cratered personal approval ratings, Brexit and an overall policy package widely deemed unbelievable are all blamed. As the report notes, Labour’s troubles did not begin under Corbyn or his predecessor, Ed Miliband: its electoral coalition “had been fracturing for a long time”, mirroring similar traumas afflicting its European sister parties.How does Labour solve such an existential problem? Not easily. Regional inequality is perversely hammering the party: many younger people feel they lack opportunities in smaller towns, move to big cities, and take their Labour votes with them. They are attracted to Labour because of economic insecurity, having been clobbered by spending cuts and the housing crisis, and because of keenly held progressive social values they fear are under attack. Older voters, meanwhile, have rightly been protected by the triple-lock on pensions, are largely homeowners who have benefited from rising house prices, and tend towards social conservatism. Bridging this gap is a formidable challenge: younger voters have little sentimental attachment to Labour and will take their votes elsewhere if they feel the party has abandoned them. Indeed, Labour should fear the Lib Dems under the prospective leadership candidate, Layla Moran, who has unveiled a series of left-leaning policies.The Tory architects of the EU referendum were political geniuses, whether inadvertently or not. Brexit provided a means to detoxify the Conservatives in the eyes of older working-class voters who had suffered under Thatcherite deindustrialisation, wreaking havoc on Labour’s electoral coalition. The hung parliament, which delighted Corbyn’s supporters, sowed the seeds for Labour’s obliteration. The resulting deadlock allowed a well-funded remain faction to become increasingly emboldened about reversing the referendum result altogether, rather than settling for a soft Brexit. Leavers, on the other hand, could claim that the democratic outcome of the referendum was imperilled, and the collapse of Theresa May’s authority allowed them to portray any Brexit deal as a sell-out. Both factions played off each other in a positive feedback loop. Labour’s Brexit compromise – leave the EU but with a close relationship – was burned to a crisp, vilified by both sides.As the Labour leadership desperately tried to keep both factions on board, and as message discipline collapsed, with prominent politicians representing remain or leave constituencies making conflicting public arguments, Corbyn was left looking weak and indecisive. According to YouGov polling at the beginning of 2019, more than three-quarters of the reasons for the collapse in his polling were directly or indirectly to do with Brexit.According to the same pollster, nearly half of Labour switchers to the Tories in 2019 identified Brexit as their reason, followed by more than a quarter who pointed to party leaderships. But it is facile to say that Labour should have resisted the siren call of a new referendum. At that moment in time, it had the overwhelming support of the membership, and Corbyn felt that the party could not stay neutral, privately noting, “We’ve taken the membership too far.” He had been elected as the tribune of the members, after all, and felt he had no option.The report rightly assails the hubris that followed the 2017 election. There was no detailed assessment of why Labour failed to win and no meaningful strategy paper was ever written. The party was, the report notes, completely unprepared for the election, lacking a clear message, and it was unclear who was in charge. This is all true. In 2017, there was a unified Labour leadership which – as the recent leaked Labour report detailed – was up against a hostile headquarters. In 2019, the leadership had become bitterly ided, partly over the handling of antisemitism but principally over Brexit. Leading figures fell out badly. A palace coup in October against the chief of staff, Karie Murphy, was intended to lead to a six-month long reorganisation of the operation, but the election quickly intruded, and it merely compounded bitter isions and left no clear authority figure in place. The splits meant that throughout the campaign policy, communications and events were all working separately. Unlike 2017 – when “for the many, not the few” encapsulated a modern class politics that resonated – there was no clear theme. The leadership had become addicted to the idea that dropping new policies was the only means of securing positive coverage and deflecting from the isive issue of Brexit: but the policy incontinence left the public bewildered and, ultimately, contemptuous.Labour was undoubtedly up against an overwhelmingly hostile media that vilified Corbyn, and many internal opponents waged a scorched earth policy too. But it would be a mistake to read this report and conclude that any politics that seeks to transform society – rather than trim round the edges – is ultimately doomed. As the report concludes, Labour must be “the party of big economic change for the whole country and every part of it”. In this age of upheaval, that is truer than at any time since the second world war. Let us hope Keir Starmer and his team take note."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/92ec7206acee294b82eedde11614e21f2bc43bb2/38_314_3366_2020/master/3366.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b96607f7b4c085636d5ed91bd2534ee5","title":"england to drop class bubbles and pupil caps from september school","story":"Government wants all pupils back full-time in new school year, education secretary saysMinisters plan to drop restrictions on classroom “bubbles” to let all pupils attend school full-time in England from September, the education secretary has said.Gavin Williamson said lifting the 15-pupil cap and expanding the size of protective bubbles would enable whole classes of 30 to be taught together, overcoming the lack of space that has resulted in schools having to rotate year groups.“We’ve been creating bubbles of children in the classroom, creating a protective environment for those children. Currently that is at 15 – what we would be looking at doing is expanding those bubbles to include the whole class,” Williamson told the Downing Street coronavirus press briefing on Friday.He said further guidance on safety would be issued in the next two weeks.The UK coronavirus alert level was lowered from 4 to 3 on Friday, meaning transmission is no longer judged to be “high or exponentially rising”.Williamson’s comments echoed earlier remarks by Boris Johnson, who said “watch this space” when asked about the physical distancing requirement for schools being cut from 2 metres to 1 metre, “if the science allows”.“I want every child, every pupil, every student, back in September. I’m sure it can be done,” the prime minister said during a visit to a school in Hertfordshire to publicise the government’s £1bn catch-up plan for schools in England announced on Friday.The plan was quickly criticised for ignoring the needs of 1 million young people aged 16-18, and for being an inadequate response to “the biggest challenge facing schools” in generations.Epidemics of infectious diseases behave in different ways but the\u0026nbsp1918 influenza pandemic\u0026nbspthat killed more than 50 million people is regarded as a key example of a pandemic that occurred in multiple waves, with the latter more severe than the first. It has been replicated – albeit more mildly – in subsequent flu pandemics.How and why multiple-wave outbreaks occur, and how subsequent waves of infection can be prevented, has become a staple of epidemiological modelling studies and pandemic preparation, which have looked at everything from social behaviour and health policy to vaccination and the buildup of community immunity, also known as herd immunity.This is being watched very carefully. Without a vaccine, and with no widespread immunity to the new disease, one alarm is being sounded by the experience of Singapore, which has seen a sudden\u0026nbspresurgence in infections\u0026nbspdespite being lauded for its early handling of the outbreak.Although Singapore instituted a strong contact tracing system for its general population, the disease re-emerged in\u0026nbspcramped dormitory accommodation\u0026nbspused by thousands of foreign workers with inadequate hygiene facilities and shared canteens.Singapore’s experience, although very specific, has demonstrated the ability of the disease to come back strongly in places where people are in close proximity and its ability to exploit any weakness in public health regimes set up to counter it.In June 2020, Beijing suffered from a new cluster of coronavirus cases which caused authorities to re-implement restrictions that CHina had previously been able to lift.Conventional wisdom among scientists suggests second waves of resistant infections occur after the capacity for treatment and isolation becomes exhausted. In this case the concern is that the social and political consensus supporting lockdowns is being overtaken by public frustration and the urgent need to reopen economies.The threat declines when susceptibility of the population to the disease falls below a certain threshold or when widespread vaccination becomes available.In general terms the ratio of susceptible and immune iniduals in a population at the end of one wave determines the potential magnitude of a subsequent wave. The worry right now is that with\u0026nbspa vaccine still many months away, and the real rate of infection only being guessed at, populations worldwide remain highly vulnerable to both resurgence and subsequent waves.Under the plan, state schools in England would be given £650m to fund efforts to help pupils affected by the coronavirus lockdown, under which nurseries, schools and colleges have been closed to most children since mid-March.While schools have made major efforts to provide remote learning, there are fears that pupils lacking parental support or internet access are in danger of falling behind their peers. But the extra funding is only to be applied to pupils aged between five and 16, provoking complaints from the heads of sixth form and further education colleges. Some of their students will have only seven months in the classroom until they sit exams next spring.David Hughes, the chief executive of the Association of Colleges, said the funding proposals would fail to cover two-thirds of young people aged 16-18.“It is indefensible to overlook the needs of the 700,000 in colleges,” he said. “I expect their exclusion from this announcement to be followed rapidly by clarification on the funding and support for college students. We are in contact with the Department for Education and hope to have this rectified as soon as possible.”Matthew O’Leary, a professor of education at Birmingham City University, said: “Yet again, the government has ignored the needs of students in further education colleges. Despite having previously promised to make funds available to support 16-19 provision, further education has once again been left out, reinforcing how the sector seems to be invisible to this government.”The IFS said: “The loss of learning and the likely widening of educational inequalities since lockdown is the biggest challenge facing schools in generations. The £650m to be provided direct to schools this year … is modest relative to the scale of this challenge.”Several headteachers who spoke to the  expressed scepticism that such a programme could be up and running by the start of the next school year, in September, with its scope potentially including 1 million pupils receiving free school meals.The EEF’s guidance states that a well-structured tutoring programme would cost around £700 per pupil for 12 weeks, and include 30-minute sessions five times a week. But it also states that “the evidence suggests that impacts are generally higher when delivered by teachers”.The EEF is piloting a national tutoring programme involving four external agencies, including two that pay tutors and two that use unpaid volunteers.A volunteer who signed up to one of the agencies involved said she was dismayed to discover her unpaid work to help disadvantaged children would be used by the government to claim it was funding efforts to repair the education lost during the lockdown.She said she had no teaching experience and would only receive two hours of training before tutoring children, although the agency had given her a disclosure and barring service (DBS) criminal records check. The main requirement for volunteer tutors was that they have a degree and an A-level in the subject they were to teach, and a minimum commitment of one hour a week.“It seems like the government is trying to give the impression that they are budgeting for professional teachers, and that feels like a trick,” she said.Nick Gibb, the schools minister, said the government was working with experts on how best to support under-fives and those aged 16-18, and “we’ll have more to say on that soon”.Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of Schools and College Leaders, said: “It is very important that this guidance is supplied to schools and colleges as soon as possible. They are doing their best to put in place plans for September but they have so far had to do this in the dark without any input from the government.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/904b4aad2e77d1c0fc5868c960de4c11909a087a/0_347_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=63f14c2d5b3bf434e244d03003c9c541","title":"its a basic equality issue home learning gap between state and private schools","story":"Lessons continue online at Manchester grammar school while nearby St Ambrose Barlow buys books for disadvantaged pupilsIt is 9.30am in the staff room at Manchester grammar school (MGS) and the head of chemistry, Fay Roberts, is settled in the windowless cupboard where she now does much of her teaching.

Many, but not all, were among the 200 boys on full bursaries at the school, which otherwise charges fees of £12,930 a year.Staff rounded up all spare laptops, dismantled a bunch of desktop computers and dropped them off at pupils’ homes. Boulton’s ambitious plan to transfer the entire curriculum online could only work if every boy could log on to Microsoft Teams.The fact that most state schools could not follow suit is the main reason, Boulton believes, that an estimated 2 million children in the UK – one in five of the total – have done little or no work since lockdown.“The one thing the government needed to get right – and still needs to get right –\u0026nbspis ensuring that every child has access to a computer and the internet. The government announced its centralised scheme offering laptops to disadvantaged children on 19 April. I had a couple of state school heads come in to share ideas yesterday and I know one of those hasn’t received a single laptop,” he said as he gave the  a tour of his almost empty school.He believes the government should have announced a national drive to get computers to all children, like it did with ventilators for hospitals. “Think of how many offices will have laptops lying around surplus to requirements.”Ten miles away in Salford, in a modern complex next to the M60 ringroad, Ben Davis, the head at St Ambrose Barlow Roman Catholic high school, has yet to receive any of the laptops he applied for via the government scheme. Only 10 children qualified, despite more than half of his 1,000 pupils not having their own computer. Many have been sharing with siblings or home-working parents, and a small number – fewer than 20, he thinks – have no suitable device at all.The school quickly gave out all its spares but there were not nearly enough to go round. This is partly why the school has not been offering regular lessons live online in most subjects (“it’s a basic equality issue”), and why at Easter it decided to go analogue, buying hundreds of textbooks to deliver to families where internet and computer access was “compromised”.Live teaching is not the holy grail, insists Davis, who has been head for almost five years. “I do think it’s perfectly possible for kids to have a really valuable experience of learning without live teaching.”He decided early on that the wellbeing of his students had to come first. “Lost learning is serious but it’s not as serious in the long-run as damaged wellbeing, which is fundamentally a real problem for children and families. We were very concerned about the effects of isolation and the likelihood of domestic violence increasing, of families coming under strain.” Though teachers are not marking work, as advised by the National Education Union, the main teachers’ union, they phone every pupil at least once a week and give feedback whenever they can.On Monday this week, Davis’s newly sterile school – water fountains taped off, yellow footprints in the corridors to mark out 2-metre spacings – reopened for year 10s to come in with a parent or carer for a pastoral chat with their form teacher. Half an hour each was allocated, “but some have taken an hour and a half. People have a lot to say. It all comes pouring out.”The year 10s won’t be taught anything in school until 29 June, when they will return for one day a week in bubbles of eight pupils for private study and support with wellbeing and home learning, which will remain the predominant form of education for all St Ambrose pupils.At MGS, which normally has 233 pupils in its Swiss chalet-like wooden junior school, year 6 pupils have been back for three weeks. Children who are at home shielding themselves or a family member are able to log in from home to a classroom rigged up with a camera so they can see their teacher and friends, chipping in when they know the answer and asking for help in real time.The sophisticated set-up has not cost much, Boulton says. “We’ve not thrown a lot of money at this issue to make it work. We’ve asked an immense amount of our teachers.” Regardless of their own caring commitments, teachers have had to work full time, though those with children at home have been allowed to encourage more independent learning, which they mark when their own offspring are in bed.The results, he says, have exceeded expectations. “Because we have stuck to our normal timetable, lessons have gone on as normal, but we haven’t been doing cricket fixtures, athletic meets, all of those things that would take children out of school. The focus of pace and teaching is different using the technology. Everybody has come to me and said we’ve got through the syllabus and are doing a lot of extension work.Davis and his team decided that three hours a day was a realistic target for their pupils to learn during lockdown, down from the five they would have normally. “Fairly quickly we realised – and I realise this as a parent as well – that a lot of kids can do the work quicker – though not necessarily better – at home than they can in school, for the simple reason that they are not having a teacher stand and take a register and explain things. If you say to all the kids: ‘You must be working from 8.40 until just after 3pm,’ that’s going to create huge pressure in families. How is that practical if everyone else is working from home?”Could St Ambrose offer a full timetable like MGS? “If we took the step of saying everything is going online, we would risk cutting out quite a large proportion of our catchment area – and we are not a school with a disproportionate level of disadvantage,” says Davis.“If I knew all children had access to a computer and broadband, you would still need to manage the workload and the expectations on the teacher and also how you do period after period with 30 kids. In theory I can see it would have some merits. My concern is that I can’t see everyone having that provision. It’s a lovely aspiration.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b17e0029fd49d882db07997b37bd61ddf65cfea8/8_104_1272_763/master/1272.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=855e4070722b3fe4b502d0ad9beef611","title":"tiny plankton tell the oceans story this vast marine mission has been listening","story":"Since 1931 ‘citizen scientists’ on ships have enabled data collection on the tiny building blocks of the sea. Now this research could shape how we tackle the climate crisisOn a clear day, from their small, unassuming warehouse on the south Devon coast, Lance Gregory and Dave Wilson can see right across Plymouth Sound to the Eddystone lighthouse. Today, they’re watching a ferry from Brittany, the Armorique, pull into dock.Behind it, the ferry is towing a one-metre-long device shaped like a torpedo. It doesn’t look like much, but it’s part of the planet’s longest-running global marine survey.The device is called a continuous plankton recorder (CPR), and it’s one of 53 such devices that Gregory and Wilson manoeuvre using forklifts in their warehouse, surrounded by racks of distinctive yellow boxes and clipboards covered in spreadsheets.They dispatch these CPRs in bright yellow boxes to “ships of opportunity” – ferries, cargo or container vessels that have agreed to volunteer for the mission. Once a ship leaves port, the crew attach the device to the stern using steel wire, then toss it overboard.Trailing along behind the ship, it collects data for the CPR survey. The mission is vast but the subject is minuscule: plankton, the tiny organisms that drift in the ocean. Every marine ecosystem relies on plankton for its basic food source, and it generates half the oxygen we breathe. Perhaps more than any other organism, it is crucial to all life on our planet.The CPR survey is the longest-running marine science project of its kind. It began in 1931 when the scientist Sir Alister Hardy investigated how herring were influenced by plankton in the North Sea. This month the distance surveyed will reach an impressive 7m nautical miles, equivalent to 320 circumnavigations of the Earth.Since that first tow from Hull to Germany 89 years ago, the equipment has hardly changed. So far a quarter of a million samples have been analysed, representing a vast geographical spread over the course of the past century. The immense scope has allowed scientists to see dramatic patterns in ocean health, across both time and space, building a much clearer picture of how our marine environments are changing.It is also, says Gregory, “one of the oldest citizen science projects in the world”. Although it is coordinated by the Marine Biological Association in Plymouth, which houses the world’s largest biological library of microscopic plankton, the survey relies on the goodwill of the merchant ships who agree to take the recorders with them as they cross the world’s oceans.“We have a navy of volunteers,” Wilson says, “from the crane operators to the ship’s agents and terminal managers in ports, right through to the boatswains and captains on the ships that tow our equipment.”He’s known as the “Milk Tray man” in British ports, because he often takes chocolates as gifts for the sailors to thank them for their help.“Because most crews and port staff remember us, a glitch at sea or tricky courier logistics are much easier to resolve,” he says. “We also realise that while it’s mission critical for us, for these guys in ports, it’s an add-on –\u0026nbspand they’re under more pressure than ever right now.”Covid-19 has posed the biggest threat to this research in 90 years – even more so than the second world war, organisers say – because the logistics of getting the CPRs to and from ports is very difficult with current travel restrictions.\u0026nbspBut while the pandemic has scuttled much biological research, the plankton survey has been able to continue on essential shipping routes, because no special scientific knowledge is required of the crew volunteers. CPRs are designed to be robust, failsafe and very easy to use. And because this low-tech piece of kit is mechanically driven by a small propeller that spins while being towed, it’s low maintenance.Seawater flows in through a small aperture at the front for every 10 nautical miles towed, it filters three cubic metres of water. Inside, plankton are collected between two layers of silk on a “cassette” that moves constantly onto a collection spool, which sits in formaldehyde to preserve the sample.\u0026nbspTried and tested for decades, the little torpedoes can be towed for up to 500 nautical miles at a time, with each 10cm of silk representing one 10-nautical mile sample.“We’ve recorded more than 200m biological records of inidual species from the samples we’ve analysed,” says David Johns, head of the CPR survey. “This resource is freely available online to everyone, from schoolchildren all the way up to top-flight scientists, who use our data for a myriad of different reasons.”Plankton are defined as organisms that drift in the ocean, unable to swim against the current. Because they are so dependent on ocean patterns, studying them can teach us about the health of not just the seas, but of the planet itself. The longer the research continues, the greater its value for predicting future trends – and confronted with a climate crisis, that predictive power has never been more valuable.\u0026nbspDr Clare Ostle, one of the CPR research scientists, has analysed more than 800 different types of plankton, from plant-like phytoplankton – which photosynthesise to produce oxygen – to the animals known collectively as zooplankton, which include fish larvae and jellyfish.“With the spring plankton bloom kicking off right now, it’s a critical time for collecting samples,” she says. “A lot of people will be relying on this data, as their own monitoring programmes aren’t able to continue during the pandemic. So it’s a big deal for us.”\u0026nbspThe scope of the survey has evolved over time. Since 2017, tows have included shipping routes along the north-west passage, as a result of ice melt in the Arctic. Meanwhile, as research questions change and new technologies come into play, fresh data can be collected from old samples. “We’ve had people come to us wanting to look back in time, to study plastic pollution, for example,” Ostle says. The first complete plastic bag caught by the records was recorded in 1965, and studies since then show an increasing amount of plastic fishing debris getting caught up in the recording equipment.Indeed, in collaboration with the University of Plymouth’s Prof Richard Thompson, Ostle’s studies of plankton dating back to the 50s were able to confirm the significant increase in plastics in the open ocean since the 80s. As a result of this pioneering study in 2004, Thompson coined the phrase “microplastics”, for fragments smaller than 5mm (and which are now so ubiquitous that some plankton have been found to ingest them).The study also provides insight into the spread of disease. After a form of cholera was contracted by people eating contaminated fish eggs on the west coast of Canada, scientists used the plankton survey to map the spread of cholera bacteria, which they found clinging to the surface of some plankton such as fish eggs.The most crucial thing plankton can help us understand, however, is likely to be how the climate crisis is affecting our oceans. The shifting distribution of plankton is a measurable effect of rising sea temperatures. By studying samples over 30 years, Ostle has found that plankton living in colder waters have significantly smaller areas where they can thrive. Meanwhile, plankton living in warmer waters are moving towards cooler conditions in the poles.“This has major impacts on fish stocks, seabird populations and so many other marine animals that feed on plankton,” says Ostle. “Plankton also absorb CO2 emissions, so they are a massive natural carbon sink that we need to protect.“It’s so important that we maintain this unusual dataset, because there are still so many discoveries to be made, and stories that haven’t yet been told.”Wilson and Gregory, for their part, are working hard to make sure the “golden thread of volunteers in ports around the world” know they’re more appreciated than ever. During the pandemic he has been packing goody bags, including sweets and ing or football magazines, to send off to the crews as a special thanks.“Everyone involved knows the value of the health of our oceans, because this is their livelihood,” he says of the citizen-scientist sailors who’ve been crucial to the mission since 1931. “They have the sea in their heart. And they really appreciate the chocolates.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e8995da5222041d5ded975924cb3a5743086cb4/0_0_8688_5792/master/8688.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7273d9b5f52cedec7b1cdd286641c133 700w","title":"bubble suits and distance friendly hats covid 19 fashion steps up","story":"Designers are looking for more creative ways to respond to the pandemicWith facemasks quickly becoming part of everyday style, a wave of new designs are feeding into the vogue for social-distancing fashion. This week as part of the Central Saint Martins graduate show, Harry Styles-approved designer Harris Reed presented a roundabout-wide hat and crinoline skirt, while as part of last week’s digital London fashion week, Westminster student San Kim showcased Protective Garments for Coronavirus made from M\u0026ampS and Poundland bags.Other recent ideas for social distancing clothing range from bubble suits for commuters to massive European size 75 shoes. As their designer, Grigore Lup, told Reuters: “If two people wearing these shoes were facing each other, there would be almost one-and-a-half metres between them.”There are also homemade efforts. Instagram account WhatIsNewYork has been cataloguing instances of social distancing outfits in the city, from wire structures to plastic bubbles. In one cafe in Germany guests were asked to wear “pool noodle hats” in order to maintain distance. The hats mirrored those worn by some children returning to school in China.Supersized silhouettes might have found an unfortunate new relevance in the age of the pandemic but, from the giant straw Jacquemus hats that “won” 2018 to the frou-frou dresses of Molly Goddard, they have been appearing on catwalks for the last few years.As part of the springsummer collections, Balenciaga led the charge, championing dresses wide enough to register on radars Thom Browne’s skirt hoops featured alongside panniers while at Puppets and Puppets dresses came with bulbous bottom-halves. For autumnwinter brands such as Marc Jacobs and Maison Margiela, where designs riffed on beekeeper outfits, as well as Moncler’s voluminous Richard Quinn collection, all presented space-filling designs.But clothes as distancing tool, whether for disease prevention or otherwise, are not new. “Clothing has long served as a useful way to mitigate close contact and unnecessary exposure,” wrote historian Einav Rabinovistch-Fox recently.While Victorian-era crinoline skirts were, she added, “used to create a barrier between the genders in social settings”, they “probably inadvertently helped mitigate the dangers of the era’s smallpox and cholera outbreaks.”Clothing to help ward off disease is not without historical precedent. In the 17th century, for instance, doctors wore beaked masks when examining plague patients, the noses stuffed with herbs as well as viper flesh powder and honey.While XL silhouettes have been big on catwalks, is it likely that, with social distancing in mind, something similar may filter down into everyday clothes?“I do think that in the immediate future social practice around clothing will change,” says milliner Veronica Toppino, who has recently designed architectural Structure hats, as wearable art rather than ready-to-wear. “It is already changing if we think about the cloth-mask.” But while she thinks projects like hers make us “reflect on fashion as a tool to investigate new ideas”, she doesn’t expect people to be wearing them anytime soon.“It will be interesting to see,” says the fashion historian Alison Matthews David. “It’s hard to say now because everything is moving so quickly but it does become appealing in a new way, the idea that you could use, in a non-verbal, physical way, a ‘keep your distance’ approach.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/10da2fd9bdb0c46c0f6101f9f1cd9c22bdbc2c8b/302_716_2615_1569/master/2615.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=52d02256fd59dbb00325362700ae8b47","title":"ive never seen con air","story":"Bare-chested fist-fights, loud guitar riffs, a billowing American flag and Malkovich turned up to 11. This is a cheese-filled treatI was prepared to like Con Air and, happily, I was not disappointed. The overall impression of watching the 1997 action classic is a lot like riding the Rock ‘n’ Roller Coaster Starring Aerosmith at Disney World: a sandblasting assault on your senses to a thrashing rock-music soundtrack. Con Air is bombastic and overblown, but always entertaining. I enjoyed it tremendously.What I most enjoyed about Con Air is how straightforward it is. Director Simon West sensibly realises that, in the best action films, the plot is simply the connective tissue between the fight scenes, and he doesn’t overcook things. The film’s entire premise is set up before the opening credits roll, and exposition is kept light throughout.And what fight scenes they are. A jet takes off with a convertible tied to its rear! It crash-lands into the Las Vegas strip! Cage and Malkovich duke it out on top of a moving fire truck! Just when you think the film can’t throw anything else at you, someone says “Call in the attack helicopters!” and a fleet of aircraft hover into shot.The one-liners zing faster than the bullets punching the hold of the plane. “Looks like you missed your connection,” announces Malkovich, before immolating a traitorous fellow con. “Make a move and the bunny gets it,” Malkovich says, holding Casey’s stuffed toy at gunpoint. (Malkovich has all the best lines.) Modern action films are often overly serious – I’m looking at you, Tom Cruise – but Con Air is enjoyable precisely because it is ridiculous. I can’t think of another action film as campily self-aware or entertainingly silly.The film isn’t perfect: there are racial and transphobic slurs, and the female characters are basically just plot points. But the casting of Cage is an inspired touch: he brings levity to a character who might in other hands be a flat-footed demonstration of masculinity’s worst excesses. I can’t think of another action lead who’d play the role with the vulnerability on show when he breaks down in tears during Poe’s reconciliation with his wife. (I welled up.) Cage’s famously flamboyant acting style also works well in a movie that is, for want of a better word, hammy (how else can you describe a film that features John Malkovich holding a bunny rabbit at gunpoint?)At its heart, Con Air is a quixotic fantasy about the responsible expression of masculinity, in which rapists have the misogyny knocked out of them by bare-chested hunks with free-flowing hair, and law and order can be restored by the efforts of one heroic man acting alone. Poe always identifies on the side of the authorities despite the fact the system imprisoned him unjustly. (In his jail cell, an American flag hangs from the bunk bed.) When Poe is trapped on the plane with a gang of marauding criminals, he instinctively works to thwart their efforts, becoming in effect a proxy for law and order itself.I don’t agree with Con Air’s masculinist world view, but I certainly enjoyed the stunts."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09a289a688bf1347c17cfa8f937c41f1f07f2251/0_61_8620_5173/master/8620.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d6583b57f291fba196e9861561a50419","title":"ian holm a virtuoso actor of steel sinew and charm peter bradshaw appreciation","story":"Alien, Lord of the Rings, Chariots of Fire and so many more extraordinary performances in classic films – what an exemplary career the actor Ian Holm, who has died aged 88, leaves behind There was always a cool, rational, weighted intelligence in Ian Holm. On screen, he was never exactly a heart-on-sleeve performer he did not need or even appear to want the audience’s sympathies. Holm could be a mandarin and almost priestly presence, but always with a pressure cooker of emotion inside. He brought a commanding strength and a stillness to his work, a less-is-more economy that gave him what few theatrical knights have had since Olivier: equal success on stage and screen. He was a character actor with star quality.It is funny that younger cinema audiences knew and loved Ian Holm for perhaps the most atypical casting of his career: as Bilbo Baggins in Peter Jackson’s Lord of the Rings and Hobbit movies.He plays the older Bilbo, who potters and maunders about the place with great geniality and charm, like a distracted Oxford don who happens also to run MI6. There was something beguiling in seeing Holm’s habitually stern features transformed into Hobbity gentleness.His other roles were rather different. He broke out in his mid-40s, having already established an accomplished career in film, TV and theatre. Ridley Scott cast Holm in his legendary 1979 sci-fi classic Alien, about the spacecraft that gets an unwelcome, parasitic visitor. Holm played Ash, the ship’s science officer: he is a calm technocratic figure who remains notably unemotional for reasons that will become plain in the film’s great shocking reveal. In unforgettably gruesome circumstances, the crew ask Ash what he thinks about their prospects and in a frazzled and gurgling voice he says: “I can’t lie to you about your chances. But you have my sympathies.” It was a great moment for Holm.But his biggest success came a couple of years later, in the colossally successful British movie Chariots of Fire, written by Colin Welland and directed by Hugh Hudson. He played the Geordie-born professional sports trainer Sam Mussabini who, controversially, coaches the ambitious Cambridge undergraduate sportsman Harold Abrahams, played by Ben Cross. It was a heartwarming performance by Holm, and it earned him an Academy award nomination as best supporting actor.Mussabini is fussy, tetchy, but fierce about his work – with a vocational teacher’s insistence on high standards and a tendency to take pupils’ failings personally. Mussabini wears his straw boater at all times indoors, even when he’s massaging Abrahams. And when Abrahams wins, he punches a hole in that hat for sheer joy. Holm allows us to see how emotionally vulnerable Sam has become, and that Abrahams is like a son to him.In the 1980s, Holm developed a steely, sinewy presence in the cinema: he brought a definite stringency or severity. Holm was the hard-drinking solicitor Stanley Pilborough in David Hare’s haunting drama Wetherby (1985) and the same year he was in Terry Gilliam’s surreal fantasia Brazil, in which he played Mr Kurtzmann, the boss of Sam (played by Jonathan Pryce), the film’s hapless hero. In that, Kurtzmann was a stressed bureaucrat in a tight suit and with an odd little moustache. He looked like Peter Sellers’ shop steward Fred Kite in the Boulting brothers’ I’m All Right Jack.It was his third film in 1985 that gave us one of Holm’s best performances: the superb crime drama Dance With a Stranger, written by Shelagh Delaney and directed by Mike Newell. It featured Miranda Richardson as Ruth Ellis, the brassy blond nightclub hostess and the last woman in Britain to be hanged for murder Rupert Everett played her sulky, haughty boyfriend, David Blakeley. Holm has the thankless but fascinating role as Desmond Cussen, Ruth’s poor lapdog gentleman caller – humiliated and emasculated – who remains slavishly in love with Ruth, despite her obsession with the younger and more glamorous Blakeley.It is Cussen who cares about the children Ruth has from a previous marriage, and he can see Ruth’s self-destructive vanities all too clearly. He hates himself and hates her for how he feels – and very much hates arrogant smoothie David.There is unforgettable ferocity in his rage when Everett’s David upsets Ruth’s young son, Andy, by inventing horrible things that are going to happen to him at boarding school. “He’s teasing you, Andy!” Desmond snaps, a whiplash of emotion. Interestingly, it is Holm’s Desmond who looks like the one capable of murder.Holm went on to have great roles in David Cronenberg’s eXistenZ and Naked Lunch, in Luc Besson’s The Fifth Element, in Kenneth Branagh’s Frankenstein and also Martha Fiennes’s Chromophobia, in which he had a startling, black-comic sex scene with Penélope Cruz.For me, his greatest and most complex role was in Atom Egoyan’s 1997 film The Sweet Hereafter, playing Mitchell Stephens, the lawyer who mysteriously shows up in a small Canadian town where locals are grieving the deaths of dozens of children in a school-bus crash. Stephens tries to persuade everyone to work up the righteous rage necessary to sue the bus manufacturers.He is cool and lawyerly, even passionless in rimless glasses: a rare instance, in any movie, of being a figure who is disturbing yet not obviously evil. His lawyer is partly an angel of vengeance, partly a bizarre destructive parasite who appears in the community stirring up unimaginable pain, reopening psychological wounds that had begun to heal, encouraging the bereaved parents to feel angry and then to channel that anger into a class-action lawsuit – and he will take a third of whatever payout results. However, it appears that his entire vocation is displacement activity, a need to right the wrongs in his personal life.This was Ian Holm’s finest hour. But I have the softest spot for his lovely performance in Chariots of Fire, as the kindly yet strict teacher who lives to see his pupil become a world beater – and becomes a world beater himself."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a1aa699d907ae130a5bffb59745a75200f6e3ab/186_228_4482_2687/master/4482.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=798ecb58dcc35be4aec8c2a9df56966b","title":"carlo ancelotti everton merseyside derby coronavirus lockdown","story":"The Everton manager on the killing of George Floyd, racial inequality, and returning to football in the Mersey derby “Look,” says Carlo Ancelotti, leaning towards the screen, a glint in his eye and a grin beginning to creep across his face. “I used to have a coach that said: ‘Coaching would be the best job in the world ... if there weren’t any games.’” And with that Everton’s manager sits back again and starts laughing. Lockdown was good, then? “Well, my stress has gone down, definitely,” he says, smiling – the kind of person who never appeared particularly prone to pressure anyway, just a raise of an eyebrow while all around him others lose their heads.“Better than coaching? Noooo,” Ancelotti shoots back. He is laughing, but he’s not joking. “You coach because what you want is to play. I’d like to play the game, not prepare it, but I’m 61 and if you can’t play coaching keeps that passion alive. I’m missing football. The fact that I couldn’t go to training every day was a nightmare for me. But I have done other things.”Another documentary he has watched is James Baldwin’s I Am Not Your Negro. He has followed events in the US, where he has family, after the killing of George Floyd. He says there are lessons to be learned and that changes have to be made. “Right now there is a very big, very serious problem in America. And the police are part of that problem, that’s the thing. If I have a problem with anything, the first thing I do is go to the police: the police have to be a protector, and that hasn’t happened. The police have made the problem even greater and it can only be resolved if we all realise this is very serious. It’s not just one policeman who has lost his head, it’s much bigger. It’s more systematic, it’s not the first time and it has to end. In 1862 Abraham Lincoln declared everyone the same: blacks, whites, there is no slavery – 1862. Over 150 years ago and we’re in this situation, that can’t be possible.”Premier League shirts will, of course, have Black Lives Matter printed on them again this weekend. “Football has an important role to play in educating people,” Ancelotti says. “Millions follow footballers, watch what they do, hear what they say.”Nor is sport immune to the impact. Ancelotti mentions Claude Makélélé, his assistant at PSG, and his former player Clarence Seedorf, but says the comparative lack of black managers is an issue to be “confronted”, while he has tackled abuse directly. Ancelotti was the Napoli manager when the defender Kalidou Koulibaly was sent off against Internazionale in December 2018, the second yellow card handed out for sarcastically applauding the referee, who had not intervened despite the Senegalese centre-back receiving racist abuse.Ancelotti asked for the game to be stopped and spoke out publicly afterwards, forcing the issue in press conferences and insisting that he would lead his team off if it happened again. When it happened the first time, he recalls, the focus was on defending his player.What did you say to him? “That we were on his side, we were with him: we would fight with him, that it wasn’t right that he should have those problems and that we would try to change things,” Ancelotti says. “Kalidou has a strong character and he was angry. Sad, too. It wasn’t new for him, which made him even sadder. He felt anger and sadness. It’s 2020, that can’t happen.“We asked for the game to be stopped, three times. We spoke to the referee’s assistant but they didn’t listen. At the time, the rules were not so clear, the protocol. But then the press pushed it and the rules on suspending games changed. It didn’t happen again Koulibaly didn’t get that abuse again.“If you challenge people, push them, make them think, things can change.”If you listen, too. In an era of footballing ideologues, managers almost as cult leaders dedicated to an idea – although Ancelotti is swift to outline the nuances and flexibility in Pep Guardiola and Jürgen Klopp – he is a little different. He says that while his staff have been in constant contact with the squad, personally he has tried to give his players space during lockdown, not wanting to overburden them in a period that is difficult enough as it is. Nor is he a manager to drive home messages incessantly. “I prefer to listen than to talk sometimes,” he says, a single, simple phrase that seems to encapsulate much about him.“A coach has to be close to players, understand them. You have an idea of the game, but they’re the ones playing. If the relationship is good, they will understand clearly if it’s not good, that becomes harder. You have to be able to communicate, be open, flexible not rigid. If you’re too rigid, the player won’t be convinced.”It helps when the players you are listening to are his. The list is quite something: Ronaldo, Kaká, Gullit, Van Basten, Zidane ... It’s not long before he interrupts and suggests sticking to goalkeepers only but even that doesn’t help much. He is 10 names in – Pickford, Casillas, Cech, and Van der Sar included – when he says he’s worried he will forget someone. OK then, is there anyone you haven’t worked with that you would have liked to?“Yes, of course.” There’s a pause for thought. “Messi.” Another pause, a grin, and he adds: “If only to compare him with Ronaldo. In Italy, Totti. I started at Roma and have a lot of affection for them and he was an idol there. I would have liked that.”All of which might make the leap to Goodison Park look an unlikely one. An Evertonian friend, he is told, is terrified you will leave that your aspirations should be loftier than this. Ancelotti was dubbed the club’s Hollywood manager. Which raises a question. Well, two questions.The first is dispatched quickly – “I’d like to be Robert De Niro” – the second takes a bit longer. What brings you of all people here of all places? “The attraction of working in the Premier League again and the club’s plans. We’re getting closer to being able to compete with the best and the project is very interesting. We’ve got a young team and the spinal cord is good, from the national team. Holgate, Mina, Michael Keane. Very reliable players. There’s André Gomes, Lucas Digne. And two very, very strong forwards.It is easy to imagine Ancelotti telephoning incredulous supporters out the blue. Hello Ethan, it’s Carlo. Ancelotti laughs. “Yeah, sometimes they didn’t believe me, but you have a chat and it’s fine. Sometimes people say they can’t believe I’m coaching this club, but I feel really good here. It’s a family club and I’m always happier when you feel that closeness and support. The staff here are genuine Evertonians there’s a strong sense of belonging.”Players such as Leighton Baines, in the process of extending his stay, and Séamus Coleman take on a particular significance, he says. “We wanted Leighton Baines to sign a new contract. First, because he’s an important player who can help us. Second, because they’re an example for everyone.” Future coaches, too? After all, if anyone can spot one, it’s Ancelotti. “Leighton Baines could be, Coleman could. I think Sigurdsson could be. Delph could be a good coach. They’re people who see football.”“And Duncan is an extraordinary person with a deep love for the club. His experience helps his relationship with the players, he has knowledge and understanding of the game, and he is very charismatic. He’s very direct, very clear, and I’m really happy with him.First, though, the restart – and Sunday’s derby. “Ah, yeah,” Ancelotti jokes, almost as if he’s happily forgotten the fixture to which Everton come back. “That’s one thing the pandemic has damaged for sure. Everyone wants the fans there: we need the noise of the ground, it changes things emotionally. But I think the game itself will be the same. A derby is a derby.”What will it be like? “I don’t know.” There’s a long pause, then an even longer one. He puffs his cheeks out, rolls his eyes, mentally scanning 1,583 matches. “Honestly, I don’t remember if I have played or managed behind closed doors,” he says eventually. “I don’t know, I don’t think so.”It has taken a while, but at last there it is: one thing Carlo Ancelotti hasn’t experienced in football. At least not until Sunday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a272b833c6a636d707fc25a71007ed9cb026961/0_109_2698_1619/master/2698.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3a503354f67e6d7ee546dd91d63bef3e","title":"norwich city southampton premier league match report","story":"For Norwich the restart is over before it truly began. Turned over by a Southampton side that did not have to play well to win convincingly, the Canaries remain bottom of the table and while the six-point gap to safety may not yet have grown, any belief among Daniel Farke’s side that they might yet escape relegation must surely have taken a fateful blow.Southampton won the game with second-half goals from Danny Ings, Stuart Armstrong and Nathan Redmond. They are now 10 points clear of the drop zone. Surely all but safe, Ralph Hasenhüttl’s men gave a performance – especially in the second period – that did the players and the manager real credit. Not only stronger and technically better, they were cool and decisive too. This last quality comes with a proviso: due to the empty surroundings it was impossible for anyone not to hear Hasenhüttl’s numerous instructions to his players, specific down to the very direction of each pass and its timing.“In the end the result was absolutely deserved‚” Hasenhüttl said. “We didn’t have a good start but it was getting better and better the longer the game went on. We had a few good chances in the first half but that last pass was not perfect. In the second half Ingsy made the opener and after that we deserved it, we never lost our aggression or our passion to get the ball.”“I trust my players and I was fully convinced we could win this game,” said Farke. “Just because of the points we have to win five games, when you lose the first game it’s getting even a bit more difficult. But we wouldn’t dance on the table after a win and we won’t give up after a loss.”Norwich began the match with an unfamiliar 4-4-2 formation, with Teemu Pukki in the unusual position of playing with a partner, Josip Drmic. They were on the front foot and in the opening two minutes forced a succession of free-kicks and corners, each taken by Emi Buendía with half-chances squandered by ponderous finishing, Drmic particularly culpable.That initial spell lasted for 15 minutes before Southampton began to exert themselves in midfield, the new club captain, James Ward-Prowse, forming an effective partnership with Pierre-Emile Højbjerg, the man he replaced. They closed down the supply to Norwich’s forward four. “We were physically stronger in the centre than the opponent and that was the key element of the day,” said Hasenhüttl.Norwich stalled, perhaps sensing that their opportunity had passed. Not for the first time this season, the mistakes then began to creep into their game. The first big chance came from a turnover Todd Cantwell eased off the ball by Jack Stephens on halfway before the seas parted. The centre-half ran with the ball all the way into the penalty area before cueing up Ings, whose shot was well-judged but crashed back off the crossbar.Hasenhüttl claimed he did not have much to say at half-time. Surely the message was clear to his players that this game was there for the taking, however, and it was not long before his team pressed decisively on their hosts’ vulnerability. A ball into the Norwich box was not dealt with decisively, Armstrong poked possession to Ings on the edge of the box and the striker sized up his opportunity and finished with characteristic decisiveness, curling a shot beyond Tim Krul. Afterwards Ings, who looked as if he had never been in lockdown, said the game had been “good fun”.Norwich heads slumped and Southampton’s grew in composure. “It’s not so nice when you win and you have only 10 or 15 people to celebrate with‚” Hasenhüttl said of playing behind closed doors. “For coaching it’s a little bit easier though because you have more chances to coach them and they hear you.”Southampton doubled their advantage in the 54th minute. Again it came from a turnover in the middle of the park, and again the visitors were able to advance straight down the pitch without interruption. This time it was Ings who was the enabler and he passed the ball to Armstrong on the edge of the box. After dancing past an ineffectual challenge he slotted a left-foot effort past Krul.Pukki then had his team’s two best chances but dithered and wasted both. With 11 minutes to go Southampton put the matter beyond doubt and again it was too easy, Ings releasing Michael Obafemi wide on the right. The Irish teenager teed up Nathan Redmond in the centre and he sent Max Aarons the wrong way with a feint before shooting calmly past Krul."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57591679e95c70d5cab32cdb05a84ca9578d08a5/0_273_4755_2853/master/4755.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=104a44d4a6b960b1236afeb87597e02e","title":"tottenham hotspur manchester united premier league match report","story":"The reaction of Eric Dier, the Tottenham defender, said it all. He had just conceded one penalty, which allowed Bruno Fernandes to equalise for Manchester United, and now it appeared that he had conceded another at the very end.Dier knew that he had not touched Fernandes before the United man went to ground but the referee, Jon Moss, had bought it and pointed to the spot. Dier was flabbergasted. Enter VAR. When the first replay was shown, it was plain that Fernandes had, at best, initiated the contact and, at worst, ed. Dier was reprieved. No penalty. Spurs breathed in collective relief.Dier had been angry enough about the first one, except this time he had put his hands on Paul Pogba, having been bamboozled by a piece of skill from the Frenchman. Pogba, on as a 62nd-minute substitute, danced past Dier on the byline before feeling the contact and hitting the ground.When Fernandes converted, it was no more than United deserved for their front-foot football and it added up to a reprieve for David de Gea, their goalkeeper. He looked to have Steven Bergwijn’s first-half shot within his sights, however well struck it was, and then he did not.When it reared up off De Gea’s hands and into the net, Tottenham had something to defend, something to reignite their season, and Roy Keane, the former United captain, had something to get angry about in the Sky Sports studio. Very angry. The defending from Harry Maguire in the build-up had been loose in the extreme but De Gea was in the line of fire.It was an absorbing game that built to its climax with United turning the screw after Pogba was introduced with Mason Greenwood. And it was the latter who almost stole all three points with virtually the last kick of the game only to see his low shot fly past the far post. Spurs were on their knees. They narrowly dodged the knock-out that would have blown a hole in their hopes of a Champions League finish.It was a slow-burning start, with the first chance falling to United on 22 minutes. And it was a chance out of pretty much nothing, created by an aberration from Davinson Sánchez. He sent an attempted clearing header straight at Marcus Rashford, who guided an instinctive half-volley goalwards. Hugo Lloris saved with his feet.José Mourinho had started Érik Lamela ahead of Tanguy Ndombele – a setback for Spurs’s record signing – but the Argentinian justified the decision, roaming with menace from the No 10 role. Lamela helped to make Spurs dangerous on the quick counter, although the opening goal was all about Bergwijn’s determination.The January signing collected possession inside the United half after Serge Aurier had beaten Rashford and put his head down, picking up pace and momentum. He ran inside Maguire while the chasing Fred would be blocked off by Lamela. Then came the moment that De Gea will want to forget.The United goalkeeper made partial amends on 31 minutes when he tipped over a Son Heung-min header after Bergwijn had raided up the right and United were reprieved moments later when Sánchez flicked high after a miscued Dier shot broke for him. Rashford was central to United’s only other flicker before the interval, although the last touch from a Fred free-kick came not off him but Sanchez. Lloris made a scrambling save. The contrast in the fortunes of the clubs before shutdown could scarcely have been greater – Spurs winless in six, crashing out of cup competitions United unbeaten in 11, “moving in the right direction” to quote Ole Gunnar Solskjær.This was a clean slate, albeit a weird one, perhaps the slickest stadium in England beautifully dressed but lacking soul, failing to communicate the urgency of the occasion.When everything is stripped away, when the volume is turned down and the only sounds come from the players’ shouts, it is plainly surreal. The positive reading is that it focuses minds on the technical spectacle, on how players at this level have extraordinarily good touches in tight spaces. The lack of time they have to make their decisions is remarkable. Then, there are the shuddering physical challenges. You can really hear them now.United tried to make the game, hogging possession and Spurs were content to invite them on. Although Harry Kane was rusty up front, there was plenty from Bergwijn, Lamela and Son behind him.Fernandes fizzed wide from distance early in the second half but United were struggling for penetration until Solskjær made his substitutions and, almost immediately, his team advertised the equaliser.First, Anthony Martial was denied by a saving Dier challenge following Fernandes’s pass and, moments later, by a wonderful Lloris save. When Martial unloaded with his left foot after Luke Shaw’s pull-back, it looked like a certain goal. Flying through the air, Lloris had other ideas. The drama, however, was only just beginning."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a2e0faf67f20dba3949fc27387106fb3199cf02/0_0_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=32efafbf2a14be03fcc80cca205e71ce","title":"share your reviews of the last of us part ii","story":"The sequel to Naughty Dog’s hit video game is finally here, but what did you make of it?

But for an ever-increasing number of people, that naysayer is being drowned out by someone else. He’s called Beefy.Beefy – or Cory Wharton-Malcolm, as he’s also known – is a real live running coach who lives in Sydenham, south-east London, but he’s also a disembodied voice, travelling with millions of people at once, telling more times than the talking clock. This version of Beefy lives in your phone, and as you plod your way up that hill and think fondly of the sofa, he says things like “thank you” and “run easy” and, for some reason, you keep going.Wharton-Malcolm, 41, is one of a myriad of pre-recorded coaches who have become a staple of lockdown exercise for adherents all over the planet. Fitness apps were huge business before solitary exercise became our only hope of leaving the house – but now they are bigger still, one of the winners of the pandemic, and the super-enthusiastic voice in your ear is the breakout star of the genre.The thinking behind the apps is simple enough. You pick a distance or a time, from a few minutes to a marathon. When you hit certain waypoints, the music fades, and up pops Beefy, or one of his colleagues or competitors, to tell you how wonderful you are.“It’s amazing how many people have found the app, and then found my voice and connected with it,” said the real Wharton-Malcolm, on the phone shortly after his digital analogue in the Nike Run Club app ignored my complaints and drove me through some particularly brutal interval runs.He estimates he’s getting about three times as many messages from listeners each day as he did before the pandemic struck. This week he signed up with a talent management agency, and there has been talk of a book.“People say they didn’t touch running with a bargepole prior to the pandemic, but because they’ve been locked inside, they’re up for it,” he said. “They say since finding your voice and a little bit of calm, they’ve started to enjoy it. I think people are in search of human connection.”The Nike app has risen from 41st most popular to fourth in the UK. There are also substantial rises for rivals such as Fitbit Coach and Peloton.“We saw a lot of fitness apps spike early on,” said Lexi Sydow, enior insights manager at App Annie. “It’s one of the standout categories – people maybe being optimistic about their quarantine period. And these apps that do have a coaching element, they are ranking highly.” Unsurprisingly, the combination of relentless compliments, self-improvement, and a real-world version of the AI played by Scarlett Johannson in the film Her leads to some disproportionate levels of enthusiasm. “@Bitbeefy you are a frikkin legend!” Laura wrote on Instagram. “Such a great run – thanks for “being” with me!” Shelly Mittal told his colleague, Nike’s guru-like global head coach, Chris Bennett. And @Eleniid summarised what a lot of people seem to feel: “I VERY MUCH NEED COACH CORY TO TELL ME JOB WELL DONE IN HIS HOT ACCENT FOR ME TO CONTINUE RUNNING!!!”Wharton-Malcolm, who describes himself as a “recovering fat kid”, is amused, but bashful. “I definitely have received some expressions of love,” he said. “I am definitely flattered by it. But I have a missus.”So familiar have his honeyed tones become to devotees that he gets recognised – and, presumably, fancied – on the basis of his voice alone. “I was stopped in Victoria station and this person was like … I know that voice!” he said. “And in Amsterdam, I was coaching a group of runners, and I said, ‘Come on, let’s go’, the kind of thing I say in the app – and someone said, ‘Wait, it’s coach Cory!’ That was weird.”Since the death of George Floyd, Wharton-Malcolm has used his substantial social media following to promote Black Lives Matter, posting videos such as a guided run through his neighbourhood talking about local businesses run by black people. More broadly, he sees a profound social benefit to exercise and coaching in an era of isolation.“Some people are just doing it for performance, yes,” he said. “But there’s a search for camaraderie, for partnership. We’re part of a community. And we all want someone to talk to.” Or listen to, at least."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae728e1e07a423392c26c997908fcc80015d442f/0_187_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e6cdbc94ff0934a51675884552ba4de5","title":"the new monuments we need your nans old dress or a stormzy lyric carved in stone","story":"Instead of stern, elevated statues, here are some ways I’d like to rememberOur secular cities are littered with false idols, all these solemn mythologies.

Stormzy’s Shut Up carved in stone. Stamps that speak. A British Museum of Post-its, Pens and Pauses. A healthy distrust of white walls, reverent silence and simple heroes. A glinting maze of coins hosting different faces: Amy’s beehive, Attenborough, Shaznay from All Saints.Make statues that stand at our height and meet our gaze.

Provided you have a few ageing bananas hanging around, it’s easy to throw together with other ingredients you’re likely to have. What’s more, it’s perfectly acceptable to eat at any time of day and, thanks to those ageing bananas, it stays moist and toothsome for days longer than most other cakes.In spite of its timelessness, however, banana bread has had a serious moment during lockdown. Not only is everyone baking, but, if my fruit bowl is anything to go by, everyone has found themselves in possession of many more bananas than they can get through with their morning cereal. Little wonder banana bread makes so much sense.But, like Ariel the mermaid gazing up towards the ocean’s surface and dreaming of land, I want more. There’s only so much BB the self-isolated cake gannet can eat before wondering how else to use up bananas on the turn. Here’s some inspiration for you.’s Waste Not columnist, Tom Hunt, writes – horrifyingly – of how we throw away 1.4m bananas per day in the UK – “If we could acquire a taste for brown bananas, things would be different,” he says. One idea is his banana katsu curry, the over-ripe fruit bringing sweetness to the sauce alongside sharp green apple, spices, soy sauce and ketchup. An over-ripe banana is a parent’s best friend, its concentrated natural sugars sweetening everything from breakfast to pudding. It’s time to learn from the babies, folks. This recipe from Jamie Oliver is a good template – feel free to add other fruit, seeds, grains, nut butters and milks as you see fit, safe in the knowledge that ripe bananas and rolled oats have deliciousness covered for a very good start to the day. Kick off the weekend with these pancakes which, thanks to the walnut flour and oats, happen to be gluten-free. Although, says their inventor, Sarah Britton, of food blog My New Roots, the banana and walnut combo makes the texture of these a bit more like that of an under-baked cookie than the pillowy lightness of a more traditional breakfast pancake. While we’re at the breakfast table, why not try a banana jam? This very simple recipe is just 15 minutes in the making – much quicker than your average fruit jam – and flavoured with vanilla, lime and dark rum. With flavours like that, you could almost be on a Caribbean island. And we could all do with a bit of that right now. Over-ripe bananas are a gift to plant-based bakers, the fruit’s sticky, creamy texture when mashed is perfect when standing in for eggs (to bind) and butter (to enrich) – and let’s not forget that aforementioned sweetness. With that in mind, these flapjacks are vegan: decadently gooey, chocolate-flecked, flaxseed-studded, oat-filled bars of healthy-ish goodness. A joy all too easily forgotten. Now that grill season is upon us, why not stuff your ripe bananas with chocolate and cook them – still in their skins, wrapped in foil – on the barbecue? A British answer, perhaps, to the all-American s’more. Or, take them to the next level with Tamal Ray’s baked banana meringue recipe. This ultra-easy recipe from Claire Ptak – enhanced with honey, sea salt and good olive oil – brings good news for ice-cream lovers without an ice-cream machine. Hallelujah.Nigel Slater recommends this ginger and chilli-laced, sweet and sour condiment (the sour from rice vinegar, the sweet from the eponymous ’nanas) alongside sea bass fillets. But, like any ketchup, it would work in numerous contexts calling for a piquant sauce. Anybody moved by the marriage of chocolate and banana will find the image of this Liam Charles number quite devastating. Caramelised ripe bananas, chocolate mousse, a crunchy orange biscuit ... A rollercoaster of emotions, overwhelmingly positive. Meera Sodha’s healthier take on deep-fried Mangalorean banana puris are a treat for any time of day.

The party said Theodora Dickinson was being investigated on Friday after targeting Labour shadow minister Naz Shah.Dickinson responded to a post showing the Bradford West MP discussing her experience of poverty, saying that if “Naz Shah hates this country so much why doesn’t she go back to Pakistan?!”The Muslim Council of Britain, which has long criticised the Tories’ handling of Islamophobia, described the tweet as “blatant racism”.Shah said: “Over the last few weeks BAME (black, Asian and minority ethnic) communities have been coming to terms with the racism they have faced over the years. In 2020 to be told to go back to Pakistan highlights the level of racism that still exists in some quarters of society.”Dickinson, who describes herself as a political communications and social media consultant, later apologised. “I fully recognise how offensive it was, which is why I deleted the tweet almost immediately, though of course this does not excuse posting it in the first place,” she added.“I have written to Ms Shah offering an unreserved apology.”The Tories, who have launched an independent inquiry into all forms of prejudice within the party, said Dickinson had been suspended. “Theodora Dickinson has been suspended pending the outcome of an investigation,” a party spokeswoman said.

I think that in the era we’re going into, those kinds of policies will be more relevant than ever.”But Gareth Snell, who lost his Stoke-on-Trent Central seat to the Conservatives by 670 votes, said the report’s findings matched a lot of what he experienced in facing disaffected former Labour voters on the campaign trail.“I was getting more or less 50-50 Corbyn and Brexit,” he said. “But I think Corbyn was shorthand for a lot of other things people were unhappy about.”To an extent the long-term decline of Labour support in seats such as his had been masked by the 2017 election, where a Corbyn-led Labour denied Theresa May a majority in parliament, Snell argued.“We were saying, ‘OK, we got the biggest increase in vote share since Attlee, but actually in places like Stoke we’ve still gone back.’ And if you look at the sorts of seats we lost in 2019, the majorities had been getting smaller. There was this idea that everybody was being lifted by the Corbyn tide of 2017, and that simply wasn’t the case.”Another Corbyn-sceptic, Neil Coyle, who remains the MP for Southwark and Old Bermondsey, was notably more blunt, tweeting: “Why Labour lost in 2019 will surprise no one who campaigned and spoke to enough voters: Corbyn’s toxicity at the top. Incompetence running Labour stupidly backing an early election and cronies squandering Labour resources also all helped Johnson.”Officials who worked on the Labour campaign said they recognised the report’s description of a party machine riven by factionalism, infighting and a lack of strategy, but said the study offered little in the way of solutions.“When I read the report found it quite triggering, to be honest – it brought a lot of fairly traumatic things back,” one person who worked on the 2019 campaign said.“It’s fair to say that everyone’s particular gripe is in there. It more or less says, ‘Everything was shit.’ But the one thing is doesn’t go into is why. There’s an argument that if you got too deeply into that you could start a new civil war. But it means the report is still only half the answer.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3949e8e996ddaeb45c5b31405b78a8747ae7b4f/0_153_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7d4faf7f0a8fbdc252b06bae7ba8c228","title":"uk rail bosses rejected call to dress staff like face mask volunteers","story":"Request came after Grant Shapps’ ‘army of journey makers’ in purple tabards failed to materialiseUK transport ministers asked train companies to dress staff in the purple tabards meant for “journey makers”, after the promised “army” of volunteers to remind travellers to wear a face covering failed to materialise this week.The last-minute request to keep up appearances, relayed to train operators by the Rail Delivery Group, was largely rejected by bosses, it has emerged.However, it is understood that some Network Rail staff were sent to locate the magenta Olympic Games Makers vests from London 2012, to coincide with the introduction of mandatory face coverings this week and busier rail services as some lockdown measures were eased.Invoking the spirit of the 2012 London Olympics, Shapps had announced in May that thousands of volunteers would be out to provide “reassurance and advice” to commuters and remind them to wear masks, which became mandatory on public transport on Monday. He said: “It will go a long way towards helping transport and passengers cope.”Later, he said the government would have “actually a whole army of volunteers … They’ll be wearing purple tabards and they will remind you to put your face covering on.”However, the initiative came as something of a surprise to the rail industry, which regarded the presence of untrained volunteers on stations during a pandemic as an unnecessary complication, and a potential safety risk.After the RMT union said it would ballot for a strike over the scheme, which it said was launched without consultation and would undercut safety-critical rail jobs, the charity tasked with staffing Shapps’s purple army, Volunteering Matters, decided to hold back until the row was resolved.Paul Reddish, the chief executive of Volunteering Matters, said there were still discussions ongoing with the Department for Transport, but there had been issues about where the 3,000 volunteers they were recruiting could be deployed around stations. He said: “They cannot substitute for paid roles, and we are not going where there are no rail staff. We’re ready to go, if indeed it gets to that stage, and the volunteers can have a good experience. But we’re not at that stage yet.”Shapps had first said that volunteers could appear as early as 1 June, but ministers had particularly targeted 15 June, when a big rise in passenger numbers was expected when lockdown restrictions were eased, and wearing face masks on public transport became mandatory.The DfT said it was aware of union concerns, and work was ongoing with Volunteering Matters and other organisations to establish where volunteers could add the most value to passenger journeys.The RMT general secretary, Mick Cash, said: “It is very clear that this is another government policy that was made up on the hoof to grab headlines, rather than actually sitting down and working through the consequences. Our position remains that we will take whatever action is required to prevent volunteers from being brought in as free labour on the railway.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/87ee498d7b3d0f65a575837e022603deff756ffa/0_666_2201_1320/master/2201.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=b45da02f5164dbff3ce46aa25708887a","title":"bt and vodafone told to stock up on huawei kit after us sanctions","story":"Security officials fear UK telcos could run out of vital parts if US pressure disrupts suppliesBritish security officials have told telecoms operators to ensure they have adequate stockpiles of Huawei equipment owing to fears that US sanctions will disrupt the Chinese firm’s ability to maintain critical supplies, according to a letter seen by Reuters.Senior officials at the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), who are studying the impact of new US measures intended to restrict Huawei’s ability to source advanced microchips, wrote to BT and Vodafone last week, said three people familiar with the matter.The NCSC told the companies they needed to maintain adequate supplies of spare parts from all manufacturers, but emphasised the increased risk to Huawei’s equipment and its future ability to provide software updates for those products in the face of US pressure.“Ensuring that products and components are kept up to date is essential to maintaining the security of networks,” the letter said. “Escalating US action against Huawei may affect its ability to provide updates for products containing US technology.”An NCSC spokeswoman said: “The NCSC has provided operators with a series of precautionary steps we recommend they take while we carefully consider the impact these sanctions have on the UK’s networks.“BT and Vodafone declined to comment. A Huawei spokesman said the company was cooperating fully with the NCSC and declined immediate further comment.Officials now said they are reviewing the specific guidance on how Huawei equipment should be deployed in order to best secure UK networks and are considering a range of options.

It’s also known as freedom, black independence and emancipation day.In Minneapolis, Minnesota, celebrations were combined with a homage to Floyd in an early morning five-mile route for runners, walkers and cyclists which ended at the site where he was killed. A reparations rally was planned for the afternoon at the Minnesota state capitol with organizers demanding the murder of Floyd be recognised as both a racist and economic issue.In Atlanta, protesters gathered in front of the Georgia Bar Association and marched to demand justice for Ahmaud Arbery – the 25-year-old unarmed black man shot dead while out for a run by a white father and son, while a third white man helped corner him and videoed the killing. Also in Atlanta, college and university students led a march which ended with a voter registration drive and concert.Al Sharpton, a veteran civil rights activist and baptist preacher who spoke at Floyd’s funeral service, delivered a speech at a Juneteenth celebration in Tulsa, Oklahoma, where in 1921 a racist white mob destroyed the “Black Wall Street” community. Donald Trump had initially planned a campaign rally in Tulsa for 19 June but later rescheduled to Saturday after learning about the significance of the holiday.“Juneteenth is both a celebration and a reminder, a commemoration,” he told a gathered crowd. “It reminds us that it took almost three years after the signing of the emancipation proclamation for people in Texas to even know that slavery was over.”“So it is only proper for me to be here to show everyone how far we have come and how far we have yet to go,” he went on. “We must understand the litany of pain that Black Americans have suffered.”Juneteenth, which combines the words “June” and “19th”, is the symbolic day in 1865 when the Union army major general Gordon Granger read out Abraham Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation abolishing slavery on a plantation in Galveston, Texas.The proclamation had been signed by the president more than two years earlier, but had little effect on many enslaved African Americans held in confederate territory. Slavery was outlawed nationwide a few months later when the 13th amendment was ratified.Dozens of events took place across New York City’s five boroughs as the mayor, Bill de Blasio, who has been widely criticized for the violent crackdown by police on protesters in recent weeks, announced that from next year Juneteenth would be an official city and school holiday.In Harlem’s Marcus Garvey Park, hundreds of people donning face masks celebrated American black identity and culture with African music, food and art. On the West Harlem Pier, a male led gathering called ‘‘protect our queens” demanded justice for Breonna Taylor and other women of color killed by police. Taylor, a 26-year-old black woman, was shot dead in March by police who entered her home in Louisville, Kentucky without warning.Increased awareness of the holiday comes amid growing calls for profound change to tackle systemic racism in American society which impacts every sphere of life for black and brown people including education, housing, voting rights, health, policing, environmental justice, incarceration and economic inequity.A number of companies including Twitter and Target gave employees the day off amid a mounting focus on the role played by the private sector in maintaining economic racial injustice. But the holiday is still not universally known about and is not taught in many schools.On Friday, senate Democrats including former presidential candidates Kamala Harris and Cory Booker, introduced legislation to make Juneteenth a national holiday. It’s expected to face opposition from Republicans who control the senate.Elsewhere in the country, civil rights leaders joined events and spoke out against injustices. Activist and scholar Angela Davis appeared at a march that drew thousands in Oakland, California, shutting down the city’s industrial port.“If I had not chosen to become a university professor my next choice would have been to be a dock worker,” Davis said. “In order to be part of the most radical union in the country.”“Thank you for shutting down the ports today, on Juneteenth. You represent the potential and power of the labor movement,” she added. Film-maker Boots Riley also addressed the crowd.Oakland’s local longshoremen’s union had arranged a strike at 29 ports up and down the west coast. The union workers were joined by a motorcycle brigade, a car caravan, a fleet of cyclists, and thousands on foot.Rather than processing cargo, “including the shirt you’re wearing, the phone you’re carrying”, said Sweets Ward, a longshoreman with the ILWU Local 10, workers joined a massive march from the Port of Oakland to Oscar Grant Plaza in downtown, named after the 22-year-old Black man who was killed by police in 2009.The union had organized similar demonstrations after Grant was killed, more than a decade ago – and many since. “This moment feels a little different,” said Trent Willis, president of the ILWU Local 10. “The response for this call is just astronomical ... We have done similar things before, but this is like our last call to action – on steroids.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7818103781c2e32d74232af18fe26ab054fe5ba4/0_469_4210_2527/master/4210.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a6603b674045036cdf2421d3130fa564","title":"juneteenth celebrations us pictures photos","story":"Tens of thousands of people in the US marked the Juneteenth holiday on Friday, which commemorates the end of slavery.

But just a week after New Zealanders celebrated having rid the country of Covid-19 and the government lifted all restrictions on daily life except controls on entering the country, the one vulnerability in its defences – its borders – was dramatically laid bare.The failure to test returning travellers before they left quarantine, and reports of slipshod standards at the hotels where they are placed in government-managed isolation, threatened political fallout for Jacinda Ardern’s government, which was heralded worldwide for having flattened the Covid-19 infection curve with a swift, early lockdown of the country.“It’s incredibly unfortunate because that is what has been the cause of the government’s increase in their poll ratings, their competency confidence,” said Bryce Edwards, a political scholar at Victoria University in Wellington. “The public clearly thought that this government deserved support due to that competency and this is a major blow to that narrative.”The trouble started when health officials were forced to admit that two women who had arrived from the UK on 6 June had been allowed out of managed quarantine early on 13 June with a compassionate dispensation to visit a dying parent. They were not tested for the virus, but were were later found to be infected.With health officials’ permission, the pair drove 400 miles (650km) down the length of North Island to visit their family. Without the officials’ knowledge they had also met up with friends on the way.Suddenly, after 24 days of reporting no new cases of Covid-19, the country’s recovery was on shaky ground. Health officials had already said it was inevitable that new cases would arrive from abroad, but they promised measures stringent enough to intercept them.More stories of lax practices and failures to test at the quarantine hotels emerged. One facility had held a wedding in the same ballroom where isolating returnees had walked for exercise. Another had convened a children’s birthday party.Six people were released on compassionate grounds to attend a funeral and then absconded rather than returning to quarantine. Health officials told travellers tests were entirely voluntary, and the health ministry has not been able to provide figures for how many people were released from isolation without being tested.Ardern, who had “done a little dance” when New Zealand was declared free of the coronavirus a week earlier, was now stony-faced. The failings were unacceptable and the lack of testing nonsensical, she said.By Friday, New Zealanders were on edge again, and politicians, health officials and military leaders warned of jail time and fines for anyone breaching the quarantine rules for returning travellers. The military would audit the isolation facilities, Ardern said, and ensure the rules were enforced.Compassionate exemptions were also revoked. Two separate tests for those in quarantine hotels are now mandatory during their 14-day stay, and refusal to take a test will result in a further 14 days in isolation.New Zealanders, whom Ardern has referred to as a team of five million, prided themselves on their unity in adhering to earlier lockdown restrictions. The government imposed a national shutdown in late March when just over 200 people had been diagnosed with Covid-19. The country has reported fewer than 1,500 confirmed cases and 22 deaths.New arrivals would have to “earn the right to join the team of 5 million by following the rules,” said Megan Woods, a government minister, on Friday. Only New Zealanders, their families and essential workers are currently permitted to enter the country.For some analysts, the government’s stern response to the breaches was still a positive. The prime minister had been “quick to acknowledge that protocols were not being followed consistently, and that procedures needed to be tightened urgently,” said Prof David Skegg, an emeritus professor in epidemiology at the University of Otago. “One factor in New Zealand’s success in eliminating Covid-19 has been the willingness of the government to respond quickly to mistakes and to listen to expert advice. I think this episode illustrates that again.”Officials announced on Thursday that New Zealand had reported another case of Covid-19, bringing its total to three. This time the traveller from Pakistan had been diagnosed at the quarantine hotel where he was staying, the way the system was supposed to work.Ashley Bloomfield, the director general of health, appeared tired on Friday. This had clearly not been the week he had planned.The public has venerated Bloomfield for his handling of the crisis. His face has appeared on tea towels and memes, and a shrine to “Saint Ashley” was erected in a Wellington shop window. “Some commentators pointed out early on that to make him into a saint, which wasn’t any of his doing, really wasn’t good for the democratic method of being able to hold such a figure to account, and it might lead to a lack of scrutiny,” said Edwards. “I think that was the case and I don’t think he was scrutinised as much, but that’s clearly going to change now.”When he spoke to reporters on Friday, Bloomfield said the fiasco with the two women did not appear to have caused lasting damage to New Zealand’s coronavirus status.Hundreds of people had been considered close contacts of the infected pair, and officials had tested 6,273 people on Thursday, “much higher than we have been doing in recent weeks,” he said.He began his briefing with the sentence that had sounded so sweet to New Zealanders for 24 straight days: “Today the country had zero new cases of Covid-19.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d5a9a183f365161c51a6ab9bb1b77a2e76ae2733/0_347_5228_3138/master/5228.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=04a762c4a228fa1a2d35fb36d94eaaa5","title":"cultural tabu how an ancient ocean custom is saving fijis reefs","story":"Traditional practice of tabu – marking a portion of fishing ground off limits – is helping preserve Fiji’s reefs for future generationsMosese Vesikara and his uncle, Kinikoto Mailautoka, are on the reef collecting sea urchins for lunch. Beneath the shifting skiff, the swelling water is clear despite Fiji’s bustling capital Suva sprawling along the next point, an easily walkable distance.When out collecting Vesikara and the other fishers carefully skirt the tabu – pronounced TAM-bo – a no-fishing zone demarcated by barnacled pillars embedded into the reef floor.These tabus are one tool of many for Fijian communities. Reintroduced to these waters after decades absent, they represent a return to traditional methods of reef and fishery management. The hope is that these traditional wisdoms, combined with modern science, can enable the growing village populations to subsist off the qoliqoli – fishing grounds – that they have for millennia.Oblivious to the zoning, schools of electric blue fish thread through the beige and twinkling coral thickets below Vesikara’s boat. The reef was not always so healthy.In the late 90s throughout Fiji, and across the Pacific, fisheries hit crisis point. Colonial modes of management stressed centralisation, and commercial exploitation had overseen a steady decline in fish numbers.“The fish were getting too small. The coral were dead because of the plastic pollution from Suva and the oil from boats,” says Hemo Marvela, chairman of this marine protection area.“You know the generation coming up. That’s why we want to protect them. That’s the only reason.”As a result a renaissance of traditional community management techniques began, with responsibility for monitoring the health of the qoliqolis returned to the local communities that lived off them.Austin Bowden-Kerby, a marine scientist who has spent a career in coral conservation in the Pacific and central America, recalls how the idea of tabus was revived during a community consultation.“There is one thing our grandfathers used to do that we haven’t been doing – we would make a tabu area. We will mark the reef with sticks and a coconut leaf tied on it. And that means you cannot catch anything on that reef. That makes it sacred. For 40 or 50 years this had not been practised.”\u0026nbspIn Fijian tradition a tabu is the temporary closure of a section of a community’s fishing ground for 100 days after a chief’s death, before a memorial feast is held. The idea of the modern tabu is to extend that closure indefinitely.And so, from this consultation, emerged a pilot of five permanent no-fishing areas.“They said ‘We are going to re-establish our culture,’” Bowden-Kerby says.Word of the resulting increased catches spread from village to village. Today Fiji has a network of 400 communities known as the Fiji Locally Managed Marine Areas (FLMMA), , which use customary management techniques that have often been ignored for decades.Marvela is chair of a four-person committee that governs the Navakavu reef through the traditional chiefly system.The committee responsible for governing the reef’s use struggles to monitor it. They had a boat to guard against poachers but it was stolen years ago. Marvela is fed up enough that he is looking to make Navakavu reef a gazetted marine protected area. This means the police can be called on to stop poachers.But it would also mean a government in Suva would again be managing their qoliqoli.Back at the village Vesikara and Mailautoka scoop out the sea urchin paste and eat them with sliced chilli and a squeeze of lemon. “These would cost about $25 each down at Suva market.” Mailautoka says.With such a payoff, the allure – and risk – of poaching is obvious, and a shift in global tastes could spell fast devastation for the qoliqoli.Already sea cucumbers, which clean and aerate the sands, have been fished to near extinction to satisfy the Asian market. Yet traditional wisdom reinforced by modern science could provide a bulwark to encroaching risks.Perhaps then the lunch-pot might still be full for the next generation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de7ee0c2f21e0bfa05f443a28475c38e94f0ab45/0_177_5297_3178/master/5297.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2cf7caff18fcdd2aaf1ea8516702e99c","title":"drinkers to order pints via apps under new covid 19 guidance","story":"Pubs could also be patrolled to ease 2-metre rule after alert level reduced to threeDrinkers would be encouraged to order pints on smartphone apps and pubs could be patrolled to ensure social-distancing measures are enforced under plans to ease the lockdown for the hospitality sector.Boris Johnson is expected to make an announcement next week on pubs, cafes, restaurants and hotels – with their reopening in England an ambition from 4 July to start reviving the ailing economy.With the coronavirus alert level having been reduced on Friday, the prime minister believes he has some space to relax measures in a boost for the sector.Whitehall officials said the review he ordered into the two-metre social-distancing rule, which seeks to slow the spread of the virus but would constrain the hospitality sector, is expected to conclude next week.Guidance drawn up by the hospitality sector and ministers is understood to encourage pub-goers to order drinks using apps instead of going to the bar, while current legislation was said to include the powers for patrols.The Times reported that restaurant tables would not be set in advance – cutlery would be delivered with the food – and room service would be left outside doors in hotels under the guidance.It was being stressed that decisions on further easings were yet to be made, but the PM said the lowering of the alert level from four to three allows ministers to “start making some progress” on social-distancing measures.And he promised new guidance for the hospitality sector and businesses “very shortly”.The downgrading – recommended by the Joint Biosecurity Centre (JBC) – means transmission of coronavirus is no longer considered to be “high or rising exponentially”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c7be96bd611f420b30614a98fa4eb0d4ba4ce0f3/364_422_2865_1719/master/2865.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ffa3ea9c735d2f0a7aeb2979692c9d28","title":"coronavirus covid 19 live news update us questions beijing cluster figures who vaccine doses latest updates","story":"Country hits grisly milestone as WHO says pandemic is entering ‘new and dangerous phase’We are closing this blog down now but you can continue to see live coverage on our new blog here. Thanks for reading.Here are the most recent updates globally:In Australia, authorities are watching the rise in coronavirus cases in Victoria closely as the state prepares to further ease restrictions from Monday.Gyms, cinemas, indoor sports centres and concert venues are scheduled to reopen on Monday while cafes, restaurants and pubs will increase capacity from 20 people to 50.Thirteen new cases were recorded on Friday, 18 on Thursday and 21 on Wednesday, resulting in the state’s biggest increase in more than a month.While the rest of the country’s Covid-19 infections decline, Victoria’s active cases rose to 91 on Friday, up from 66 four weeks ago.But health authorities said they were relieved to know the links to most of the new cases, many of them returned travellers or close contacts of returned travellers.“We’re hoping that this isn’t the beginning of a second wave and we’re doing everything we absolutely can to make sure that that’s not the case,” Victorian deputy chief health officer Annaliese van Diemen said.Brazil has passed a total of more than one million coronavirus cases, and nearly 50,000 deaths, according to its health ministry data, in a new low for the world’s second worst-hit country.Brazil has recorded 1,032,913 confirmed cases, second only to the United States, with 1,206 new deaths reported on Friday to take the total official fatalities to 48,954, the ministry said. The Brazilian government on Friday published new guidelines for meatpackers after a spike of Covid-19 cases at food plants, including keeping workers at least one metre apart, but labour prosecutors criticized the steps as inadequate.No testing is required under the ministry of agriculture’s new rules, which were issued after consultations with the labour prosecutor’s office.A prosecutors’ representative said the guidelines ignored key recommendations made by the office that specified minimum distancing of 1.5 metres between workers in common areas of the plant, as well as mass testing.The prosecutors’ recommendations also addressed the quality of face masks required for use, physical distancing and testing protocols.The CDC in the US has recommended that meatpacking workers be spaced at least six feet (two metres) apart.Costa Rica’s government will halt reopening the country’s economy due to an increase in the number of coronavirus cases over recent days, health minister Daniel Salas said at a news conference on Friday.An outbreak of coronavirus cases at a meat processer in northern England owned by British supermarket Asda has caused the plant to close temporarily, the Walmart-owned retailer said on Friday.Asda said it had been working with public health authorities to ensure staff were tested, and that while the factory in Cleckheaton, West Yorkshire had not been forced to shut, it had been closed as a precaution. It did not confirm how many cases had been found.A joint statement by Asda and Kober Limited, the firm which runs the plant, said: As soon as we became aware that some colleagues at our Kober site may have Covid-19, we responded swiftly and worked collaboratively with the local authority and Public Health England to test all colleagues.The closure is the latest in a series of outbreaks linked to meat processing plants across Europe and the Americas. On Thursday, one of Britain’s biggest food companies suspended production after more than 50 positive tests.British trade union Unite said it had received reports of five more suspected outbreaks at different meat processing factories, without providing further details.The union said employers had to do more to protect their staff, while academic experts outlined risks of working in a factory environment.Brazil is expected to surpass 1 million confirmed coronavirus cases on Friday, second only to the United States, with total deaths fast approaching 50,000 as the country struggles with a tense political climate and worsening economic outlook.The true extent of the outbreak in Brazil far exceeds official figures released after 6 pm local time on most evenings, according to many experts, who cite a lack of widespread testing in the country as a factor adding to many uncertainties about the disease, Reuters reports.Alexandre Naime Barbosa, a medical professor at the São Paulo State University said: That number of 1 million is much less than the real number of people who have been infected, because there is under-reporting of a magnitude of five to ten times. The true number is probably at least 3 million and could even be as high as 10 million people.Brazil’s health ministry reported 978,142 total confirmed cases and 47,748 related deaths on Thursday evening. The count has risen by a daily average of 25,000 new cases and 1,000 fatalities for the past week.But by Friday afternoon, a consortium of Brazilian news outlets keeping an independent tally of COVID-19 statistics from state health officials reported the country had already passed the benchmark of 1 million confirmed cases.Guatemala has replaced its health minister amid a spike in COVID-19 infections and deaths in the Central American country, Associated Press reports.An official in the presidency who was not authorized to speak about the personnel change and requested anonymity said that health minister Hugo Monroy was replaced on Friday with Amelia Flores, a former vice-minister of health in an earlier administration.Monroy, who had held the position since January, had been harshly criticized for his management of the pandemic.Guatemala has reported more than 11,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 449 deaths.President Alejandro Giammattei has been under growing pressure from the business sector to loosen restrictions. Earlier attempts to reactivate the economy were followed by a surge in infections, prompting Giammattei to clamp down again.The World Health Organization (WHO) warned on Friday of a “new and dangerous phase” of the coronavirus pandemic with people tiring of lockdowns despite the disease’s accelerating spread.The virus, which has now killed more than 454,000 people and infected 8.4 million people worldwide, is surging in the Americas and parts of Asia even as Europe starts to ease restrictive measures.Lockdowns imposed to halt the spread of the disease have caused crippling economic damage, but the WHO said the pandemic still posed a major threat.The world is in a new and dangerous phase. Many people are understandably fed up with being at home... but the virus is still spreading fast.A vaccine remains months off at best despite several trials, while scientists are still discovering more about the virus, its symptoms and the extent to which it may have spread before being identified.Zimbabwe Health Minister Obadiah Moyo was arrested by police on Friday over allegations of corruption in government procurement of around $60 million worth of medical equipment, the Daily News newspaper reported.Several other Zimbabwean and South African news outlets reported the arrest. Reuters was not immediately able to confirm the arrest with authorities in Harare, Reuters reports.Last week Delish Nguwaya, said to be a local representative of international pharmaceutical firm Drax International, the company supplying the equipment to the government, was arrested over the same deal, according to the state-owned Zimbabwe broadcasting commission.President Emmerson Mnangagwa, who took over from long time leader Robert Mugabe after a military coup in 2017, has since cancelled the procurement deals.In addition to the novel coronavirus, which has infected nearly 500 people and caused four deaths, Zimbabwe is facing worst economic crisis in more than a decade and increasing public anger over inadequate services and government corruption.

Spain expects a decision in the coming hours in its talks with Britain on whether to establish a travel corridor to avoid imposing a quarantine on travelers due to the coronavirus pandemic, a Spanish foreign ministry source said on Friday.“Spain is willing to be open to the United Kingdom. We are in talks with them about their quarantine. We are in a position to open without a quarantine,” the source added.Shops in Wales are set to reopen on Monday. First Minister Mark Drakeford has said the “R” rate in Wales continues to be below one1 and the number of deaths reported every day is at the lowest point since lockdown began.Each of the different nations in the UK are in charge of their own coronavirus lockdown restrictions, and this week has seen the lockdown eased slightly in Scotland and Northern Ireland.Italy: Covid-19 was present in two big cities two months before first case was detected. In Italy traces of coronavirus have been found in samples taken from sewage water in Milan and Turin in December, according to a study by Italy’s Higher Health Institute (ISS).Researchers examined 40 samples collected between October 2019 and February 2020, as well as 24 control samples between September 2018 and June 2019.Coronavirus traces were also found in wastewater samples collected in Bologna on 29 January.Deaths from the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy climbed by 47 on Friday, against 66 the day before, the Civil Protection Agency said, while the daily tally of new cases decreased to 251 from 333 on Thursday.The total death toll since the outbreak came to light on 21 Feb now stands at 34,561 the agency said, the fourth highest in the world after those of the United States, Brazil and Britain.The number of confirmed cases amounts to 238,011 the eighth highest global tally.The agency said 2.987 million people had been tested for the virus against 2.959 million on Thursday, out of a population of around 60 million. Apple Inc will shut some stores again in Florida, Arizona, South Carolina, and North Carolina in the United States due to a spike in novel coronavirus cases, Bloomberg News reported on Friday.Apple did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.Crowds have gathered at shopping malls and supermarkets across Colombia to take advantage of a government-mandated VAT-free day for shoppers, despite warnings from health experts that the South American country is far from past its peak of coronavirus cases.On Friday morning, scenes at malls resembled those on Black Friday, the shopping bonanza in the US in late November. Photos circulated on social media showing huge crowds of people packed into stores, albeit while wearing face masks.Yet Colombia’s president Iván Duque appears to be more concerned with reopening the economy. Friday’s VAT holiday will be followed by two more in the coming weeks, aimed at getting the economy going once more.An analyst at El Espectador, one of Colombia’s largest newspapers, wrote on Friday that the measure was likely inspired by the US, “where tax holidays are universally recognized as demagogic policies,” that do little to relieve hard-hit consumers and instead benefit large-scale retailers.With queues snaking around stores and malls overnight, many took to social media to voice their umbrage with the reckless policy. “There’s still not enough ICU beds… there’s not enough respirators, but this is a VAT-free day,” one person tweeted, with a video of queues in Cali, a major city in the country’s western Cauca Valley.Colombia’s inspector general, Fernando Carrillo Florez, lambasted the tax holiday. “It can become one of the largest sources of infection,” he tweeted. “In one day of irresponsibility, we can lose what we gained in 100 days of lockdown.”The coronavirus pandemic is accelerating, the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned. Thursday’s 150,000 new cases were the highest in a single day and nearly half of them were in the Americas“The world is in a new and dangerous phase,” Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a virtual briefing from WHO headquarters in Geneva. “The virus is still spreading fast, it is still deadly, and most people are still susceptible.”More than 8.53 million people have been reported infected by the novel coronavirus globally and 453,834 have died.Tedros urged people to maintain social distancing and “extreme vigilance.”As well as the Americas, a large number of new cases were coming from South Asia and the Middle East, Tedros added.The coronavirus was present in two large Italian cities in December, more than two months before the first case was detected, a national health institute study of waste water has found.That suggests the virus appeared in Italy around the same time it was first reported in China.Researchers discovered genetic traces of Sars-CoV-2 - as the virus is officially known - in samples of waste water collected in Milan and Turin at the end of last year, and Bologna in January, the ISS institute said in a statement seen by AFP on Friday.Italy’s first known native case was discovered mid-February.The results “help to understand the start of the circulation of the virus in Italy,” the ISS said.They also “confirm the by-now consolidated international evidence” as to the strategic function of sewer samples as an early detection tool, it added.The results feed into an effort by scientists around the world to trace the virus’s family tree."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4283772.1592594637!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ucd school of medicine disassociates itself from professor s views","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tProf Dolores Cahill: “The views expressed by Prof Dolores Cahill are her own.

The European Commission, which is a partner of the IMI, said the claims made by Prof Cahill in the interview could cause “significant harm” if taken literally.‘Propaganda tool’During the interview, since removed by Youtube, she claimed that lockdown and social distancing were not needed to stop the spread of the virus, and that “politicians and the media” were using the pandemic “as a fear-mongering propaganda tool to try and take away rights from people and to make them more sick and to force vaccinations on us”.More than 130 students, almost all from the UCD school of medicine, signed a letter saying the failure of the university to disavow Prof Cahill’s statements “acts as a silent endorsement”.A meeting to discuss the controversy was held on Thursday, after which the head of the school, Prof Michael Keane, told academic staff: “The school of medicine, college of health and agricultural sciences, the Conway Institute and the university, continue to fully support the public health position taken by the Irish Government concerning Covid-19.‘Spread of the virus’“This includes treatment for Covid-19 patients and societal restrictions aimed at curbing the spread of the virus.” Many UCD faculty staff and students are directly involved in the provision of healthcare and research specifically relating to Covid-19, Prof Keane pointed out. “The views expressed by Prof Dolores Cahill are her own. They do not reflect the position of the school, college, institute or university.”During Thursday’s meeting, those present discussed the academic freedom provisions in the Universities Act 1997.The view is understood to have been discussed that any move to disadvantage Prof Cahill would leave the university open to being sued.

File photograph: Nick Bradshaw The .Precautionary notices temporarily banning bathing at Dollymount, Sandymount and Portmarnock beaches in Dublin have been put in place following heavy rainfall this week. The restrictions are likely to remain in place over the weekend. The incidents arose due to storm water tank overflows at Ringsend wastewater treatment plant resulting in discharges into Dublin bay. The temporary ban was implemented by local authorities in consultation with the HSE.Irish Water reported a storm water overflow from holding tanks at the Ringsend plant on Wednesday morning after heavy overnight rainfall.Meanwhile, swimmers confirmed they were told to get out of water at the South Bull Wall on Wednesday night due to deterioration of water quality.The plant operated in accordance with design and regulations, Irish Water said. “The overflow contained wastewater that was highly diluted with rainwater and had been screened and settled to remove debris – a form of primary treatment. There was also an overflow at the Portmarnock pumping station, again caused by the heavy rainfall.”The bathing water monitoring site operated by the EPA –beaches.ie – indicated the restriction at Dollymount strand was “due to risk of deterioration in water quality due to discharges breaching limits” – and it would be in place until June 22nd.The Ringsend plant treats approximately 40 per cent of Ireland’s public wastewater but has been operating at over capacity and not in compliance with national and EU environmental regulations for many years. More than €400 million is being spend on upgrading it and increasing its capacity.When there is unusually heavy rainfall, the amount of water entering the sewer network can exceed the capacity of the plant andor network, Irish Water pointed out. “On such occasions, to prevent the sewer network from backing up and causing flooding of roads and properties, the excess storm water is released to the environment. Irish Water notifies local authorities and the EPA of any incidents or overflow that could impact the receiving waters,” it said. On Sandymount strand prohibition of bathing was due to risk of deterioration in water quality due to “storm water overflow”. Bathing at the adjoining Merrion strand is permanently banned mainly due to discharges from polluted streams nearby.Meanwhile, bathing restrictions were applied at Seapoint on Thursday due to the risk of deterioration “due to expected heavy rainfall”.Local authorities are responsible for managing and monitoring bathing waters. Notices are displayed at bathing water locations and on beaches.ie from June to September advising the public on water quality and of any bathing restrictions. “Currently restrictions are in place on a large number of beaches,” Irish Water confirmed."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4283785.1592595400!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"cabinet approves early exit from covid 19 controls with gyms cinemas open from june 29th","story":"Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said on Friday that the Cabinet has approved the re-phasing of the roadmap to reopen Ireland’s economy and society.

Photograph: Julien BehalThe Cabinet has approved plans to accelerate Ireland’s exit from restrictions put in place to tackle the spread of Covid-19.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said on Friday that the Cabinet has approved the re-phasing of the roadmap to reopen Ireland’s economy and society.Apart from some exceptions, many businesses and activities will return from June 29th including places of worship, gyms, cinemas, hairdressers and sporting activities.He confirmed that gatherings will be limited to 50 people indoors from June 29th rising to 100 people in July.“In phase 3, which we expect to commence on Monday the 29th June, all sporting activities, including close contact sports, can recommence including team leagues for adults and children. We will all need to be careful. It will not be as it was before the start of the pandemic and for now sports will take place with very limited numbers of spectators,” Mr Varadkar said on Friday.“We are making progress but this announcement comes with some important terms and conditions. The virus hasn’t gone away. We are all still susceptible to it,” he added.The Taoiseach said the past few months have been amongst the toughest in the country’s history.“In the darkest moments I think we all worried how bad things would get. How much more would people have to suffer. As a country we got through this without giving way to despair and by looking out for each other and staying hopeful.”Mr Varadkar said the country was ahead of schedule in lifting the lockdown measures.He confirmed that all sporting activities can recommence from June 29th but sports would take place with a limited number of spectatorsHowever the announcement “comes with terms and conditions,” he said, adding that people should continue to work from home where possible.“Personal responsibility will become more important than ever before.”He said people should consider four things: distance, activity, time and environment.“Taking personal responsibility means not entering a place if you can see that it is packed. It means leaving somewhere even if you are having a good time.”The Cabinet has also agreed to provide €70 million in funding for the sports sector as it reopens at the end of the month.“Ireland has missed sport in recent times. Communities have suffered an enormous amount. This particular allotment of money is a recognition of the tremendous community work being done by small sports clubs, large sports club and many other people,” the Minister for Sport Shane Ross said.Restart funds will be made available, Mr Ross said, adding that “insolvency was at the door” for many sports clubs. Funding of up to €40 million will be made available for the three main field sports organisations, the FAI, GAA and IRFU. There will be resilience fund of €10 million, a sports club resilience fund of €15 million, and a re-start fund of €5 million.WillpowerMinister for Health Simon Harris said the collective challenge for the country now is “our willpower”.“We have been easing restrictions now for over a month and we have not seen a detrimental impact.”“But we move forward with the knowledge that globally this virus remains as dangerous as ever. We have weakened the spread of Covid-19 in Ireland but it can come back strong unless we follow the proper health checks.”Mr Harris appealed to the public that if they have symptoms they should not wait to contact their doctor. It is taking two days at present for people to do this which is too long, he said.Mr Harris was also asked about the resumption of routine cancer screenings which have been paused. He said the National Screening Service will outline their plans by the end of the month but that programmes would reopen in a phased basis over the summer.The Minister also said it is unlikely that there will be a return to the same “menu” of restrictions as before if a second wave of cases emerges in the coming weeks.Chief medical officer Tony Holohan said the public health team will consider over the coming weeks what kind of restrictions might be needed if there is an emergence of new cases.He also said the team would re-examine the numbers allowed in both indoor and outdoors gatherings in the coming weeks.Minister for Business Heather Humphreys said “I think I speak for most of the country when I say that the news that hairdressers, barbers and beauty salons will be able to open from June 29th is most welcome”.She said 2020 should be “the summer of the staycation”.On the issue of the 14-day quarantine that travellers coming into Ireland are asked to abide by, Mr Varadkar said the quarantine remains in place and that a Cabinet committee would further consider the issue next week.At a briefing following the meeting of NPHET, Prof Philip Nolan, chair of its Irish Epidemiological Modelling Advisory Group, said that Covid-19 was at a very low level in the State and very stable. However, a resurgence in the number of new Covid-19 infections in the State as a result of foreign travel, including from Britain and Sweden, has raised concerns among public health officials.Fewer than 10 new cases of the coronavirus disease relating to travel outside the country were reported over the past fortnight after several weeks with no confirmed cases associated with travel.“Over the last two weeks we have begun to see a small number of travel-related cases - it is a cause for concern nonetheless,” said Prof Nolan. Many of these cases were still being investigated, he added.The Department of Health reported four additional Covid-19 fatalities and 16 new confirmed cases on Thursday, bringing the death toll to 1,714 and the total number of cases to 23,355.Nursing homes account for 962 deaths or 56 per cent of all fatalities from the disease.Chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan said the greater the progress made on suppressing the virus at home, the more important the risk of importing cases from abroad would become.“We wouldn’t like to see any cases being imported if we can avoid that,” he said and advised people to continue to avoid all non-essential and holiday travel to and from Ireland.Dr Holohan said the team did not see pubs reopening in the same phase as restaurants from the end of the month but that if pubs planned to operate as restaurants from this date he hoped publicans would be “responsible” in applying public health advice and guidance “in good faith”.Prof Nolan said that the figures on the low number of new cases and admissions to hospitals and intensive care units showed that the disease was “at a very low level and very stable.”But he sounded “a note of caution” that health officials “would only just now” be seeing the effect of changes made in the second reopening phase on June 8th.PrematureMeanwhile, public health expert Dr Joe Barry warned on Friday that the reopening of pubs is “a little bit premature”.On the balance of risks, the easing of restrictions should be taken “a little more gently” with high risk locations like pubs, he told RTÉ radio’s Morning Ireland.Dr Barry, who is Clinical Professor in Public Health Medicine and Head of the Department of Public Health and Primary Care in Trinity College, Dublin said the issue was that a person could walk into a pub, have a few pints and walk out with Covid-19, but be asymptomatic.“It’s a little bit premature to let pubs reopen the way they want to do it. This has to be looked at much more carefully over the next three weeks,” he said.Dr Barry said pub is a different environment from restaurants, and would be more difficult to control. Pubs are the ideal place for the spread of the virus given the close proximity of customers, he said. Adding alcohol to the situation meant that people’s judgement could “go a little bit.”He argued that the Fáilte Ireland guidelines on the reopening of pubs were “strange” with “a lot of wooly language.”Dr Barry said he could understand publicans intensely lobbying to reopen their businesses, but publicans were not unique in their suffering. The situation was too serious for people to think they could just out to pubs again. After all the efforts that had been made, there was too much to lose, he warned.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Choirs and music practice can also resume, but with strict social distancing and ideally outdoors.Gatherings will be limited to 50 people indoors and 200 people outdoors until July 20th.This is later due to rise to 100 people indoors and 500 people outdoors, although a further review will be carried out by the public-health team in the coming weeks.PreschoolsCreches, childminders and preschools will be opened only for children of essential workers, however this will expand to include all workers on a phased basis from late July. All other children’s activities and venues will be reopened from the end of the month.People will also be permitted to travel throughout the country, and travel to offshore islands can also resume. Those planning to travel to different counties will be asked to “acquaint themselves with the level of transmission of the virus in the relevant area”.There will be no specific number for gatherings in private homes but the public-health team has asked that physical distancing be maintained.Cocooning for those over 70 will continue to be recommended, the roadmap states.In its advice to Government, the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) said “the risk of a large surge of infection remains ever present and Covid-19 will continue to be a threat to the world for the foreseeable future”.“As the public-health restrictions are lifted and there are no longer detailed rules in place imposed by the State, everybody in society will now exercise their own judgment and take personal responsibility for decisions that they make about the risk of infection to themselves and others in different situations.”The existing ban on rent increases and evictions has also been extended until July 20th following Cabinet approval.Minister for Health Simon Harris said that it was “unlikely” that there would be a return to the kind of restrictions previously put in place in March, while chief medical officer Tony Holohan said the NPHET would now begin to consider measures “at a national level, or below national level” should there be a spike in cases.“It won’t be the same set of measures that we introduced in March,” he said.Mr Holohan said he did not believe the measures were being lifted too quickly. “We think it is appropriate for where we think we are in terms of the transmission of the disease,” he said.Mr Harris also said the National Screening Service would outline its plans for the resumption of routine cancer screening by the end of the month but that programmes would likely reopen on a phased basis over the summer.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4278888.1592573160!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"i cried tears of joy the day she told me i didn t need to have chemotherapy","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAnne Kavanagh at home in Terenure, Dublin: ‘The Oncotype test is a great way of speeding things up and is so accurate.’  Photograph: Alan Betson On a Monday last October, Anne Kavanagh noticed that one of her breasts felt different from normal.The next day she went to her family doctor. Within a week, she was diagnosed with early stage breast cancer, known as “HR-positive, HER2-negative, node-negative”. The tumour was so small that it did not show up in an X-ray.When it was removed the following week, the surgeon suggested that Prof Janice Walshe, consultant oncologist at St Vincent’s University Hospital in Dublin, be brought in on the conversation on whether chemotherapy would then be necessary.In the meantime, a second tiny lump was found and removed. They went ahead with the Oncotype test (a genetic test) by sending a sample to the US. The result was back within 10 days and Kavanagh says there was no long, stressful wait to find out whether she would need to have chemotherapy.She had a score of three out of 100, an indication there was no need for chemotherapy, and instead underwent four weeks of radiotherapy.“I have been absolutely fantastic since,” says Kavanagh, who is married with three children, and will be 70 in September.She believes she was blessed in getting over the rollercoaster of emotion so quickly rather than waiting to learn her fate.Sixteen years ago her sister Mary had to undergo chemotherapy, which was the standard course of treatment.“I don’t think cancer is the same terrifying word that it was then. The Oncotype test is a great way of speeding things up and is so accurate,” she says.Her cancer had a minimal impact on her quality of life. She lives in Terenure, Dublin, and believes being fit, doing yoga and walking often played their part. Her family are thrilled by the outcome and she has become a strong advocate for regular breast checks.Moreover, she says, her case highlights the merits of going to the doctor as soon as a lump is detected – when “a lot of people put it off”.No benefit from chemoOrlaith Cryan had breast cancer surgery in February 2013 having also been diagnosed node-negative (early stage breast cancer). She was referred to Prof Walshe, who recommended the Oncotype test. A tissue sample was sent to the US and her score “just scraped in” at less than 20.“She told me you can have chemo if you wish. She felt I would not benefit from it. I went on her advice,” Cryan says.Knowing the likely impacts including hair loss and having to go on steroids, she was very happy not to go down that route. Instead, she had hormone therapy for five years, taking tamoxifen – which blocks the female hormone oestrogen in the body. She has been off that drug since early last year.After surgery she had a short course of radiotherapy, with minor side-effects, while the tamoxifen had no side-effects.“I never lost my quality of life,” says Cryan (52), who is married with three adult children and lives in Knocklyon, Dublin. Regular check-ups are all that have been needed since.“Without the Oncotype test I would have been put straight into chemotherapy . . . It was absolutely fantastic that I didn’t have to,” she says. “I cried tears of joy the day she told me I didn’t need to have chemotherapy.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"How a genetic test helped in the treatment of two women with early stage breast cancerVast majority of Irish economy and society is set to reopen at the end of the monthState was one of the first countries to adopt the test for early-stage breast cancer patientsBehind James O\u0026rsquoReilly\u0026rsquos conviction for rape and abuse lies a system that fails TravellersTown reopens but locals remain stunned by shooting dead of \u0026lsquoeasygoing, respectful man\u0026rsquoStephen Silver (43), with an address in Co Mayo, was remanded in custodyHotels Federation says new guidance \u0026lsquofails to recognise many have capacity to host larger gatherings\u0026rsquoMinute\u0026rsquos silence to be observed at Garda Headquarters, all Garda stations nationwideExpected antipathy in rural areas to Green Party over agriculture policy hardly featuredMore than 56,000 learners on waiting list and 36,000 of these have finished lessonsMan held in joint Garda operation targeting gang suspected of large-scale drug traffickingPlaces of worship, gyms, cinemas, hairdressers to reopen and sport resume from end of monthProf Dolores Cahill claims she wants to \u0026lsquodebunk the narrative\u0026rsquo surrounding Covid-19Organisation says medics who responded to \u0026lsquoall hands on deck\u0026rsquo campaign are now being told there is no work for themAll available space to be used but principals raise concerns about accommodating studentsIrish Dental Association says Simon Harris promised protective equipment for dentistsSalon owners say they have adapted and put measures in place to keep everyone safeProtesting workers picket all 11 stores in the Republic over redundancy termsStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4282773.1592506512!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"government extends covid 19 travel rules for all arriving passengers","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA notice for arriving passengers about the Covid-19 passenger locator form at Terminal 2 in Dublin Airport. Photograph: Brian LawlessPA Regulations requiring people entering the Republic from abroad to provide the address where they will be self-isolating for the required 14-day period have been extended for a further three weeks. Upon arrival in the State at airports or ports, iniduals are required to fill in a passenger locator form. The coronavirus measures are in place to allow authorities to check if iniduals are self-isolating for 14 days as advised, and for contact tracing purposes. Those who do not fill out the passenger locator form or who provide false details can face a fine of €2,500 or a prison term of six months.The regulations were introduced on May 28th to last until June 18th, at which point they would be reviewed. A Department of Health spokeswoman confirmed on Thursday the regulations had been extended until July 9th, “at which stage they will be reviewed.”“This means anyone arriving in Ireland will have to fill out a form and inform us of their whereabouts. This ensures we have an adequate contact tracing system in place,” she said. The spokeswoman said public health advice instructing people to self-isolate for 14 days upon arriving into the State from abroad remains in place. However, she added this advice was “strongly recommended,” but not mandatory. “We would ask that all persons arriving into the State follow this advice as closely as they can,” she said. In recent weeks the Cabinet has discussed the potential easing of overseas travel restrictions, with the option of permitted travel between other countries where coronavirus has been controlled under consideration. One source said Cabinet colleagues had begun to receive queries from constituents on when they could travel abroad on holidays again.Insurance claimsCurrently the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) advises “against all non-essential travel overseas until further notice,” including Britain, but not Northern Ireland. Several insurance companies have warned if holidaymakers decide to disregard the existing advice on overseas travel they will not be covered. Zurich has advised customers that if iniduals travel abroad against the DFA advice any insurance claim arising from the coronavirus pandemic could be denied. Similarly Laya states if policyholders booked trips after the advice on non-essential travel was introduced they will not be covered.In a statement, Insurance Ireland, which represents the industry, said while the wording of policies differ, “in general if a policy holder decides to travel at a time when the Government advises against non-essential travel, they would be in danger of invalidating their travel insurance.” The group said its “strong advice” is that policyholders “follow the Irish Government’s advice at all times.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4283853.1592600864!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"larger weddings should be allowed in some cases ministers tell cabinet meeting","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister Heather Humphreys: raised questions about large wedding venues which could potentially accommodate more guests and family members.  Photograph: Nick Bradshaw A number of Ministers have privately called for larger weddings to be allowed where churches and venues can safely accommodate extra guests.The call was made at a meeting of the Cabinet on Friday which approved indoor gatherings of up to 50 people from the end of the month. The limit for such gatherings will rise to 100 from July 20th.It is understood that Minister of State for Defence Paul Kehoe and Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation Heather Humphreys raised questions about large wedding venues which could potentially accommodate more guests and family members.Minister for Health Simon Harris said the public health team would examine the proposals in the coming weeks and provide further guidance, sources say.Meanwhile, the president of the Irish Hotels Federation Elaina Fitzgerald Kane said the new Government advice provides “some clarity for hotels and engaged couples, especially those whose special days were cancelled due to the Covid-19 restrictions or whose weddings are imminent.”“However, this limit fails to acknowledge the extensive health and safety measures already developed so that hotels can provide a safe environment for guests and their teams, nor does it take account of the capacity of some properties to host larger events safely.“We are calling on the Government to allow hotels that can safely host larger weddings to do so based on the size and scale of the venues, rather than imposing a general limit on how many people can gather at any venue, regardless of safe capacity.”Ms Kane said that the announcement represented a “starting point” but said it “fails to recognise that many hotels have the capacity to host larger gatherings within the current physical distancing guidelines.”“While some brides and grooms will now be able to have their special day this summer, a roadmap is urgently needed that will provide further clarity on what weddings can look like following the summer months until the end of the year. Couples will be very anxious to know this.”Hotels have developed a set of guidelines in conjunction with Fáilte Ireland which also detail how to safely host gatherings such as weddings in different sized venues.The guidelines recommend a private room for the drinks reception. Canapés must be in inidual portions. During the meal, salt and pepper shakers, butter dishes will be available only on request. There will also be “no family-style service of food, ie no shared vegetable and gravy dishes.” Wedding afters “must be served directly to each guest fully plated.” Social distancing will have to be maintained on dance floors.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Delhi says Chinese dammed a river and lay in wait for clash in which 20 Indians diedCases widely seen as Chinese \u0026lsquohostage diplomacy\u0026rsquo following arrest of Huawei\u0026rsquos chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou in VancouverInvestigators say they have found gun and are talking to two \u0026lsquopeople of interest\u0026rsquoTensions remain high despite two governments agreeing to de-escalate confrontationAustralia says it will not name country responsibleKim Yo-jong\u0026rsquos criticism of Seoul illustrates her seniority and potential to become rulerBatons wrapped in barbed wire used in high-altitude brawl in which 20 Indian soldiers diedNZ officials tracing 320 people regarded as \u0026lsquoclose contacts\u0026rsquo of pair who returned from UKClash on Himalayan border is the most serious since 1967, why now and what next?Any moves to invalidate peace deals posemajor setback to Moon\u0026rsquos efforts for more lasting reconciliation with NorthFirst loss of life in area for decades as \u0026lsquoviolent face-off\u0026rsquo between troops elevates disputeLatest in a series of threats from the Kim regime since diplomacy with US broke downFierce criticism as editor of influential Rappler website faces up to six years in jailChile replaces health minister as deaths spiral while global cases exceed 7.6 millionSocial media giant says China ran network of accounts to spread misinformationTwo years after Trump-Kim summit minister says peace hopes are now \u0026lsquodark nightmare\u0026rsquoThere had been repeated calls by the Maori community to remove statue of John HamiltonLam warns city cannot afford further \u0026lsquochaos\u0026rsquoalmost 9,000 aged 11- 84 arrested in protests over past yearDecision marks a setback in relations amid efforts to persuade North to give up nuclear weapons programmeSouth Pacific nation of 5m declared it was coronavirus free on MondayStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"World community urged to reject move to intensify \u0026lsquoprofound human rights violations\u0026rsquoAmple evidence uncovered of movement\u0026rsquos widespread persecution of Yazidi minority and other ethnic minoritiesSarah Hegazi\u0026rsquos simple gesture at a concert led to outrage, persecution and heartbreakDemonstrations against prices and wages erupt in Sweida and spread to DeraaAnnexation would be incompatible with international law, Maas warnsTerror group ramps up attacks as crises including coronavirus provide opportunityGovernment pressed to speed up talks with IMF and donors to secure funds and halt slideBritish-Iranian woman seeking release after first furlough from jail in Iran since 2016Police and security force officers killed in roadside bomb and gun battleHealth authorities confirm more than 3,000 new cases on two consecutive daysOpponents warn that US-backed plan would lead to independent Palestinian stateWar and coronavirus-ravaged country to get $1.35bn from UN and Saudi ArabiaTension rises in region with Israel planning to extend sovereignty to Jewish settlementsGiven lack of other options, authorities used restrictions as main tool to fight pandemicFormer cabinet minister Saad al-Jabri was strategic architect of Saudi counter-terrorism effortsPrime minister claims allegations are a \u0026lsquodeep-state\u0026rsquo, left-wing political witch-huntLong-serving politician will become first sitting prime minister in Israel\u0026rsquos history to stand trialPA president cites imminent threat of Israeli annexation of parts of the West BankFirebomb attack on home claimed the lives of a couple and their 18-month-old sonWHO forecasts coronavirus will kill 42,000 and infect most of 28 million populationStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com\"/polopoly_fs/1.4192672!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_940/image.jpg","title":"us democratic","story":"The process to choose the Democratic nominee to take on Donald Trump in November’s US presidential election is well under way.States across the country are in the process of choosing\u0026nbsptheir preferred candidate, either through a primary contest or a caucus.

A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted.

On every front, trouble beckons. The economy is paralysed the deficit spirals out of control. Incompetence and incoherence appear to characterise the official response to the Covid-19 pandemic, epitomised by the farce of over contact tracing and the confused messages on the lockdown.Even more chillingly, a wave of cultural vandalism sweeps across the land, leaving monuments defaced and our heritage in danger. As the authorities cower before the mob in this atmosphere of turmoil, essential liberties are under threat.The Conservatives should be mounting a fierce defence of our culture and history. After all, the clue is in the party’s name. Yet, despite a majority of 80 seats in the Commons, the Government appears weak, distracted. Instead of blasting the trumpet of defiance, Ministers continually sound the muted whistle of retreat. The party lacks confidence, the Cabinet experience. Boris Johnson himself has lost his ebullience as his popularity declines. At the peak of the Covid-19 crisis, he enjoyed approval ratings between plus 20 and plus 40 per cent. In contrast, one recent poll put the figure at minus seven per cent.What the Government desperately needs to avoid is the fate of another Conservative administration, which came to power exactly 50 years ago today. It was on 19 June 1970 that Edward Heath entered Downing Street after his triumph in the General Election over Harold Wilson. The victory had come as a surprise, for most opinion polls had pointed to a comfortable Labour win. But his success in confounding conventional wisdom initially emboldened Heath, who promised a vigorous new style of governance after all the squalor and ineptitude of the Wilson years.Just four months into his premiership, he declared that he would “embark on a change so radical, a revolution so quiet yet so total, that it will go far beyond the programme for a Parliament.”But that bold rhetoric could hardly have been more empty. Instead of taking command, Heath soon began to be buffeted by events. His Ministry limped from one catastrophe after another, its authority continuously draining away. Throughout this nightmare, the Prime Minister miserably failed to uphold Tory values. Instead, he behaved liked a progressive mandarin, seeing every problem through the prism of Whitehall bureaucracy instead of his party’s central philosophy.Without a firm political anchor, he was tossed on the turbulent seas of discord. Having come to power promising to crack down on public expenditure, he moved in exactly the opposite direction. Vast sums of taxpayers money were lavished on health, housing, welfare and education, with the result that inflation shot up to record levels. He said he would take on the militant trade unions, but he ended up presiding over a catalogue of retreats, like his 1973 surrender to the National Union of Mineworkers.During the election, he had presented himself as the champion of free enterprise who would oppose the extension of state control. He was soon executing more dramatic U-turns, as he introduced a prices and incomes policy, nationalised Rolls-Royce, and bailed out a number of “lame duck” companies like the Upper Clyde shipbuilders. The political storms were relentless. He had to introduce a three-day week because of energy shortages, cope with the Arab oil price hike and deal with soaring unemployment. During his premiership, Northern Ireland went through the most violent period of the Troubles, characterised by internment, Bloody Sunday and the collapse of Stormont. The attempt to reach a settlement through the power-sharing Sunningdale Agreement failed broke on the diehard opposition of unionists and loyalists, whom the Government failed to challenge.A brusque, cold personality with a streak of egotistical arrogance, Heath struggled to establish any connection with the public or rapport with his party. But his other key flaw is that he failed to act like a Conservative. It is telling that two of his most important measures represented an attack on British tradition, the very opposite of the impulse to conserve. One was his vast reorganisation of local government, which saw the destruction of numerous cherished municipalities and the creation of artificial new monoliths like the West Midlands County Council or Humerside.Far more important was his decision to bring Britain within the embrace of the European Community. This internationalist mission had long been the primary goal of this political career. Even in 1963, when Charles de Gaulle rejected Britain’s application for EC membership, he declared that “we will continue to work with our friends in Europe for a true unity.”Heath’s elevation to Downing Street enabled him to enact the fulfil his dream, though he only did so by misleading the British people about the realities of Brussels rule. In the 1970 election, the Tories shamelessly declared that “there is no question of Britain losing essential sovereignty.” Once the European Act had been pushed through Parliament, Heath was even more brazen in his dishonesty, announcing in a 1973 broadcast that “there are some in this country who fear that in going into Europe, we shall in some way sacrifice our independence and sovereignty. These fears, I need hardly add, are completely unjustified.” But they were fully justified, as the subsequent history of Britain’s subjugation at the hands of the EU demonstrated.Heath fell from power in March 1974, after, with typical maladroitness, he had called a general election on theme “Who Governs?” The answer from the majority of voters was, “not you.” After a second election defeat in November, an internal revolt by Tory MPs saw him replaced by Margaret Thatcher, who turned out to have far more steel than he did. While he embarked on the longest sulk in history, she transformed Britain. One of her most famous lines, delivered in 1981 with the country in the throes of another economic crisis, was a direct rebuke of Heath’s impulse for backing down. “You turn if you want to, the lady’s not for turning.”The fundamental lesson of Heath’s demise was that, in graphic contrast to Mrs Thatcher, he never really tried to govern as a Tory. Every administration is bound to involve major compromises – Mrs Thatcher herself had a gradualist approach to trade union reform – but Heath actively seemed to despise Conservatism. Boris Johnson is of course a very different figure: warm-hearted, humorous and jovial, with a natural gift for campaigning.But the current drift has to end. The Government could start to reassert its grip by standing firm in the Brexit talks, boosting businesses by easing the lockdown more quickly, and, above all, by challenging the wreckers of the social justice movement. Otherwise, the miserable spectre of Heath will loom ever more largely over Downing Street.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"air bridges plan set begin fewer 10 short haul destinations","story":"Air bridges enabling holidaymakers to sidestep quarantine are likely to open with fewer than 10 predominantly short-haul destinations, The  understands.Officials are drawing up criteria by which to determine the risk posed by each destination of spreading coronavirus on tourists\u0027 return. Air bridges will only be cleared after advice on each low risk country from the chief medical officer, and the Foreign Office agreeing to lift its ban on non-essential travel to the destinations. It is work in progress – risk first, and how you measure that risk, followed by the popularity of the destination, said an aviation source.Ministers are expected to announce the plans on June 29, when the quarantine policy was scheduled to be reviewed, although there was speculation in Spain on Friday that the country was about to announce its agreement to a travel corridor or air bridge with the UK.Australia and British territories Gibraltar, Bermuda, Montserrat and the Falklands Islands are also being considered for travel corridors, although it is not clear if they would be part of the first tranche of countries.The numbers of countries with agreed corridors is likely to increase after the first review on June 29, although ministers are determined that each step should be assessed to minimise the risk of a second coronavirus wave.That means quarantine could remain in place throughout the summer for anyone arriving from countries that do not have a corridor with the UK.With the prospects of air bridges rising, some families are already planning to decamp to Europe this summer, with some travel firms reporting a spike in bookings.Emma Coulthurst, of price comparison website Travelsupermarket, said people seemed to be pre-empting the Government announcement and had been buoyed by seeing countries such as Italy and Portugal reopening for tourism.She said searches on the site for holidays in Spain and Greece doubled a fortnight ago when the countries made it clear they were trying to salvage the summer season. In the past week, there has been an 18 per cent increase in searches for package holidays to Spain.Through to June, we were seeing most searches for October departures, followed by September and December and April and May next year, said Ms Coulthurst.Things have completely flipped in the last fortnight on the back of talk of \u0027air bridges\u0027 and European countries reopening. Now it is this July, August and September that we are seeing most searches and bookings for.Flight booking site Skyscanner said there had been a 34 per cent increase in searches for return travel from the UK in the week beginning June 7 compared to May 10. Roughly a third of people are looking to travel in the next 30 days, and Alicante, Tenerife and Faro were among the most popular searches on the site. However, the number of bookings through the service is still far below pre-coronavirus levels.Gavin Harris, of Skyscanner, said: Right now, consumers are navigating a complex decision-making process. There still remains uncertainty about the provision of future travel in both the short and longer term. Noel Josephides, of tour operator Sunvil, said he had not seen a rush of bookings and the firm has cancelled customer bookings up until July 15 so as not to leave travellers in limbo. He added that people appeared to be waiting for the ForeignOffice travel advice to be lifted.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"elon musk urges johnny depp amber heard bury hatchet ongoing","story":"Elon Musk has urged Johnny Depp and his ex-wife Amber Heard to “bury the hatchet” amid the former couple’s legal battle.The Tesla and SpaceX billionaire said that all those involved in the defamation case between Depp and Heard should come to a resolution.Mr Musk denied ever being involved in a “three-way affair” with Heard, whom he previously dated, and Cara Delevingne, the British supermodel, while Heard was married to Depp.He also denied ever being in any relationship with Heard while she and Depp were married.The technology tycoon told The New York Post: “Cara and I are friends but we’ve never been intimate.

The institution\u0027s vice-Chancellor said the decision was taken after carrying out a survey of 6,000 worldwide students. The delay means some Leeds students will graduate up to six months later than expected, and fear they could miss out on jobs and graduate schemes which typically start in September.A petition from Masters students at the university claims the university is prioritising international students over their careers.They’ve prioritised money from international students over the prospective careers of their students because they justify their decision based on a research they conducted with overseas students, the petition says.Domestic Leeds masters students were not contacted as part of this research. This decision will majorly impact grad opportunitiesjobs and funding.University leaders warned ministers in April that they faced “major financial risks” in the 2020-21 academic year due to a fall in the number of international students combined with a rise in undergraduate deferrals from home students. They said that without Government support, some institutions will face “financial failure”.Liverpool has delayed the undergraduate start date by two weeks, while students at Dundee University will go back three weeks later than first planned.Other universities to announce a delay to the start of their term include King’s College London, Bristol, Manchester, Nottingham, Warwick, Cardiff and Exeter.A Leeds University spokesman said: “We are sorry to have disappointed some of our applicants, but it has proved impossible to accommodate a September start date for everyone. We will of course be happy to discuss any challenges this presents for inidual applicants.”Aberdeen became the first university to delay the start of term by two weeks in April, in order to allow for added preparations on campus in response to the pandemic.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/04/02/20/andrew-lloyd-webber.jpg","title":"andrew lloyd webber theatre reopen uk joseph technicolour dreamcoat palladium tickets","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Industry experts warned this week that the UK is on the brink of ‘cultural collapse’Lord Andrew Lloyd Webber has revealed that a government report advised that musicals return “without any singing” to stop the spread of coronavirus.In a week that saw industry figures warn that the UK is on the brink of “cultural catastrophe”, the composer told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme about his plans to keep theatre going.With the government being widely criticised for failing to support the arts during the crisis, Lloyd Webber explained that he’d had “a couple of phone calls” with Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden about the future of theatre.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“I would love to say that I think that they understood a little more,” Lloyd Webber said.“I have seen a report, I don’t know what’s going to be in the report on theatre that’s coming out on Monday (22 June), but I sincerely hope it doesn’t contain some of the things that I’ve seen in some of their advice, one of which was a brilliant one for musicals – that you’re not allowed to sing.”RSC slams article that called Romeo and Juliet cast ‘garishly erse’Armando Iannucci warns of ‘absolutely terrifying’ future for the artsDavid Tennant says UK theatres are ‘teetering’ close to collapseLloyd Webber shared his plans to “prove” to the world that theatres can stay open. The composer hopes that a one-off performance of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat will go ahead at the London Palladium in July, explaining: “We’ve just had the final bits of equipment delivered into England, we hope to have them in the theatres next month.“All one can do is try and be positive. I really believe that we in theatre must be positive and use everything we can to demonstrate that we can open. If having done that we fail, at least we’ve tried.”The coronavirus has had a devastating impact on the British theatre industry, with producer Cameron Mackintosh announcing this week that Phantom, Hamilton, Les Misérables and Mary Poppins would not be opening their doors again until 2021, with redundancies expected for employees on all four shows.A report from industry leaders also published this week warned that the UK is facing a “cultural catastrophe” and the loss of £74bn and more than 400,000 jobs this year as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.The Phantom of the Opera\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Mr Uddin is one of a number of suppliers who say that Sir Philip’s fashion empire has refused to pay for millions of pounds worth of orders, leaving them struggling to pay workers and keep the lights on.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMr Uddin told The Independent that he was forced to shut down production two weeks ago because cancelled orders meant his cash flow had dried up and he could not pay money owed to suppliers of materials. He said he is now paying out $25,000 per day in costs but has no income, and now fears that without an urgent resolution he will have to close his doors for good.The Bangladesh Export Processing Zone, where Denim Expert’s factory is located, has suspended Mr Uddin’s import and export permissions because of unpaid rent and utility bills. Goods that were due to be shipped out in February and March have been sat in containers at the port incurring charges each day.“With payments virtually suspended since the outbreak started, there has been a catastrophic impact upon the cash flow of our operation, which functions on very low margins at the best of times,” Mr Uddin said.

Most manufacturers take this material on credit and pay it off when buyers pay them for the finished goods, meaning that when money is not forthcoming they quickly run into problems. Arcadia said it had no direct relationship with Denim Expert but confirmed that it did have outstanding orders for the company’s goods via a third party which buys jeans from a number of factories.Following media coverage of Mr Uddin’s problems with Arcadia and other buyers, an Arcadia representative contacted Denim Expert but no agreement has been reached. The company offered to buy some of the goods but not until August, an offer which Mr Uddin said he could not accept. An Arcadia spokesperson said the group was “in ongoing discussions” with its suppliers, including Denim Expert, to come to an agreement about the cancelled orders. The group has been in financial difficulty in recent years, narrowly avoiding administration in June 2019 after landlords backed a rescue deal at the last minute. Under the deal, 50 stores were earmarked for closure and 1,000 people lost their jobs.

That’s how it’s been for the last 100 yearsGlobally, the group, which is owned by Sir Philip’s wife through a holding company in Monaco, cancelled as much as £100m, according to The Worker Rights Consortium (WRC).Mr Uddin added: “I am not interested to work with Arcadia any more. I want to get rid of them as a buyer. Usually in manufacturing industries like this, whatever the buyer wants, you have to accept. That’s how it’s been for the last 100 years.“I have made up my mind. I only want to work with the people who are fair and responsible.”Fiona Gooch, senior policy advisor at Traidcraft Exchange, said: “It is terrible that factories are having to close in Bangladesh, and other garment producing countries, through no fault of their own. “By refusing to pay up, brands like Philip Green’s Burton Menswear are putting thousands of workers, mainly young women and their families at risk of destitution. “Philip Green is a millionaire.

These are covered by separate guidance which will be updated soon, the FCA said.Richard Lane, director of policy and external affairs at StepChange Debt Charity, said: The extension of payment holidays for credit cards, overdrafts and other forms of consumer credit will come as a huge relief for the many thousands of households struggling to keep up with credit repayments during this pandemic.But unless further long-term support measures are put in place, this relief will be short-lived.Our own research has found that 4.2 million people have borrowed to make ends meet since lockdown began, storing up a tsunami of £6 billion of debt that is set to worsen if left unchecked.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Retail sales jumped 12 per cent in May after record lows in April as lockdown restrictions eased and some shops began to reopen, official figures show.Sales remained 13.1 per cent below levels seen in February before the coronavirus pandemic hit, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).Non-food stores enjoyed the biggest gains as DIY chains, including B\u0026ampQ, reopened their doors after closing to implement social distancing measures such as changing layouts and placing markings on floors.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWhile some garden centres and hardware stores were able to start trading again from mid-May, many other sectors, such as clothing, were restricted to selling online. Online sales surged from 30.8 per cent of all retail sales in April to 33.4 per cent in May. Online-only retailers grew 24.3 per cent in the three months to May.Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?In a further sign that economic activity began to recover in May, fuel sales rose but remain 42.5 per cent down on February.Food store sales dipped 0.3 per cent in May but remained high after a spike in April caused by restaurants, caterers, schools and food-to-go shops closing down. Retailers are reliant on a continued improvement in sales after thousands of non-essential shops across the country began to reopen this week. With numbers of customers strictly limited, queues formed outside some stores on Monday.A number of big retailers are opening stores in phases as they assess the effectiveness of safety measures, as well as the profitability of different sites in a socially distanced environment.Concerns remain that relaxing restrictions will lead to a rise in infections, forcing shops to close again. That scenario could prove disastrous for high street retailers, many of which are already facing difficult financial circumstances.Tom Leman, head of retail at law firm Pinsent Masons, said: “It’s been a big week for retailers with the reopening of many stores across the country and reports of long queues as consumers eagerly return to physical shops. “However, today’s figures are a clear reminder of the challenges facing the sector as they look to make up on the financial impact of store closure. It is crucial that, as retailers strive to regain lost revenue, they balance the health and safety of consumers alongside a great retail experience.”Office for National Statistics\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It is expected to be build in an underground location in Geneva by approximately 2038.While final approval has not yet been given, CERN can take a more proactive approach in designing the collider, utilising resources otherwise allocated to alternative designs such as a linear eletron-positron collider or a muon accelerator, according to Nature.Cern’s pursuit of the elusive god particleThe later stages of CERN’s development will be building an electron-positron collider to produce and study the Higgs boson.That machine would then be dismantled and replaced with a proton smasher, which would search for new particles to complete or disprove our current understanding of physics.By 2050, it could be smashing the particles together with approximately six times the force (100 teraelectronvolts) as the Large Hadron Collider.“It’s probing nature at the shortest distances and looking for the smallest things we can see … it’s a real exploratory mission. Everyone agrees that’s what we need to do. The question has been: what’s the best machine to do it?” said Professor Jon Butterworth of University College London.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas from fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telescope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailIt said that at the end of a payment freeze, firms should contact their customers to find out if they can resume payments - and if so, agree a plan on how the missed payments could be repaid.If customers can afford to return to regular repayment, it is in their best interest to do so.Anyone who continues to need help should get help, it added.For customers still facing temporary payment difficulties as a result of coronavirus, firms should provide them with support by reducing payments on their credit card and personal loans to a level they can afford for three months.Where a customer needs further temporary support to bridge the crisis, any full or partial payment freezes offered under the guidance should not have a negative impact on credit files, the FCA said.Lenders grant 1.5 million repayment holidays on credit cards and loansHow will proposed temporary relief help people with overdrafts?Banks told to make overdrafts interest-free and freeze debt repaymentsCoronavirus: Banks ordered not to cancel people’s credit cardsBut borrowers should bear in mind that credit files are not the only source of information lenders may use to assess creditworthiness.Lenders may, for example, refer to information they already have about a customer.Christopher Woolard, interim chief executive at the FCA, said: We have been working closely with other authorities, lenders and debt charities to support consumers in the current emergency.The proposals we\u0027ve announced today would provide an expected minimum level of financial support for consumers who remain in, or enter, temporary financial difficulty due to coronavirus.Where consumers can afford to make payments, it is in their best long-term interest to do so, but for those who need help, it will be there.Comments on the proposals are being invited by 5pm on 22 June and the regulator expects to finalise the guidance shortly afterwards.The plans do not apply to other consumer credit products, such as motor finance, high-cost, short-term credit, rent-to-own, pawnbroking and buy-now, pay-later products. These are covered by separate guidance which will be updated soon, the FCA said.Richard Lane, director of policy and external affairs at StepChange Debt Charity, said: The extension of payment holidays for credit cards, overdrafts and other forms of consumer credit will come as a huge relief for the many thousands of households struggling to keep up with credit repayments during this pandemic.But unless further long-term support measures are put in place, this relief will be short-lived.Our own research has found that 4.2 million people have borrowed to make ends meet since lockdown began, storing up a tsunami of £6 billion of debt that is set to worsen if left unchecked.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

For those that can’t figure out the puzzles for themselves, all 15 combinations are listed at the bottom of the article.Inevitably, spoilers for the game follow...In the game’s opening chapter, this safe is found in the supermarket in Jackson. The clue is found on the desk next to the safe. Look behind you, and you will see a wall with pictures of “Employees of the Month” – there should be one that stands out.In Seattle, Day 1, you have the option of exploring the Bank with Ellie in the Downtown area (located at 5th and James). You can find a note detailing the plans for a failed bank heist, which also provides the combination for the safe room. Travel through the safety deposit box room  – found at the end of the tills – and the vault should be on your left.What does The Last of Us Part II’s LGBT representation mean for games?Ellie finds this easily missable safe after going through the fence Downtown at Madison between 5th and 6th during Seattle Day 1. The combination is the same as the code used to open West Gate 2 – so check the list of gate codes that should be in your inventory.The fourth safe is found in the courthouse in Seattle Day 1. It’s located under a desk by the window before you travel into the car park. The skeletal remains of a FEDRA soldier are nearby. There’s a white board nearby with the combination written on.In the Capitol Hill segment of Seattle Day 1, you encounter this safe around the time you start seeing explosive tripwires, in a thrift shop that’s by a gym. The safe is placed right at the back, and requires solving two clues to open – the first, on the bulliten board, which leads you to the second, which is written on the walls of the thrift shop’s toilets.The final safe in Seattle Day 1 is located in a breakroom in the area where you first fight Shamblers. The clue is written on a note left on a table, which points you towards a can of soda. Smash open a vending machine, and you will find part of the answer. Tap the numbers into the lock, and you will gain access to the employee locker room.At the beginning of Seattle Day 2, you need to find a tattoo parlour, located near the bike shop. Go through the parlour, and there is a small building in the back with a dumpster propped against the door. The safe is inside you can find the combination written on a note in one of the nearby buildings. Beware though – there are infected inside too.The Last of Us Part II is a bleak and beautiful triumph – reviewLater in Seattle Day 2, when you’re en route to the hospital and walking down Route 5, you’ll reach a gate you can’t open, requiring you to use a dumpster to prop up the gate. Before doing so, however, look for a nearby apartment with a truck parked outside that you can climb to enter through the second floor. Once in, you’ll find a note telling you that the safe code corresponds to a wedding anniversary. It’s written on a calendar nearby – count back 30 years from the circled date.This safe is also found during Seattle Day 2. After travelling through the Merci building, you drop into a pool and emerge on the other side of the road. Go into Weston’s pharmacy – the note containing the full code is found on your way in.During Seattle Day 3, Ellie acquires a speedboat. After travelling a short distance, you’ll reach a point where a gate blocks your progress, and you have to leave the boat to open it. There’s a caged area in your immediate proximity containing the safe – climb up to the upper level and search one of the dead bodies for a note that discloses the combination. Shift the cart away from the wall to reveal a hole, which leads you into the cage.During Abby’s Seattle Day 1, you pass by a hardware store. After going through it and the boat repair shop, you come across a trailer. Break a window, go inside, and there’s a WLF gun cache note with the combination on it. The safe itself is then stored in a nearby building, which you can enter through a hole in the wall, around the left side.In Abby’s section of the game, you come across a row of shops, including a bakery and the Red Dragon Bar, and what looks like an antiques shop. Travel through the bar up to the second floor, and jump across into the opposite building. There’s a note on the second floor that tells you the combination to the safe – which is kept in the bakery opposite.Naughty Dog boss says The Last of Us Part 3 could be next projectThe final safe in Abby’s Seattle Day 1 is found on the crashed ship, at the back of the boat. The combination clue is written on the mutiny note.After climbing the rapids and crossing the highway overpass in Abby’s Day 2, you jump down into an apartment, which contains the safe and notes left between two of the building’s neighbours. Look at the apartment numbers on the doors in the hallway to determine the combination, as per the note’s instructions.The last safe is located in the skyscraper in Abby’s Seattle Day 2, which you must travel down on your way to the hospital. Search the storage room next to the gym entrance, before the spore-filled area. A clue for the combination is written on an artefact inside the back room – the code is the same as the Wi-fi password, which is written near the juice bar.All the combinations:The Last of Us Part 2\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It tried to find out both the minimum number of people that would have to live on the planet as well as the way of life they would have to pursue if their life there was to be self-sustaining.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHe found that 110 would be the minimum number of iniduals required, although having more people would change the calculations.He also noted that the success of those people would depend on a range of factors, including how well they would be able to work together and share their time and resources.Professor Salotti noted that the question was largely theoretical at the moment, but could have considerable effects for the future of humanity. Life on Earth could one day be threatened by “some cataclysmic event”, he noted, and it would be possible that the only way humanity would survive would be to head to Mars or some other planet.Some companies, including SpaceX, have attempted to build ways to ensure this could happen, with rockets made to carry people on the long journey to Mars. But any attempt to do so will inevitably be limited in the number of people that it can take, which Prof Salotti noted will lead people to make important calculations about the minimum number of people that could survive there and create enough resources and tools to allow their life to become self-sustaining.The research attempted to understand the work the people would have to do to make that possible, and how much time they would have to do that work. The number of 110 people is the minimum number who would be able to do that work, Prof Salotti found.The study – Minimum Number of Settlers for Survival on Another Planet – is published in Scientific Reports this week.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.After 42 years as the nation’s most-read newspaper, the Sun has been knocked off the top spot for circulation by the Daily Mail, according to the latest available figures.Launched in 1964 the red-top has dominated the print media landscape throughout the last four decades - serving as the archetypal tabloid newspaper and an extension of Rupert Murdoch’s media empire.However amid declining print sales across the sector and the impacts of the coronavirus, the paper has been overtaken by the Mail for the first time since 1970.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAccording to figures reported by industry publication Press Gazette, the daily edition of the Mail reported sales of 980,000 per day in May - a reduction of 17 per cent year on year. Paul Dacre pens astonishing attack on his Mail successor Geordie GreigAnd while the Sun recently stopped publishing its figures, the Mail is understood to have seen evidence of its new position as the nation’s most read paper. The Murdoch publication’s last report in March put its daily sales at 1,210,915 to the Mail’s 1,132,908.The Mail’s editor Geordie Grieg, who took on the publication from Paul Dacre last year, said he was “humbled that our readers have backed us so magnificently and loyally by buying the paper to make us Britain’s bestselling paper.”He added: “I am immensely proud and delighted  that the Daily Mail has  become Britain’s biggest-selling newspaper, an historic moment in our history.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Retail sales jumped 12 per cent in May after record lows in April as lockdown restrictions eased and some shops began to reopen, official figures show.Sales remained 13.1 per cent below levels seen in February before the coronavirus pandemic hit, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).Non-food stores enjoyed the biggest gains as DIY chains, including B\u0026ampQ, reopened their doors after closing to implement social distancing measures such as changing layouts and placing markings on floors.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWhile some garden centres and hardware stores were able to start trading again from mid-May, many other sectors, such as clothing, were restricted to selling online. Online sales surged from 30.8 per cent of all retail sales in April to 33.4 per cent in May.

Retailers are reliant on a continued improvement in sales after thousands of non-essential shops across the country began to reopen this week. With numbers of customers strictly limited, queues formed outside some stores on Monday.A number of big retailers are opening stores in phases as they assess the effectiveness of safety measures, as well as the profitability of different sites in a socially distanced environment.Concerns remain that relaxing restrictions will lead to a rise in infections, forcing shops to close again. That scenario could prove disastrous for high street retailers, many of which are already facing difficult financial circumstances.Tom Leman, head of retail at law firm Pinsent Masons, said: “It’s been a big week for retailers with the reopening of many stores across the country and reports of long queues as consumers eagerly return to physical shops. “However, today’s figures are a clear reminder of the challenges facing the sector as they look to make up on the financial impact of store closure. It is crucial that, as retailers strive to regain lost revenue, they balance the health and safety of consumers alongside a great retail experience.”Office for National Statistics\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To take a photo, the camera needs to a small aperture and an extremely short shutter speed.Digital camera maker Nikon recommends using an aperture of between f8 and f16, and a shutter speed from 14000 second to 130 second.The totality phase of the eclipse will only be visible for a fraction of a second, however the full process of the Moon passing in front of the Sun will take several minutes.Created with Sketch.

Currently, it is only available to iOS users, but is expected to eventually come to Android users too.Tapping the button to compose a tweet will shows a new button with a wavelength icon. Hitting it pops up a record button, which will capture 140 seconds of audio.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHowever, many users pointed out that these kind of tweets could not be accessed by deaf people.Other social platforms, including YouTube, Zoom, Snapchat, and Facebook videos all have captioning.Journalist Liam O’Dell tweeted: “It\u0027s one thing getting Twitter users to caption their videos, asking them to caption audio tweets just makes the social media platform even more inaccessible to #deaf people like me.”Some users suggested providing subtitles, or alternative text, so that it could be more accessible.In a thread, the company apologised for treating accessibility as an “afterthought”.Instagram to overtake Twitter for news, report finds“We\u0027re sorry about testing voice Tweets without support for people who are visually impaired, deaf, or hard of hearing. It was a miss to introduce this experiment without this support” the company said.“We’ve fixed several issues related to vision accessibility, including making voice Tweets identifiable on the timeline and making accessibility improvements to the voice Tweet experience. These updates will be available in a forthcoming iOS release”“We’re already exploring ideas for how we could support manual and auto transcriptions. We’re also looking at how we can build a dedicated group to focus on accessibility, tooling, and advocacy across all products”It was also revealed that Twitter does not have a dedicated accessibility group. The company, which made 3.46 billion dollars in 2019, relies on employees volunteering rather than a formal team, according to Twitter software engineer Andrew Hayward.“The volunteers behind accessibility at Twitter (there is no formal team) strive to do their best to ensure products are shipped appropriately. Unfortunately though, we aren\u0027t aware of every product decision, and the wider #a11y conversation is ongoing.” he tweeted.Twitter’s head of design and research Dantley Davis said that he would advocate for accessability to be a part of project design from the beginning of all projects in future.“I appreciate the feedback and direct conversation about #a11y from our passionate community” It\u0027s clear we have a lot of work ahead to make Twitter more inclusive for people with disabilities.

Two of the stores – in Ross-on-Wye and Leominster – reopened on Monday 15 June.“Being able to shop in person, especially at smaller independents, is a joy,” owner Andy Rossiter, pictured above, says. “I think lockdown made a lot of people realise that they don’t want all their shopping to just land at their door, but booksellers also know they need to work hard for their audience. It’s not simply a case of just opening your doors.”Rossiter has been busy preparing the stores, moving fixtures and checkouts so that staff and customers can socially distance while browsing for books.Carry out a risk assessment: employers will need to carry out Covid-19 risk assessments in consultation with their workers or trade unions.Maintain social distancing: employers should redesign workspaces to maintain social distancing between people and stagger start times.Manage transmission risk:\u0026nbspemployers should look into putting barriers in shared spaces, creating workplace shift patterns or fixed teams.Reinforcing cleaning processes: workplaces should be cleaned more frequently, paying close attention to\u0026nbspdoor handles and keyboards.“We have installed Perspex screens at till points, bought hand sanitiser stations for the entrances to our stores and placed tape and signage throughout so we can clearly indicate the social distancing rules within our stores,” he says.The bookshops have reopened with less members of staff and they have limited their opening hours from their pre-lockdown seven days to just five. Rossiter has also been consulting staff and getting their input on the UK Government’s coronavirus advice.“Our trade body, the Booksellers Association, has been brilliant at reading and interpreting this advice to make it bookshop-specific and releasing it in digestible and accessible weekly bulletins, he says.“Booksellers love serving customers, and we’ve been serving our local community for a decade, so seeing those regulars again and having that relationship start to return to normal will be fantastic.Surinder Josan, owner of All Seasons DIY, a family-run shop, explains how he has used strict safe workplace measures to keep his shop doors open and his businesses afloat.“All Seasons DIY is a family-run shop which was established over 40 years ago, run by myself, my wife, and my mother. My son and daughter work in the shop around their university studies as well,” Josan, below, says.The family decided to shut the shop when school closures were announced. But after just a week they decided to reopen the business in order to serve the local community, who relied on the store for essential food and other items.“In order to reopen, we had to reassess how we both serve and interact with our customers,” Josan explains. “We adopted several new measures to comply with social distancing to keep both ourselves and our customers safe.”These new measures they adopted included safe distance markers outside the shop, to limit the number of people in store at any one time, installing screens at the checkout areas, encouraging contactless payments, lowering the minimum card spend to £1, and offering hand wipes to customers.“The number of customers who have come in and complimented us for it is unbelievable. They say when they come here they feel really safe,” Josan adds.Blend Coffee Co is an independent coffee shop based in Portslade, East Sussex, near Brighton. The two directors behind the business, Oli Crawley and Tom Jennion, have introduced a range of measures so they could confidently reopen for staff and customers.“Our primary concern is to keep people safe, so to make sure our coffee shop was ready to be reopened we implemented a number of safer working measures,” says Crawley.These new measures included a deep clean of the shop prior to reopening, implementation of a new ordering layout and adopting a new policy which stipulates that no customers are allowed inside the store.Working alongside Crawley and Jennion are a further three members of staff.“Only the directors returned to work to alleviate any pressure on our barista team feeling they need to work,” says Crawley. “This also allows an operational analysis of all our new protocols to ensure they are efficient and safe.”The checkout system has now been moved to the front of the shop, Blend now only accepts card payments and there is a new waiting area outside the shop.This plan was developed after we undertook a risk assessment and analysis of the premises to ensure that customer-staff interaction could be maintained and sustained in a safe manner. We ran a test prior to reopening to ensure that our new measures would work and allow us and our customers to stay safe,” adds Crawley.For further information from the UK Government on how employers, employees and the self-employed can return to work safely, click hereThis is Government advice for EnglandWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Unfortunately, not long after her return, jobs began to get cancelled because of the intensifying Covid-19 crisis.She started looking for something else right away – and is currently living and working on New Moor Farm in Southminster, Essex, working with asparagus, having swapped fashion for food.Though a far cry from a usual career, Philip is enjoying her new setting. “Right now, I live on site on the farm, in one of the caravans in the orchard. It’s nice,” she explains. “The community is amazing. There are so many different characters on the farm. Everyone is really friendly and we’re all here for the same reasons: to help and to work.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHer day-to-day routine varies. “Most days I’m up at five, start working at six on the farm, in the packhouse,” she says. “Generally, I’m doing a little bit of everything, so I’m helping on the line, bundling, helping customers, grading – just helping out wherever I can.”Philip is among Brits across the country working on farms in order to help the industry continue despite the many obstacles presented by the Covid-19 pandemic.The temporary closure of much of the food and hospitality industry has left huge quantities of fresh produce at risk of going to waste. The pubs and restaurants that would usually purchase large amounts of vegetables remain shut and travel restrictions have prevented pickers from overseas working on the farms.Join the Pick For BritainThat’s why the Government is urging fit and healthy people looking for work across the country to get involved. The Pick For Britain initiative is helping to bring workers and employers together to ensure the farming industry can continue.From furloughed employees whose contracts allow them to work during this time, to university students on their summer breaks, it’s a great opportunity to earn money and meet new people – while helping Britain’s food industry during these unprecedented times.The growing season is only just getting started, so from now until September, bringing in the harvest requires a major effort. Visit pickforbritain.org.uk to find out moreEat seasonal and local vegBut that’s not the only way to support the industry right now. Simply eating more in-season local produce will help to prevent wastage.A wide range of vegetables are currently being harvested in the UK. These include asparagus, cucumbers, mushrooms, courgettes, spinach, summer squash, radishes, beetroot and tomatoes – and buying and cooking with this seasonal veg is a great way to contribute to the farming industry.​In need of some recipe inspo?

You can get involved too: share your recipes using #SeasonalVeg on social mediaTry different types of fishSimilarly, the UK\u0027s fishing industry has suffered during the current coronavirus pandemic.While higher-end produce is currently not being purchased by restaurants, much of the catch from UK waters that would usually be exported hasn’t been, so boats across the country have struggled to sell their fish and seafood. That’s why there\u0027s never been a better time to try something new.Among the wide range of different species found in UK waters are mussels, crab, mackerel, herring, rainbow trout, hake and coley (or saithe).

All the famous faces, including a picture of Sir Peter, are “fans” of the Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group.Each fragment will be signed by the artist and auctioned on Bidsquare, with bids starting at £325. The auction will be live until midnight on 26 June.The idea originated when London Advertising approached Sir Peter about the project as it wanted to use the mural to raise money for organisations helping people during the pandemic.Sir Peter, who also designed artwork for Paul Weller, Ian Dury and The Who, said: “I’m very happy that the Mandarin Oriental mural can be used a second time to raise money for such a wonderful purpose.

But organisers stepped up after the lockdown began and started providing 5,000 meals a week to families in Poplar struggling to afford or access food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesDizzee volunteered as part of his work with Kitchen Social – the Mayor’s Fund for London programme providing food for children across the capital during the school holidays. “I was given an amazing opportunity to visit and help out Kitchen Social at Bygrove Primary School in Poplar, who are providing free food, books and school equipment to kids in the local area where I grew up,” he said.“Thank you to all the amazing people I met and thanks to the Mayor’s Fund for London for connecting the dots.”How to support our campaignBygrove Primary School is also receiving vital supplies from The Independent’s Help the Hungry campaign appeal partner The Felix Project.The food surplus charity, which delivers to hundreds of food banks and community projects across London, began helping the school at the start of the crisis by dropping off one or two trays of fresh produce and staple items each week.The charity has since increased the supply from one or two trays of food each week to 40 trays to help organisers cope with the huge demand.Mark Causton, manager of the school’s initiative, said: “The Felix Project have been an immense help – I can’t praise them enough. We know we’ll need to carry on this work right through the summer, so we rely on all the fresh food they’re supplying.”Mr Causton added: “We’ve seen a lot of parents furloughed or losing work over the past couple of months. In the case of some families struggling to afford to buy shopping, this is one of their only sources of getting food for their children.“It was really great to have Dizzee Rascal here helping out. He got stuck in, and got on so well with all the volunteers and all the families. It was just nice to see a smile on a lot of people’s faces.”The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis – find out how you can help here.

Figures from the Independent Food Aid Network (IFAN) show a 175 per cent rise, with both charities reporting this their “busiest period ever”. Furthermore, a survey by the giving platform Neighbourly of 900 charities and community groups providing food to the vulnerable found that 70 per cent expect the situation to get even worse in the next six to 12 months.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Independent proprietor Evgeny Lebedev paid special tribute to the almost 6,000 ordinary iniduals who have dug deep to contribute to our appeal. He said: “Time and time again Londoners have shown that they are capable of immense generosity and community spirit in this period of crisis.“To all those that donated, bought and bid — I salute you.”Morgan Stanley said the bank and its employees in London had made the donation as part of their global Covid-19 response.How to support our campaignClare Woodman, head of Morgan Stanley EMEA, said: “The Felix Project plays a vital role in distributing food to people in need, especially those severely impacted by the pandemic. I am proud our employees in London are supporting them as part of our Covid-19 Hunger Relief Campaign.”Another substantial donor was Partners Capital investment group, which donated £95,287.John Collis, head of Partners Capital, Europe, said they “selected The Felix Project as one of our charities to support during this difficult period as it is one of the most impactful charities in London today”.Heads down for quiz nightThe original Top Gear trio — Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May — will tonight host a special Zoom quiz in aid of our appeal partner, The Felix Project. Participants in the Quintessentially Foundation’s “World’s Greatest Quiz Night” will face five rounds of questions devised by Nicholas Shearing, questions producer for top British TV quiz shows Pointless, Debatable and Impossible. May, who has driven Felix vans delivering food to vulnerable Londoners throughout lockdown, said: “At least in this stay-at-home pub quiz version, it will be easy to cheat.” 7.30-9pm. Tickets £10: thefelixproject.orggreatestquizOur appeal was also boosted by the silent auction, in partnership with Quintessentially Foundation, which closed this week with 135 bids placed for 36 lots and raising almost £40,000.The most highly prized lots were two tickets to a Liverpool FC game, four tickets to the Euro 2021 semi-finals, a video-chat with Spurs coach Jose Mourinho, a private guitar lesson with singer-songwriter Ellie Goulding and a helicopter lesson.The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis – find out how you can help here.

After paying rent and all her bills from the universal credit she receives at the beginning of the month, she now finds she has just £4.30 left over for food and nappies for the rest of the month.How to support our campaignSo she is almost entirely dependent on school vouchers available for her oldest two children (£15 per child per week) to buy absolute essentials, and one weekly food package dropped off by the Sufra food bank.“I don’t mind going hungry sometimes, so long as my kids have food,” said Ms Sarri-Gonzalez. “Sometimes I might have just one main meal for myself in a day. There was one point during lockdown I didn’t manage to eat anything for myself for two days, almost three days. But I always set the table for the children – I keep things as normal as possible for them.”“It’s so difficult at the moment. So stressful. I’m hoping when the kids go back to school later in the year I can go back to work and make things easier somehow.”The Independent’s Help the Hungry campaign appeal partner The Felix Project has quadrupled the volume of surplus food it gets out to people in need since the crisis began.The work remains as urgent than ever. The most recent YouGov poll for the Food Foundation charity shows over 1.5 million people in households with children have been unable to access food for economic reasons during the lockdown.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Watching parents struggle to put food on the table and go without food themselves is devastating.”Rebecca Archer and her partner – who have three girls aged eight, six and three at home in London’s High Barnet – have found it difficult to afford enough food during lockdown. “The shopping I do is costing a lot more with them at home all the time,” she said.Once the bills are paid and the main weekly shop is done on a Monday, the couple finds they have about £50 left to get through the week – about half the amount they usually had before the pandemic hit.The family has recently taken advantage of two £15-a-week school vouchers they get for their two oldest girls, and receive some cooked meals from their neighbour Katie-Louise Barber – a volunteer delivering food using The Felix Project’s supplies.“It’s been a real strain. Thinking and worrying about money all the time isn’t easy,” said Ms Archer. “I never thought I’d be worrying about having enough for the children to eat. There was one point we just didn’t have enough for the pre-paid gas meter, so we had to go without that for more than a week.”The Trussell Trust, which runs the country’s biggest network of food banks, has warned food charities cannot cope “indefinitely” with the huge spike in demand for help caused by the pandemic.A coalition of anti-poverty charities had written to the chancellor asking for an emergency income support scheme that would increase child benefits and end the five-week wait for initial universal credit payments.Anthony Cotterill, leader of the Salvation Army in the UK, warned: “It’s years since we have seen poverty to be such a real and present danger for so many people. We are approaching a poverty tipping point.”The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis. Find out how you can help here.

Viruferrin has been scientifically proven to block 98 per cent of similar viruses to Covid-19, including influenza and Sars.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe snood-like coverings can be worn for up to 50 hours before they need washing, and their effectiveness only drops to 96 per cent after over 200 hours of wear.The face coverings are cut and sewn together by Cookson \u0026amp Clegg in Blackburn, which is run by Patrick Grant, star of the Great British Sewing Bee. He is also behind a campaign to get Britons making their own coverings, The Great Community Sew.How to support our campaignThe coverings, which retail at £20, are different to medical grade PPE used by NHS workers. However, due to the protein coverings they are more effective than standard face masks at protecting wearers from viruses.There was a buzz at the Royal Park Felix Project depot when boxes of Virustatic Shield coverings arrived.David Clark, who has been volunteering for three years, said: “I think it is important to wear these face coverings when you’re delivering to members of the public who potentially come into contact with vulnerable people.”Mr Clark dropped off some coverings to Ian Breen, centre manager at Acton Homeless Concern, which serves hot meals five days a week to those in temporary accommodation or on the streets. Mr Breen said: “It is fantastic to have a delivery of some masks for free. It is important to protect those working here and the people who use our centre.”Gretchen Fisher, from Ealing, who has been volunteering for four years, added: “I wear them whenever I go out as you have to protect others.” Mantas Keblis, the depot manager, said that having “extra precautions” would help food reach more people in London. “Everyone really likes them. They are very comfortable to wear.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And today, because of the enormous generosity of Virustatic Shield, whose innovative anti-viral snoods we’ve also been producing, 10,000 of London’s most vulnerable people will receive a vital face covering, delivered to them via The Independent’s fantastic campaign.Which star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day It is now mandatory to wear face coverings on public transport, but these coverings are in short supply.That’s why we started The Big Community Sew to encourage people to make face coverings for their friends and neighbours, and by doing so preserve vital supplies of PPE for NHS workers and care home staff who are fighting this virus on the frontline.The science behind face coverings is simple: they help prevent the wearer from unwittingly spreading the disease. So put simply, if I wear one I protect you, if you wear one you protect me.Patrick Grant is a star of television’s ‘Great British Sewing Bee’The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis – find out how you can help here.

Ms Hopkins, who has been repeatedly retweeted by US president Donald Trump, gained more than 1.1 million followers on the site before her suspension, which came hours after she had complained she had lost her blue tick “verified” status.In a statement a spokesperson for the social media firm said: “Keeping Twitter safe is a top priority for us – abuse and hateful conduct have no place on our service and we will continue to take action when our rules are broken.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“In this case, the account has been permanently suspended for violations of our Hateful Conduct policy”.A previous contestant on reality show The Apprentice, Ms Hopkins forged a career as a commentator at a number of media outlets – many of which she would leave amid outcry over her views on immigration and Islam.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Bianca Walkden during a training session at the National Taekwondo Centre in ManchesterFrench President Emmanuel Macron gestures about social distancing alongside Prime Minister Boris Johnson as he arrives at Downing Street for a meeting.

Trump video attacking CNN labelled ‘manipulated media’ by TwitterHowever she has repeatedly seen her profile boosted by the man at the helm of the world’s leading superpower. Donald Trump, also formerly of The Apprentice, has shared a number of posts from Ms Hopkins including attacks on London mayor Sadiq Khan.Twitter, along with sites like Facebook and YouTube, has attempted to de-platform a number of far right figures in recent years including Mr Robinson and those behind groups like Britain First. In response many have taken to fringe sites with a focus on free speech including Telegram and Russian social media site VK – operating with a diminished audience while still able to disseminate their messages.However social media giants have faced ongoing criticism for being slow to respond to those spreading hate on their platforms.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It was being stressed that decisions on the further easing of measures were yet to be made, but the PM said the lowering of the alert level from four to three allows ministers to “start making some progress” on social-distancing measures. And he promised new guidance for the hospitality sector and businesses “very shortly”.The downgrading – recommended by the Joint Biosecurity Centre (JBC) – means transmission of coronavirus is no longer considered to be “high or rising exponentially”. Localised outbreaks of Covid-19 are still “likely” to occur, the advisers warned, and the virus remains in general circulation.Mr Johnson also told the public on Friday to “watch this space” when asked whether the distance restriction could be reduced to help schools in England return in autumn. He has been under significant pressure from Conservatives to relax the distance and on Friday night former business secretary Greg Clark said evidence from other nations is “lower social distancing has worked”.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Education secretary Gavin Williamson suggested that primary school class sizes of 15, known as “bubbles”, could be expanded back to their normal size to allow more children back in the classroom.At the Downing Street daily briefing, Mr Williamson said he wanted all year groups to return to school “full-time” in September, adding that further guidance on safety measures will be published in the next two weeks. In Wales, First Minister Mark Drakeford was planning to end its five-mile restriction on travel next month and allow holidaymakers to return a week later. And in Northern Ireland, most pupils are set for a return to education in the autumn after ministers agreed to cut the social distancing measure to one metre.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

He added that it was time for legislative action and not another review.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe UK already has one of the most comprehensive centralised databases related to race and ethnicity in the form of its “Ethnicity facts and figures” service. It is designed to provide information about “the different experiences of people from a variety of ethnic backgrounds” and reveals some startling disparities between white people and Bame people living in the UK.Below are 11 charts that illustrate these different experiences.Stop-and-search powers have been heavily scrutinised in recent years and were the subject of a review by the Equality and Human Rights Commission in 2010 that found that black people were up to six-times more likely to be stopped by police than white people.Stop-and-search rates between 2018 and 2019 show that black people are now nearly 10-times more likely to be stopped and searched by police than white people. This has contributed to far higher arrest rates for black people than for white people.Not a single police force in England or Wales registered an arrest rate of less than 20 for every 1,000 black people.By contrast, not a single police force in England and Wales registered an arrest rate of more than 20 for every 1,000 white people.Disproportionate policing practices were also highlighted in a recent investigation into coronavirus lockdown enforcement across England and Wales.Freedom of Information (FOI) requests by advocacy group Liberty found that police forces were seven times more likely to fine Bame people during lockdown.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailFurther imbalance can be seen when it comes to home ownership and renting. Around 63 per cent of households in the UK live in homes that they own, according to figures from the English Housing Survey.When these households are broken down into ethnicity, however, a stark difference emerges.White British people have higher than average home ownership rates ⁠— nearly double that of black Caribbean people and more than treble that of black African people. These minorities are instead vastly over represented when it comes to private renting and social housing.Only Indian households, which make up just 2.5 per cent of the population of England and Wales according to the 2011 Census, have higher home ownership rates the white British households.The lack of home ownership among minority communities in the UK may contribute to a reduced feeling of belonging compared to white people.Results from the most recent Community Life Survey found that black people are increasingly less likely to feel as though they belong to Britain compared to white or Asian people.A similar story of inequality can be seen when breaking down education statistics by ethnicity. It emerges as early as primary education, where white British children are 10 per cent more likely to achieve the expected standard in reading, writing and maths.By the time the two groups reach A-levels, white British students are more than three times as likely to achieve high grades than black Caribbean students, according to figures from the Department for Education.Worse education transfers to worse employment rates for minorities, with black people seeing at least double the unemployment levels as white people between 2004 and 2018.The UK’s Annual Population Survey revealed that black people in employment are also paid less on average than white people.Average hourly pay for black people hovered between £9.91 and £10.80 between 2013 and 2018, while white people saw wages consistently rise from £10.58 to £11.87. Only people from Indian backgrounds received better pay than white people.Systemic racism in the UK even manifests itself in the proportion of deaths from the coronavirus pandemic.Data reveals that people from Bame backgrounds are up to twice as likely to die from Covid-19 than people of whit British ethnicity.The risk of death for people of Bangladeshi ethnicity is twice as high as white British, while other Asian, black and Caribbean ethnicities are between 10 per cent and 50 per cent more likely to die, according to a report from Public Health England.Health experts say there is no evidence to suggest that people from Bame backgrounds are genetically predisposed to be more vulnerable to the virus than white people. The figures are therefore a result of existing social and racial inequalities.In his attack on the government’s plans for a racial equality commission, Lammy said the time for holding discussions and launching reviews was over.Nine charts that show extent of racial inequality in US“It feels that yet again in the UK we want figures, data, but we don’t want action,” he said.“Black people aren’t playing victim, as Boris indicated, they are protesting precisely because the time for review is over, and the time for action is now ... Get on with the action, legislate, move. You’re in government ⁠— do something.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It has four core beliefs: family, integrity, teamwork and success – all integral pillars of its Reconnection to Recovery and Resilience programme.Put together by Sharon Gray OBE and the federation’s head teachers, it’s designed to welcome pupils back to class after lockdown. “Everybody in the Embark community has done their bit,” says Gray, a headteacher for 20 years, mostly in special schools supporting youngsters experiencing social, emotional and mental health difficulties and schools going through challenges.“It’s been all hands on deck,” executive headteacher and Trust leader of Embark’s schools Matthew Crawford adds. “Even two weeks into lockdown we were thinking about our children returning to school, whatever date that may be.”Safety at school1. Anyone who is unwell or been in contact with somebody showing coronavirus symptoms should stay away from schools, colleges and childcare settings2. Hands should be cleaned more often than usual with soap and running water for at least 20 seconds and dried thoroughly. Alternatively, hand sanitiser or alcohol hand rub can be used3. Promote the ‘catch it, bin it, kill it’ approach to coughing and sneezing4. Clean frequently touched surfaces regularly using standard products, such as detergent and bleach5. Help to minimise contact and mixing by altering classroom layout and timetablesWith regards to physical changes that parents and pupils can expect to see in corridors and classrooms, Embark is working with Government guidance and undertaking a thorough, bespoke risk assessment for each of its schools. “It can’t be a one-size-fits all approach,” Crawford stresses.According to Anna Upton – head of the 240-pupil Chaucer Junior School in Ilkeston, Derbyshire – questionnaires were sent out to reconnect with parents, through which they could express concerns and suggest ideas about the return to classrooms.According to Upton, staggered breaks and how drop-offs will work were important issues that were flagged in questionnaires. “But the risk assessment the Trust has put in has allowed us to make a comprehensive plan and we can communicate that to the parents,” she explains.“What the Trust have done with the programme is to implement nine stages which support our schools to open as safely as possible, supporting the staff parents and the children. The risk assessment means that I, as a headteacher, can do what’s right for my school.”Chair of trustees Sarah Armitage emphasises the importance of teamwork based around a guiding principle: families first. We look after families, so we reach out we talk.” she says.“Then there’s teamwork. Let’s harness the power of the team so it’s not the headteacher sitting by themselves with all these things to think about – that load is shared.”Armitage’s back-to-school outlook is optimistic too: “We have created something with this programme that we hope will be massively beneficial. Our role as leaders is to keep that going, carry on putting emotional needs at the heart of everything we do, because then children are able to learn and benefit – and move through this crisis.”Information in this article applies to schools in England only.

However, it is vital that this is not misinterpreted as a green light for life to revert to normal, or for unnecessary risks to be taken. Level 3 still reflects that an epidemic is ongoing and that significant numbers of new infections and, sadly, deaths, are occurring every day. Moreover, many patients are suffering from the longer-term consequences of Covid-19.”Matt Keeling, professor of populations and disease at the University of Warwick, said the move was “expected and is justified by the current epidemiological situation”.  The shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, warned that now was not the time for complacency.“We are past the peak with, thankfully, hospitalisations and deaths coming down. But this virus remains deadly we have one of the highest numbers of excess deaths in the world and this is no time for complacency,” he said. “We still need more testing, including regular testing of NHS staff and a functional tracing regime in place.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.The two-metre social-distancing rule could be relaxed for classes of up to 30 pupils to allow the return of “every child in every school” to lessons in September, Gavin Williamson has indicated.The education secretary suggested that the “protective bubbles” already used to permit 15 primary pupils to mingle without social distancing could be increased in size in the autumn so that all schools in England can reopen without the need for additional teachers and buildings. New guidance can be expected within two weeks, he said.And Boris Johnson himself gave a strong hint that the two-metre restriction – already set to be reduced to one metre in Northern Irish schools – is on its way out, telling reporters to “watch this space”.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe bullish plan comes despite a warning from the prime minister’s scientific advisory group last month that opening primary and secondary schools risks creating “significant transmission networks” for coronavirus.The experts cautioned that overconfidence about the effectiveness of the NHS Test and Trace system – designed to prevent the spread of Covid-19 by isolating the contacts of those known to be infected – could “quickly” lead to an increase in the crucial R rate of transmission to as high as 1.7, risking a loss of control over the spread of the disease.Teaching unions have warned that schools will be unable to reopen fully under the two-metre rule due to shortages of classroom space and staff.Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?Neither Mr Johnson nor Mr Williamson would give a firm commitment to a return to the classroom for all primary and secondary children in September, describing it only as their intention.And the education secretary dodged the question of whether he expected returning students to be offered a full school week.Visiting a school in Hertfordshire on Friday, Mr Johnson said: “We will be putting in further changes as the science allows.“I think that’s what the public also wants to see, they want to see us working with the reality.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive updates on politics every morning by emailAmid growing pressure on the government following botched plans to return all primary school pupils to the classroom this month, the prime minister said it was “absolutely” his intention that children of all ages should be back on a five-day-a-week basis by the autumn.“Let me be very clear,” he said. “I want a world in which, as far as possible, provided we can make classrooms safe – and I think we can – I want every child, every pupil, every student, back in September. I’m sure we can get it done.”Speaking as the latest official figures recorded 173 new fatalities from Covid-19, bringing the total death toll to 42,461, Mr Johnson said the UK was “starting to make some real progress with test and trace, with treatments for the disease” and that he hoped people would be “much, much more confident” about sending their children to school by the autumn.With the government’s Joint Biosecurity Centre reducing the coronavirus alert level from 4 to 3 – signalling that transmission is no longer regarded as high or rising exponentially – Mr Johnson added: “We have to start thinking of a world in which we are less apprehensive about this disease.”However, minutes from a 21 May meeting of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), released on Friday, showed that experts regard the full reopening of schools as a potential route to a second spike of infections in the UK.Sage advised that “opening both primary and secondary schools had the potential to recreate significant transmission networks, which would have a large effect on the epidemic”.The summer holidays gave an opportunity to “unwind” the effects of reopening, said the paper, which also noted that the relatively young age profile of most parents and teachers reduced the level of risk.But it added that opening schools would require “a significant effort to ensure that environments are appropriate to minimise transmission (for example distancing and hygiene measures and ventilation)” and said that more work was needed to assess the risk to grandparents.Stressing the importance for school reopening of a successful test, trace and isolate (TTI) programme, Sage warned that “overestimating the effectiveness of TTI capacity could lead quickly to R returning to 1.7”.Mr Johnson’s chief medical and scientific advisers have repeatedly stressed that coronavirus can only be brought under control if R is kept below one, with the risk of exponential growth if it rises above this level.Layla Moran, Liberal Democrat education spokesperson and leadership contender, said: “This stark warning shows that ministers must ensure the track and trace system is working properly so that our schools can reopen safely.“It is deeply worrying that one in four people who test positive for coronavirus are currently being missed under the scheme.“The government must clarify what action is being taken to fix these flaws and reassure parents, teachers and communities across the country.”Protective bubbles have been used in three primary-school year groups since the start of this month to allow up to 15 children to be taught together without social distancing, with each mini-class having the same teacher and working in the same space at all times, and contact with other groups kept to a minimum.But attempts to get more children back to school for a month’s learning before the summer break foundered on the practical difficulties of applying this to whole schools.Setting out his plans at the daily Downing Street coronavirus briefing, Mr Williamson said: “We’ve been creating bubbles of children in the classroom, creating a protective environment for those children.“Currently that is at 15, what we would be looking at doing is expanding those bubbles to include the whole class.”Mr Williamson said the government wanted to bring “every child back, in every year group, in every school”. But when pressed, he did not confirm that this would mean a full five-day week for all pupils“We recognise there is still going to have to be protective measures put in place to make sure children are safe and make sure that teachers and all those who work in school are safe as well, and that is why we are going to be issuing further guidance in the next two weeks,” he added.The announcement came shortly after the Department for Education unveiled a £1bn “Covid catch-up plan” for personal tutoring and extra time in school for children at risk of falling behind because of missed lessons during lockdown.But the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, Geoff Barton, said schools and colleges were trying to prepare for September amid an “information black hole” from the government.“Everybody wants to see all children back in schools full-time from September,” he said.“In order for this to happen, the current government guidelines would need to change because it would not be possible to do this while limiting class sizes to 15. You would need twice as many classrooms, and twice as many teachers.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

In Vietnam, rats are caught in rice fields – some traders breed them in farms with other live animals.For years scientists have warned that the wildlife trade – including wet markets that sell live animals – can harbour infectious diseases such as coronaviruses.The origins of the current Covid-19 pandemic remain contested. However, experts suspect that the disease started in bats and was transferred to another animal before being passed on to humans.The study, published in the bioRxiv journal ahead of peer-review, found six known coronaviruses in samples taken from three southern provinces in Vietnam between 2013 and 2014.New York rats feel the pressure of city livingPositives increased significantly along the supply chain. Around 6 per cent of the rats tested on farms were found to harbour coronaviruses.

But given this country is facing its worst recession in decades, now is hardly the moment to be sinking taxpayer cash into overseas vanity projects with no possible benefit for Brits. If Boris is determined to stick to David Cameron’s pledge to splash . per cent of GDP on foreign aid, then let’s thank our lucky stars it will now be spent wisely.THREE cheers for Marcus Rashford, a magnicent role model who yesterday won his campaign to make sure Britain’s poorest kids get one square meal a day over the summer. We know it will have been tough for the PM to swallow his pride and U-turn. But it was the right thing to do:  parents struggling to feed their children need all the help they can get right now. And £million — the cost of extending free school meal vouchers during the holidays — is a drop in the ocean when you consider the overall cost of lockdown.We like Rashford’s style, too. How refreshing to see a celebrity using his fame to articulate a powerful argument with such authenticity. NEW unemployment figures make for grim reading. The number of people claiming  jobless benefits more than doubled to hit .million in May — the  highest level since . And because the furlough scheme is masking the true extent of the crisis, we fear the worst is yet to come. Scientists are trained to think about public health  in the narrowest sense.

The Government’s decision not to pay for the vouchers was mean-spirited and cheap.But you do wonder about a government which decides upon a policy — and then changes it as soon as a top footballer opens his mouth.Next week, Michael Gove decides to extend trade negotiations with the EU after an intervention by Harry Kane. And lockdown is lted completely when Kyle Walker says he wants to go to another house party.Still, Rashford was right and deserves credit. And he’s right, too, that the Government could go further in helping those of us who live in poverty. The pandemic has thrown the Government off course.It was bound to. But Boris and Co must remember why they were elected last December. They got a huge mandate from our country’s very poorest regions. The areas that usually support the Labour Party.That was partly because of Brexit, of course. And partly because the then Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn , was about as effective as a recently gassed badger.But it was also because Boris promised those former Labour heartlands what they wanted to hear.A closing of the ide between rich and poor, and between London and the rest of the country.Jobs, investment in new industries and transport infrastructure.He might think we’ve all forgotten. But we haven’t. The latest poll shows Labour only five points behind the Conservatives.The honeymoon is over.Boris could begin by increasing the minimum wage for people aged  and over. It is low wages, far more than unemployment, which is keeping people mired in poverty.It wouldn’t cost the Government very much at all. It would also provide a much-needed boost to the economy.An increase in free childcare from  hours per week to  hours would also enable those struggling to make ends meet to get out of the house and work for longer.Shortly after last December’s election, Boris turned up in the North East to give his thanks.He once again promised that the region would be rejuvenated.There’s been good news on some fronts — the Nissan plant at Sunderland, for example, won out over its rival in Barcelona. It will stay open, despite the loss of  jobs.But more needs to be done to attract industry to the North and the Midlands.So far as I can see, the Government has done nothing. OK, it’s had a few problems on its hands.But when this pandemic has passed, the Government will need to intervene to help our economy — the private sector alone cannot do it.And the place to start is away from London — in the places where the new breed of Tory voter lives.Marcus Rashford’s intervention was timely and needed. This Government needs to know the poor are watching and waiting. Waiting for action, waiting for the promises of last year to be delivered.THERE is a stupidity about the woke crowd, trying to ban everything, which defies belief.An old episode of Fawlty Towers was pulled. Because it had some disturbing and potentially offensive racial material in it.But as the star of it, John Cleese, tried patiently to explain – it was SATIRE.The character of Basil Fawlty was the subject of the humour. He was mocked for his idiocies. That’s why we laughed.The episode has now been reinstated – but the moron caravan has already moved on. Now they’ve got it in for Mahatma Gandhi. Racist! The bloke who fought for India’s liberation from British colonialism.Was he a racist  Yes, without much doubt. He took a pretty jaundiced view towards Africans. But the good he did easily outweighs the bad.And believe me, there isn’t a single person born before  who didn’t possess views which today’s society would consider offensive. Regarding race, or gender, or homosexuality. Not one.Why can these people not understand that the past was dferent  And that we judge its heroes in a dferent light There was a really nasty battle between the two sides, with many dead – the first time since .China continues to bully its neighbours and oppress its own people.In this battle, I know whose side I’m on.THE Government has not done much right recently.But at least Boris and Co are binning the Department for International Development.It is to be stripped of its status and merged with the Foreign Office.With any luck, this will mean we will not be giving away any more hard-earned taxpayers’ money to countries like India, which has its own space programme so is clearly not short of a bob or two.Or China – a nasty, totalitarian state and the second richest country in the world.In the last round of spending, we actually bunged money into a programme to help Chinese people improve their diets.Nope, not kidding.I wonderit mentioned anything about it maybe not being a great idea to eat bats Various studies have suggested these donations are worthless and often counter-productive.I think, right now, we need to spend money at home, no SCIENTISTS from Japan have predicted that within  years we will be able to understand what animals are thinking. We will be communicating with them.Uh-oh. Not sure that’s good. Imagine a chat with a wasp . . .“Hi, Mr Wasp. What you doing ”“I’m crawling up your window. What’s it to you  And it’s Ms Wasp, as it happens. I’ve transitioned. So don’t misgender me. Now, p*** off before I sting you on the neck.”Worse with cats. “LOVE you  WTF, I’ve never even liked you. You’re mugs, humans. Just put the food out and give me a warm place to sleep and I’ll purr for a bit to keep you happy. Now, excuse me. I’m going to sleep on the roof of the shed for six hours.”But I might start watching it now as the cast all seem to hate each other.The soap has been torn apart by rows over the Black Lives Matter debate.Lysette Anthony has taken loads of flack and her co-star Rachel Adedeji has described her as “actual trash”.Hmm . . . somehow I suspect the show will not be anywhere near as interesting as the row.NOT everything about lockdown has been bad. Far from it.My we hasn’t been to TK Maxx for three months, for a start. There’s a mercy.And we’re not using cash. There’s little indication we will need to use cash ever again.Those people who aren’t on the breadline have saved money.And then there’s offices. Will we really go back to that awful daily commute, when the vast majority of jobs can, these days, be done at home  Just think how many homes we could createwe converted all those empty offices into flats.Offices were created because we needed a place to store paper files. Don’t really need that now, do we The Government should encourage firms to move to home-working, when – the stats suggest – employees are a lot more productive.IN France – a country almost as badly hit by Covid- as the UK – the schools will be reopening on Monday. By law, no arguments. Full curriculum.Over here, meanwhile, there are suggestions that some schools will not be opening until JANUARY and will not open properly for a year. Incredible.The Government needs to get a grip of this right now, as I argued last week.Call the bluff of the horrible trade unions and get our kids back to school.

It’s just easier than trying to do the school work.“It’s a way of escaping from everything.“I’m worried the teachers will be disappointed in me because I haven’t done enough work.“I’m worried I’ll fall behind and have to resit the year when all my friends go on.”And he is not alone. A study by University College London revealed that two million children have done barely any schoolwork at home.Since March, around  per cent of pupils have done none, or less than an hour, a day. And just  per cent put in more than four hours a day.Finn’s mum Kerrie, , a former secondary school teacher, admits she only ever sees her son at meal times.The single mum, who also has daughters Imogen, , and six-year-old Elodie, has found it hard to juggle home-schooling with working full-time as a social worker.She says: “When lockdown started I thought I’d be able to manage, especially because I used to be a teacher.“I was really motivated and ordered lots of stuff on Amazon to help. I think because the kids could see I was motivated it rubbed off on them.“But as time has gone on it’s become more dficult and challenging. I can’t give  per cent to my job and  per cent to teaching my kids. It’s just not possible.”Now Finn usually gets up around .am, has breakfast then switches on his games console — and stays up until midnight.Kerrie says: “I tried to get Finn to do schoolwork. With not enough computers for me and the kids to work, I even set written work for him.“But I couldn’t make him do it, no matter how much I encouraged him.” As we report today, more than , child health experts have signed an open letter to Boris Johnson demanding the Government publishes a clear plan to get all youngsters back to school as soon as possible or “risk scarring the le chances of a generation of young people”.The letter, organised by the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, warns children are “suffering enormously” from a lack of access to exercise, vaccinations and mental health support.m have done under an hour’s work a day, experts warn PM it will ‘scar a generation’This is par­ti­cu­larly concern­ing for Clare Cashion, , when it comes to -year-old daughter Libby.Clare, a civil servant from Worcester, who is also mum to Ollie, , Lochlan, four, and two-year-old Cullann, says: “Libby has gone from being a  hardworking student to a changed character, so I do worry about her wellbeing.”Libby now stays awake until am and usually gets up at about lunchtime. Instead of doing schoolwork, she spends most of her time talking to friends on social media.She says: “At first we didn’t know what we were supposed to be doing, and because there wasn’t proper work or anyone to check your work and because you can’t just ask questions, I didn’t want to do it.“When I did do it, I didn’t get any feedback, and then my friends would tell me they hadn’t bothered, so I just thought, ‘What’s the point ’.“I’m a huge worrier and I am concerned about falling behind, but I’d rather stay up and talk to friends on my phone. That’s when everyone is online.“Mum tries to make me do more schoolwork but it doesn’t work. There just doesn’t seem much point at the moment. “I’d just like to go back to school.”In a report last month, government advisory body Sage warned lockdown had caused a “shock” to kids that will last the rest of their lives and affect work opportunities.The report also confirmed the risk of children catching coronavirus was “much lower” than adults.Yesterday, MPs on the Education Select Committee accused teaching unions of running a “disgraceful political campaign” to keep classrooms closed by “cherry picking” evidence to make parents fear schools are “death traps”.Chairman Robert Halfon asked: “Can you explain why parents and children can have access to Primark over the coming weeks and months but not to schools ”For Libby and Clare, it will be a big relief when schools can reopen. Clare says: “School has now started online lessons, so one week they’ll be live, and  Libby has taken part in some, but the following week it’s just emails and sometimes they have to cancel.“I think Libby struggles with not knowing exactly what’s expected.”Finn is just as desperate to get back in the classroom.He said: “I really want to go back to school because it’s a lot easier to learn in a classroom with a teacher explaining the work, and I miss my independence.“I’ve found it really dficult being at home this long.”To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Teachers will head back to schools for the original target date - August  - to get classrooms ready for students. The guidance has a day one focus that concentrates on social distancing and hygiene considerations within school settings, Mr Weir wrote. The letter said: The Northern Ireland Executive has agreed that the current social distancing guidance of m must continue to be followed between all adults within the education sector, but that a distance of m is safe and appropriate between children and young people.Using protective bubbles has been supported by the Department of Health and PHA, and flexing their use to m will allow full classes to attend.The m guidance between children is to be followed as far as possible within the confines of the physical capacity of each classroom and the m rule for staff adhered to fully.To facilitate these arrangements, schools will be opening in week commencing  August for preparation purposes, he said.Health Secretary Matt Hancock said this evening the Department for Education was looking at a relaxation for the rule in England. He said: We are working on what is needed to get all schools open in September.I do get the interaction between  metre rule and getting people back to school.But the  metre rule is itself a social distancing measure, so removing it has an impact in terms of the transmission of the disease. So we have to make sure in that review...the virus is under control enough to make the change and to replace the  metre rule,that is the conclusion, with something that makes it easier to do, for instance, getting people back to school.Northern Ireland has now dropped guidance for people who were shielding because the threat of becoming severely ill from the virus was so high. Health Minister Robin Swann said people should still be cautious when out and about and follow strict social distancing.The news comes as: Children in reception, year one and year six are currently back in schools in England, with all students expected to be back in classrooms by September.Boris Johnson announced a full review into the metre rule in England earlier this week, as hospitality industry leaders piled pressure on the PM to relax the rule. Downing Streets Chief scientic adviser Sir Patrick Vallance has said the  metre rule can be relaxed in some circumstances. He said earlier this week: There are times in which this can be changed and that evidence of course can then be the basis of a policy decision on what the right distance is that should be mandated or put forward as the rule to follow. To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

For example, nuts are a great source of magnesium and vitamin E, an antioxidant that protects the body from damaging free radicals. These can cause oxidative tissue damage, triggering inflammation that contributes to problems like allergies and asthma.”Whether you like them chopped up in a salad or on top of a burger, turns out red onions are more than just a crunch addition to your dinner.Theyre rich in a chemical that can actually ward off a blocked nose and itchy eyes.“Eating foods rich in quercetin, a natural anti-histamine, such as capers, red onions and apples, can be helpful, according to Max.Also,you eat pineapple which contains bromelain, that helps the body absorb the quercetin.”Some of us may fear brown food, but lets face it, its much better for us than its white counterpart.Not only is it packed full of immunity boosting vitamins but you might even notice a dference with your weight too as theyre usually lower in fat.Max says: “Legumes, whole grains and tofu are high in zinc, which has an antibacterial and antiviral effect in the body and fosters immunity.Examples of legumes are lentils, chickpeas, peas, beans, soybeans, and peanuts, and whole grains include brown rice, oatmeal, barley, buckwheat, bulgur wheat and millet.”Good news, Vindaloo lovers - a super hot curry may help to blow those symptoms away.Capsicin, the stuff that gives chilies their heat, is known to help open up the nasal passages and relieve that bunged up feeling.But just make sure youve got a box of tissues to hand.“Spicy foods and horseradish can have natural decongestant effects, Max says.Use with caution though, as they may also irritate the throat, resulting in excess mucous and cough.”Instead of pouring a load of salt and pepper on your chips, why not go fancy and add rosemary.Not only will it look like something you might order in a posh burger bar, but the seasoning could actually help with hay fever symptoms.“Season your food with rosemary as it opens up the respiratory system, helping to reduce inflammation and encourages better breathing, according to Max.Okay, so we know tea doesnt count as a food but what you drink is definitely a part of your diet.So,you wake up each morning totally bunged up and reach for a coffee then you might want to reconsider.Max says: “Drinking hot tea with lemon and honey first thing in the morning activates movement of the hairs in the nose, which some people believe will prevent early morning sneezing with allergies or hay fever.“Drinking camomile tea can help as it has anti-inflammatory properties and contains azulene, a natural antihistamine.”“Nettle tea can also be beneficial. Stinging nettles are thought to be able to reduce the amount of histamine in the body and can help with unwanted symptoms such as a stuffy nose, itching eyes and sneezing.”He added: “Peppermint tea may help to ease a blocked nose.”. MushroomsWhether its chucking more in your next risotto or asking for extra on tonights pizza takeaway, consider the benefits of the humble mushroom.“Mushrooms contain higher levels of polysaccharides, which encourage the body to switch off the part of the immune system that reacts to antibodies and cause those unwanted hay fever symptoms, Max says.Reishi mushrooms,you can get hold of them, contain high levels of polysaccharides.”Its another simple one to increase in your diet - as long as you dont mind having a stinky breath.Max says: Fresh, raw garlic contains quercetin, a natural antihistamine. It’s also anti-catarrhal and contains vitamin C.”Some foods can actually make hay fever symptoms a lot worse... and its bad newsyoure a chocoholic.Max says: “Chocolate and alcohol contain histamine, the chemical that sets off allergy symptoms in your body. So whilst you might not want to give these up completely, reducing your intake might help.”He added: “Avoid dairy drinks which may encourage the body to produce mucus.Excess mucus is exactly what you don’t needyou suffer from hay fever. Instead, drink water, fruit tea, herb tea or any non-caffeinated tea.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

nicknamed Chariots - became a sporting hero on the pitch at the end of the s.The RFU said it was determined to “accelerate change and grow awareness” but also noted the importance the song had for supporters as they roused the national side against their opponents on the pitch.A spokesperson said: “The Swing Low, Sweet Chariot song has long been part of the culture of rugby and is sung by many who have no awareness of its origins or its sensitivities.“We are reviewing its historical context and our role in educating fans to make informed decisions.”The Twickenham ground is also covered with lyrics to the song including the line “Carry Them Home” which is also used as a marketing tool.The song has also been released as an official England World Cup song during tournaments in the past.William Wallis is thought to have written the song in around  while he was a slave in Oklahoma.A minister is thought to have transcribed the words and the song is said to have been made famous by The Jubilee Singers during tours of the US, the UK and Europe in the early part of the th century.The Nazis called the song “undesired and harmful” in .It regained popularity in the US during the Civil Rights Movement in the s.It was sung by folk singer Joan Baez at the Woodstock Festival in .Swing Low, Sweet Chariot is said to have been written by Wallace Willis, a native American who was a slave in the Deep South before the Civil War.A minister is thought to have transcribed the words and the song became known after the African American group The Jubilee Singers popularised it during tours of the US, the UK and Europe in the early th century.Phil McGowan, of the World Rugby Museum thinks Swing Low, Sweet Chariot, was first used in  while Offiah was playing, whose nickname with fans was Chariots Offiah due to his fast speed.The reason why fans sung the song had been unclear until footage of the song being sung while Offiah was in action on the pitch emerged earlier this year.Mr McGowan told the \" href\"https:www.bbc news uk-england-\" target\"_blank\" rel\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\"BBC the footage of Offiah “solved the mystery of why on earth were they were singing this song”.The England and Saracens star Maro Itoje, , has already raised concerns about the song.He told \" rel\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\"Sportsmail earlier this week: ”I dont think anyone at Twickenham is singing it with malicious intent, but the background of that song is complicated.”The RFU has appointed Genevieve Glover as head of a ersity group which will look at ways rugby can be more inclusive and end institutional racism.Swing low, sweet chariotComing for to carry me homeSwing low, sweet chariotComing for to carry me homeSwing low, sweet chariotComing for to carry me homeSwing low, sweet chariotComing for to carry me homeI looked over Jordan and what did I seeComing for to carry me homeA band of angels coming after meComing for to carry me homeSwing low, sweet chariotComing for to carry me homeSwing low, sweet chariotComing for to carry me homeIf you get there before I doComing for to carry me homeTell all my friends Im coming tooComing for to carry me homeSwing low, sweet chariotComing for to carry me homeSwing low, sweet chariotComing for to carry me homeOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The smaller the area being considered the greater the effect on the R value of a cluster. A small cluster of Covid- cases can lead to an apparent rise in R which does not give the true reflection of local risk. Today Sage experts warned the R rate does not tell us how quickly an epidemic is changing, pointing out that dferent diseases with the same R rate can result in epidemics that grow at dferent speeds.  For example,a disease has an R rate of  and infection lasts years, it will grow much more slowly than another disease with an R rate of  where infection lasts days.As a result, for the first time the Government, has published the coronavirus growth rates, for the UK, England and the regions.The growth rate reflects how quickly the number of infections are changing day-by-day.The Government said today: It is an approximation of the change of number of infections each day.If the growth rate is greater than zero , then the disease will grow.If the growth rate is less than zero then the disease will shrink.The currently growth rate for the UK as a whole is -% to -%, while in England it stands at -% to -% - indicating the epidemic is shrinking faster in the UK than in England.In all areas of the UK except London the growth rate is negative. In the capital it lies somewhere between -% to +. All other regions are below the crucial threshold of zero.A Sage spokesman said: Growth rates provide us with dferent information to R estimates, by informing us of the size and speed of change, whereas R value only gives us information on the direction of change.If the growth rate is greater than zero - or positive - the disease will grown. But below zero and negative, is a sign its shrinking.The growth rates in the regions are:UK: -% to -%England: -% to -%East of England: -% to -%London: -% to +%Midlands: -% to %North East and Yorkshire: -% to -%North West: -% to %South East: -% to -%South West: -% to %The R value and growth rate for the UK and England paint a hopeful picture of an epidemic that is heading in the right direction.It comes in a week where lockdown was eased further, with non-essential shops reopening their doors on Monday, and shoppers flocking to queue after three months away from the high street.Todays lowering of the Covid- alert level by the Joint Biosecurity Centre marks another positive step.The Governments chief medical officers, led by Prof Chris Whitty, say transmission of the bug is no longer high or rising exponentially.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.The move to Level  allows for the gradual relaxation of restrictions and social distancing measures - raising hopes the two-metre rule could be scrapped, a move which could breathe much-need le into businesses closed for months, and mark a move towards getting all kids back to school.A joint statement from the four CMOs, said: The Joint Biosecurity Centre has recommended that the Covid- alert level should move from Level to Level  .There has been a steady decrease in cases we have seen in all four nations, andthis continues.It does not mean that the pandemic is over.

That is something her devoted husband, Scott Mitchell, has been dreading.The couple married in  with some cynics snfily declaring it would never last, mainly because of the -year age gap, but Scott proved them all completely wrong.He adores his we and has put his le on hold, and his physical and mental health at risk, to take care of his Barbara.Scott has also helped to raise funds and awareness for dementia charities, even taking part in the London Marathon with a group of Barbara’s friends from EastEnders.It has been deeply sad to see how this disease has ravaged one of the most delightful women in showbiz.I always adored interviewing Barbara. She was sunny, funny, full of fascinating stories and always interested in everyone and everything.She would have a laugh with the crew, a cheery chat with our production team and was exactly the same whether the cameras were rolling or not.I know a lot of famous actors and entertainers who are grumpy gits until the red light goes on. Barbara was never like that. She is a consummate professional, but also a delightfully warm human being.I remember seeing her at an event in London, where she was swamped by photographers and members of the public. She’s so tiny I couldn’t actually see her in that large sea of people, but what I did observe was how everyone came away with an autograph or a selfie.Barbara is old school. She always said she owes her fame to the public and that they deserved a smile, a cheery wave and a quick photograph.That’s why she is so adored and why we are so very upset she is having to go through this anguish. Scott says her speech is growing worse and she now struggles to find the words to express herself.She ends up sitting shaking her head in sadness and frustration. Barbara is also getting up two or three times a night, becoming unsteady on her feet and falling over. Scott is worried sick that she will suffer a really serious injury.Sometimes Barbara looks at old photos of herself and asks, “Who is she ” and increasingly she doesn’t recognise Scott, which cuts him to his very heart and soul.This disease is so brutal, because it chips away at the sufferer, steals their memories and erodes what makes them unique. You gradually lose the person you love and have to mourn them while they are still alive. That’s why the work both Scott and Barbara have been doing is so vital.When she bravely told us she was ill two years ago, the Alzheimer’s Society saw visits to its website double and one-off donations to the charity rose by  per cent.She made a plea to the PM to help carers and sufferers, and to increase funding, and Barbara was one of the few people that made Boris Johnson stop waffling and actually listen.Dementia is a second epidemic within this pandemic, which is why we need more documentaries like the ones from Ross.There are , sufferers that we know about in the UK, and with us all living longer that number will carry on increasing.Relatives caring for those blighted by the disease can often feel alone and helpless. GPs and the NHS do their best, but it can be a lottery as to what expert care is available.As we have seen during this crisis, care home workers are an extraordinary group of people who treat their frail and elderly patients like a second family, but no one really wants to put a beloved parent or partner into a nursing home.There comes a time, however, when there is no other choice. Scott is now facing that prospect and it is tearing him apart. I also spoke this week to the musician Naughty Boy, whose mum Zahida suffers from dementia.He is a devoted son and lives with his mum to take care of her. Naughty Boy is backing Dementia UK’s Lives On Hold campaign, which focuses on carers and how draining it is for them, especially since lockdown. He wants to stress that there is help out there. I was touched at how he makes sure there is at least one thing every day for his mum to look forward to, to give her joy.He tries to see some light in the darkness and it’s also something Scott has always tried to do. He has to be Barbara’s memory and keep a hold of the love they have for one another.Eventhey have to be parted so she can go into a home, nothing can take that love away from him or anyone  going through the same sad experience.IF you are going to quote Game Of Thrones, then for the love of God at least get it right.Tone deaf Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab dismissed those who support the Black Lives Matter campaign by taking a knee, as seeming to “get the idea from Game Of Thrones”.This was not only hugely insulting, but Raab didn’t even bother to get the phraseology right. In Game Of Thrones, the characters are willing to die before they would BEND the knee in front of despots and royalty.In the real world it’s about expressing solidarity against racial inequality.Raab believes the heartfelt gesture is a “symbol of subjugation and subordination” and he would only do so for the Queen and his we. Those who take the knee, including footballers at theof the Premier League this week, and many protesters here and in the US, were astounded by his crass remarks.Following such wide­spread incredulity and anger, Raab has been furiously back-tracking. I do hope his Twitter clarication is genuine and not just another Government damage-limitation tactic.If this really was an episode of Game Of Thrones, he would have had his a*** handed to him by my favourite character, Sandor Clegane, known as The Hound.After that encounter, I guarantee he would never again be able to bend any part of his anatomy.HOLLYOAKS actor Adam Rickitt is an astonishingly candid and brave man. He not only spoke about his mental health at a time when it was considered career-destroying, but has talked frankly this week about being infertile.Adam suffers from an auto-immune disease that has made it impossible for him to ever father children. The -year-old has ankylosing spondylitis, which has had a devastating effect on his sperm count.While other men might have felt embarrassed about it, Adam has been refreshingly honest. He revealed the doctor told him most men have three million sperm, but he only had two. Not two million but TWO.He and his we Katy Fawcett, a top correspondent with Good Morning Britain, are very happy with their three dogs. Adam has been equally upfront about his mental health and suicidal thoughts. Since meeting Katy in  his le has turned around and, alongside acting jobs, he’s running a craft beer bar and shop. The couple call it their “baby”.They adore each other and are lucky to feel complete without kids.GWYNETH PALTROW’S latest attention- seeking wheeze is to bring out a candle that “smells of her orgasm”. This is a follow-up to last year’s model that bore the catchy title, “This candle smells of my vagina”.Not sure about you, but I have no wish to have my living room reeking of Gywn or anything to do with her sex le.I also cannot begin to imagine the sheer buttock-clenching embarrassment suffered by her two teenage kids.I think what her candles really smell of are pure unadulterated bulls**t.THE Oscars and Baftas have been delayed for a few months due to Covid-, so this could be a good time for the film industry to have a rethink about the whole business of award shows.Instead of a seemingly never-ending run of ceremonies, perhaps there should be a cull. In the US they could keep the Oscars for films, the Emmys for TV and the Tonys for theatre, and here the Baftas, NTAs and Oliviers.Then each event would be special, rather than a seemingly endless parade of bored-looking stars like Renee Zellweger, above, done up to the nines and wishing they were at home.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

No matter that I am not, nor have ever been, a member of the Conservative Party.I would never be forgiven by some people, who just couldn’t understand why an ethnic minority person would have sympathy for Conservative policies. At best we’ve been hoodwinked at worst we must just be plain evil.It often feels like we are not allowed to think for ourselves, outside of the orthodoxies set down by left-wing political groupthink.In the days of fighting to set up my school, and in our first few years of establishing ourselves, I received racist emails and threats of violence — from the Left.There were protests outside my school and abuse was shouted in my face from militant union members opposed to free schools.My detractors tried hard to discredit me in ways that made sense to them.There was even a running Wikipedia battle over my heritage, lasting for years.It was regularly edited to state that I was of Indian descent, while some people claimed my ancestry to be Indian Ugandan, and thereforethat I must hate black people.It was absurd, and I didn’t know from one day to the next what race my Wikipedia page would say I was.While it seems a bizarre thing to fight over, some opponents clearly believed that my criticisms of the education system and my support for free schools could be discountedI wasn’t black.My experience ten years ago is why today I have the greatest sympathy for Conservative MPs such as Priti Patel and Kemi Badenoch. Heaven knows what actual Tory MPs from ethnic minorities must have to endure.Mirza has been working with the Conservative Party for many years and her simple appointment to this role has enraged her detractors. For them, a “good” ethnic minority is one who always toes the leftist line.So play around with my Wikipedia page, make me Indian with a couple of keyboard strokes, and suddenly not only have they wiped my mother out of existence, but my words don’t really matter any more. This accusation of “not being black enough” raised its ugly head when Priti Patel was accused of distracting from the racism facing black people by highlighting her own experiences — assomehow her struggles were worth less because she is of Indian heritage .That being called a “P**i” as a young girl wouldn’t have had the same crushing, hurtful impact as any other racial slur. Similarly, Munira Mirza has been accused of not being able to understand the experiences of black people because she is of Pakistani origin.The recent protests inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement should have provoked serious conversations about the meaning and impact of race we all need to explore the nature of racism and what to do about it.But it is clear to me, from the black boxes on Instagram to the meaningless supportive BLM statements on corporate websites, that few people are interested in examining race in our own society.Most people want an easy fix, a stamp of approval that will allow them to be branded a non-racist so that they can go back to their normal lives, satisfied that they are a good person .This is not even remotely helpful to anyone, it’s simple box ticking but the desire to signal “anti-racism” instead of just not being a racist is so prevalent that at times I wonder whether human beings have the capacity to distinguish between the two: The signal and the reality.This tick-box race culture goes hand in hand with the oppression Olympics. Hierarchies of race are the easy bingo card that allows ethnic people to be ticked off on a sheet.Chinese  Sorry, only two oppression points for you. Black  Wow, that’s ten points! You go straight to the top!This is why,you are merely interested in appearing to be non-racist, rather than actually being a non-racist, you will buy into the idea of this totem pole of oppression.You will ignore that race and class are so much more complex than this.My father was of Indian heritage, but he came from a much poorer environment than my black mother and grew up without any shoes.Le is more complicated than the tick-box culture allows, butyour only interest in race is to do enough to signal to everyone that you aren’t a racist, then you will promote that hierarchy enthusiastically, because it is the perfect prop for your non-racist dissimulation. It doesn’t require any thought or effort.The reality of being anti-racist requires years of reading and discussion, befriending a iety of black people, including ones who think dferently from you politicallyand really coming to terms with one’s own uncomfortable feelings around race. Signalling requires a black box on Instagram and instantly everyone approves of you. You can see why most people choose the simpler option.In fact, spending a letime helping black boys realise their potential, something Black Lives Matter should approve of, instead of earning me adoration as a black box on Instagram does, has given me many enemies.My -plus years of improving young people’s lives is meaningless next to the superficial letters of support for BLM, because making a useful dference to people’s lives is less important than being seen to do so. It is a wonder why anyone ever does anything truly good at all.But there is one way of being anti-racist in a very simple and real way that takes no time at all.Allow Priti Patel, Kemi Badenoch and Munira Mirza the right that so many white people enjoy and take for granted: The right to think for themselves.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I do not underestimate how dficult it is to reopen schools safely in the current climate. But Prime Minister has simply not risen to the challenge. There has been no plan, no leadership and no willingness to find a way forward. Instead of taking responsibility, the Prime Minister has wasted time flailing around trying to blame others.

Unless the government accepts the mistakes it has made, there is a real risk that it will not meet its latest promise to get all children back in school safely in September.

It is understood that scientists have given their approval to reduce the distance people need to stay apart to one metre,other precautions are taken. This is likely to include more widespread use of face masks, screens and making sure buildings are ventilated. For the latest on the coronavirus pandemic, read our liveblog here The measure is one of several that the PM is expected to announce over the next two weeks in an attempt to revive the economy andto a new normal. Earlier today, Mr Johnson said he wanted all children in England toto school on a five-dayss-a-week basis in September. Meanwhile, ministers are said to be negotiating holiday air bridges with  other countries to allow travel overseas, while the Welsh Government has announced it wants to restart tourism next month. A Whitehall source has also told the paper that two families could be allowed to visit each other at home as part of expanded support bubbles. Health officials are also preparing to write to more than two million people who are currently shielding due to health conditions, telling them they can soon venture outside to shop and enjoy leisure activities. It comes after the UKaposs four Chief Medical Officers for the four nations of the UK agreed to reduce the coronavirus threat level as the number of new infections continues to slow. The downgrading - recommended by the Joint Biosecurity Centre- means the Covid- epidemic is in general circulation, but transmission is no longer high or rising exponentially. However, advisers have warned that localised outbreaks of Covid- are still likely to occur.  Health Secretary Matt Hancock boasted it is a big moment for the country, and a real testament to the British people’s determination to beat this virus. Earlier today, the Prime Minister dropped his strongest hint yet that the two-metre social distancing rule could be dropped. On a visit to Bovingdon Primary School in Hertfordshire on Friday, he told the public to watch this space when askedthe measure could be relaxed to help schools in Englandin autumn. A Downing Street team is already running an urgent review of the two-metre rule, which is expected to conclude next week. The review could see the recommended distance between people in shops and outdoor spaces cut to a level seen in other European countries. It comes after warnings from the hospitality industry and MPs that thousands of pubs, restaurants and cafes would go bustforced to re-open while the two-metre rule is still in place.

Increasing the maximum class size to  would mean entire classes could have to go into isolationa single pupil tests positive. The Education Secretary said schools would be given fresh guidance on changes to social distancing rules in the next two weeks. He told the Downing Street briefing: This is why weaposve said clearly weaposre going to be publishing the further guidance within the next two weeks so that schools have the maximum amount of time to prepare for the next phase of welcoming children back.

Gavin Williamson said: Weaposve been creating bubbles of children in the classroom, creating a protective environment for those children. Currently that is at , what we would be looking at doing is expanding those bubbles to include the whole class. He said signs the virus was reducing meant ministers could look at making sure every child s to school. Mr Williamson added: We recognise there is still going to have to be protective measures put in place to make sure children are safe and make sure that teachers and all those who work in school are safe as well, and that is why we are going to be issuing further guidance in the next two weeks.

The four Chief Medical Officers for the four nations of the UK agreed it should be reduced from Level  to Level . It means the Covid- epidemic is in general circulation, but transmission is no longer high or rising exponentially. Itaposs finally happened after the government claimed for weeks that it was moving towards . Health Secretary Matt Hancock boasted it is a big moment for the country, and a real testament to the British people’s determination to beat this virus. But it doesnapost actually make much dference to how the UK will come out of lockdown. Thataposs because after a massive row over the alert level, the government claimed it doesnapost actually make a dference to easing restrictions. So what is the alert level and what dference will todayaposs announcement make to your le  Weaposve had a took. What are the coronavirus alert levels   There are five alert levels, set by a Joint Biosecurity Centre that was established in May to deal with the pandemic. They are:Level  COVID- is not known to be present in the UK Level  COVID- is present in the UK, but the number of cases and transmission is low Level  A COVID- epidemic is in general circulation Level  A COVID- epidemic is in general circulation transmission is high or rising exponentially Level  As level  and there is a material risk of healthcare services being overwhelmedWhat is the UK Covid- alert level now  As of Friday  June the alert level is three, meaning a COVID- epidemic is in general circulation. That is down from level four, as the alert level had been since the system was set up in May. Who agrees the UK alert level   Changes to the alert level are recommended by the JBC and then signed off by the four Chief Medical Officers in the four nations of the UK. In other words, despite Boris Johnson claiming for weeks that it was moving towards , he does not have direct power to change the alert level. The level is set primarily by R - the number of new people each carrier is infecting - and the overall number of coronavirus cases. What is the alert level actually used for   Thereaposs a big debate about some of this. We know from the roadmap for easing lockdown, published on May , that the alert level is designed to communicate the current level of risk clearly to the public. So itaposs a bit like the terror threat level. It crunches of all the risks facing the UK into one star rating, to give the public a vague idea of how bad things are. It shows the threat now - not the potential future threatthe virus spins out of control again. Whataposs controversial is how much the alert level affects lockdown directly. When it was first announced in May, the government said there was a link - but now it claims there isnapost a link at all. What did the government say before   When the alert level system was set up in May, the government linked it to the easing of lockdown. In a slide on May  , is said that at level , current social distancing measures and restrictions remain. Only at level  would there be a gradual relaxing of restrictions and social distancing measures. And at level  there would be no or minimal social distancing measures. And Boris Johnson said on May : That Covid Alert Level will tell us how tough we have to be in our social distancing measures – the lower the level the fewer the measures. The higher the level, the tougher and stricter we will have to be.  The government has since changed its tune and made clear any changes to lockdown are not based on the alert level. Instead, No says lockdown changes are based on the five tests for easing lockdown:The NHS is able to cope A sustained fall in deaths New infections dropping enough Adequate testing and PPE No risk of a second peak that overwhelms NHSThis prompted a massive row when the government started easing lockdown in England - opening schools and shops, and letting groups of six meet outdoors - despite the high alert level. Questioned on June , the PMaposs spokesman appeared to rewrite history. He said the government were always clear that changes to lockdown were based on the separate five tests - not the alert levels. Why did the row happen  We still donapost fully know. Perhaps itaposs possible that early No literature - including Boris Johnsonaposs address to the nation - was produced in error or when the policy wasnapost properly settled. But what we do know is this. Using the five tests, rather than the alert level, allowed some political input into the decision to ease lockdown. Rather than basing it entirely on the science about the virus, Boris Johnson could also base his decision on other factors like the economy. We also know it took a long time for the Joint Biosecurity Centre - which sets the alert level - to be ready. On June , three weeks after it was announced, No admitted the Joint Biosecurity Centre was not yet fully up and running”.

Boris Johnson says he is very proud of his administration’s response despite the UK having one of the highest death tolls in the world, problems with test and trace, and the confusion on getting children back to school. In our second major audit, our Health Editor, Business Editor and Head of Politics give their verdicts and look at what the Government has got right and what it got wrong. Here are our verdicts... Lockdown What they got right: A consensus has now emerged thatthe Government had locked down earlier, it would have saved tens of thousands of lives.However, when lockdown came it was better managed than some European countries. Allowing an hour of daily exercise contributed to high levels of public compliance. What they got wrong: The UK’s top infection modeller, Prof Neil Ferguson told MPs half of all deaths could have been avoidedlockdown was called just a week earlier.With the Office for National Statistics now putting Covid--linked deaths at more than ,, that was a staggering conclusion. The decision now facing ministers is how soon and how much to ease lockdown. The ability of the economy to reopen depends on how strictly businesses are required to stick to social distancing rules and, for instance, whether they may be eased from keeping m apart to .m or m. Verdict: That Britain was one of the last countries in Europe to introduce lockdown will be a defining decision of the pandemic. PPE What they got right: Problems accessing suitable personal protective equipment have eased in recent weeks. Supply networks have been established but many healthcare organisations have been forced to source their own stocks.Problems remain, particularly in dentistry, due to the cost of PPE. What they got wrong: An independent committee advising on pandemic risk had recommended in  that PPE be stockpiled for the NHS – but it was ignored.The National Audit Office found central stocks supplied only % of gowns, % of goggles and % of aprons that models said would be needed under a “reasonable worst-case scenario”. Office for National Statistics data shows infection rates in hospitals and care homes are still stubbornly high compared to rates in the general public. Verdict: The NAO report makes a mockery of claims by Health Secretary Matt Hancock that Britain had enough PPE but was just struggling to get it to the right places. Care homes What they got right: The Government pledged £.billion to help local authorities respond to coronavirus. The bulk of the money was intended to help social care services.What they got wrong: Years of failed efforts to integrate NHS and social care hampered the response. Unlike the NHS, there was a lack of centralised data on infection rates ripping through many of the UK’s , independent care home providers early on. The NAO found , hospital patients were discharged to care homes without even being tested at the height of the outbreak. This came while Health Secretary Matt Hancock claimed to have “thrown a protective ring” around care homes. Just % of PPE was sent to homes from central stocks compared with what modelling had said was needed. Care homes have lost thousands to Covid-, leaving many independent providers on the verge of going bust. Verdict: Reform of a system on the brink is vital but residents and families fear things will get worse before they get better. Furlough What they got right: The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme launched by Chancellor Rishi Sunak was the Government’s biggest weapon in the face of the crisis.More than nine million workers are having % of wages covered by the state. The scheme prevented massive job losses but at huge cost to the taxpayer – almost £billlion and growing. What they got wrong: Early issues included the cut-off for when new employees were eligible, which was extended. There have also been concerns about possible fraudulent applications.But the biggest concern is the months ahead. The scheme will be wound down from the end of July, when employers will be expected to pay gradually more – sparking fears of staff being axed. The scheme ends on October , which could result in even more redundancies in sectors still suffering. Verdict: The scheme prevented a tsunami of job losses. But wave upon wave of redundancies have already been announced and expect more jobs misery to come. Quarantine What they got right: It’s hard to know at this stage, given the onslaught of criticism. Most people arriving in the UK from June  have had to self-isolate for  days.Home Secretary Priti Patel claimed scientic advice showed introducing the measure sooner would have made “little dference” to the spread of Covid- but that the UK was now “more vulnerable” to infections coming from abroad. What they got wrong: Convincing the public, airlines and other businesses it was the right thing to do.It is claimed the quarantining rule is costing the economy £million a week. Britain’s three biggest airlines – British Airways, easyJet and Ryanair – are seeking an urgent judicial review, saying the policy is having a devastating effect. The Government is due to look at the policy again on June . Verdict: Any scientic evidence that quarantining was the right move has been eclipsed by the shambolic way in which the scheme has been introduced. BAME deaths What they got right: Public Health England was commissioned to look at the impact of Covid on minority groups. It found Black, Asian and minority ethnic people are more likely to die.People of Bangladeshi ethnicity had around twice the risk of white British. People of Chinese, Indian, Pakistani, other Asian, Caribbean and black ethnicity had between % and % higher risk. A separate report by the Office for National Statistics found people in poorer areas were more likely to die from Covid. The most deprived areas of England and Wales have . deaths per , people, compared with . in affluent areas. What they got wrong: Boris Johnson has appointed Minister for Equalities Kemi Badenoch to review the impact of Covid on the Black and Asian communities.But the Government has not said when it will be published or what action it will take to protect those most at risk, including BAME workers in the health and care sectors. Verdict: Not enough action to protect minorities and poorest. Test and Trace What they got right: Contact tracing was rolled out suspiciously early amid a political storm around the lockdown breach by aide Dominic Cummings.Despite this speed, the UK is already carrying out more tests than in most comparable countries due to our high infection rates. NHS Test and Trace has yet to reveal how quickly people are being traced, which is key to preventing a second wave. What they got wrong: Data from the first fortnight shows a quarter who order a test cannot be contacted or refuse to give friends’ details.Contact tracers were meant to be helped by an NHS app, promised by mid-May but scrapped after a troubled trial.The Health Secretary will now look at an app by Apple and Google which will not allow the NHS to access data to identy local outbreaks. Any app will be ready by winter at best.The statistics watchdog also rapped “inadequate” testing figures. Verdict: The performance of the call-centre contact tracing system is improving but time will tellit is enough. Schools What they got right: Education Secretary Gavin Williamson has finally announced a £billion package to help pupils in England catch up.This will cover tutoring for disadvantaged kids and one-to-one or group tuition for primary and secondary pupils. It works out as just six hours of extra teaching per child, despite many having lost six months of school time. Nor does it include help for sixth-formers. What they got wrong: There is still no national plan for getting pupils in England back to school. The Government had wanted all primaries to reopen for all kids before the summer holidays.They had to ditch this goal when teachers and unions pointed out it was impractical under social distancing rules. It is not certain that all schools will be able to reopen in Septemberthey have to split pupils into -strong “bubbles”. This may require more staff and using other public buildings as temporary classes. Verdict: The absence of a clear plan has left parents and teachers confused.Vulnerable What they got right: Councils got support to provide accommodation for people living on the streets. After pressure from opposition MPs, the Home Office found £milllion to support victims of domestic abuse during the pandemic. But the Government has yet to commit to long-term funding to help rough sleepers. Labour says just £.m of the £m to help domestic abuse victims has reached the front line. What they got wrong: It took a campaign by Man Utd star Marcus Rashford for the Government to agree to extend free school meals for the summer holiday. The PM also U-turned on measures forcing overseas NHS workers to pay for their own treatment. New claimants for Universal Credit are still having to wait five weeks for the first payment and demand for foodbank support has risen by % since the lockdown.Verdict: The Government has a blind spot when it comes to helping the disadvantaged.Overall What they got right: When the outbreak struck, the Government basked in a lot of public goodwill as the country came together. The rapid building of the Nightingale hospitals was a huge collective effort.Chancellor Rishi Sunak also won plaudits for the smooth rollout of the furlough scheme. There was also praise for the clear communications from the Government which led to millions of people abiding by the message to “stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives”.

A combination of Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership, toxic infighting and an unpopular stance on Brexit all contributed to Labour’s worst showing for more than  years. The review also notes victory at the next election is far from guaranteed, saying hoping Brexit will go away and having a new leader will not automatically reverse fortunes. To win a majority next time needs a swing greater than Tony Blair managed in . It requires winning back seats from the SNP in Scotland and those lost to the Tories in the Midlands and north of England. While Labour stacked up votes in big cities, it has lost voters in towns and coastal resorts. No wonder the report concludes there is a mountain to climb. But there are also reasons for optimism. Keir Starmer has made an excellent start as leader. He has taken the fight to Boris Johnson, appointed a talented Shadow Cabinet and started to heal some of the party’s isions. Labour needs to build on this early success by developing an attractive policy agenda.

His portentous, I-am-serious-me statement did not add so I can f*** it right up at the end, but it might as well have done.As Britain emerges from lockdown and , excess deaths, mostly due to the virus getting a bit tired rather than any brilliance on the governmentaposs part, blame is being bundled up in preparation for the Prime Ministerial reshuffle which will send it as far away as possible.One of the recipients will be the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, whose response to a health pandemic has been to destroy the health and social care of as many people as possible, with a level of incompetence that is close to brilliantly awful.  At the start of April, Apple and Google joined forces to use smartphones to trace coronavirus outbreaks. Within days, journalists were briefed the NHS was developing its own version, available in weeks, to ease lockdown. The fact UK local authorities had public health officials trained in tracing disease outbreaks was barely mentioned.On April , Halfcocked announced: Today I wanted to outline the next step: a new NHS app for contact tracing [...] We’re already testing this app and as we do this we’re working closely with the world’s leading tech companies and renowned experts in digital safety and ethics.”On April  it was reported Apple had refused to downgrade its privacy rules, which the NHS app needed to work.On April  Halfcocked said the app was crucial and would be rolled out in a matter of weeks. On April , a parliamentary committee was told it would be ready in a fortnight, and the Apple Google version of a tracing app had been rejected as it would slow us down quite considerably. All tracing apps rely on bluetooth connections between phones, but they store data dferently. The UK insisted all contacts be uploaded automatically onto a central server, regardless of health status Apple and Google kept data offline on your phone, pinging warnings out to anonymised contacts only when an infection is confirmed. The international version would also be built into operating systems, putting it on billions of phones worldwide, rather than relying on people specically downloading it.Most of the world went with Apple and Google. In Europe, only Britain and France insisted on a homebrew. On April  Germany switched sides, announcing a national app would not run on iPhones unless the screens were unlocked and the app running.Halfcocked doubled down. By then contracts had been signed with a bunch of private companies to provide software engineers, data processing centres, and servers.On April , the government announced the app would be tested on the Isle of Wight. Hancock said it was islandersapos civic duty to download it. On May , the Health Service Journal reported claims it was not fit for inclusion in the NHSapos own app library, had not passed basic cybersecurity tests, and was “wobbly”. On May , barristers warned the government might be sued over privacy and data protection concerns, and cyber experts said it was open to trolling, and foreign spies shutting down entire cities with fake reports.The same day, Halfcocked said the app was a very, very positive step in terms of us all being able to get some of our liberty back”. It was reported, again, the app wouldnapost work on locked iPhones, and would make safe international travel impossible.On May , Isle of Wight users said it didnapost work on older iPhones, Australia announced it was going with Apple Google after its own app didnapost work well enough, and the government had given £.m to a Swiss firm to seeit could somehow blend the Apple technology with the British app.On May , it was revealed the NHSX app was being rebuilt. On May , the government said it was not. Experts, again, said they were worried the NHSX version relied on self-reporting, rather than a diagnostic test, leaving it open to trolls and abuse. On May , NHSX finally admitted the app didnapost work on older phones. On May , MPs heard the UK app would not work with the Irish version, so any cross-border infections in Northern Ireland would not be picked up.Yet on May , Halfcocked boasted to Parliament: We now have the elements we need to roll out our national Test  Trace service – the testing capacity, the tracing capability and the technology. It was announced, again, the app would be rolled out within weeks.  Apple and Google launched their app - the one that would slow us down - on May . Four days later, the Department of Health gave £million to local authorities so their public health experts could help with tracking and tracing.On May , the Mirror revealed the PMaposs chief adviser had broken lockdown rules while infectious. On May , we revealed heaposd done so twice. On May , Halfcocked set , human contract tracers to work before the app was ready, and said he was getting people used to the idea. A DoH announcement said it would be complemented by the app in coming weeks. On May , he bent maths to announce heaposd hit his target of , tests a day early.  Halfcocked did not mention the app in his opening statements at the daily coronavirus briefings on June , ,  or . On June  the UK Statistics Authority said his figures were far from complete and comprehensible. On June , he thanked Serco - one of the firms involved in the app - for its assistance in the tracing programme.This week, Parliament was told the app would not be ready until winter and, besides, it was not a priority. Yesterday,  weeks after sanity required it, the government abandoned it.Turns out, the NHSX app didnapost work on older phones. It drained battery le. There were privacy concerns. Oh, and it and only traced % of an infected personaposs contacts, so you might as well have thrown all those millions into the English Channel along with a few thousand extra dead bodies.It was going to be available in weeks,  weeks ago. It was being tested, before the code was even written. The much-slower Apple Google app was produced quicker, works better, and was probably cheaper. Country after country hit problems and changed direction, but Halfcocked ploughed on. Sources, leaks, experts, and barristers all pointed out issues, but millions were spaffed up a wall trying to get the Swiss to do something weaposd have been sued for. Most of the developed world now has a phone app but we do not, and Halfcocked refuses to tell us when we might.Itaposs now obvious the app would never have achieved the critical mass of % that Parliament was told it needed, and that contact tracing was botched, then rushed out early to save embarrassment over ious Cummings and goings. Easing lockdown is now even less safe than it was, which was not very.And it seems as though Halfcocked is the worst kind of gambler - stupid. He fell for the apossunk cost fallacyapos - the idea that,you spend enough cash, a payout is guaranteed. Iceland has the worldaposs highest uptake of a coronavirus-tracing app, at % of its population. Its health minister has said it was not a game-changer. The UK government must have known, but gave millions to tech firms rather than the public health officials who were actually capable of saving lives.

A report by University College London found two million children have done less than an hour a day of schoolwork during the lockdown. So today, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson announced a £billion package for tuition. But critics say it doesnapost do everything it needs to and there could be holes in the system. So what exactly will it pay for and how will it help your child  Hereaposs what you need to know. The £billion package is in two parts.The first is a £m fund to be shared across state primary and secondary schools over the   academic year to help all children catch up. Head teachers will decide how the money is spent, but the government expects this to be spent on small group tuition for whoever needs it.This is a universal offer - itaposs not just for the most disadvantaged pupils.The second part is a £m National Tutoring Programme to increase access to high-quality tuition for the most disadvantaged young people over the   academic year.Are nurseries and colleges included   No, itaposs just for schools. Nurseries and colleges were included in an erroneous early version of a press release that was sent to journalists before being rescinded. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said he wants to support nurseries separately through the Hungry Little Minds scheme, and then move to further education too. He promised extra support but gave no firm commitment. Purnima Tanuku, Chief Executive of National Day Nurseries Association, said: “Yet again the Government fails the early years sector and very young children who are most in need of support. “Many nurseries have reopened to very few children and their businesses are just not financially viable. Neil Leitch, chief executive of the Early Years Alliance added: It beggars belief that the early years sector has been excluded from this aposcatch-upapos package. Childcare settings across the country are working hard to provide the best possible support to those children who have missed several weeks of important early education. Why is it then, that once again, schools get much-needed financial support and early years providers donapost  Will the cash be paid over the summer   No.When Boris Johnson announced the fund he said it would be a massive catch-up programme for summer and beyond.But Schools Minister Nick Gibb admitted the fund will only start to be distributed from September. Speaking on BBC Breakfast, he said: Schools will know itaposs coming and they will be able to budget on that basisthey want to do things before September. But the money will start being distributed to schools from the next academic year, September. How far will the money go   The Department for Education said it came on top of a £m fund for laptops for kids in need. Sir Peter Lampl, founder and chairman of the Sutton Trust, described it as a large sum in a government press release. But Luke Sibieta, a research fellow at the IFS think tank, said the money was worth just £ per child - a % increase in . And he said the rise would still leave spending per pupil more than % below its level in  in real terms.

But when footie-mad Cahill Corner and Kellise Campbell teamed up for a chat, the two rivals soon realised they had plenty of common goals. Talking before Sunday’s Merseyside derby on a Zoom call arranged as part of the Mirror’s Britain Connects project and the Great Get Together, the youngsters opened up to each other about their lives in lockdown. And the subjects ranged from missing family to hopes for the match and their careers. In her all-red bedroom – full of posters, pendants and scarves – Kellise, , introduces herself by saying: “I’m the world’s biggest Liverpool fan,  per cent.” And in his Everton-themed room a short walk away – with its blue and white bed, shirts and mascots – Cahill, nine, says “Hi” and declares he is “the world’s biggest Everton fan”. But for an hour, they put dferences aside to join Britain Connects and mark the weekend of the Great Get Together, in memory of late Labour MP Jo Cox – who would be  on Monday. The Mirror is bringing thousands with opposing views together while the Great Get Together hosts virtual events, from plant swaps to open mic nights. After months unable to watch or play games, Cahill and Kellise agree this derby is extra-special. In their football-mad city, where the rival stadiums are less than a mile apart, an Everton v Liverpool fixture is always a big deal.  Goodison Park and Anfield are only a short drive from where Cahill and Kellise are talking – and they have very dferent ideas on the result. Kellise, who lives with her mum and three siblings near Toxteth, says: “I’m excited for football to start – I’m excited about the derby.” Cahill, who lives with his parents and three siblings, says: “I reckon we’re gonna win -. It’s about time we won a derby.” Kellise laughs and shoots back: “I think it’s about time you won a derby too.” After a chat about favourite players – they are both fans of each other’s big names and, of course, local lad Steven Gerrard – they talk of their own efforts to stay match-fit in lockdown. As they trade training tips, it is clear they have missed talking to other kids. And they soon open up on how tough times have been. “ Coronavirus has ruined everything,” shrugs Kellise. “It’s like the whole world’s gone on pause.”  “School stopping, football stopping,” adds Cahill, sadly. “You have to be home-schooled and there’s no one there to play with. I’ve been missing football, I’ve been missing school and I’ve been missing tournaments – winning trophies, stuff like that. I’ve been missing watching Everton live, going to Goodison Park.” Kellise says: “I miss going to the match. I miss singing You’ll Never Walk Alone. Sometimes I put it on in my room and shut the door.” Cahill says: “The worst time was May and April. That’s when it got serious. We couldn’t go to my nan’s or family members’.” Kellise agrees, saying: “It’s hard not being able to see family. The only way is Facetime and Zoom. You can’t go to their house, give them a hug and say ‘hi’.” Kellise goes to secondary soon and without the end of Year  to enjoy, she is a bit unsure about what comes next.  She says: “I miss my SATS – I was quite excited to do SATS. It’s sad. I start secondary in September but I’m nervous because I don’t know what it’s like and I won’t have seen my friends in months.” More chat reveals how resourceful the sports-mad pair have been. As well as daily runs, boxercise sessions and footie drills, they have cycled and worked out whenever they can – with family members and YouTube trainer Joe Wicks. When Cahill reveals his dad built him a footie pitch in the back garden, all Kellise can say is, “Wow”. Cahill, who is in the Everton junior team, says: “I wanna be a footballer butI don’t make it I’ll probably be a fireman or a paramedic. But I might an electrician or a gas person like my dad.”  Turning pro is also a goal for Kellise, who trains with a local team. She is partly inspired by England’s Lionesses. And as they chat, these two seem happy to spur each other on. “One day, you might play or I might play by working hard,” smiles Cahill. “Hopefully, boys and girls might be able to play with each other in a few years. “You can’t say boys are better than girls because they’ve done the exact same. Girls can do the same as boys, play football, do whatever they want.” "},{"url":null,"title":"calls cps lawyer sacked after","story":"NewsCalls for CPS lawyer to be sacked after sharing concerning Britain First postKim Kendall, who has argued serious cases for the Crown Prosecution Service across Lincolnshire, has been criticised after the Britain First post appeared on her Facebook pageShareCommentsByMark Naylor:,  JUN News\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The Facebook post was a petition from Britain First calling for the iconic statue of Nelson Mandela in London to be torn down, accusing the Nobel Peace Prize winner and former president of South Africa of being a communist and a terrorist mass murderer. Grimsby Live says the post, which referred to murdered British soldier Lee Rigby, was shared on Ms Kendallaposs page last week.It read: I donapost remember the UK rioting after two black immigrants hacked to death a white British soldier in broad daylight... Just saying. Britain First is an extreme far-right group led by Paul Golding, who was recently found guilty of a terrorism offence, after refusing to give police access to his mobile phone when he ed from a political trip to Russia. It is claimed Ms Kendallaposs Facebook page was removed since the post was shared.  Richard Lunn, a solicitor and director at Haywood, Lunn and Allen in Grimsby, Lincolnshire, was one of several lawyers who complained to the CPS. He said: At the end of the day, whether you are defence, prosecution or judiciary, there is an element of trust which the public needs to have in knowing that we are acting impartially and objectively. If the public thinks that we are not, that trust will go and the system will fail.  CPS employees must follow strict guidelines which say they are required to be impartial, particularly when making decisions about whether cases should proceed to court or not. CPS rules under its Code of Conduct also says employees must not post statements on social media which contravenes their obligations. “Employees must not compromise their political neutrality,” it says.A second lawyer who saw the posts toldhe was extremely concerned by the material.Criminal lawyer Attiq Malik said: As a campaigning lawyer against racism it is extremely concerning to learn that there are those in our profession who have Britain First posts appearing on their Facebook page.” A CPS spokesperson said: Impartiality and fairness are central CPS values and these are underpinned by a clear code of conduct. Any allegations of inappropriate behaviour are taken very seriously and investigated thoroughly. Mrs Kendall, who works at courts across Lincolnshire, typically deals with listed sentencing cases, overnight remand cases and making decisions about whether bail should be recommended or opposed for defendants.

Fans could have to walk through disinfectant mists and have their temperatures taken on the way in to venues. Industry chiefs say they are optimistic that live music canafter the summer -they can survive that long. Thousands of shows have been cancelled or postponed since the start of lockdown in March, and the government has been warned that tens of thousands of jobs are on the line. Some of the best-known venues in the country say they are facing financial ruin. Lucy Noble, who chairs the National Arena Association - which represents  of the UK and Irelandaposs biggest concert venues, including Manchester Arena, Londonaposs O and Birminghamaposs Utilita Arena - told : We are at serious risk. And the chief executive of Londonaposs Royal Albert Hall said that temperature tests, health surveys and disinfectant mists are among the ideas heaposs asked the government to look at. Concertgoers could also be required to wear masks, and staff will have to wear PPE under plans being considered. Eventhe two metre social distancing rule is halved, venues would only be able to operate at % of their capacity - which would not be financially viable, Ms Noble said. But bosses are optimistic shows can be back soon - although music fans will need to get used to wearing masks, she added. Concert promoter Live Nation today announced a series of outdoor drive-in concerts over the summer, but the government is yet to say when indoor shows can resume. Craig Hassall, chief executive at the Royal Albert Hall, toldthat there could be lessons learned from South Korea, where theatres were able to operate during the pandemic. He said: We’ve asked the government to look at how venues in other countries have been operating, and the checks and balances they have put in place instead of blanket social distancing guidelines. The test case in Seoul – where a Phantom of the Opera production has continued running – has seen audience members walking through a light mist of disinfectant, having their temperature taken, and filling in a questionnaire about their symptoms and recent places they’ve visited. If we’re to find a solution, it is going to be a combination of numerous measures, from increased access points to hand sanitisers, Perspex screens and PPE for staff.  He said current social distancing rules will not work, stating: We’ve done some modelling using social distancing rules and our capacity would be reduced to around % with two-metre distancing, and around % with one-metre. In order for us to break even, and therefore be sustainable as a charity, we typically need a capacity of around %. The National Arenas Association said the lockdown has been catastrophic for venues and staff. On an average event night, it says member venues employ , people - of which upwards of % are casual or contract staff. Ms Noble toldthat eventhe government slashes its social distancing rules to one metre, it will not be enough. This is not financially viable for arenas, she said.  Even with one metre social distancing we’d be looking at a % capacity which is not workable for most of our shows which are large scale touring rock and pop. We are looking at what activity we are able to undertake in the coming months, but it won’t be live performances, these do not work financially on a two metre social distancing model. She added that although the backlog of cancelled tours could mean venues are open more nights next year, that is little help right now. Ms Noble said: We do believe that  could be busy across all the arenas because many tours are being postponed, but this doesn’t help our situation now where there is absolutely no income to our venues.  We are at serious risk.  Several venues have been forced to launch appeals to help them through the crisis. Among these is Alexandra Palace in North London, where bosses are facing up to a huge defecit. Askedit would be possible to hold events with customers staying two metres apart, a spokesman said it could happen - but itaposs extremely unlikely. He told : Anything is possiblewe are permitted. Once decisions are made then promoters, venues and artists etc will need to understand the new costing model but this is unlikely to work for anyone.

The home in County Tyrone, Northern Ireland, looks ordinary from the outside, but inside it is packed with newspapers dating back to , stopped clocks, a half-smoked pipe, and the owneraposs shoes left by the bed years after the property was vacated. Photographer Rebecca was invited in to see the decaying cottage after its owner died and she was left in awe of the haunting scenes within the perfectly preserved home. The cottage was lived in until  by the last of three brothers, who kept all of their family history, alongside tins of food from the early th century left unopened on the kitchen shelves.A man only identied as Dessie was the last to live there, leading aposa solitary le among the relics of the pastapos before moving into a home in  and passing away two years later. Rebecca, who owns the Abandoned NI website sharing photos of the derelict houses she explores, was allowed in by the owner to get a record of the incredible space before it was knocked down to make way for a new build. She said she was left gobsmacked by what she found, with old books, magazines, papers and photographs littered around the farm workeraposs cottage and left untouched. A clock on the mantel piece is stuck showing ., a pair of glasses are left ready to pick up and a rusted OXO tin has been left open, with two pocket watches stored inside. Hundreds of handwritten letters fill the drawers, and three kettles are sat on the stove, next to a cup which appears to have been placed there just before it was abandoned. Old books and newspapers including the Mid Ulster Mail from  were left sitting in the living room which had been shut off for more than  years, alongside one newspaper which reported the aftermath of the sinking of the Titanic in . Upstairs there remained rotting bedclothes, a bed pan on the floor and a flat cap left hanging on the end of a bedframe. Rebecca said she initially wasnapost surethe interior would be very interesting, but she has now created an exhibition based on the lives of Dessie and his family.  She said: I have to admit I saw the outside and wasnapost sureit was worth it. As soon as I opened the door I was blown away. I went into what I thought was a wee cottage and itaposs basically a social history museum. The cottage first appeared on maps in  and Rebecca began researching the family to help piece together the puzzle in all of the photographs.

The grieving family of Nicole Smallman, , and Bibaa Henry, , spoke of the “devastating impact” of their loss as detectives continue to hunt the murderer. They were repeatedly stabbed by a stranger who stalked them in a city park in the early hours of Saturday June  while they were dancing to music. The killer sustained a serious injury as the sisters fought for their lives and left a trail of blood. In a statement, the parents of the two sisters said: “The greatest fear of any parent is that they will outlive their children. “What makes our situation unique is that two adored sisters were murdered together on the same night. “The grief we feel is palpable, our beautul and talented daughters gone.” The fact the sisters were dancing to music with fairy lights meant their attacker could have stalked them from a distance without fear of being heard. Police have received more than  calls from the public following an appeal for information. The sisters were killed in Fryent Country Park, in Wembley, northwest London, after meeting friends there to celebrate Bibaa’s birthday.  Searches of the scene are continuing, but police have found the murder weapon. They also recovered their mobile phones from a pond in the park. Police said the pair were in “good spirits” and “taking selfie pictures, listening to music and dancing with fairy lights” until at least .am on June . Friends had left their celebration throughout the evening, with the sisters ending up alone in the park by around .am. Their last contact with friends and family was about .am, police said. The bodies of the two women were found next to each other shortly after pm on June .  The killer appears to have spent time trying hide his victims in a wooded area. The sisters’ mother is Wilhelmina Smallman, the Church of England’s first BAME female archdeacon. Bibaa, from Brent in north-west London, was an “exceptional” senior social worker and “a passionate advocate for safeguarding vulnerable children and families”. Her family said that before she qualied she would drive disabled children to their activities, “singing as they drove along”.  She loved her family, including her father, a former amateur boxing champion and building contracting company owner, and mother, who trained as a teacher and to become a priest. Nicole, from Harrow in north-west London, was the youngest of three sisters, described as someone who “saw beauty in everything” and had a “very calm and positive attitude towards most things in le”. Her family said she was “a strong advocate for humanitarian causes and saving our planet” as well as an “amazing photographer, actor and singer” with a “silky smooth” voice. “Friends and family all agree she was beautul both inside and out,” her family said. They added: “Bibaa and Nicole were sisters whose untimely deaths we will spend the rest of our lives trying to come to terms with. “The tributes for our girls keep flooding in it has been comforting, heartbreaking and at times overwhelming. Faith and prayer is keeping us going. I’m not sure how we’d get through this without it.” "},{"url":null,"title":"latest coronavirus hotspots high r","story":"NewsLatest coronavirus hotspots with a high R rate - what is the infection rate near you The R number, which is the effective reproduction value of a disease, is now close to one in parts of UK and so there are fears theyll be a second wave of Covid-ShareCommentsByBradley JollyDigital journalist:,  JUN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video explained-what-r-number-how-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,info:,article:,info:,],hasLeadVideo:true,evergreenArticle:,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news latest-coronavirus-hotspots-high-r-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The forces are clashing over whether a letter informing Madeleineaposs parents her case was being treated as murder was passed on to the family. Madeleine has been missing for thirteen years since vanishing, aged three, from a holiday apartment in Portugal she had been staying in with family. Her body or any trace of her has ever been found. But German authorities have recently made a bombshell claim that they believe she is dead, as they unveiled a new key suspect in the case.  German prosecutor Hans Christian Wolters claimed his office informed Kate and Gerry McCann that authorities in the country believe their daughter is dead. But earlier this week the McCanns rubbished these claims, using their official website to issue a rare public statement insisted they have not received any correspondence from German investigators. Mr Wolters then insisted two letters were indeed sent via the Met Police in London, alleging British detectives then failed to pass them on. The first letter, dispatched at the end of May, confirmed that German police were treating the case as a murder, while the second was sent last week to update them on the investigation, Mr Wolters claimed.  But this afternoon Scotland Yard hit back, saying it did pass on a letter to the McCanns last week, but from the German federal police and not the prosecutorsapos office. A statement from the Met said the letter did not state there was evidence that Madeleine is dead. Scotland Yard added that the force has not received any such letter from the German prosecutor and is still treating the case as a missing person investigation. A spokesman for the Met said today: Following reports in the national press about the investigation into the disappearance of Madeleine McCann, we are issuing this clarication. The Met received one letter from the Bundeskriminalamt[German Federal Criminal Police Office] on June , which was passed to the family.  The letter did not state that there was evidence or proof that Madeleine is dead - the Met continue to investigate Madeleineaposs disappearance as a missing person investigation. No letter has been received by the Met from the German prosecutor. The row has stemmed from an appeal for information made by German, British and Portuguese police at the start of this month for information about new prime suspect, Christian Brueckner. Scotland Yard maintained on June  there was no evidence to suggest Maddie - who would have turned  on May  - was in fact dead.  But on a German TV appeal just hours later, detectives said they were treating it as a murder inquiry. German prosecutors said they suspect the man they have named only as aposChristian Bapos abducted and murdered Madeleine.They also revealed they are investigating a -year-old child sex offender for murder, but have admitted they do not have enough evidence to charge anyone in the case. The -year-old German national Brueckner is a convicted paedophile, and has now been widely identied across the media as the key suspect. He is currently in prison serving time for drug dealing, and could be freed next monthhis conviction over a  rape of an elderly American woman is overturned. He has refused to speak to detectives investigating the Maddie case so far. Brueckner has racked up  convictions across Europe, including for sex offences against children, drug offences, theft and forgery.  He is serving a -month prison sentence for drug dealing and could be freed by July the European Court of Justice overturns his conviction for the rape of the -year-old victim. The woman was attacked in September  in her flat in Praia da Luz, and Brueckner lived about half a mile from her home at the time. Maddie vanished from the same resort about  months later. Brueckner was finally apprehended in  for the rape and jailed for seven years.He is appealing his conviction, claiming German police broke law by extraditing him from Portugal on a drugs charge but then putting him on trial for rape. Met Police detectives have said that the suspect was seen in the area around the resort of Praia da Luz, in the days and weeks before Maddie vanished on May , .

The German admitted he was a convicted child abuser after appearing in court in Portugal for theft in . Brueckner told the judge he served  months in prison for a sex attack on a youth in his homeland when he was a teen. The revelation that authorities knew of his conviction will pile further pressure on Portuguese officials. A senior Policia Judiciaria source said before that Brueckner was never quizzed because police did not know he was a sex offender. Detectives investigating Madeleine’s disappearance in Praia da Luz in May  questioned dozens of known sex offenders living in the area. But Brueckner, now , was never interviewed and ed to his native Germany months later. Brueckner was caught stealing fuel from HGVs in Portimao, Algarve, in April . In his first court appearance at the Judicial Court of Portimao, told the judge he was convicted of thefts and sexual offences at age . He molested a girl age six in Baia, in . It is unclearthe admission was passed to police by court officials.  Last week, a police source said of Brueckner’s conviction: “Back then, there was not the exchange of information between European police forces. The Policia Judiciaria didn’t know about it.” Brueckner’s suspected involvement in Madeleine’s abduction only came to light in , following a police appeal. An informant came forward claiming he confessed to him in a bar that he knew what had happened to her.  Last week a police source told Portuguese newspaper Expresso that “nearly all” Portuguese and foreign sex offenders were questioned. The paper said: “Although Brueckner arrived in Portugal in  after fleeing a child sex abuse conviction, he wasn’t on that list of predators. “That’s because back then, there was not the exchange of information between European police forces that takes place today. “That case of sexual abuse of a minor did not cross the German borders and that meant the PJ didn’t know about it.  “The German was known to police in Portugal, but for petty crimes he’d been convicted of which didn’t raise any alarm bells in May .” Earlier this month Policia Judiciaria deputy director Carlos Farinha tried to blame Scotland Yard for Brueckner slipping through the net. He claimed the German’s name was among hundreds passed on to the Met’s Operation Grange team in . Mr Farinha said: “If the suspicions about this man were so obvious, he would have been the subject of requests made by the British. “These requests were always authorised by Portugal, but those requests about him were never made. “If the PJ is being accused of giving Brueckner a lack of priority, the same could be said of the politan Police.”  Brueckner’s suspected involvement in Madeleine’s abduction only came to light in  following a police appeal. An informant came forward claiming the drter confessed to him in a bar that he knew what had happened to her. German prosecutors say they have evidence Madeleine, from Rothley, Leicestershire, is dead and are conducting a murder inquiry. It emerged today that police destroyed a van belonging to Brueckner which could have held vital clues about the case. He slept in the battered Bedford van at beaches on the Algarve and may have been using it when she vanished in May .  The German was in the van with jobless carpenter Tatschl when they were caught carrying out the  diesel thefts. He was given permission to get the vehicle back after his arrest but did not collect it within a mandatory ten-day period. However court records do not make it clearhe picked it up at a later date - and was using it when Madeleine disappeared. Expresso claimed it was actually seized by officers in November  after he failed to pay a fine for the fuel theft. The van was not swept for forensic evidence that German authorities are now desperately searching for.  Expresso said the blue Bedford CF was kept in a police compound in Portimao for  months before being scrapped. According to court documents seen by the newspaper it had the Portuguese registration plate AZ. Brueckner’s connection to the van has not previously been revealed by German or British police. They have only released details of two vehicles - a VW T Westfalia camper-van and a black Jaguar XJR . Brueckner also drove a mustard VW estate in Portugal and later owned a German-registered Tfin Alegro winnebago. The German paedophile lived in the Algarve from  until shortly after Madeleine disappeared from Praia da Luz.  He stayed in a dilapidated farmhouse close to the popular resort, where he often entertained his British girlfriend. But Brueckner disappeared in early , leaving the property a “rat-infested mess” according to one British neighbour.

The Duchess of Sussex had a gnawing urgency to leave the UK and now wants to be at the forefront of the Black Lives Matter movement, a pal said. Meghan, , moved to Calornia this year after she and Prince Harry quit their royal roles. A close friend is reported to have told DailyMail: Meghan said her work as a leader is more important than ever right now and that she’s been speaking with Oprah and other community leaders on how she can be part of the solution. Meghan feels like her mission goes far beyond acting. She said she wants to use her voice for change and hasn’t ruled out a career in politics. The insider said Meghan believes she was destined to fight against racism. In a speech to students at her old school, Immaculate Heart School in Los Angeles, she spoke about African-American citizens killed by police. She said: George Floydaposs le mattered and Breonna Tayloraposs le mattered and Philando Castileaposs le mattered and Tamir Riceaposs le mattered. She spoke of her absolute devastation at racial isions and the death of George Floyd, telling girls graduating at her old high school: Iaposm so sorry you have to grow up in a world where this is still present.  Meghan is said to be absolutely mortied after her best friend Jessica Mulroney threatened to sue a black influencer and can no longer be associated with her, it has been reported. Jessica, , has been fired from ABC and her show has been cancelled after she threatened to sue Sasha Exeter following a row over racism on Instagram.

As reopened retailers prepared for a post-lockdown sales surge, she said: “I wish all businesses every success.” The Royal Family today pitched in to help get Britain spending again as shops prepared for a bumper month of post-lockdown sales. After nearly three months of closure and uncertainty, retailers have reopened in an effort to ­kickstart the battered economy. The Queen told of her pride in firms that supported the NHS and ­the most vulnerable during the crisis, as they battled to stay afloat. And the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge today joined the family effort to encourage people to visit local businesses. It comes as shoppers are predicted to spend £billion this month and bring fresh hope to the high street. The Queen spoke amid a wave of support for the Mirror’s Shop for Britain campaign. In a message as patron of the British Chambers of Commerce, she said: “As many organisations around the country are reopening, I send my best wishes and support to business communities across the UK, Commonwealth and across the world. “At a time of great dficulty for many, it is heartwarming to see the civic response and generosity of so many businesses, small and large, to the challenges posed, whether supporting the health sector or vulnerable communities.  “It gives me great pride to see the contribution you and your members are making to help firms, champion trade and rebuild communities. I wish all ­businesses every success in their endeavours in the weeks and months ahead.” Prince William today lent his support to family-run Smiths the Bakers in King’s Lynn, Norfolk – not far from his Anmer Hall home where he, Kate and their children George, six, Charlotte, five and ­two-year-old Louis, have been staying during lockdown. The firm’s business mostly comes from wholesale, including to schools, which had closed. But it is now starting to see customers . William, , told Paul and Therese Brandon, who run the shop: “The important thing is that shops like yours can get the footfall back in again and the high street and town feel like it’s getting a little bit more back to normal.  I think everyone’s just been, you know, in a daze. They don’t quite know what to make of it all.” Scanning their products, he added: “I can’t come in here and not buy anything, so have you got any pain au chocolat at all  “My children will not talk to meI turn up without enough.” The prince bought four, costing a total of £.. Pulling out his contactless card, he declared: “I hope this works. Good, it’s still working, first time out in a while.” Not far away, Kate visited Fakenham Garden Centre – choosing plants and seeds for the couple’s children. The -year-old told owners Martin and Jennie Turner: “They love it. It’s such a great space for children and families to come to. “I’ve been food shopping but I have to say I haven’t been out a huge amount, but it’s good and so important, now as things start to ease, people know they can go out and particularly to places like this.” In another boost for Britain, banking trade body UK Finance backed our campaign. Its managing director of commercial finance, Stephen Pegge, said: “High streets play a vital role in local communities and will be central to the UK’s economic recovery. “We are proud to be supporting the Mirror’s Shop for Britain campaign.” UK Finance revealed banks provided , bounceback loans worth £.billion to retailers and wholesalers during lockdown. Many shops in England are thought to have held off reopening until today, despite getting the green light on Monday. Research showed shoppers can look forward to big discounts.  Brightpearl, an operations  for retailers, revealed almost three in  shop bosses questioned said the sales could dwarf those offered on Black Friday and Boxing Day. Official figures out today revealed a ­better-than-expected recovery in retail sales last month. Takings jumped nearly % between April and May, the Office for National Statistics showed. Intu, which owns Manchester’s ­Trafford Centre and Lakeside in Essex, said visitor numbers since Monday were up % on last week. George Brown, of investment bank Investec, predicted retail sales could rise another % in June. That would be an extra £billion, taking spending back above the £billion. He added: “Signicantly, this would take retail sales pretty much back to the levels seen in February.” Experts believe the online sales surge will slow as more shops reopen.  But Centre for Retail Research director Professor Joshua Bamfield warned the high street recovery would be slow. He said of today’s trading: “I think it will be reasonable, but it won’t be stupendous.” The Government has extended measures to prevent struggling high street stores being evicted during the summer until September.Best high street bargains as shops reopen The high street reopened this week and bargains abound.

More than  per cent even said they have enjoyed their new digital lives, while a fth feel they are more productive thanks to the time they have gained from not having to travel to dferent places. Almost a third also said lockdown has proved they can be just as productive working from home, with  per cent planning to ask their employerthey can work from home in the future. A spokesman for Virgin Media, which commissioned the research, said: Itaposs great to see how well the nation has adjusted to living their lives online over the past few months. Brits have embraced digitally living and will maintain many of their new online habits even when lockdown is over. Whether itaposs catching up with friends and family via video calls, exercising along to online fitness instructors, to learning new languages over YouTube. With more people being just as productive while working from home, we expect to see more flexible working in the future, as workers have shown they can do their job as efficiently from home as all they need is a seamless internet connection. The poll also revealed a aposJoe Wicksapos effect with Brits spending on average two hours and  minutes exercising to online fitness classes. As a result, more than a quarter have worked out more than ever before, with  per cent planning to continue to follow internet-based exercises classes once lockdown is lted.

Yoga classes, digital aposbirthday partiesapos and streaming live music and theatre performances are among other online activities people plan to keep doing. The results also revealed that Brits are honing their DIY skills by turning to online tutorials with almost a fth saying they will watch more how-to-guides in the future.

And Britain could bask in the hottest day of the year so far next week, with sunny weather moving in from the weekend. Met Office meteorologists said temperatures are forecast to rise day by day, and could reach C in London by Wednesday.The current record for this year was set on May , when the mercury reached .C at Santon Downham in Suffolk. This beat the previous record set just the day before when Londonaposs St Jamesaposs Park recorded a high of .C. The BBC forecasts temperatures of C in London and the South East on Wednesday and Thursday next week. By comparison, it says Spanish holiday island Majorca will experience highs of C on the same days. Met Office Chief Meteorologist, Andy Page said: “Saturday will be brighter with many of us enjoying a dry day with warm sunshine and just a few isolated showers. A band of rain will move east across the UK during Saturday night, clearing Sunday morning, then it’ll be another bright day for most on Sunday with sunny spells and scattered showers, these turning heavy across Northern Ireland and Scotland.” Early next week it will stay unsettled across north-western parts of the UK, where however it’ll be warm and dry with temperatures continuing to rise through the week. Deputy Chief Meteorologist Martin Young said: “By the middle of next week we’ll see temperatures across much of England and Wales widely climbing into the mid to high twenties Celsius and it will probably be hot in parts of southern and eastern England, as temperatures peak close to  Celsius.  “It’s possible Northern Ireland and Scotland will join the rest of the country in seeing a spell of warmer weather later next week, as this hot air from the continent extends northwards across the UK. “We’re keeping a close eye on the possibility of severe thunderstorms developing later next week too, triggered by the warm continental air.” Today: Most places will be dry with sunny spells and feeling warmer than the last few days. One or two isolated showers are likely. Cloud, wind and rain arriving in Northern Ireland by evening. Tonight A band of rain and strong winds will move eastwards, clearing western areas by dawn. Wind touching gale force around some western coasts, while rain will be heavy in places.

I’m still in disbelief months later. It was bonkers for a while. When we’d first met our babe months earlier, his little smiling face melted my heart. Now that we had him home, it was still so hard to believe he was ours….a lot like it felt when we brought Ivy home from the hospital. Our poor boy must have been so confused to not have his foster family with him suddenly. He didn’t sleep well for a long time but throughout the day, he was - and still is the most smiling little ray of sunshine ever. Because we had constant social worker visits and calls and checks it felt like we were just babysitting for him for a long time and that was really, really hard. He’s a super clever little boy and when he started walking at only  months old, he was into everything. Boisterous, inquisitive and feisty. He bumped his forehead and we followed instructions from social workers to inform themhe ever has a bump….. it turned into an absolute nightmare for us. It was absolutely horric and even though we followed NHS guidelines for bumps , we were told one night thatwe didn’t bring him into AE, someone would come and collect him from our home. I was absolutely devastated to be treated this way and for them to remind usthat he was still classed as a ‘cared for’ child and we have to do whatever they ask. At one point, they even said they would escort us to the doctor. It was horrible. I  billion percent understand that they have to be soooo careful with adopted children because of all the horror stories that have happened in the past. But we had been subjected to the most thorough checks imaginable, character references, training, everything. The fact that we couldn’t be trusted with our own child was a massive blow. Obviously he was fine and the staff at the hospital thought it was ridiculous that we’d been forced to bring him in but that incident put us on absolute egg shells until the adoption was finalised.It was definitely a challenge but worth every single ounce of stress for those chubby little cheeks of his. He is the most snuggly little boy in the world, he loves a hug and it’s just the most glorious feeling in the world when he toddles over to me and hugs my legs. Ivy and him get on so well. I couldn’t have asked for it to be more perfect. It took Ivy a few weeks to adapt. It was a massive change for her and there were night terrors, tantrums - and of course jealousy. I felt terrible, we’d just turned her little world upside down. We honestly thought she wouldn’t cope. But she couldn’t help herself, she caved to his snuggles in no time and we were amazed how quickly she adapted.  We reminded her - and still do how special she is to us. We told her that she would always be our number one girl and Bill was our number one boy. We had one on one time every day so she still knew that we were there whenever she wanted. It helped so much and that’s something so important to consider when a new child comes into a family! Now we are free of scrutiny - don’t get me wrong, most of our social workers were incredible and we will keep in touch with them for a long long time. But now it just feels so good for him to be completely ours. For a while, I never dared to dream that this would be possible but like I always say, when you have hope, anything is possible.

Eleanor Williams, , of Barrow-in-Furness, faces seven counts of perverting the course of justice, which the court heard she denies. In a hearing at Preston Crown Court, prosecutor Jaime Hamilton QC, said the case involved a number of separate but connected incidents. The first incident was in October  in which Williams made a  allegation of rape and sexual assault against a male and then manufactured evidence to support the claim, he said. Three allegations of a similar nature were made against a second man which the Crown say was supported by evidence fabricated in text messages and social media posts by the defendant.  Williams faced two further counts in relation to an extensive allegation of trafficking and sexual exploitation by two men which the prosecution will say were wholly  and supported by fabricated messages, said Mr Hamilton.

As a marine biology student, the -year-old was desperate to get close to some of the most impressive beasts on the planet. Alongside her studies, Keltie also worked as a part-time trainer at Sealand in British Columbia in Canada. The popular attraction had first opened in  and was home to an orca called Haida, who had been captured the year before. He was a huge hit and aquarium bosses soon wanted a mate for him and caught Chimo, a killer whale who was a partial albino. Tragically, the orca died just two years later and Haida mourned her death, remaining alone for several years. But Sealand was not deterred and captured a second female orca, Nootka II, to be Haidaaposs mate. She died just nine months after arriving at Sealand. A third mate, Nootka III, then arrived at the aquarium, but Haida had absolutely no interest in her. By now, orcas were big business and when Dr Murray Newman, Sealandaposs founder, got a call from a man claiming to be feeding an injured killer whale calf by hand in the ocean, he went to investigate. The young orca, who they named Miracle, was suffering from a bullet wound and Sealand was granted permission to transport him for emergency care. Benefiting from the medical attention, Miracle soon became a popular attraction but had to be kept separated from Haida. But after a few years, tragedy struck when Shadow, Miracleaposs aquarium seal companion, died after drowning in the nets surrounding the pen they shared. Chillingly, Sealand er Larry McInerney told the documentary Who Killed Miracle  that Miracle had learned that by damaging the nets ers would come into her pen. It meant she could play with them but over the years she became more aggressive and this caused problems for the drivers, who struggled to keep up with maintenance on her pen. She too died a few years later and in the uproar that followed owners agreed to release Haida back into the wild. Sadly, he passed away just days before his release, although there was no evidence of foul play. Soon after, Sealand brought three new orcas to the aquarium - Tilikum, Nookta IV and Haida II. The three killer whales had been captured in Iceland after they were told to stop taking orcas from the water around Washington. But the relationship between the three orcas was far from harmonious. For almost a year, the three huge orcas were kept in a holding tank near Reykjavík, before they could be transported to Canada. Tilikum, who was now around  and a half feet long, could only swim slowly in circles or simply lie on the surface of the water. Gone were the sounds of the ocean that he had been used to for the first two years of his le, replaced with the low hum of the mechanical filtration that kept his tank clean. Tilikum, which means friend in Chinock, was finally moved to his new home on Sealand at the end of  - but this would be where his nightmare would begin. Tilikum, the youngest of the three was said to be bullied and chased by the two bigger and older females. Orca pods are dominated by females but there are reports that even after Haida II had become established as the leader, she still bullied Tilikum. This seemed to escalate at night so as soon as the final show of the day was over the three huge beasts of the deep were shoved into metal pods that were just  feet across and  feet deep. This would be their home for the next  hours before they were needed to perform again. One trainer, who worked at Sealand for two years in the late s, said the orcas would often emerge the following day with scratches and cuts from where they had rubbed against the side of their pods. Seven days a week, the orcas had to perform every hour, eight times a day and it seemed to be taking its toll. Both Nootka and Tilikum suffered from stomach ulcers and had to be given medication. And each of the whales had their own, distinct, personality. Tilikum, the youngest, was the most playful - he was described as youthful, energetic and eager to learn. Biologist Eric Walters, who was working at Sealand at the time, said: Tilikum was our favorite. He was the one we all really liked to work with. Nootka was unpredictable, possibly because of her health problems and had bitten her trainers and even a blind woman in the audience who had been invited to pat her. Sealand eventually recruited help from Bruce Stephens, a former SeaWorld head trainer, who was asked to make recommendations to improve practices at the aquarium. He is said to have given each trainer a handbook, which warnedyou fail to provide your animals with the excitement they need, you may be certain they will create the excitement themselves. The move was welcomed by biologist Eric but soon he realised it seemed to have made little dference. He said: They basically ran it like you would run McDonaldaposs. It just canapost be good for an animal that is so intelligent to do the same thing every day. It wasnapost long before Bruceaposs warnings began to take shape. The orcas would pounce on anythnig new that landed in the water. And they wouldnapost give it up freely, playing with items and refusing to hand them back to the trainers. By May , Eric had quit his job at Sealand and wrote a scathing letter to the Canadian Federation of Humane Societies, highlighting the safety concerns he had about the aquarium. He had a chilling final warning: I feel that sooner or later someone is going to get seriously hurt. Then on February , , just as the final killer whale show finished for the day, Keltie Byrne was tidying up when she slipped and fell half into the pool. She struggled to pull herself out but before she could haul herself back onto dry land, one of the whales had pulled her in. Keltie was a competitive swimmer but even so, she couldnapost escape the predators of the ocean. Head of animal training at Sealand at the time, Steve Huxter, said: They never had a plaything in the pool that was so interactive. They just got incredibly excited and stimulated. By now, the other trainers had realised something was seriously wrong and were frantically trying to attract the attention of the three orcas. They were throwing food into the water to seethey could distract them and bellowing recall commands. In a last ditch attempt to help Keltie, they three a le ring close enough for her to grab - but working together, the orcas kept her away from it. It was dark and chaotic and the trainers desperately trying to help from the pool side couldnapost determine which of the killer whales had hold of Keltie. Twice she managed to reach the surface and each time her horrying screams for help echoed around the pool. After  minutes of being Tilikum, Haida and Nooktaaposs play thing, Keltie bobbed to the surface for a final time. This time, she was silent - the student had drowned. Eyewitness Nadine Kallen said at the time: She went up and down three times. They almost got her once with the hook pole, but they couldn’t - the whales were moving so fast. An inquest found that the orcas had prevented Keltie from getting out of the pool and ruled her drowning death an accident. Little more than  months after Keltieaposs tragic death, Sealand closed its doors for good. SeaWorld bought all three of the orcas, with Tilikum and Nookta moving to Orlando, while Haida and her calf, Kyuquot, were shipping to San Antonio. But this would not be the only time Tilikum would kill. Eight years after Keltieaposs horrying death Daniel Dukes was found dead on the orcaaposs back while he was in his sleeping pool. The -year-old had visited SeaWorld earlier that day and managed to avoid security cameras to stay until after dark. He got into Tilikumaposs tank, naked, and when his body was found the following morning, he was covered in cuts and bruises. An inquest ruled he had drowned. Then, SeaWorld trainer, Dawn Brancheau was killed in front of thousands of spectators at the attraction in Orlando, Florida, by the male orca on February , . Dawn, who had achieved her goal of becoming a senior trainer at Seaworld at the time of her tragic death, had studied psychology and animal behaviours at university. When she graduated, she spent two years working with dolphins at an attraction in New Jersey before landing her job at Seaworld. Two years after Dawn started work at Seaworld, she became a killer whale trainer. She made sure she was as fit and healthy as possible so she could manage to rigours of swimming with the huge beasts from the deep. Dawn was one of the star trainers at Seaworld - she was key to the killer whale shows and her face was seen on billboards advertising the park. Chillingly, four years before her tragic death,  years ago today, Dawn had spoken out about the dangers of working with orcas. She had a special relationship with the huge killer whale, Tilikum, also known as Blackfish. He was one of the largest orcas at SeaWorld and he had been in captivity for more than  years. Those who worked with her said their bond was strong and based on love and trust. John Hargrove, who was a senior trainer at Seaworld at the time of Dawnaposs death, said: We’ll never know why Tilikum made that choice to grab Dawn and pull her into the pool. He had a great relationship with her, and she had a great relationship with him. I do believe that he loved her, and I know that she loved him. It was after one of the Dine With Shamu shows that Tilikum carried out his brutal act. Tourists could watch the action as they ate and Dawn had climbed out of the pool. She was lying with her face next to Tilikumaposs - the orca she had spent countless hours with and who had always treated her as a trusted companion. Suddenly, Dawn was dragged into the water. Initially it was claimed she had been pulled into the pool by her ponytail, but there were later suggestions Tilikum had grabbed her by her shoulder. What came next was truly gruesome. Tilikum didnapost just kill his trainer, the attack was prolonged and incredibly violent. Dawn, , was not only drowned, her left arm was torn from its socket, Dawn was scalped with her hair and skin found at the bottom of the pool. Horrically, her spinal cord was severed, while she also suffered from broken ribs, a broken jaw and a post-mortem revealed she died from both drowning and blunt force injury. Chillingly, the captive whale killed his trainer and then refused to release her body. For  minutes, he kept Dawnaposs broken body on the pool with him, despite attempts from the other trainers to distract him with nets and food. Eventually, they managed to get him into a smaller, medical pool, where he was easier to calm and he finally released the body of the trainer who had spent so much time with him. Following Dawnaposs death, Tilikum was sent to spend most of his days in a pool rarely seen by the public. There are reports that he would spend hours on end just lying on the surface of the water. Tilikum died at the Florida attraction in January . Six years after Dawnaposs death SeaWorld announced they would end their programme of breeding the orcas in captivity.

Deaths in the country also rose by ,, taking the official tally to ,, although the true figure is feared to be far higher. There is no widespread testing programme in the country with the true figure of cases thought to be as many as ten times higher. Second only to the United States in both cases and deaths, Brazil confirmed its first case of the novel coronavirus on February . The virus has spread relentlessly across the continent-sized country, eroding support for right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro and raising fears of economic collapse. Brazil had reported ,, confirmed cases on Friday, with and is likely to surpass , deaths on Saturday, although weekend reporting can be lower. Even so, the true extent of the outbreak far exceeds the official figures, according to many experts, who cite a lack of widespread testing. That number of  million is much less than the real number of people who have been infected, because there is under-reporting of a magnitude of five to  times, said Alexandre Naime Barbosa, a medical professor at the Sao Paulo State University.  The true number is probably at least  million and could even be as high as  million people.COVID-, the illness caused by the coronavirus, arrived in Brazil via wealthy tourists ing from Europe to major southeastern cities such as Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro and has spread deep into the interior, reaching % of Brazilapossmunicipalities, Health Ministry data showed.Bolsonaro, sometimes called the Tropical Trump, has been widely criticized for his handling of the crisis. The country still has had no permanent health minister after losing two since April, following clashes with the president.  Bolsonaro has shunned social distancing, calling it a job-killing measure more dangerous than the virus itself. He has also promoted two anti-malarial drugs as remedies, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, despite little evidence they work. The far-right former army captainaposs handling of the crisis has prompted Brazilians to bang pots and pans regularly outside their apartments in protest, but it has not stopped him from wading into costly political battles with his own cabinet and the Supreme Court, stoking fears of instability.  Pressure from Bolsonaro and public fatigue after months of ineffective state and local isolation orders has led governors and mayors to begin lting restrictions on commerce and other economic activity. Public health experts have warned that loosening restrictions too soon threatens to accelerate contagion and drive up fatalities. We think that there will be a new wave after the loosening of these measures, said Ricardo Langer, a doctor treating COVID- patients at the MaracanÃ£ stadium field hospital in Rio de Janeiro.

Forecasters say temperatures are on the rise as we move through the weekend and into next week - with low pressure being replaced by sizzling European air moving in from the south. However, parts of the UK, especially the north west, could continue to see showers across the weekend before high temperatures next week. Met Office forecaster Alex Deakin said: Over the weekend we replace this humid air at the moment causing thunder, with another area of low pressure bringing in fresher conditions. There are signs into next week of drier, sunnier weather and perhaps warmer - specically in parts of the south. The north west is likely to remain more unsettled. We have low pressure nearby at the moment, winds are light so thunderstorms being creates are slow moving and thataposs why they are dropping a lot of rain. As we go over the next few days that is replaced by another area of low pressure - but that is coming in from the Atlantic and has very dferent characteristics. It will bring in fresher air and the winds will be stronger. After a mixture of conditions this weekend, Alex said next week could see a big change - specically for those in the south east.He added: A switch of wind direction means is pretty good news for the east coast. We switch to south westerly winds meaning eastern areas have an offshore wind so it turns much brighter and warmer. Beyond that, although low pressure is sticking nearby, it looks like it will hang out in the north west and higher pressure will move in. In the south and east high pressure means drier and sunnier weather - and it could warm up as well. European charts suggesting there is some really warm air nearby that could allow for some it to waft up across parts of the south. Some parts of the UK hit by a deluge of rain saw flooding after low pressure fronts brought stormy conditions. Hundreds of homes were flooded yesterday – some for a third time this year. Emergency services pumped water out of houses in Pentre, Wales, a village flooded twice when Storm Dennis hit in February. Yellow thunderstorm warnings were in place for London, southern England and parts of south Wales. Ryan Shelton posted footage of a submerged street in Ilkeston, Derbys, and said the flooding was “worse than ever”. The -year-old said it was “quite scary” how  minutes of rain left .m of floodwater.

A great team goal from one end to a goal in five touches.Derek McKay skins the full-back, what a pass toForrest, who shoots, goalkeeper parries and McKay scores.#Steve has summed up the goal perfectly, although it must be said the #full-back# McKay left in his wake during the break forward before playing in Forrest was Hoops legend Tommy Gemmell, while McKay#s finish # which put the Reds - up on the day # was also notable for being the th Scottish Cup goal scored by the Dandy Dons.More than , people packed into Hampden for the national trophy showpiece in  # one of the most famous days in Dons history. It is quite right for one of McKay#s goals, which completed a fairytale cup run for the late attacker, to be among the candidates for Aberdeen#s best ever goal.Speaking to the Evening Express in , McKay said: #Celtic kept pounding us, but we knew the cup was coming to Aberdeen when I made it - inside the last  minutes.#I back-heeled the ball over Tommy Gemmell’s head at the half-way line and raced away with it before passing to Jim Forrest, but his shot got blocked.#I was the first to reach the rebound and blasted the ball into the Celtic net.#Win a   Aberdeen kids kit and £ Smyths voucher in our Aberdeen#s Greatest Goal competition\" title\"#Win a   Aberdeen kids kit and £ Smyths voucher in our Aberdeen#s Greatest Goal competition# # Evening Express\" src\"https:www.eveningexpress fp sport football aberdeen-fc donsnews help-us-find-the-best-strike-ever-from-a-dandy-don embed # secretzPdlfpkOE\" data-secret\"zPdlfpkOE\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"We want youngsters to have a go at imitating our Aberdeen#s Greatest Goal contenders, with the club agreeing to give away a kids# home kit and kids# away kit for the two best efforts as chosen by our  of judges.

Mindfulness concentrates your mind on the ‘here and now’ and is a proven way of dealing with mild depression or anxiety.Focus on what the plants feel like – not just their fragrance when touched – from leathery and lacey to soft and smooth. You can also mix plants that are great to touch with tactile hard landscaping elements such as a water feature, smooth polished round pebbles or the glazed ceramics.Some top touching plants and features to considerLeaves # try Stachys byzantina, commonly known as Lamb#s Ear. Its soft, downy, furry silver-grey leaves are a favourite among gardeners who tend to use it for ground cover in rich soil. As a contrast there is Acuba japonicawhich has smooth, glossy leathery leaves.Flowers # who can resist touching a bottlebrush Callistemon cintrinus – bundles of tiny delicate stamen flowers form a brush that’s soft to touch – or the soft paper-thin petals of a poppy Papaver orientale.Grasses # run your hand over the arching, thread-like leaves of feathery Stipa tenuissima also known as Mexican feather grass or the more robust drought proof ornamental Festuca glauca with thread-like blue foliage that forms dense mounds.Bark – tree bark can also provide a tactile experience especially when it’s the stunning flowering cherry Prunus serrulate with mahogany coloured bark that peels away in bands round the trunk.Landscaping – you can easily y the textures in your garden by choosing dferent hard landscaping options. If you have smooth pebbles surrounding a water feature that you can run your hand over and through, you could place lichen-covered rocks in another area of the garden.Our general well-being is intrinsically linked to the natural world which is why Thrive – the gardening for health charity – has developed the Thrive Gardening Club.For fortnightly tips on getting the most out of your garden, whatever your age or ability, and information on how gardening can keep you healthy and feeling good visit www.thrive.org.uk get-involved keep-in-touch subscribe-to-gardening-clubThrive is the UK’s leading provider of social and therapeutic horticulture programmes using gardening to bring about positive changes in the lives of people living with disabilities, ill health or mental health issues, or who are isolated, disadvantaged or vulnerable."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor may 22 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,Mental Health Awareness Week, now in its th year, runs from May  to May .This year, the theme for the week is kindness and across the country, people will be celebrating kindness in digital and creative ways within social distancing restrictions.The last couple of months, with all the uncertainty of the virus and the impact of lockdown, have been an extremely stressful and worrying time for many people across the Highlands and Islands. People who may have previously felt isolated in remote and rural communities may be feeling this even more acutely at this time, so it’s important they know support is available.Across the region, many people have also sadly faced the pain of losing loved ones to the virus or have fallen ill themselves, while others have seen their livelihoods put at risk or incomes reduced. All of this has put additional strain on people’s mental well-being.This year’s Mental Health Awareness Week is putting the focus on kindness as a means of helping people through the pandemic and building a better society as we emerge from it. We see many acts of kindness in the Highlands and Islands all the time, but this week is an opportunity for people to reflect on their interactions with others and how they can try and be a little kinder during this unprecedented time.David Stewart, MSP for Highlands and Islands region.Sir,During Mental Health Awareness Week, sight loss charity RNIB Scotland is highlighting the emotional reassurance and practical help it is offering during the coronavirus lockdown.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as their families, friends and carers.Losing some or even all your sight can be devastating news to take in, but our trained helpers can support you in coming to terms with your condition and finding the way forward.RNIB is concerned the lockdown might be affecting people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older, particularly hard. The uncertainty over access to basic shopping and medication, to information in accessible formats, the social isolation and barriers to being guided because of social distancing can all add and compound to the mental and emotional stress people are experiencing.As well as our Need to Talk service, the RNIB helpline on    is available for anyone with sight loss and we continue to organise social activities over the phone and social media.We want people with sight loss to know they are not alone and that help is available.James Adams, RNIB Scotland director, Edinburgh.The Scottish Invasive Species Initiativehas launched Alien Detectives – a fun and educational online resource to help the young and not so young  learn more about alien # or non-native – invasive species.Originally designed as a school education pack, the huge array of activities now includes a wide range of fun games and activities that anyone can enjoy at home, in the garden or on local walks during lockdown.Alien Detectives includes crafts, quizzes, worksheets, presentations and puzzles all themed around invasive species and the river environment. Although primarily aimed at young people, anyone with an interest in the environment or invasive species can enjoy them too.Our project team has been busy while homeworking during lockdown to produce these fantastic resources. We hope becoming Alien Detectives will bring many hours of enjoyment to iniduals and families during lockdown, especially at a time when most young people are not in a regular school environment and might be looking for a new challenge or activities to continue their learning.Invasive non-native species might be a new topic to many but it is a really important one. Invasive species can have a major impact on our environment and native wildle and are responsible for signicant bioersity loss in Scotland and across the world. We hope these resources will help raise awareness of the impacts of invasive species and inspire more young people to learn something about them.No prior knowledge is needed and there’s lots to learn and have fun with so become an Alien Detective and help us tackle invasive species today.All of the ‘Alien Detectives’ resources can be found at www.invasivespecies.scot alien-detectives.Callum Sinclair, SISI Project Manager, Newton Stewart.Sir,We may not be able to hold picnics in the usual way just yet, but why not hold the next best thing – a virtual picnic  That way you can invite as many people as you want.National charity Family Action is running its Virtual Family Picnic from May  to May  and everyone is invited.

We stayed with Margaret and Iain McDonald at their home named Meadowview in Tarbert which was located near the school.We all enjoyed the area so much that we continued to visit every year for the next consecutive eight years.Margaret invited me to go out on the herring boats once or twice. One was named Village Maid and the other Village Belle and, needless to say, we often had kippers for breakfast, which were very nice. I remember there was a boat called the Southern Cross tied up to Cock Island # can anyone tell me any history of it and when it disappeared There also used to be a smokehouse for kippers along from Tarbert to Ardrishaig.Another fond memory I have is watching the logging trucks unloading on the quay and watching them get loaded on to large boats and I think then being shipped round to Sweden or Finland. Is that correct or not as I thought there was a paper mill at Fort William As mentioned earlier, I joined North West Ambulance Service in the s and Margaret used to send me the Argyllshire Advertiser and in one of them was an advert for recruitment to the Scottish Ambulance Service.I duly got an application form from Paisley and was all but sending the form in when I realised it would be very unfair to move so far away from our young children#s grandparents and for them to be unable to see them growing up. At the time your local pharmacist was retiring and my we Sue was a qualied pharmacist, but our children were both under school age so relied on her parents for child care. Ironically, I believe the job was filled with a Blackpool pharmacist whom I had met ocassionally.My love for Scotland continued, and we had our honeymoon travelling around Scotland and calling in at Tarbert for several days on the trip round.Our last trip up there was  in June as a treat from our daughter who accompanied us on this trip. The weather was glorious, and one day we caught the bus to Skipness and walked part of the Kintyre Way back.Another day we took the MacBrayne Ferry to Islay, which was again a glorious day out, also visited Crinan, Lochgilphead and Inveraray, followed by a couple of days fishing off the pier in Tarbert. We travelled back via Portavadie and Dunoon, and have in the past used the ferry to Arran, then Brodick, Ardrossan and home.Thank you for taking the time to read this. It has been good to share some of the memories of Argyll with you.#"},{"url":null,"title":"happy lockdown birthday june 5 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSend us a photograph of your family member or friend enjoying their special day and we will publish it and wish them a happy birthday.Remember to include their full name, age, where they are from and a bit about what you did to make the day at home special.Send your photographs to editor@argyllshireadvertiser"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures june 5 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe featured image this week was submitted by Aileen Gillies of Lochgilphead, who caught this stunning sunset on May  at Bellanoch bridge on the Crinan Canal."},{"url":null,"title":"plans in place for 2021 camanachd cup final","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsFollowing the expected cancellation of shinty’s  cup competitions, the Camanachd Association has confirmed with title sponsor Tulloch Homes and Kingussie Camanachd Club that the plan to host the final in Kingussie will be postponed for a year and will now take place on September  .The Tulloch Homes Camanachd Cup Final willto the Highland venue for the first time since  and for its th anniversary.First contested in , the final of shinty’s national knock-out cup competition promises to be a brilliant day out for all the family and a  chance to watch two of the country’s elite shinty teams.Hundreds of tickets have already been sold and to be part of this historic moment you can secure your tickets, including some exclusive offers, on shinty.The  final takes place at The Dell and will be one of the biggest stagings of the event in its -year history with live traditional music, entertainment and a dedicated Kids Zone adding to the festival feel.The first final of the Camanachd Cup took place at Inverness on April  .

But the COVID- lockdown interrupted proceedings.This season’s Scottish Cup was a bit of a disappointment with Star exiting the competition in the second round after losing out to a vastly improved Dumbarton United side -. On the plus side, the first round saw Star take on Paisley League team Pollok FC and an excellent performance saw Star run out convincing winners -, one of only four defeats suffered by Pollok in all competitions.In the West Region Cup, Star progressed to the quarter-final again. A first round bye, a convincing - win against Cambuslang FA then a walkover saw the Lochgilphead youths face Paisley League A Division team Erskine.In a hard-fought encounter, Star matched Erskine for most of the game but with only  players available they couldn’t get the breakthrough they needed and eventually lost -.Star started their league campaign in September with a competitive match against new team Thorn, who transferred from Paisley A Division. Star lost -.Two strong performances in October saw Star record  a terric - win over Shettleston, last season’s league runners up, and a - win against St Patrick’s Sports Academy # an entertaining but nerve-wracking game.A mid-season stutter in November saw the Lochgilphead boys lose out to Cathcart -, then Clydebank -, both newcomers.The losing run continued into early December as Star faced last season’s champions Drumchapel Amateurs ending up down - at half-time before recovering their form with a committed second half display to pull it back to -. Unfortunately they lost out to a fourth Drumchapel goal as they chased the winner themselves.This set Star back on track as they finished the year with a hugely convincing performance, demolishing Cathcart -.January and February proved a real battle with the weather with wind, rain and freezing temperatures # often all three # only allowing four games to take place. Star secured fine victories over Busby, -, and Glasgow Red Star, -, and fought back to grind out creditable draws with Shettleston, -, and Place Park, another new team, -.Star played one league game in March before lockdown and again it was another entertaining game with a rollercoaster feel to it. Facing up to Drumchapel Amateurs, both teams played out another terric match which had everything.Coming back from a goal down and with only  men, Star played cracking football to race into a - lead but it took its toll as Drumchapel stuck to their task to draw level before adding a couple more goals to secure a win in the final five minutes.This was another fine season for Red Star s, competing well in a strong league, with only  signed players.Though the season was cut short, the boys played  games winning , drawing two and losing seven. They scored  goals and conceded  goals. There were some cracking games and the boys were looking forward to the knock-out stages of the league cup.Inconsistency probably cost Star a few more wins, but that’s what youth football development is all about and there is potential for the boys to develop.Well done from coaches and parents to the  boys who played this season – Craig Aitken, Zak Barclay, Gregor Brown, Keiran Caskie, Lewis Curran, Ruaridh Green, Woody Hoad, Alexander McLean, Conner McMurchy, Leon Murphy, Innes Paterson, Jamie Stewart and Tom West.Thanks for great support goes to sponsors Ardrishaig Community Trust, main strip, SC Crawford Building Contractors Limited, change strip and zip tops, Jewsons, tracksuits, and Mid Argyll Youth Development Services and the parents, supporters, referees and opposition teams that have made the season so enjoyable."},{"url":null,"title":"sheena shows the way as tarbert tees off","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsGolf started again at Glenralloch as lockdown measures were eased slightly across Scotland.The first members were on the tee at am on Friday May  for the re-opening, followed by a steady stream as the day went on.

This can be as simple as a scarf or bandana that ties behind the head.Before putting it on, you should wash your hands or use hand sanitiser and do the same after removing it.Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth at all times and store any used face coverings in a plastic bag until you have an opportunity to wash them.Do not touch the front of the face covering, or the part of the face covering that has been in contact with your mouth and nose.Once removed, make sure you clean any surfaces the face covering has touched and wash the covering regularly. The covering can be washed with other laundry, using your normal detergent.When wearing a face covering, take care to tuck away any loose ends.How do I stop my glasses from steaming up If you wear glasses, wearing a face mask at the same time can cause the lenses to steam up, making it dficult to see properly.But the common problem has an easy solution, thanks to advice from doctors in the medical journal Annals of the Royal College of Surgeons of England.To prevent the issue, doctors advise washing your glasses with soapy water before putting the mask on, and rinsing them under warm water.Then, gently dry off the lenses with a clean towel or cloth before putting them back on.Washing the lenses with soapy water leaves behind a ldquothin surfactant film that reduces misting on the lenses, meaning they now shouldnrsquot steam up when a face mask is worn.Should face coverings be worn where The current government advice states that face coverings should be worn in enclosed spaces, which includes some shops and public transport.At the moment, people are not being told to wear them outdoors, while exercising, or in schools or offices.Several airlines, including easyJet and Ryanair, have introduced a requirement for passengers to wear face masks on board.However, the government believes that face masks should be reserved for people who need them to protect against risks in their workplace, such as health and care workers."},{"url":null,"title":"borders-priest-moving-rome-new-job","story":"A BORDERS priest has accepted a high-ranking job in Rome.Nick Welsh, , has been based in Galashiels for the past two years.But he will soon be flying out to Italy after being picked for the role of vice-rector at the Scots College, where aspiring Scottish priests receive their training.Father Nick, originally from Stirling, told the Border he had ldquomixed emotions when he heard the news.He said: ldquoIrsquom quite excited, but Irsquoll have a bit of a heavy heart when I leave ndash I was just getting used to the Borders.Since , Father Nick has been administrator of the Parish of Our Lady  St Andrew, which has churches in Galashiels, Melrose and Selkirk.He said: ldquoI was really warmly welcomed here.

The only part of the square that has any real purpose and meaning is the Cenotaph.The idea that George Square is in serious need of a makeover is nothing new, of course, and there have been ious  dawns and broken promises over the years, not least the outrageous fiasco of  ndash remember that  ndash which wasted huge amounts of public money and goodwill alike. But the two defining events of  - coronavirus and the Black Lives Matter protests -offer Glasgow the best opportunity in a generation to finally get this right and transform George Square into the vibrant civic centre Glaswegians deserve.Letrsquos start with the pandemic, which will continue to damage the economic and social pull of town and city centres. As lockdown restrictions are gradually lted we will grasp a new reality ndash fewer shops, restaurants, bars and cultural attractions than before, with those that do re-open unable to work at full capacity for now. Answers to the sort of questions around attracting people to city centres that were already stumping businesses, planners and local authorities even before coronavirus hit have become all the more pressing.Thatrsquos where a proper revamp of George Square comes in, a key step forward in boosting Glasgowrsquos economy and cultural capital in the wake of the pandemic. What should the square contain  That would be for citizens to decide, but herersquos a few quick ideas that presume an eventual end to social distancing: an ampitheatre for live music, theatre and comedy, proper seating, pop-up pods for community groups, a food and craft market, arts and exhibition space, murals, a garden and childrenrsquos play area.As for the fate of the statues, again, it would be for the people to decide whether they still have a place in this new urban realm. Not that we would want to forget our past, of course. But surely we can find new and more creative ways to confront, commemorate and celebrate it, taking in voices that were previously ignored ndash women, ethnic minorities, working class people, gay people, the disabled ndash reflecting the ersity of our city as it is now.Rather than an expensive international competition for designs ndash letrsquos learn from  ndash a three-month public consultation could be held, and a  of local architects, planners, artists, businesspeople and community groups convened to create perhaps three dferent plans, which would then be voted on by the people of Glasgow.

Surely a mixture of public, private and philanthropic funding could be sourced Glasgow City Council has already started the conversation that could make all this happen, by bringing forward the pedestrianisation of George Square and suspending a third of city centre parking bays to make room for walkers and cyclists.I would urge council leader Susan Aitken and her team to think bigger. A commitment to redesign George Square would offer an exciting, positive and inclusive focus for Glaswegians in the tough months ahead. The end result could be what Glasgow has been crying out for for a generation: a proud and modern civic centrepiece that is worthy of our great city, a place that excites, entertains, and educates, that makes us feel part of something bigger.

But in Scotland, thanks to Covid it could be within sight. Schoolrsquos out, not just for summer but for the foreseeable future.At least that was the educational prognosis from the Deputy First Minister, John Swinney, at the weekend. He announced a new ldquoblended learning, which sounds like something to do with tea, but is a euphemism for Scottish children spending most of the school week at home.:Opinion: Brian Beacom: Why I am edging slowly towards the pro-independence point of viewParents in Edinburgh were told that, when schools go back on August , theyrsquoll be lucky to see their children getting face-to-face teaching for a third of the time. Many Scottish pupils might only get one day a week. This is not so much blended as half-baked.Mr Swinney also endorsed the view of Larry Flanagan, general-secretary of the teachers union the EIS, that next yearrsquos exam diet should be cancelled, like this yearrsquos. Few in the education establishment much like competitive exams at the best of time, so it might seem unsurprising that they have been dropped ndash for the first time since .Parents, who donrsquot seem to have been consulted by Mr Swinneyrsquos misnamed Education Recovery Group, are furious. They see this as an abdication of responsibility by bureaucrats who care nothing about educational attainment and are putting the interests of their own client groups above the welfare of children.Parents in Edinburgh formed an instant pressure group,  , to demand proper, face-to-face education at least  per cent of the week. Sarah Chisnall says they also want serious benchmarked online learning for the other part of the ldquoblended learning experience, with a regular amount of teacher face time.Three months into school lockdown, it is surely a scandal that nothing of the like has been done. Home schooling is practically non-existent in many areas, according to parents, with some children having no contact with anything remotely resembling an actual teacher on line. Google, FIFA  and Instagram are poor substitutes.A UK-wide study from University College London confirmed yesterday that two million children across Britain have done little or no schoolwork at home during the lockdown. Four million have not had regular contact with a teacher and six million have not ed their most recent assignment.Nicola Sturgeon, who recognises a political disaster when she sees one, leaped in to try to undo the damage done by her deputy. ldquoIt is absolutely not the case that we are planning on blended learning to last a year or anything like it, she said on Monday, giving no guarantees that it wonrsquot.The First Minister promised that face-to face-teaching will happen ldquoas soon as possible. Exams will go ahead ndash well maybe ndash and she hinted that the two-metre rule in social distancing might be relaxed in schools.ldquoDelusional. said the SNPrsquos sometime coalition partners, the Scottish Greens, which has a lot of teachers amongst its membership. Like Larry Flanagan of the EIS they think next yearrsquos exams should be cancelled because there is no safe way of preparing children for them.Tell that to the parents. We know that the risk to children is vanishingly small. To prevent pupils spreading the disease to teachers and parents, schools could use masks, hand sanitisers, ldquobubble cohorts, and perspex screens.It is not aschildren arenrsquot associating already out of school.

It manestly isnrsquot in supermarkets, parks and public transport either. So why is this bureaucratic red line being applied in schools Why is the education of their children not a priority, they say  With classes and schools only able to handle a third of children, the obvious answer is to increase the number of classrooms and the number of teachers.Break out of the school precincts and start deploying unused venues like cinemas and churches, even marquees. Bring in supply teachers and retired teachers to bump up the numbers.It would of course mean more than the pound million or so in additional funding the Government is currently offering the local authorities. But the Scottish education and skills budget is more than pound. billion. Surely some of that could be reallocated, as was the case in the NHS when they set up ldquopop-up hospitals like the Louisa Jordan.At any rate, Nicola Sturgeon now has a major fight on her hands. The EIS says, correctly, that the two-metre rule is still what the Governmentrsquos scientic advisers say is necessary to prevent a second wave of Covid-. They are not going to sht on that, eventhe World Health Organisation has been talking about reducing it to one metre.There are two million parents out there and only , teachers. Ms Sturgeon can do her political arithmetic. She is going to have to spray some serious cash to get the schools back on any kind of ing basis.Scottish teachers got a  per cent pay hike from the Government last year. I suspect Mr Swinney is going to have to loosen the purse strings again to prevent the deschooling of a generation of Scottish children.The late Ivan Illich, whose thinking influenced the Curriculum for Excellence, envisaged children teaching themselves, using technology, even though he was writing before the internet existed.

New Zealand has achieved much the same with Covid: it had had no new cases at all for  days, until two UK visitors tested positive this week.The lower the prevalence of the virus within the population, the easier it is to pinpoint and contain new clusters, prevent a second wave and allow a fullerto normalityalbeit at a later date.Whatever our progress, Scotland recorded  new cases between May  and June , so eradication is still elusive.: Why the science has no clear-cut answers to Scotlands two-metre dilemmaIn this context, the decision not to re-open beer gardens is all about a better result later: for example, reducing virus prevalence enough that physical distancing can be halved to one metre in time for the hospitality traderesuming on July .Ms Sturgeon said there is emerging evidence that pubs, restaurants and gyms are \"hotspots for transmission\". Japanese research found that the risk of infection is around  times higher indoors than outdoors.So why is it safe to open outdoor food markets but not beer gardens  One theory is that people in beer gardens spend a prolonged period in same company, increasing the risk of transmissionsomeone in the group is infected but not yet showing symptoms.They are also more likely to talk loudly, shout, or even singwhich is also linked to transmission.

However, tidal and wave action continued to drive erosion under the tree roots and actually encouraged erosion.ldquoThese days, the awareness and understanding of the cycles that sand dunes go through ndash and their value as habitats in their own right ndash is much more prevalent so we are looking at how best we can restore sand dunes to their natural state.Sand dunes help to protect the coastline and are likely to be an increasingly important defence against sea level rise as a result of the Climate Emergency.Natural and healthy dune systems change their formation in response to wave, wind and tidal action, with some sand removed only to then be replaced at a later stage with deposits of new sand.This self-sustaining process can play out in the course of one storm but more often occurs over many years and,viewed at a particular moment in the cycle, could give the impression that the dunes are disappearing.Tree planting in previous generations attempted to stop this apparent erosion and fix the dunes in place ndash but it also interrupted the natural process of replenishment, as well as the colonisation of dune vegetation.Ms Dolby said: ldquoPrevious restoration attempts over the last  years have failed to properly restore open dunes because they did not deal with a surface layer on the dunes that had been enriched by fallen leaves or needles, conditions which favour woodland plants and that effectively prevented more sensitive dune plants from surviving.ldquoThe method wersquore trialling now involves removing the trees and scrub and scraping and burying the plant litter layer to leave a bare sand surface, which will hopefully support the rare vegetation special to these dunes.The trial site, at Morrich More, will be closely monitored over the next five years to assess the effectiveness of the restoration process.Scotlandrsquos more than , hectares of sand dune systems are considered among some of the countryrsquos most valuable habitats, thought to support more than  rare species.Risks to the dunes include coner plantations which have already claimed around , hectares and sea buckthorn which has colonised signicant areas of sand dune in parts of south-east Scotland. This non-native shrub, like the tree project, was originally planted to combat erosion, but has itself become a problem.In , Scottish Natural Heritagerevealed that Donald Trumprsquos Aberdeenshire golf resort could lose its status as a protected wildle site after the sand dunes at Menie no longer included enough of the special features for which they were designated a site of special scientic interest .:Wrapping up the Eighties with Runrig, Jesus and Mary Chain, Del Amitri and Deacon BlueThe designation is given to areas with rare species of fauna or flora, or with important geological or physiological features.A three month consultation on the future status of Foveran Links SSSI began that June, but was postponed until this year only four months later.In official documents SNH said Menie Links Golf Course had ldquoadversely affected the sand dune habitat with  per cent of the total SSSI lost and % of the sand dune habitat gone.Mr Trump was granted permission to build a golf course at the site despite concerns about damage to the dunes and the links opened in .SNH said evidence showed permanent habitat loss following the construction of fairways and greens, and that the stabilisation of mobile sand ldquohas destroyed the dynamic nature of the site.Trump International said the move by the Government body was politically motivated and a ldquostitch-up."},{"url":null,"title":"wrapping-eighties-runrig-jesus-mary-chain-del-amitri-deacon-blue","story":"The Jesus and Mary ChainldquoA spitting, snarling, hissing, crackling vinyl assault, the Heraldrsquos Dave Belcher wrote of this East Kilbridersquos band November  debut, Psychocandy.

A great early review in NME had brought them to the attention of record labels, and they went with Virgin.

refusing to try and overcome a lack of teaching space as a barrier for pupils ing to school full time.The Scottish Government has told councils to draw up plans to allow children toto classrooms part-time from August , with social distancing rules, with the rest of the time learning remotely at home.But in recent days, Nicola Sturgeon has appeared to soften her stance on whether the blended learning models will in fact be rolled out when schools re-open their doors amid speculation the two-metre rule could be relaxedthe virus continues to be suppressed.Mr Neil criticised Stephen McCabe, the children and young people spokesperson for the umbrella organisation for Scottish councils, Cosla ndash accusing local authorities of failing to do all they can to increase the time pupils physically spend in schools.Speaking at Holyroodrsquos education committee, Mr Neil said: ldquoIrsquom a grandfather and my grandchildren have just been told theyrsquore going to get, from August , one and half days a week in school for the indefinite future.ldquoI personally and their parents regard that as absolutely unacceptable ndash that is not good quality education, itrsquos not blending education, itrsquos bleeding education. Surely we can do far better than that for our children.:Jason Leitch: Virus prevalence could inform future decision on reducing two-metre ruleMr McCabe, who is also the co-chairman of the Scottish Governmentrsquos education recovery group, admitted that the blended learning model ldquois second best.He added: ldquoThe reality is that we are being advised by the government, by the scientists that at this point in time, children can onlyto school in August on the basis of a two-metre social distancing. Itrsquos impossible for us to provide full time education in that constraint.But Mr Neil questioned why councils cannot ldquotake a leaf out of the NHSrsquos book after the health service took on more staff and saw an emergency facility set up in case it was needed.He said: ldquoWhat they did was they requisitioned the buildings they needed, they recruited the additional staff they needed.ldquoI agree that has to be paid for by the Scottish Government butyou listen to what the paediatricians are saying ndash the cost of getting your children back to school five days a week in terms of their mental health, their physical health, their education, our future economic prospects ndash all of that is dependent on that happening.He added: ldquoDo you not think the attitude should be, let us not take capacity as a constraint but actually address the capacity issues to make sure we give our children as full time.ldquoWe are looking at the moment asScotland is potentially going to be the only one of the four nations in the UK not planning for or at least trying to get a full timeto school in August. Thatrsquos not good enough.ldquoCan we not apply a bit of imagination and create homework hubs for example ndash with the IT equipment to make sure every child has access to what they need to do. This is not getting it right for most children.ldquoI think yoursquove just taken the capacity constraints and decided to work to those and not actually try to overcome them.:Nicola Sturgeon told to stop dithering on schools plan as blended learning could be scrappedBut Mr McCabe disputed the claims, insisting councils and schools are doing all they can to make the proposals work.He said: ldquoThere are around , schools in Scotland. To imagine that we could replicate , schools is just fantasy.ldquoMoney is not the only issue. If the Scottish Government offered councils a blank cheque and said, it doesnrsquot matter what it costs, go out there and double the school estate, get every child back to school full time with face-to-face learning in August, based on two-metre social distancing, we couldnrsquot do it.Scottish Conservative education spokesperson, Jamie Greene, said: ldquoThis is a serious intervention from a former SNP cabinet secretary, who is now saying publicly what many SNP MSPs are thinking privately.ldquoCurrent plans for part-time learning are unworkable and potentially a disaster for children.He added: ldquoAt least Alex Neil has the guts to tell Nicola Sturgeon and his front bench ministers some dficult truths about their lack of ambition and incompetence, adding his name to a growing list of SNP advisers and politicians expressing anger at this shambolic handling of schools.ldquoThe Holyrood committee also learned today of more confusion, with councils admitting that their one and only plan is to only offer a maximum of  per cent attendance in class, in direct contradiction to the First Minister who said that was the contingency plan. Councils are saying one thing, ministers are saying another.ldquoAll the while parents are getting angrier at John Swinney and the SNPrsquos intransigent attitude and complete lack of leadership over such an important issue."},{"url":null,"title":"van-used-suspect-madeleine-mccann-case-sold-scrap","story":"The never-before-mentioned vehicle ended up in an Algarve breakerrsquos yard after reportedly being seized by Portuguese authorities following the youngsterrsquos May  disappearance.Brueckner used the Portugueseplated blue Bedford van with an Austrian friend in April  to steal diesel from two lorries, court files dating from the time of his conviction show.The files say the vehicle was dismantled after being valued at just pound by a court seeking payment of a fine linked to the Germanrsquos theft conviction.It ended up being crushed in  according to respected Portuguese daily Expresso, which said it was seized seven months after Madeleine vanished in May , although court papers point to it being confiscated before her disappearance and state it was never ed to Brueckner.Bruecknerrsquos diesel theft accomplice has been identied as an Austrian drter called Michael Tatschl.The two men were arrested on April , , by officers from Portugalrsquos PSP force after being caught stealing fuel from lorries in Portimao ndash a half-hour drive from the Praia da Luz resort where Madeleine vanished.They were freed in December  after eight months in prison.Brueckner vanished from a house he was living at in nearby Barrocal, close to the place where he sold a two-tone VW camper van that has been at the centre of the police appeal, without paying a fine linked to his theft conviction.Portuguese GNR police officers found the abandoned Bedford van at the property in November , according to Expresso, after going to the address because it was the one Brueckner had given court officials.The newspaper reported, despite court files identying the van seizure date as April : ldquoAt the Barrocal home, which belonged to another German, material used to steal diesel and the Bedford van was discovered. It added: ldquoIt will never be knownthe vehicle could have contained any clues about the missing British youngster.The van is understood to have been taken apart at an unidentied breakerrsquos yard in May  after the pound valuation by a court-appointed expert.There was no suggestion yesterday that the battered van had ever been swept by forensic experts before being dismantled as Bruecker was not a suspect in the initial Madeleine McCann investigation or known to Portuguese police as a sex offender.His only other conviction in Portugal is for disobedience.Court files show the -made Bedford van was still officially registered to a Portuguese national based in the town of Monchique, in the Algarve.But its owners in practice were Brueckner and jobless former carpenter Tatschl, who told officials after their diesel theft arrests that they had purchased the vehicle two weeks earlier from migrant garage owners.The revelation about the new vehicle comes after Brueckner was linked to another vehicle not flagged up in the new police appeal sparked by German prosecutorsrsquo insistence that Madeleine is dead and the convicted rapist is their prime suspect.It emerged earlier this week that childrenrsquos clothing, including several girlsrsquo swimsuits, had been found in a ft Tfin Allegro motor home Brueckner is said to have driven between Portugal and Germany.It was not one of the two vehicles ndash the two-tone camper van and a Jaguar car ndash British police flagged up in their new appeal just over a fortnight ago. German prosecutors say they have evidence Madeleine is dead and are conducting their case as a murder inquiry.British authorities say their probe is a missing personsrsquo inquiry.A former ambulance driver identied only as Dieter F, whose daughter Nicole knew Brueckner when he lived in Portugal, claimed last weekend the Madeleine McCann suspect had boasted to him in early  he could transport ldquodrugs and children in his ft-long American-style van. He told the Mail on Sunday that Bruecker said to him as he showed off the vehicle: ldquoI can transport children, kids, in this space."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"June ,  at : pmNHS Orkney has confirmed, this afternoon, Thursday, that a new coronavirus case has been identied by test in Orkney.

Employers should support their workers in using face coverings safely and provide advice,requested, on applying and removing the covering.On ferry services face coverings must also be worn by passengers and staff unless the ferry, or part of the ferry which is open to members of the public, is entirely outdoors or physical distancing of two metres can be maintained.Transport Secretary Michael Matheson stressed the importance of the new rules and that by wearing a face covering everyone is engaged in a collective responsibility to reduce the risk of transmission.He said: “Our message remains clear that public transport should be for key workers and those who need it most and can’t walk or cycle to work.#Capacity is reduced to enable physical distancing and operators are not yet running full services. However, as we work towards recovery and more peopleto work and further local leisure opportunities begin to open up it is vital that measures are put in place to protect everyone’s health.“Transport operators continue to play a key role in supporting essential travel and in ensuring passenger confidence in public transport while maintaining physical distancing. The use of face coverings forms a fundamental part of gaining that public trust.“We are asking people to take personal responsibility to do the right thing. Wearing a face covering while on public transport means you are playing your part in the collective effort to prevent the spread of coronavirus and reducing the risk to your fellow citizens. These measures complement physical distancing and good hand hygiene, they do not replace them.”Advice on face coverings, including how to make one and instructions for using one, will be available on the Transport Scotland website.

The financial support is helping firms across the nation to adapt, innovate and protect jobs. Here are two examples of how companies have been helped, and what support is available.Source: Her Majesty’s TreasuryAn unprecedented package of UK Government financial support has helped firms like Q-Mass in East Kilbride weather the coronavirus crisis. Director Ronnie Robertson said lockdown hit his company’s order book, but the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has been vital to help them hang on to their valued staff.Ronnie said: “Before this, we had quite a good order book, with three to four months of work planned, so we were pretty worried where it was going to take us.” At first, he was worried how he would keep Q-Mass’  staff on the payroll, but then the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme was announced.It offers UK Government support to pay  per cent of staff’s wages up to £, a month, and the scheme has now been extended until the end of October.Q-Mass manufactures bespoke parts for the oil, gas and defence industry so staff training is important. Ronnie said: “Our staff are very highly skilled. We’ve gathered a bunch of people here and trained them up and taken on apprentices.

The financial support is helping firms across the nation to adapt, innovate and protect jobs. Here are two examples of how companies have been helped, and what support is available.Source: Her Majesty’s TreasuryAn unprecedented package of UK Government financial support has helped firms like Q-Mass in East Kilbride weather the coronavirus crisis. Director Ronnie Robertson said lockdown hit his company’s order book, but the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has been vital to help them hang on to their valued staff.Ronnie said: “Before this, we had quite a good order book, with three to four months of work planned, so we were pretty worried where it was going to take us.” At first, he was worried how he would keep Q-Mass’  staff on the payroll, but then the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme was announced.It offers UK Government support to pay  per cent of staff’s wages up to £, a month, and the scheme has now been extended until the end of October.Q-Mass manufactures bespoke parts for the oil, gas and defence industry so staff training is important. Ronnie said: “Our staff are very highly skilled. We’ve gathered a bunch of people here and trained them up and taken on apprentices. We do a lot of training, we’ve got good people, we train them a lot and we want to hang on to them.”He found applying for the furlough scheme quick and straightforward.

It has allowed the waste crews to collect recyclables that have been stored in folks’ houses, whilst ensuring that our crews are able to work within the requirements of physical distancing.

This should be contained in a single green bin or box. Corrugated cardboard should not be included – either in the bin or left alongside.It is hoped that corrugated cardboard can be accepted from next week at the recycling centres at Hatston and Garson, along with garden waste.

The two metre social distancing rule will affect passenger capacity for our ferries – and we also continue to experience issues around the availability of staff and the effect that has on opportunities around timetabling.“I would assure our isles residents that we continue to bring these issues and challenges to the attention of the Scottish Government and will do all we can to maximise sailingsnecessary, taking on board the views of our isles residents throughout.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It looks increasingly likely that any exit from lockdown and safe re-opening of tourism and hospitality businesses could be during the low season.#Without financial support to tide them over, that could be the nail in the coffin for many businesses.“In Shetland, like where in Scotland, earnings from tourism during the spring and summer months sustains people through the winter and it is a real worry that coronavirus hit just when the visitor season was starting.#It is clear that a -month plan, at least, is needed to ensure that viable businesses can survive to provide a living for their owners and be ready to safely welcome visitors again when the time is right.”Speaking via video link earlier this week, Mr Carmichael welcomed the Chancellor of the Exchequer#s announced extension to the furlough scheme to protect jobs – but added more was needed to help tourism.“Here in the Northern Isles we particularly see that in the visitor economy, which is crucial to us,# he added.#The assistance for bed and breakfast operators, or operators of self-catering accommodation, leaves too many people without the assistance they need.“A support scheme that finishes at the end of August, or September or whenever it will be, simply will not be adequate in parts of the country such as ours.#Those parts of the country that have seasonal tourism require a -month programme, or  the tourism industry that will be left to be resurrected at the end of this process will be that much weaker, and the rebuilding and recovery that much more dficult.” on Wednesday also heard from struggling tourism businesses.One BB owner said she had been unable to apply for support funds as they required applicants to have paid businesses rates, whereas she paid domestic council tax.Living Lerwick has also raised the plight of small tourism operators.Project manager Emma Miller said that as some did not have a business banking account they had been unable to apply for the Creative or Tourism and Hospitality Enterprises Fund, which opened in Scotland to support the industry. raquo"},{"url":null,"title":"owners asked to let coastguard know if boats are left unattended ","story":"Boat owners are being reminded to please inform the coastguardthey will be leaving vessels unattended for any period of time.The Aith leboat was called out on Sunday evening after reports of a small boat lying empty near an uninhabited isle to the west of Scalloway.While no missing people had been reported in the area, the volunteer crew of the Charles Lidbury were asked by local coastguard officers to make their way to the scene and investigate.The call out came at .pm and the leboat team steamed south to where the skf had been moored – near the skerry of Sanda Stour at the entrance to Weisdale Voe.On arrival the small boat was recognised by a crew member – who then made contact with the boat#s owner to confirm that they were safe and well.

Meter readers will be able to take readings from meters located in outside positions as normal.NIE Networks is urging customers to protect its meter readers and themselves by continuing to observe social distancing protocols. Ben Cupples, Meter Reading Manager at NIE Networks, explained the importance of recording a precise meter reading for the customer.“Providing a precise meter reading will ensure that your electricity bills accurately reflect your consumption,” he said. “Our meter readers will call to your home and will record the reading you provide while we wait.“If you are unable to read your meter for any reason oryou are not at home when we call, we will leave a card with information on how to submit your meter reading online via the NIE Networks website, via email or over the phone.”Mr Cupples explained that while meter reading activity would resume it would only be carried out with the health and safety of the public and meter readers in mind.“The safety of our employees and customers is our utmost priority. “If you see our meter readers out and about, we would ask that you please help them by standing at least two metres away. Likewise, we will stand at least two metres from customers’ doors at all times.“We are continually reviewing how we undertake our meter reading activities in light of COVID- and we are looking forward to being able to resume our normal way of working with customers at some stage, but we will only make that decision when it’s safe to do so.” NIE Networks is reminding customers that you only need to submit your reading to either NIE Networks or your supplier – there is no need to do it twice. Customers unable to submit a meter reading will receive an estimated bill from their supplier based on their usage history.If a member of the NIE Networks team arrives at the door, they will always show identication.

The father and son team have now raised £, for the charity, which has had to suspend many of its services for local cancer patients and their families, and has furloughed most staff due to the coronavirus pandemic.The charity has also had to postpone its fundraising events, so donations are even more vital during the current crisis. The latest batch of bracelets are from guitar and bass strings played during Ash#s recent European tour, which was cancelled half-way through. Over the last year, Mark#s dad has made hundreds of bangles as souvenirs from a host of the band#s concerts played all over the world. Mark, who said he hopes to be back on tour once the pandemic is over, said: Thanks so much to all the Ash and Snow Patrol fans who have supported our #RockBangle project for Cancer Focus NI. So far we have raised around £, and hope to sell more bracelets once our tour recommences, whenever that may be. Big gratitude also to dad, who#s worked so hard on making these bangles in his wee shed, and Happy Father#s Day to him from my lockdown home in Northumberland.Mark donated the proceeds of the bracelets to Cancer Focus NI because of his mum, Miriam, who has now thankfully survived cancer three times. Miriam has received great support from Cancer Focus NI over the years. She is also one of the founder members of the charity#s support group in Downpatrick, helping other women who#ve been diagnosed with cancer. Mark, who sells the bangles on his social media channels, explained that making the bracelets is a team effort. I weave and cut the strings to size and my dad solders the joints together, making what was an ugly joint into something that resembles a metal pearl, he explained. They look nice, but raw and rustic. I want them to retain a bit of that rock #n# roll aesthetic. Rosie Forsythe, from Cancer Focus NI, said: We can#t thank Mark and his dad enough for all their hard work and generosity. Cancer Focus NI relies on donations for over % of our income.

I haven#t felt as sad since  and I#m going to take a while to get over it.These men are out there protecting us and it#s a very sad thing that they can#t go about their duties, this is how they are rewarded.Local TD Denis Naughten said he was absolutely shocked and saddened to hear of the tragedy.He said at age , Det-Gda Horkan would have been only a child when the two gardaí were killed. He may not have been old enough to remember it but all of the community would remember their tragic deaths.This brings all of that back, particularly to the community in west Roscommon and around Castlerea. It adds to the tragedy.Daylight brought floods of tributes from all corners of Ireland and beyond.From the Taoiseach, President and colleagues of the fallen garda.There were more local tributes too, including one from Charlestown Sarsfields GAA club, where Det-Gda Horkan had earned the nickname #The Bear#.What we have here is a random act, a violent act, that led to the death of Det-Gda Horkan, so it is tragic and it is an attack upon us all. Garda Commissioner Drew HarrisGarda Commissioner Drew Harris visited the town and described the brutal killing of Det-Gda Horkan as a random act.Colm served the communities he worked in with distinction and pride during his  years as a member of An Garda Síochána, said Mr Harris.Detective Garda Colm Horkan is the th member of An Garda Síochána killed in the line of duty. Today is a terrible reminder of the signicant sacrices, including the ultimate sacrice, that gardaí make to keep people safe.Speaking to reporters in Castlerea yesterday afternoon, he said there was no sense that the death was linked to organised crime, saying it was a random act.As we know in this time, this was in effect a conversation between Det-Gda Horkan and a member of the public, he said.There was then an altercation during which the service pistol which Gda Horkan was carrying was then used against him and he was shot and fatally wounded.He received very prompt and professional medical attention but to no avail and died from his injuries.Mr Harris said that Det-Gda Horkan#s death was an attack upon society.I can certainly say at this moment in time there is no sense of a bigger picture, organised crime or subversive, he said.What we have here is a random act, a violent act, that led to the death of Det-Gda Horkan, so it is tragic and it is an attack upon us all.It is correct to say that it#s an attack upon society, he added.The commissioner appealed to the public to help with the investigation as there is a video of the attack circulating social media.Colm gave his le protecting the community he had served with distinction and courage. Taoiseach Leo VaradkarHe urged anyone who was in Castlerea Town Centre on Wednesday night at pm-.am to come forwardthey have information.Far from Castlerea, on the steps of Government Buildings, the shooting of a serving garda brought pause to a political week dominated by government formation talks.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar praised Det-Gda Horkan for the courage and sacrice he showed during his more than two decades serving with An Garda Síochána.Mr Varadkar offered his condolence and support to Det-Gda Horkan#s family.Colm gave his le protecting the community he had served with distinction and courage during his  years as a member of An Garda Síochána, he said. His story is the same as the thousands of men and women who wear the unorm. A story of courage, sacrice and service.Our gardaí are our s of the peace and defenders of the rule of law, he said. They are role models.This tragedy is a heart-wrenching reminder of how much we owe our gardaí for the work they do all over the country.They protect and serve our citizens, our communities and our country, every day putting themselves on the front line of crime prevention on behalf of all of us, he added.Meanwhile, in the second largest town in Co Roscommon, disbelief was being replaced by grief.Up to  people gathered in the town centre last night for a vigil in Det-Gda Horkan#s memory.A small green marquee was set up in the Fairgreen in the Main Street and tributes were led by local Fianna Fáil Councillor Paschal Fitzmaurice and parish priest Fr McManus.Heavy rain lashed down as the small town mourned the passing of the garda.The terrible sad occasion that happened here last night is a tragedy that I suppose we will never, ever forget, said Mr Fitzmaurice.District Officer Superintendent Goretti Sheridan also paid tributes to a friend and colleague. I want to thank everyone for coming this evening, it means a lot to us.We#re obviously devastated at the death of our friend and colleague Colm, she said.Fr McManus said that the community had particularly felt the blow of the now three losses because they were very much a part of the community and widely respected in the Roscommon town.Our prayers and thoughts are very much with his family, relatives and his colleagues here in Castlerea, and gardaí everywhere, he said.Additional reporting by Gabija Gataveckaite, Conor Feehan and Tom Brady.

It wasn’t just regular clients or local people… I had guys from the North contacting me too – it has just been crazy,” he added.He says while many businesses are concerned about their future after the pandemic, businesses providing personal services should weather the storm.He said: “I would call barbering recession proof… A lot of people see it as a necessity.

Customers like a bit of luxury.”He said his business had just started to get “where he wanted it to be” when it was announced in March that all barbers and hairdressers had to shut.“The closure was a big setback for the business but it was completely unprecedented and there was nothing you could do other than prepare for whatever the new normal would look like,” he added.We are getting word that the th of June is the date we can reopen.

Publicans in Derry who took a ‘massive’ financial hit by closing ahead of St Patrick’s Day in the interest of public safety have encouraged the public to ‘support their local’ once they reopen. Northern Irelands hotels, bars, restaurants and cafes can reopen from July . William McGuinness and his business partner Phil Nolan own Paedar O’Donnells, The Gweedore and Fty Seven nightclub on Waterloo Street. Before the government issued any formal directive for businesses to shut, Paedar’s led the way by announcing that it was closing its doors on March . googletag.cmd.push It came two days before the busiest date on the calendar for Irish bars, St Patrick’s Day. “It was a matter of conscience for us,” Mr McGuinness said, “the general feeling at the time was that the NHS was going to be under pressure and we thought St Patrick’s Day would have been a petri dish for infection and we didn’t want to be responsible for that.” Boris Johnson’s order for all non-essential businesses would come over a week later on March . Derry City and Strabane has the second lowest COVID- death rate of every council area in the country and just  positive Coronavirus cases to date – also the second lowest in the country. googletag.cmd.push Chair of the British Medical Association in NI, Derry doctor Tom Black, has credited the part played by local businesses who took their cues from the Republic of Ireland. Mr McGuinness said they’re happy they made that decision even though the business took a ‘massive hit’ because of it. “St Patrick’s Day is our busiest day of the year and we were thinking about retirement soon but this thing has thrown it all up in the air. “We knew that, but we were just concerned about the health of Derry people.” Paedar’s missed out on grants because it didn’t meet the criteria but employees were furloughed. The rebuild will be a slow process, Mr McGuinness said, as the pandemic took its toll. DIFFICULT From July  pubs and bars will be allowed to trade but must serve food and operate on a table service basis. Pubs that do not serve food will be allowed to sell alcohol outdoors, such as beer gardens, also restricted to table service. Mr McGuinness said that will make it ‘very dficult’ for small bars like Paedar’s with limited outdoor space. Permission to use that space is absolutely essential in his view. He added: “I would object to the fact that restaurant bars are allowed to open but bars aren’t allowed to serve inside. “I think the risk is higher in a restaurant bar with adults and children being served food and drink whereas we’re just serving alcohol to adults. “With food there are all sorts of utensils but we just have glasses and disposable plastic. “I don’t see the sense in holding us up because we don’t do food.” The ‘rush’ is now on to ready the bar for customers and bar owners like Mr McGuinness are looking to the government and local authorities for guidance. Paedar O’Donnell’s has been cleared of tables and chairs to allow for the walls to be freshly painted and floors nished ahead of the grand reopening.  Mr McGuinness hopes that the government advice is relaxed to allow bars to serve indoors. They’re awaiting further guidance before spending any money on Perspex screens or other safety measures. He concluded: “We’d encourage people to come back but it’s going to be very limited space. “We don’t have the tourists, we were a very busy bar at weekends, and we’re not going to get those numbers in – nowhere is – because Derry people like to go out on a Friday and Saturday and nowhere will be able to cater for them because of social distancing. “There’s no money to be made in the next few months that’s the reality. “But hopefully over timeit is under control and there’s no resurgence maybe we can get back to some normality.” INFORMATION The owner of numerous bar-restaurants in the city including the Bentley, The Magnet and Molly Malones, Tony O’Connor, is also seeking clarity. “I’m surmising that they’re working on it at Stormont but we need more information about social distancing and so on,” he said. With all of his restaurants serving food he’s assured by the fact that customers can sit indoors but is unsure as to whether dining customers can stay longer to socialise. Mr O Connor said: “Every one of our premises will be opening on July  because of the food situation. Out of our six bars, five of them have outdoor areas.” This week he held a meeting with management and they’re ‘all positive and raring to go’. Like many businesses, the pandemic has been a ‘nightmare’ for Mr O’Connor but he realises that everybody is on the same boat. The Irish government ‘deserves a massive pat on the back’ for closing bars before St Patrick’s Day, he said, because ‘you would have had thousands and thousands across Ireland’ spreading the virus. “A lot of bars lost out on revenue there, no money was coming in and none getting paid out, so you just start over again,” he added. AMAZING  Bars have been actively discouraged from staging live music events or screening football matches to minimise the urge for customers to ‘dance’ or ‘hug each other’ after a goal is scored. It’s Mr O’Connor’s aspiration that the bar will be allowed to have a singer-songwriter, two-piece band performing or DJ providing entertainment. The local businessman said they will have hand sanitisers at each entrance, on every floor, at every table and also behind the bars and in kitchen areas for staff. “I’d rather not open as to have big screens in front of the bar because I think it takes the atmosphere away. “We have enough space so we can take tables away to create distance,” he stated. They’re also considering an App on which people can order food and drinks but are awaiting further guidance. And extra staff will be on hand to carry out an increased cleaning schedule. Looking to the future, Mr O’Connor would like to see visitors to the city from other parts of the island. He said: “I think Derry will get a good turnout because we handled the pandemic well as a city, there was a low number of Coronavirus cases. “I can’t wait to get my teeth back into it, we’ve been doing nothing the past few months, and the not knowing is the worst thing. “We’ve been doing takeaways but getting fully open is going to be amazing. “We’d invite people to get back out and support your local. “Self-awareness is key, Derry has played a blinder, it should be recognised and people here don’t have to be told to social distance, they’re fully aware.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

She added: “I know people may feel frustratedthere is no commitment in terms of dates and movement but there are no concerns at this stage on our part that the work isn’t being done. “That’s not to say it hasn’t been dficult but there are no concerns from the university either, they have everything they need to progress through the GMC stage. “And even when we get to the next point on this journey when we will have applications out there is so much work, it is a long-term project. googletag.cmd.push “The initial intake is for  students but that will increase over five years and we need a financial commitment to resource that for every year and work on the wider expansion of Magee.” A General Medical Council spokesperson confirmed that the next date to comply with is the Graduate Medical School Admissions Testapplication process in July. A GMC spokesperson said: “There are stages that must be completed, required for all new medical school applications, before students can be recruited. “We will decide on the readiness of the University of Ulster to accept students in September , by the end of this July.” Since the May  announcement, key players in delivering the project including the Economy Minister Dianne Dodds and Arlene Foster have spoke of ‘signicant work’ and risk assessments that must be carried out before they can commit themselves to a date. Karen Mullan said that it is ‘dficult’ when there are ‘dissenting voices’ and it ‘does create that sense of fear that is out there’. She recognised that work still has to be done to get it over the line and ‘you can’t mitigate against something that is out of everybody’s control’. Asked is Sinn Feacutein is facing resistance from within the Executive Karen Mullan was clear that all parties signed up to the commitment laid out in the New Decade, New Approach document towards Magee. But she acknowledged that Magee is not a priority for other MLAs who are focused on their own constituencies. ‘TRANSPARENCY’ SDLP Leader, Colum Eastwood MP has expressed concern that the First Minister was unable to give SDLP MLA, Mark H Durkan, a cast iron guarantee that the Magee Medical School would be ready to open in September . The Foyle MP said: “The SDLP have been campaigning for Magee expansion for many years and we secured a ringfenced funding commitment as part of New Decade, New Approach. We also worked hard to secure a commitment to supporting Magee expansion in the draft Programme for Government in the south. “The money was made available and in the months that followed, we urged the DUP and Sinn Fein to make the necessary decisions and get this project delivered. “Not only did we find ourselves rebuked as negative when asking practical questions, we were told that it was a done deal. “Clearly, it is not as the First Minister was unable to provide these basic assurances today in the Assembly Chamber, when questioned by my colleague Mark H Durkan MLA. “We will continue to fight for the Medical School and a fully expanded Magee campus. We hope that it will still open next year, but this latest statement from the First Minister makes it more dficult. “At very least, the people of Derry deserve transparency and honesty from those holding the most senior positions in the Executive. SDLP Economy Spokesperson, Sinead McLaughlin MLA added: “This is a very disappointing lack of clarity and to be blunt, Im angry about it. We were promised the Magee Medical School was coming next year and now we are not sure. “We have to invest in training more doctors to reduce locum costs and to strengthen our health service. Covid- demonstrated the need, but it looks likely that Derry and the North West will be let down by the DUP and Sinn Fein, once again.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

From  July, subject to the rate of community transmission continuing to be low, people will no longer need to shield and should instead follow the same guidance and precautions as those considered to be generally vulnerable. That involves taking particular care when out and about - and strictly maintaining social distancing. Letters will be issued in the coming days to all those covered by shielding informing them of the planned change. Mr Swann stated:“I have been clear that shielding would not last one minute longer than it needed to. We have now reached the point where,the current trends continue, there will be no need for anyone to shield after  July. googletag.cmd.push “I have listened to many of you and to the challenges you have faced during this period. I am in no doubt as to the dficulties shielding has presented for a great many people. “It is unrealistic to think these dficulties will just vanish because the need to shield has ended. That is why the letters we issue will provide details of the support which will continue to be available up to and after  July. “While my announcement today will be welcome news for many who are shielding, some will view the prospect of an end to shielding with great anxiety. I want to assure them that they should decide what to do at their own pace. Everyone will approach this situation dferently. googletag.cmd.push “As is so often the case at present, this will be about weighing up the options and making informed choices. Going outside can bring some degree of potential risk but this can be mitigated and minimised by strict social distancing. Staying indoors indefinitely is not good for anyone’s mental or physical health. “Finally, I would ask everyone to be considerate as people end their periods of shielding. We should all continue to social distance, but in the coming weeks I want you to be particularly understanding of the fact you might be encountering someone who has had to stay at home for many weeks. Please be aware of this, show respect and kindness to all and keep your distance.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Concern was recently raised that Derry City and Strabane District Council ratepayers were footing the bill for people from a dferent jurisdiction to get rid of their rubbish. DUP Alderman Maurice Devenney said the use of the local dumps by people from Donegal was a quite serious problem which needed to be examined. He asked for vehicles using the council-owned recycling centres to be monitored to assess how big an issue it was. Five of the councils  recycling centres reopened on May  last after being closed from March because of the coronavirus pandemic restrictions. googletag.cmd.push After the recycling centres reopened, council officers noted the registration of all vehicles using them. The information was collated from Monday, May , to Friday, May . The figures, which have been seen by the Derry News, revealed that during that -day period, a total of , cars with Republic of Ireland number plates used the local dumps. The vast majority of Republic-registered vehicles used the Pennyburn recycling centre - a total of . This was just over % of the overall , vehicles which used the Pennyburn dump during this time. Eighty three vehicles with southern number plates used the Glendermott recycling centre during this period, out of a total of , visitors. googletag.cmd.push There were  southern-registered cars which used the Strahans Road dump in Strabane, out of a total of , visitors. The two other councils dumps that reopened on May  - Strathfoyle and Claudy - had no vehicles from the Republic visit them during the period from May  to May . Derry’s recycling centres do not charge people to get rid of their waste. In Donegal, people must pay for some items at recycling centres while others are free. The issue of usage of the local recycling centres was discussed last week at a meeting of the councils Environment and Regeneration committee. At the meeting, DUP Alderman Ryan McCready proposed that a special meeting of the committee be organised to discuss a number of issues around the recycling centres This included, he said, the dumping of commercial waste at the centres and the number of people from outside the council jurisdiction using the centres. Alderman McCready stressed that he was speaking about anyone from outside the council area, and not just people from Donegal. His proposal was supported by other councillors on the committee. Meanwhile, van drivers who use the local recycling centres are being advised of new arrangements that will come into place from this week. From today, large vans with trailers will only be permitted entry to Strathfoyle and Strahans Road sites during the following revised times - Strathfoyle, between am and am Monday to Saturday, and at Strahans Road between am and am, Monday to Saturday. No large vans with trailers will be accepted at Pennyburn dump. However, large vans will only be permitted access between am and am, Monday to Saturday. A spokesperson for the council said the new arrangements are in place to assist with traffic management arrangements and for safety reasons.

Crossroads Primary School in Kilrea have enlisted the help of Pearse’s GAC for the event, which will take place at Pearse Park on Thursday, June  at .am. The ceremony will be restricted to the families of Primary  pupils only, with designated car parking spaces mapped out for each pupil. Principal Eugene Mullan said the school wanted to do something special to mark the end of the pupils’ time at Crossroads. “I was racking my brain trying to think of something that was memorable and special for the Ps. They’ve missed out on so many experiences in Term ,” he told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “We had a residential planned and we had all the end of season tournaments were ahead of us. We had a trip just before lockdown with the Year s and the school council to Stormont and at least they had that experience and got away together. “I’d considered doing a live stream, but I saw an ad for drive-in bingo in Banagher at the weekend and thought we’d give the prizegiving a go. “At least this way, the children can all come together. They won’t get to socialise with each other the way they normally would have, but at least they’ll be able to see one another.” googletag.cmd.push Mr Mullan said the venture was something the school had never attempted before, but that dficult times need creative thinking. “It’s a first for our school and I’ve never heard of a school doing a drive-in prizegiving before,” he said. “It’s an unprecedented time, though, so we have to come up with creative solutions and try and make it some way memorable for the children. “The big screen is being set up on Thursday morning and we’ll connect up a laptop with photo presentations so everyone can see and follow on with what’s happening. “All the P cars will have a designated parking space in an arc in front of the big screen and then extended family can park in behind.” The Ballerin native said Covid- had frustrated the school’s usual work in preparing the Primary  pupils for their transition to secondary education. “In Term  we would normally talk about moving on and any concerns or anxieties the children have,” he said. “We haven’t had a chance to do any of that and they’ve missed out on open days and taster days in their new schools too. “It’s going to be a big culture shock for them, but this should be special for the boys and girls and give them a nice send off.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Toilet facilities at the Banagher Dam car park were demolished in  after they fell into disrepair. The portable toilets that replaced them were also withdrawn following a dispute between NI Water, who own the site, and the Forestry Service, who manage it. Cllr Kathleen McGurk welcomed the reopening of some sites and said reinstating toilet facilities was ‘imperative’. “It is welcome news to see the reopening of these facilities as a tentative step out of lockdown,” she said. googletag.cmd.push “This will hopefully allow many more people to enjoy the fantastic scenery and outdoor recreational spaces our council area has to offer. “However it is imperative that the toilet facilities which were once at Banagher Glen are reinstated as a matter of urgency. “It is simply not acceptable that other recreational spaces are afforded more amenities than Banagher Glen. “If we hope to attract more tourism to the Dungiven Sperrins area of the Borough we should ensure we offer a world class experience, and that must include basic amenity facilities. “I will be contacting all stakeholders, Council, NI water and Forestry Services, to ensure that they engage with each other to provide the amenities that this recreational space deserves.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The announcement was made today by the Northern Ireland Executive. Churches in the Republic will be reopening around the same time. “It is particularly helpful that parishes in cross-border communities will be able to plan together for a safeto Mass around the same time, said Archbishop Martin. I have been heartened by the amount of preparation which is already ongoing in our parishes to ensure that our sacred spaces will be as safe as possible when we begin to gather again together in prayer. googletag.cmd.push I expect that we will be beginning in a cautious way at first, and there will be a need for ongoing patience and careful monitoring of the situation. “In recent days, having spoken to priests across the dioceses of Armagh and Dromore, it is clear to me that there is a strong desire from our people, religious and priests to be able to celebrate the Eucharist and have access to the other sacraments, especially baptism, marriage and reconciliation. Archbishop Martin commended parishes for reaching out to parishioners in very dficult circumstances during the lockdown which included the broadcasting of Mass and other prayer opportunities by webcam. googletag.cmd.push Since March, we have also been alert to God’s presence in the lonely and the suffering. Sadly the pandemic has brought great hardship to many families whose loved ones have died because of the virus. In a lot of cases it was not possible for family members to be by their side, or to be present at their funeral. God knows our grief and how much we need strength, courage, consolation and comfort at this time”.

With handsanitiserat the door to every store, one-way systems, contactlesspayment, and limits on customernumbers, the new normal might take a while to get used to. Around half the shops in Foyleside Shopping Centre were open on Tuesday morning, with Dunnes Stores attracting the biggest crowds. Staff in Marks and Spencers and Boots, which have remained open throughout the pandemic, were glad to see a bit more hustle and bustle in the centre And with sales on in Debenhams, Dunnes and Marks and Spencer, many shoppers remarked on how happy they were to be out spendingagain. googletag.cmd.push But while the shops are open, cafes and coffee shops in the shopping centres remain closed for now. Mary McLaughlin, who hasnt been shopping in the city centrein over three months, said shewas glad to be back. This is my first day back up the town and Im all hyper with it, she said. I havent been up thetown since way beforeSt Patricks Day Its been awful not being able toget up the town, butas long as we are all healthy thats the main thing. Its just great to get out again. Ive been looking forward to it. Self-confessed shopaholic Geraldine Deery has been yearning for the social side of shopping. googletag.cmd.push Im ashopaholic and its been drivingme crazy, she said. I missed going up the town and meeting people and having a chat. And I really miss going in for a cup of coffee with my sister. Ive gone abit crazy buying things, Im making up for losttime of the weeks I missed. The management at Foyleside, The Richmond Centre and Debenhams have clearly put a lot of timeand effortinto establishingand marking out one-way systems and there are plenty of signs in place reminding people to keep to the two metre social distance rule. You do be a bit nervous because youre looking at the floor, trying to make sure you are going the right way, said Mrs McLaughlin. Everything is well spaced out and the floors are all marked out. Although Im glad I came out early because its quiet at the minute. Derrys small independent retailers are also slowly getting back to business after getting the go ahead this week, David Thomas, whose jewellery shop and workshop Thomas Goldsmith has operated from Pump Street for over  years, has been surprised that some of his fellow small traders havent reopned yet.  Ive just been for a walk round and Ive noticed that a large number of small independents arent openat the minute. This is the second dayinto it and they are taking their time to get back to work. Maybe thats their own choice. It surprisedme because to rebuild businessagain is important. For a lot of them who have furloughed staff and who are self employed as it were and are receiving payments they are thinking I wont risk it because theres a safety net there. But obviously that safety net is going to start disappearing. Business has been quite slow this week, but MrThomas is hopeful that shoppers will be back. We arecompleting the work we werent able to complete in March after the guillotine came down and we werent able to finish. And then we were hit by problems in the supply chain but that has started to ease up. In the last two weeks it has relaxed and things are filtering thoughnow. Were now able to complete things we should have done in March so weve stillgot that momentum from then, but in terms of work coming through its going to be a bit slow. There are a lot of people are being made redundant or who havent been able to claim grants and things like that. But on the other hand there are people who were furloughed and had to stay at home and werent able to spend money and they should have a fairly healthy bank account and they are desperate to get out and buy stuff. Mr Thomas has made changes to the way the shop operates in order to comply with the new regulations. Only one customer is admitted at a time, staff are usingfacemasks and hand sanitiser, and jewellery that has been tried on is being cleaned before it goes back on th shelf. People are understanding and respectful, remarked Mr Thomas. He feels that lockdown has given people time to reflect on their work le balance and lestyle. People are saying it will never be the same, he said. We were all chasing our tails a bit, workingvery hard. Does it have to be like that  Can we take things a bit easier  Do we have to be rushing off to Portugal on cheap flights  It has been strangeto sit at home in the garden and look up and see the skies totally clear. Many of Derrys charity shops have also reopened their doors, with Oxfam, Kinship Care, the Red Cross and Cancer Focus back in businessearlier this week. However, the three month closure has meant some stores are struggling with low stock levels. Deborah Tracey is the manager at Cancer Focus on Shipquay Street, which opened in May .  The shop reopened last Friday after a week of cleaning and preparation and have been busy ever since. Inside there is hand sanitiser at thedoor and a one-waysystem in place. Most people have been using the hand sanitiser before they come in, said Ms Tracey. We have been busy with people bringing stuff in and buying stuff too. People seem to feel confident coming out to shop now and theyare glad toget back to a bit of normality. Cancer Focus has amanager and deputy manager but all the other staff are volunteers. Some of our volunteers have been worried about coming back because they are older and more at risk, said MsTracy. So weare lookingfor newvolunteers now. We provide everyonewith shields, masks and gloves for their safety. Cancer Focus has also launched an appeal for donations. Any donations to the shop must be quarantined for  hours when we receive them, said Ms Tracy. We are looking for donations of clothes, bric-a-brac, shoes, bags and books.

At present, hospitality businesses have to adhere to strict licensing laws in terms of serving outdoors. However, local councils have been encouraged by the Northern Ireland Executive to take a flexible approach to the situation to support the sector as it emerges from the coronavirus lockdown. Derry City and Strabane District Council is currently looking at ways it can help local businesses. They have launched a short survey asking for peoples opinions on the matter. The survey can be filled in here -https:bit.ly eohTnm googletag.cmd.push A council spokesperson said: The hospitality and retail industries have been some of the hardest hit in terms of lost revenue during COVID-. They will also be one of the last to fully emerge from the lockdown. With the impact of the pandemic and the resulting social distancing measures that must continue when businesses reopen it is essential that we start to reimagine how theservice industries can adapt and operate in the current circumstances.New business models and taking hospitality and trade outdoors will play a signicant part in the survival of the service industry locally.

He spoke to Michael McMullan about his love for football, his career and answering Irelands call. *** It has always been football for Ruaidhri Higgins. Always. He has never known anything dferent. Even in Primary Four, Leo McCloskey saw enough to call him into the Termoncanice PS team. The following year, they lost a Northern Ireland final, before going one better  months later. It was the beginning for the man Stephen Kenny has put his trust into lead the scouting and analysis of the Republic of Ireland soccer team. googletag.cmd.push Higgins obsession for the game smashed through the roof when he began to play with the local Newtowne underage teams from the age of seven. “I wasnt one of those kids that was into cartoons, super heroes and Disney films, I was just obsessed by playing football from no age,” Ruaidhri begins. “I cant ever remember not playing it and it has been my le.” It began to get more serious when Kenny Shiels, who was taking his son Dean to play for Lisburn Youths at the time, asked Ruaidhris fatherhis son would join them. It was a prominent shop window for scouts, but the regular . kick-offs demanded a six oclock rise and trek up the M. googletag.cmd.push “It was a massive commitment,” Ruaidhri said, of his parents Danny and Marys time. For two years, it was Newtowne in the summer and Lisburn in the winter and all the travelling it entailed. They backed him  percent. Ruaidhri and Paddy are their youngest sons, with a  year gap to Michael and Kevin. “It is two dferent generations, but we are unbelievably close, the four of us,” Ruaidhri stresses. “I have been in every corner of Europe with football and they have always followed, they have been massive supporters in my career. “Without that upbringing and without that support, then I probably wouldnt be in the position I am in and wouldnt have had a career in this country like I had. I am very grateful and I dont take it for granted.” Ruaidhri played Gaelic football in his youth and as a pupil of St Marys Limavady lost an Ulster final replay to Coalisland. Growing up, he rarely missed a game when Derry were challenging for Sam Maguire. Even then, at the age of eight, Ruaidhri was deeper in thought than most. “The semi-final was probably the final, I remember when Johnny McGurk hit the winning score with his left foot,” Ruaidhri recalls of the  triumph, with the detail he will be using to suss out Irelands opponents. “It was a massive passion at that time but football shaded it. My brothers, my Da and my uncles first love would be GAA.” His first soccer football game was a trip to Parkhead to see Celtic come from - down to beat Dundee United in the Scottish Cup. He has been to Old Trafford, but doesnt have a favourite team. “I wouldnt say I am a fan of anyone. I am a football fan and I would look out for Celtic orUniteds score but it wouldnt ruin my weekendthey didnt win.” As the years passed, Ruaidhris prowess in the ious underage leagues attracted the attention of soccer scouts and was forward and back with too many clubs before opting for Coventry City. *** There were offers from more prominent clubs on the table, but Coventry attracted him. A chance for first team football, a long-term contract and hospitality all influenced his decision. “I was made feel unbelievably welcome, even at that age, by Gordon Strachan, the first team manager,” Ruaidhri states. “Richard Money, the Academy Director, and George Mackiemade my family feel unbelievably welcome every time we went over and made a big fuss.” Ruaidhri has no regrets about the move and completed his last two years of school in Coventry. At the time, a growth spurt led to knee problems and he spent the first two months in plaster and he didnt kick a ball for close to six months. “It was the right decision,” Ruaidhri points out of the club insisting he join earlier than anticipated. “I was playing through the pain barrier at home and they werent happy about it. Until they fixed it, I went  months in and out of playing because of the pain I was in. They had invested in me and were well within their rights. “It toughened me up. I moved away from home at  and had to become a man before a normal teenager, that stood me in good stead. Looking back, in terms of becoming more streetwise, it gave me a sound footing.” While he was happy with his progress in his first two years, he felt there was a genuine point he caught the eye of first-team manager Gary McAllister, who liked how Ruairi played in possession and he bagged two goals on his reserve debut. “I played really well and got peoples attention around the club,” Higgins felt. It was a quick evolution in how the game changed and relegation from the Championship sent out a warning message. “It was all about second balls and getting up and down the pitch. That didnt suit my style. Once athleticism started to take over from creative players, I kinda knew I might not have a career at that level,” he added. For four and half years, Coventry had high hopes for the Limavady man, but it faded away. When his contract ended, he wasnt too keen on going down the leagues. “It is a body blow to players when they get released from clubs in England. It is your dream, it is your passion, you feel you have failed.” Just when he needed a saviour, Stephen Kenny made the first of five important phone calls to Ruaidhri Higgins. *** With his teenage years coming to an end and his Coventry career over, an   number lit up on Ruaidhri Higgins phone. Kenny had just taken up the mantle as Derry City manager in August  and was putting together a squad. “I had never spoken to him before,” Ruaidhri reveals. “There was a definite rebuilding process when I came home, I wasnt the same person for six to  months. I lost my confidence and felt I had let people down,” he said, while stressing nothing was further from the truth. “Stephen was the perfect manager for me at that time. Living at home with my parents helped massively.” Slowly but surely he got his mojo back. “I owe Stephen a lot. In my first six months I played a lot in the reserve team just to get playing football again. I was performing better and better and running games in the reserves and it gave me the confidence that I could get my career back on track.” Kennys management skills continued, when he waited for the opportune moment to bed him back into the senior squad. It wasnt a rush, but rather some games to ease him into a regular spot. The Candystripes, with Higgins as a regular, won four League Cups in a row from  to . In , they won the FAI Cup with a - extra-time thriller, Kennys last game before taking over at Scottish side Dunfermline. After losing the  title to Cork City on the last day of the season, they missed the  treble after Shelbourne won the league on score dference. “Stephen brought great success and, particularly in  and , the Brandywell was packed and there was a great buzz”, Higgins states. “We had a really good run in Europe in  and that probably cost us the treble because of the backlog of games.” Derry beat IFK Gothenburg and Gretna before going out against Paris Saint-Germain - on aggregate, after holding the French side scoreless at the Brandywell in the first leg. Higgins played in both legs against Gothenburg and rates it has his European highlight. “They had three or four Swedish internationals that played in the  World Cup. We were something like - to win in Gothenburg,” he remembers. Kenny broke down their opponents in advance of the game, showing video clips of unknown teams and how they got results against Gothenburg. “I remember after that meeting, we walked out of it and we were thinking we have a helluva chance here. “We went out and deserved to win the game. It wasnt a smash and grab, it was an unbelievable performance. The home game we deserved to win that, we won - on aggregate and it was a massive achievement for the club.” Derry lost the FAI Cup final in  and were relegated to the First Division the following season, due to financial irregularities. “We went four or five months without pay. I had just bought a house, I had a mortgage and I had bills to pay,” Higgins points out. Pat Fenlon brought him to Bohemians. During the stint Bohs won the Setanta Cup, but Higgins was cup tied and missed out and again Higgins missed on a league medal on score dference to champions Shamrock Rovers. “I probably didnt do myself justice there. I had a decent period in mid-season, I lost my form and when Derry got promoted I went back there.” Back at the Brandywell, Higgins won a fth League Cup and in the FAI Cup decider, his flick on setup Rory Patterson for the extra-time winner. “We qualied for Europe through the league and were actually in the title race until four or five games in the season.” The  season, was one of Higgins best in a Derry shirt, but when Roddy Collins came in as manager, he wasnt in the plans. “I had a good season and had a new options and it was Stephenwho brought me to Dundalk and we won the League Cup, that was my sixth. It gave us the confidence to push on and win the league,” Higgins recalls. “We were trailing Cork going into the final game of the season. We played them at home and we beat them -, that was an amazing night. I was involved in four titles that went to the last game of the season, I lost three and won that one. “There has been a lot of ups and downs but thankfully there are a lot of good memories to look back on. You get lower with the downs than higher with the ups “Throughout my playing career in the League of Ireland, I averaged a trophy a season, so I had a successful enough playing career.” After a spell at Coleraine, where he also managed the U Academy squad, he began to focus more on coaching. He remembers Willie McKeown, then Coventrys Ireland scout telling him youve a great eye for the game and encouraging him to push on and get his coaching badges. “I had no interest at that time obviously. You have this dream of becoming a star footballer, but I genuinely always had an interest in the tactical side of the game,” said Higgins. Stephen Kenny also thought he had a good eye for the game and asked him to join Dundalks coaching staff. In the first season, they lost out to Cork City in the league. “I stayed in the role as analyst, we won thedouble and Stephen left to take theUs, Vinnywas promote to manager and I was promoted to assistant manager. So, I won the league with Dundalk in three dferent roles.” *** When Kenny was promoted to the Ireland manager post, he once again punched Higgins number into his phone. It was a brilliant call to get,not altogether a shock. “We have that relationship. He values me. It was a shock in a sense that it was the international stage, a dferent level. “It is a huge honour and a privilege to be asked. I had made my mind up very quickly because it is impossible to turn that opportunity down when it comes.” He acknowledges Dundalk, who he states were amazing in giving him the . Going to another League of Ireland Cup would have took some serious thinking. “When you are going to the international stage, it is incredibility tough to even consider turning that down,” Ruaidhri highlights. Now the work starts again in earnest. When I first call, he is scouring footage of European play-off opponents Bulgaria. His weeks are taken up with meetings, both online and face to face where circumstances allow it. “ One thing you can be sure, Stephen will have plenty for you to do and he leaves nothing to chance,” Ruaidhri stresses. “We have two games in early September, thats the main focus for myself, Stephen and the staff under him.” When le gets back to normal and gamesto the fixture calendar, Ruaidhri will be clocking up the air miles. “I will be going to watch our own players in England and reporting back, as well as studying the opposition,” he adds. Nothing beats being there and seeing a game in the flesh. The TV camera will only ever follow the ball. “If you have a birds eye view from the stand, you can see everything that is going on. When the ball is at this end of the pitch, what is the teams shape like back here. “When you are watching an inidual player, you literally focus on the player. It is dferentyou are watching a team. You are analysing the whole structure of the team. It is two completely dferent things,” Higgins continues. From playing on Termoncanices school team, to now, he is now an important cog in international football and takes Stephens approach as a massive compliment. “There are a lot of bigger names than me, who he couldve went after and have loved the position. He has huge trust in me and sees the value I can bring and I take it as a massive compliment and for me, it is a huge confidence booster.” He has never been at a major tournament as a fan. Watching from a pub as Damien Duff tore Spain apart in the  World Cup clash in Suwon is a memory, a game Ireland lost on penalties. “Damien was probably the best winger in the world and thats not exaggerating,” Higgins says of the man who, along with Alan Kelly and Keith Andrews, is now in the management setup with him. Now, qualying for a major tournament would be a dream, but as part of the management is also an objective Higgins has an input to. “We have an opportunity within the next two years of getting to the Euros and getting to a World Cup. “You dream of it when you were a small boy. We will be doing everything we can, it wont be from the want of trying. We have a really good group of players to go and try to achieve something special.” Football has always been Ruaidhri Higgins le. His skill set has opened the latest door of opportunity.

His book has been described in The Independent as ldquoone of the finest pieces of modern nature writing in recent years. In this extract the autistic teenager shares his joy of the natural world on a day out to Murlough with his sister and brother.OUR garden is thrumming with birds today: coal, blue and great tits, blackbird, thrush, magpie, jackdaw, rook, all of them revelling on the grass, pecking at the feeders.I could happily watch them all day but rain is coming from the east, so we decide to go west to the coast at Murlough to stay in the sunshine. I usually despise being in the sun. I find its light too bright, its heat too hot, and it can make me feel astherersquos nowhere to hide. But with this rain coming, I feel like being on the dunes at Murlough, pressed by warmth and sea breezes.The ancient dune system here is six thousand years old, fragile and spectacular. The unusually high dunes were formed in the late th and th centuries by massive storms, and were used by people in the Middle Ages as rabbit warrens to provide them with meat and pelts.Grazing rabbits encouraged the grassy heathland here, but when myxomatosis first broke out in the s, as it did in other parts of Ireland and Britain, the population was almost wiped out. With fewer rabbits, sea buckthorn and sycamore could grow, turning heath to scrubland. Now the National Trust have intervened at Murlough, managing the landscape so it reverts back to heath mdash and judging from the copious pings, it looks like the rabbits are thriving again, too.The day is sparkling, the wind is shaking and shaping the clouds. Lorcan and Blaacutethnaid want to swim, so I stroll along the beach with my binoculars. Shapes out at sea stop me: a trinity of torpedoing gannets. They swoop, wheel and suddenly drop, spiralling until the last second when they transform into arrows before hitting the water.Swallows are overhead ndash I can see their small bodies so clearly, weightless and constantly moving. I feel myself rising with them.My dark, knotted thoughts seem to be staying away at the moment. I feel as free as the gannets and swallows. If they can live their lives, shouldnrsquot I do the same  Can I breathe and live and also fight  The natural world mdash which includes us mdash is facing such enormous challenges that itrsquos easy to become overwhelmed and depressed. But we must fix them, andIrsquom no longer here, alive, I canrsquot be part of the solution.What is it thatrsquos holding me back  Anxiety  Depression  Autism  These are the shackles. Surely, I can break free. Or at least I can accept these things as part of me. I have no answers, but the lightness of these thoughts and these days weave my body and mind with everything around me. The only thing that I am really bound to is nature ndash as we all are.Lorcan and Blaacutethnaid are running towards me, and I run to them, and then we run together, exultant. We slow down in unison, all feeling the same pull of the large peculiar shells dotted around the beach. We each pick one up and hold them outstretched, delicate porcelain in our hands.They look like pale planets, pockmarked with symmetrical lines. I rattle mine, listening to the whisper of sand and the past. These are sea potatoes mdash a type of sand-burrowing sea urchin mdash with pocks that once held spines and a bleached calcium carbonate shell that could so easily shatter on land or at sea. Each one is a miracle. So many miracles washed up at once.We start to collect them and Lorcan decides to name three of the best specimens Sandy, Sam and Sandra. He holds a conversation with them, three sea potatoes, which makes us laugh so hard that tears well up and almost flow, and wersquore still laughing as a warm rain starts to fall on us.Under dark skies, I feel completely unburdened of any doubts in my own abilities to help our planet. Instead, I feel energised and ready. Sopping wet and cold and with chattering teeth, still giggling madly, I feel hope pouring in the rain. Being myself is enough.Diary of a Young Naturalist by Dara McAnulty is published by Little Tollerand can be bought online, or at No Alibis bookshop in Belfast..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"A lifetime of capturing Ireland’s scenic beauty  ","story":"AMATEUR photographer Chris Laverty spent a letime capturing Irelandrsquos scenic beauty.The former Queenrsquos University computer centre manager travelled extensively, always with his camera, and always with an eye for the magic of the countryside around him.

As we work to do so, our absolute priority will be to keep our patients, service users and staff safe. the statement adds.The health trustrsquos insistence that emergency services will be restored at the Downe comes ahead of a meeting with a Sinn Fein delegation to discuss the issue.Spearheaded by South Down MP, Chris Hazzard, the delegation will be seeking assurances that all services will be restored to their previous level.Ahead of the meeting, Mr Hazzard said that due to the pandemic, the local community was left without access to vital services at the Downe due to the health systemrsquos response to coronavirus which ldquorequired what amounted to extraordinary measures for an extraordinary time.The MP said the Downe was left ldquounrecognisable as emergency and outpatient services, amongst others, closed from the end of March.ldquoWhere required, all available staff and equipment from these units was also requisitioned for use in other parts of the South Eastern Trust area, he continued.ldquoIn agreeing to the radical reconfiguration of the Downe, the community made a big sacrice in order to accommodate the unprecedented demands made by both health trusts in the fight against Covid-.Insisting that it was the right thing to do at the right time, Mr Hazzard said there is now an onus on trust management to respond in kind to the community.He said the recently published recovery plans have delayed the restoration of vital services to the community, causing signicant concern amongst many who fear that ldquotemporary closure might inevitably mean permanent removal.Mr Hazzard said the Sinn Fein delegation will be calling for the full restoration of services at the Downe and will also be meeting with the chief executive of the Southern Trust to call for services removed from Newryrsquos Daisy Hill hospital to be reinstated.Rowallane DUP councillors are also demanding the full restoration of services at the Downe Hospital, highlighting the importance of reopening the emergency department as soon as possible.Cllr Billy Walker said it was ironic that within hours of confirmation that the Downpatrick ED would not reopen at this stage, the South Eastern Trust revealed via social media that the Ulster Hospitalrsquos emergency department was extremely busy.ldquoThis is nothing new, he declared. ldquoThere is a clear need for the Downersquos emergency department to reopen now. Having this facility available can help ease the pressure on other EDs and we cannot understand why there is not increased investment in Downpatrick.ldquoWe all understood the temporary closure of services at the Downe to allow health chiefs to respond to the global pandemic, but the time for those services to be reinstated is now. The people of this district demand and expect nothing less, he added..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Calls for start date as Mallon backs scheme  ","story":"WORK on Ballynahinchrsquos new multi-million pound bypass could potentially start before next March.Stormont roads minister Nichola Mallon has included the near two-mile scheme in a list of strategic projects that will be progressed during the current financial year, with the Ballynahinch project effectively ready to proceed.Never before has the Ballynahinch scheme been accorded such a high priority by the Department of Infrastructure, with all attention now focusing on confirmation of a start date.Major progress has been made over recent years to advance the scheme to link the Newcastle and Saintfield roads with the bypass designed to alleviate chronic town centre congestion in Ballynahinch and along the main approach roads to the town.Major new roundabouts are proposed at the Belfast Road junction with the Saintfield Road and at the Newcastle Road junction with the Downpatrick Road, with a new bridge constructed over the Moss Road.Overtaking lanes stretching almost  metres are proposed at either end of the by-pass where the major new roundabouts are to be constructed, with the scheme also including a shared footpath and cycle lane.The bypass is the single biggest road scheme ever proposed for the district with suggestions that it will take at least  months to construct, with roads officials insisting that the scheme will reduce journey times and improve road safety.Announcing her decision to progress the Ballynahinch bypass and a number of other flagship road projects over the next year, Ms Mallon said her plan is to aid economic recovery and community transformation.She has asked her officials to press ahead with the bypass and other major road schemes in other parts of the Province, including the southern relief road in Newry, the Enniskillen and Cookstown bypasses and junction improvements along the A.ldquoThese strategic and flagship road improvement schemes span Northern Ireland and will deliver for many communities and help to address regional imbalance, said the minister.ldquoMany communities across the North have waited a long time for progress to be made and while Covid- has left considerable challenges, I have been determined to get the wheels in motion and get these schemes back on track.The roads minister said each of the schemes are at a dferent stage, explaining that she has asked her officials to bring forward plans to press ahead in the short and longer term.Ms Mallon added: ldquoWhile these are uncertain and dficult times, with a focus on green recovery, I also recognise that our road infrastructure needs updated to relieve traffic in towns, explore options for active travel and reshape our places to deliver towns and cities that work for our communities and aid economic growth.ldquoI hope to be in a position in the coming weeks to provide a further update on the progress being made.South Down MP Chris Hazzard has welcomed the ministerial commitment to deliver the new Ballynahinch bypass.A former roads minister in a previous Northern Ireland Executive, he has urged Ms Mallon to deliver on what he described as her ldquonew found commitment to the multi-million pound scheme by committing resources and commencing construction work as soon as possible.The MP claimed Ms Mallonrsquos commitment to ldquodevelop the eagerly-awaited project last Friday came after she had ldquofailed to include the bypass scheme in her departmentrsquos budget statement earlier in the week.ldquoThe local community will be relieved that the roads minister hasnrsquot forgotten about the Ballynahinch bypass after a disappointing few days following her capital budget plans were published earlier in the week, without mention of the local scheme, continued Mr Hazzard.ldquoI welcome the fact that the minister has finally now publicly acknowledged and committed to further develop the scheme. However, bearing in mind the scheme is all but shovel ready, this should be a simple case of signing the commencement orders with construction starting as soon as possible.Mr Hazzard said the roads minister has a capital budget of more than poundm to be spent this year, suggesting that very few projects are as advanced as the Ballynahinch bypass.ldquoThere is no logical reason why this long overdue project canrsquot get the green light for construction as a matter of priority, he said.The MP added: ldquoIn light of the severe economic impact of Covid- and the ongoing Brexit uncertainty, the commencement of this scheme would be a welcome step towards improving both our local economy and the wellbeing of our community..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Darragh Cross residents bring cheer to local residential home  ","story":"RESIDENTS from Oakland Court in Darragh Cross made the most of the lockdown by having socially distanced nights of entertainment while helping the residents of a nearby residential home.From hosting fun events such as bingo and discos, they raised pound for Willowview Residential Home in Saintfield.Oakland Court residents would like to thank Darragh Crossrsquo Vivo shop for its donation of prize hampers and everyone who donated prizes and gts.In turn, all residents and staff of Willowview Residential Home would like to say pay their gratitude to to all the residents of Oakland Court and Darragh Cross Vivo for their kindness and thoughtfulness..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"DNA testing on dog dirt  ","story":"SENIOR Newry, Mourne and Down Council officers say they will need time to research the issue of using DNA testing on dog dirt in a bid to trace animals which are allowed to use public areas as open air toilets.Members of the local authorityrsquos Neighbourhood Services Committee will discuss the issue at their virtual meeting later today.A motion on the issue tabled by Rowallane councillor Patrick Brown at the March meeting of the full council was referred to the local authority committee for discussion.Dog dirt poses a major health risk, especially to children, who could potentially lose their sight as a result of coming into contact with it.Cllr Brown said there was a need to consider innovative ways of tackling the issue which has been raised on a regular basis by elected representatives across the local authorityrsquos seven DEAs.He is keen for the local authority to investigate the viability of using DNA testing in a bid to identy offenders and aid enforcement officers to dish out fines.Cllr Brown is also eager for council officials to draw upon best practice from other councils who have introduced such a scheme in a bid to crack down on the dog fouling issue.In addition, he wants the local authority to roll out what he has described as an ldquoenhanced public awareness campaign focusing on the dangers of dog fouling.Ahead of tonightrsquos council meeting, officers are recommending that Cllr Brownrsquos motion is agreed to allow them time to research similar schemes which have been introduced where.In addition, officers say that they will need to understand the time and resources required to implement such a scheme locally beforereporting back to the council committee.Politicians, who have previously asked for more enforcement staff to be deployed across the district to deal with the dog fouling problem, say the highly contentious issue is one of the single most complained about problems in the area.They say that despite valiant efforts over recent years by council officials and others, the issue has not been adequately addressed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Drive in assembly at Crossgar primary school  ","story":"CEDAR Integrated Primary School in Crossgar has said farewell to its P pupils.Staff held a drive-in leavers ceremony for the outgoing P class last Friday.Parents and carers were invited to park in the playground and watch the  pupils receive folders of their work from their time at Cedar.They also received a survival kit for lsquobig schoolrsquo, as well as trophies for sports, arts and ICT,.

He was also famous for discovering milk chocolate.Born in Killyleagh on April , , Sir Hans died in Cha in , aged  and described as the worldrsquos greatest collector who, from his earliest years, catalogued and carefully encased every artefact that he found.Over the years he accumulated nearly , items many of which today are on display in the British Museum.Close to the picturesque harbour in Killyleagh stands a copy of the London statue in honour of Sir Hans with a local councillor branding the campaign to take down the statues in the capital as ldquoridiculousCllr Billy Walker insists that the pioneering physician was not a slave trader and that the clamour for many statues to be taken down was becoming ldquosilly, urging the Government to show some backbone on the matter.He said Sir Hans was ldquorevered in his home town where people were proud to have a copy of the statue to a man who did so much for the world.Cllr Walker continued: ldquoSir Hans gave us the concept of free museums, found a cure for smallpox and pioneered science and medicine to do away with magic for treating illness.ldquoHe also promoted the use of quinine against malaria, discovered milk chocolate and was the first man to lead both Royal Colleges.

In addition to the services directly provided at our local hospital mdash the peoplersquos hospital mdash Downe staff were redeployed to other healthcare facilities andcontributed enormously to the NHS effort.When the emergency planning was taking effect, it was the clear understanding of many local political and community representatives, that the emergency department service would be restored immediately upon the conclusion of the pandemic.Whilst there is clearly a signicant possibility of a so-called second surge in infections mdash and we are all aware as to just how serious such a second surge could be mdash at the same time there is increased normalisation of health provision across the North.The restoration of the urgent care service previously provided at the Downe must be a top priority as part of this normalisation. It should have been included in the June action plan, published by the health trust last week.Just last week, as attendances were increasing at the remaining emergency departments, including at the Ulster Hospital, it was apparent that existing facilities are and will be unable to cope with demand.During the Covid emergency planning, decisions were taken to temporarily close the emergency departments at the Downe, Daisy Hill and the Mater hospitals.Just last week, trade union representatives received categorical assurances from the Southern Trust about the re-opening of about Daisy Hill Hospital. Similar assurances are now required about the Downe.There is also a signicant impetus gathering now for the implementation of restructuring of healthcare services generally, and of urgent care in particular, across Northern Ireland.Decisions about the future of healthcare, particularly urgent care, afford an excellent opportunity to redress health inequalities that have arisen and been perpetuated by the historic under investment in the health service by successive governments and by the pursuit of centralisation policies.Many people believe that those centralisation policies played a crucial role in leaving us facing into a pandemic with insufficient hospital beds, insufficient intensive care beds, insufficient ambulance cover, insufficient ventilators and insufficient healthcare workers.Any change to emergency and urgent care provision is only permissible where it happens with the consent of the people.In the final analysis, decisions about the allocation of healthcare resources are political decisions taken by politicians, elected by the people and not by bureaucrats. Tiers and levels of bureaucracy make no dference to where ultimate responsibility lies.I have a great deal of sympathy for the recently appointed health minister, Robin Swann, who within a few weeks of his appointment, found himself facing the biggest public health emergency in the history of the National Health Service.I would respectfully suggest that Mr Swann should insist upon the criteria for change stated by Michelle OrsquoNeill when she was Health Minister.The now Deputy First Minister stated in November  that local people should be at the centre of decision-making processes in designing and delivering services. The , people who marched through Downpatrick in support of the Downe Hospitalin the Love the Downe Rally on February , , would certainly agree with that.As far back as , Dr Michael McBride, speaking at the sod cutting ceremony for the new Downe Hospital, said that ldquothe emphasis would be on making the health system respond to the patient rather than the patient to the system. I concur with that.In the Down Recorder of November , , after the publication of the Bengoa Report, Michelle OrsquoNeill was quoted as saying: ldquoWe will deliver care and support in the most appropriate settings, ideally in peoplersquos homes and communities.Again, I would concur with that.If there is to be a change in urgent care provision across Northern Ireland, no one can expect to be immune from that change. At the same time, change would only be possible or acceptableit is to create a better service for all of the people and a fair and equitable distribution of services.Many people in this area believe that we have had a very raw deal for over  years from the health service and some politicians.It sometimes seems to be forgotten that the National Health Service is free at the point of use, but it is certainly not without cost. It is the people who pay for it.Rural communities have particular characteristics and needs that must be addressed, in terms of at the most basic, accessibility to services. Like everyone , they have rights.Access to healthcare is a right, not a privilege.If it is to be the case that urgent care is being restructured, citizens in rural areas which, for this purpose, includes virtually anyone outside the Greater Belfast area, cannot be expected to forego services so that Belfast can continue to enjoy a proleration of emergency services, with not one but two Type  emergency departments on the scale of that at the Ulster Hospital, on its overdeveloped and cramped site, the Royal Victoria Hospital and the Mater, with the Type  unit at the Lagan Valley hospital, just seven miles from Belfast, a similar distance to that travelled by the people of Ardglass to the Downe hospital.Of course, Type  emergency departments are also to be found at Antrim and Craigavon, neither of which are far from Belfast and are linked by the best possible road infrastructure.Logically, it would seem, that the existence of two Type  units in Belfast is not sustainable, given the apparent massive pressure on services.We were told by the Department of Health at the time of the January  public meeting in Downpatrick Cricket Club that the purpose of that meeting was to enable local people to ldquofundamentally shape, inform and influence the criteria to be used to deliver services in the future.We hope that is still the case and await meaningful engagement with the community before change is implemented.The then deputy permanent secretary was quoted as having said that the then Minister would want to see ldquoongoing engagement in redesigning services. I am sure that the current Health Minister has the same views.The challenge for the Health Minister in the future must surely be to develop a fair and equitable distribution of services that would end discrimination against rural communities and ensure that all services, including ambulance services, are readily accessible to all of the people.It is worth remembering as well, that there was actually a .%in the attendances at emergency departments in Northern Ireland between December  and December . In the same period, attendances at the Downe Hospitalrsquos emergency department rose signicantly.Decisions about change in the health service are political decisions. All of the major parties form the Northern Ireland Executive, which is collectively accountable for the program for government and all that it delivers or fails to deliver for the people.It is imperative that any attempt to change or restructure healthcare provision in Northern Ireland is done so in full consultation with the end users of the services, who are also the paymasters for it. This will be very dficult, as history has created a deep mistrust between substantial elements in our community and the Department of Health.Our community has suffered greatly from repeated cuts to services and the ruthless pursuit of a centralisation agenda a pursuit that has continued even in recent years when the NHS in England and Wales has been investing in and supporting smaller hospitals, recognising their crucial roles at the heart of local communities and using technological advances to support them.If it appears that Covid- is being used as a cover to implement long-standing Department of Health policy, then any changes would be resented by the community and in fact rejected by it. This would lead to an irreparable breach of trust between the people and the State.If an attempt is made to in any way reduce the services that are currently on offer at the Downe Hospital, this community, as it has done before, will rise up in righteous indignation.Twenty five thousand people took to the streets of Downpatrick in February . If our emergency department is not restored within a reasonable timescale mdash a matter of weeks mdash it is very likely that this area will see an unprecedented display of anger, with , plus people on the street, with legal challenges about any perceived abuse of process and a community-wide campaign, a cross-community campaign and political upheaval at the highest level of government.The people of East and South Down have had enough. They have reluctantly sacriced local services, as a temporary measure in the short term, but their resolve should not be underestimated.The people of Newcastle, Ballynahinch, Castlewellan, Ardglass, Killough, Clough, Downpatrick, Strangford, Crossgar, Lower Mourne and the vast surrounding rural hinterland need these services.Farmers, fishermen and builders need emergency care as much as ever, so too do the tourists who flock into our area every year and probably will do so in even greater numbers this year.It is time to restore the Downe Hospitalrsquos emergency department and it is time to concentrate investment in local services, delivering for the people who need the services, where they need those services.The NHS must serve the people from ldquocradle to grave. It is a part of the social contract between the people and those who govern them.Politicians and administrators come and go.

Beyond the boundary!Yet this domineering, almost bullying, approach belied one of Irish cricketrsquos truest gentlemen off it: soft-spoken, never a word that offended, never a word against him.In one of the most distinguished legacies to the local game, the late Downpatrick farmer captained the Ireland team before turning to administration in the roles of chairman and president of the Northern Cricket Union and president of the Irish Cricket Union.Yet it was where it mattered most, at the grassroots of the game, that Alfie left his indelible mark.His devotion to the Downpatrick club and its famous international ground The Meadow was boundless and le-long, from underage player to captain of the club, coach and ultimately chairman and president.He either played or captained Downpatrick in five NCU Senior League, three Senior Cup-winning sides and an Irish Senior Cup triumph along with his older brother Hugh, another talented batsman whose death at the age of  dealt a terrible blow to Alfie.In later years it was a source of great pride that Hughrsquos son, Paul, was to captain the club and daughter Anne played for Ireland.His wersquos nephew, James Cunningham, also captained the club.Alfiersquos hard-hitting ways over four decades from the s took him to  Irish appearances mdash six of them as captain mdash in the days when international caps were much less liberally awarded, and his contribution to the success of NCU representative cricket has rarely been equalled.Administration was an endless labour of love at local, provincial and national level. Such was his accommodating nature that he chaired countless committees ranging from solving an umpire shortage in the NCU to raising funds at ICU golf days.His contribution to his local community extended far beyond the boundaries of the cricket club.In his day he was a member of the NI Sports Council, a director of his local hospital trust and president of Ardglass Golf Club.Alfiersquos friends were legion, none more close than Cecil Walker, that leading light of the Lisburn club.Their playing days over, they travelled the world with their wives watching international cricket and storing delightful memories of new friendships, whether tales of the Bodyline era over tea with Harold Larwood at his home in Sydney, or a fond mention by David lsquoBumblersquo Lloyd from the commentary box.Of all thatrsquos been written down the years about Alfie Linehan, one game has been overlooked and yet it speaks more than any of his commitment to Downpatrick.It was Saturday, August , , and Downpatrick were due to play Lurgan. It was also the day of Alfiersquos wedding to his beloved Mary. No problem: wedding in the morning, cricket in the afternoon, reception in the evening, off on honeymoon the next day.Of all the tributes paid to Alfie none has been more signicant than that on BBC Televisionrsquos Sports Personality of the Year programme last December.He was included in the prestigious roll of honour of international sports personalities who had died during . The programme called them ldquospecial people.My own personal memory of Alfie will always be the toast he iniably delivered at the end of an eveningrsquos conviviality, of which there were many:ldquoMay you always walk in sunshineSlumber warm when night winds blowMay you always live with laughterFor a smile becomes you soThis article was first published on the CricketEurope website as part of a series paying tribute to those who have made signicant contributions to Irish cricket..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Traffic calming measures are needed at Castlewellan road  ","story":"TWO local Sinn Fein representatives have voiced their concern over speeding traffic on a Castlewellan road.MLA Emma Rogan and Cllr Roacuteisiacuten Howell say residents in the Burrenwood Road area have contacted them over the speed of some of the vehicles.However, they are both disappointed with the responsive their queries received from the Department of Infrastructure.Cllr Howell said that while the road met the criteria for traffic calming measures to be introduced and had been earmarked as a priority, the Department was unable to carry out the work at present.She remarked: ldquoWhile both myself and the local community welcome that Burrenwood Road has been recognised as a priority, it is extremely frustrating that due to an oversubscribed waiting list the work will not be carried out.ldquoItrsquos very annoying for us to hear the road now meets criteria but wonrsquot be completed due to it not sitting high enough on a waiting list.Cllr Howell added: ldquoThis is a disappointing response and I understand the frustration of residents.Ms Rogan said she would be contacting the Infrastructure minister to ascertain when the work will be carried out.She added: ldquoThe safety of pedestrians especially young children must be paramount..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Virtual meeting to support businesses affected by virus  ","story":"PLANS have been unveiled for a virtual meeting to help businesses across the district which have been severely hit by the coronavirus pandemic.South Down MLA Colin McGrath and Downpatrick councillor John Trainor are organising a so-called lsquotown hallrsquo event designed to offer solutions for business operations post Covid-.The event mdash which takes place next Wednesday evening on Zoom at pm ndash will feature expert advice from a number of leading figures from the business world.They include Glyn Roberts of Retail Northern Ireland and Colin Neill of Hospitality NI, who will be joined by Tourism NIrsquos chief executive, John McGrillen.Mr McGrath and Cllr Trainor want as many businesses as possible to join the June  video conference event and ask the questions that matter to them.The Assemblyman believes that itrsquos incumbent on politicians, Northern Ireland Executive ministers and MPs to fight for businesses and help develop strategies that will benefit them post-coronavirus.ldquoNext weekrsquos virtual meeting is deigned to provide these businesses with key advice so that when they all reopen, they will continue providing the first class service they have been offering, in some instances, for decades, said Mr McGrath.ldquoI have been working with our local council SDLP team in establishing a video conference call with expert figures from this sector.Mr McGrath said next weekrsquos event will outline his partyrsquos plans for how it will work with local business as everyone prepares to exit lockdown.He added: ldquoI would encourage as many businesses as possible to get in touch and wersquoll get you connected with this quickly evolving network of local business support and advice.Cllr Trainor said while the financial support offered by the NI Executive to many businesses to help them cope with the challenges of coronavirus was welcome, his party was keen to explore what would happen post Covid- and what support would be required.He added: As a result of the initial shock and upheaval caused by the pandemic, businesses have lost a great deal and some have had to shut up shop entirely.ldquoThere is much fear and concern over what will happen to the businesses that are still operating, in particular, those in the retail, hospitality and tourism sectors..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/11488251.jpg","title":"government plan give drivers   switch electric car","story":"How will it work What would the scheme achieve This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We weren’t alone, with the BMA and nursing professional bodies concurring. We were denied sight of ‘the science’ until Imperial College’s research was leaked. This ideological, Darwinesque, anarchistic push from the libertarian-right set an unfortunate tone from which we should all guard. The botched ‘closure’ of schools in Northern Ireland, with + schools remaining open to receive, on average, just two, three or four children of key workers, was a reflection of local political dference. Far too many schools opened during lockdown and teachers could do little about this.NEU have contributed positively with the minister for education and the department to find ways forward. Our detailed -page discussion document “On ato Education in Northern Ireland” was widely praised as a positive pupil-centred contribution when presented publicly and to the Assembly Education Committee. Our teachers and educators have continued to work long hours, well beyond the constricts of their contracts. Teachers well understand that disadvantage is compounded for the most marginalised pupils during lockdown. With infection rates dropping, and the economy struggling, we all accept that calculated risks are required for some sort of normalisation to occur. Our recent meeting with the minister on th June was wholly constructive and collegiate.It is time to ‘dial-down’ the tone of the discourse and work together, positively, for a safeto schooling in mid to late August.Mark Langhammer, Regional Secretary, NEU, Northern Ireland ——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

in one of his articles that such a progressive town as Penarth was without an operatic and dramatic society, writes Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Societypresident, Mary Gardner.The response to his outcry was quickly taken up and within three weeks the Penarth Operatic Society was formed.The Societyrsquos first production was Gilbert  Sullivanrsquos Iolanthe, played at The Hippodrome which later burnt down, and what a glittering opening evening it must have been as the audience wore evening dress.The review featured next day read, ldquoBrilliant Initial Performance.More newsVale council issues warning over the use of parksFines increased for coronavirus lockdown breachesMarie Curie Great Blooming Tea Party goes virtualA few years later in , the drama section came into being and with it a new title of the Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Society, known affectionately as PODS.Since then PODS has progressed down through the decades with many highlights along the way.One being in  when PODS presented that great musical, The King And I, which won the premier prize at the Waterford International Festival, for which the company received a beautul Waterford crystal vase.The Town Council held a reception to honour the Society at the Paget Rooms, and James Callaghan, the local MP, paid his tribute to PODS saying it ldquoadded lustre and brought culture to Penarth.Another landmark was the play, Dear Octopus, by Dodie Smith produced for PODS th anniversary celebrations.One of our most challenging and exciting shows was Cabaret in , which won the National Operatic  Dramatic Associationrsquos award for Best Production and Best Stage Management and Technical presentation.More recently in , to honour and pay tribute to the many men who gave their lives in World War One, PODS presented the very special play, Last Man Standing, which also won a NODA award for Best Drama.In , PODS decided to do pantomime, and this has been a greatly gratying and popular addition to the companyrsquos output.Itrsquos wonderful to see children in the cast having on-stage experience, and then those children in the audience, perhaps for the first time, enjoying and loving live theatre.PODS is a very busy Society putting on four shows a year, a musical, two plays and a pantomime.Mrs Gardner said: ldquoThis year, sadly and very upsettingly after much hard work by all involved, the covid- virus struck as PODS had just set-up at the Paget Rooms ready for its run of Goodnight Mister Tom, only to be told the venue would be shut down next day.ldquoSince January, the Society had also been rehearsing for its May musical, The Full Monty, and that too has had to be cancelled.       ,params: .pushldquoNevertheless, when this terrible emergency is over the company will

years, and its goal is to make its centenary in  with the help of its faithful audiences, friends and patrons.PODS is always ready to welcome new members, but at the moment it cannot meet or rehearse due to the covid- restrictions.It might be some time before restrictions are lted on groups being able to rehearse together, or audiences allowed back in theatres, meanwhile PODS members keep in touch

option to alleviate potential flood risk.More NewsVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldMillions become unpaid carers due to coronavirus crisisPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownThe campaign by the Save Dinas Powys Woods and Protect Homes from Flooding group was launched in March  after the Woodland Trust said NRW was proposing to build a dam within its site of Cwm George and Casehill Woods.The group said the proposals would involve cutting down  square metres of trees including  square metres of ancient trees and regular flooding upstream during high rainfall would result in further destruction of ancient trees, hedgerows, wildle, and plants.Dormice and other protected species like bats were at risk, the group said.The woods, much-loved by the community, attracts visitors from other areas and is the Woodland Trustrsquos most visited site in Wales with more than , visitors.Hundreds of people took part in marches in  to oppose the dam.NRW released its draft Outline Business Case in February  and a consultation period with the local community took place.Hundreds of people attended a meeting in February to oppose the dam and they wrote to NRW, with their views, during the coronavirus lockdown.Chairman of Save Dinas Powys Woods  Protect Homes From Flooding, Peter Smith said the group welcomed the announcement that NRW will not develop a dam in the Dinas Powys Woods.ldquoLocal people recognise the flood risk in the village, but are overwhelmingly in favour of a natural flood management programmein the Cadoxton River and Eastbrook catchments, plus improved channel maintenance andrequired local hard defences, rather than an environmentally unfriendly dam, Dr Smith said.ldquoOur proposals will slow the flow of the rivers upstream thus reducing the risk of flash flooding, and by removing obstacles improve flow downstream.ldquoWe now look forward to working with NRW and The Woodland Trust to design an effective NFM scheme.ldquoBoth have expertise in this area, and, having made funds available for NFM projects, we know that the Welsh Government is keen for Wales to become

including the Woodland Trust, our local community councils, and county councillors.ldquoWe extend our particular thanks our local MS, Jane Hutt, for her advocacy and support.Community councillor, Chris Franks said NRW must not now ignore any problems.ldquoClearly over the years there has been reduced spending on maintenance of the stream through Dinas Powys and towards Barry, he said.ldquoThe public has said that the NRW must improve monitoring of flows on the Cadoxton River, implement natural flood management measures and improve flow at Cardf Road bridge where the stream passes under the

causing other concerns such as limiting access to food and healthcare.This is the time of year when there is the least amount of food available, and the closing of markets and freedom to travel for farmers to source food and water means that times are exceptionally hard.Jenipher as vice-chairwoman of a Fairtrade coffee cooperative, is responsible for many who rely on the cooperative for work.The expert hand-sorters who are seasonal workers and rely on this part of the coffee chain to feed their family at this time, have no coffee to sort.While they may have some spare eggs, vegetables or matoke to trade, the threat of soldiers prohibiting them from doing so is too much for them.Farmer co-operatives, an essential element of Fairtrade, enable and encourage communities to work together.Fairtrade also requires an extra amount of money, the Fairtrade premium, to be paid to producers.Fairtrade farmers like Jenipher are struggling, but they have the benefits of a strong local community as well as the backup of the Fairtrade premium.Fairtrade International have announced a .m euro Fairtrade Producer Relief fund targeting the immediate needs and Resilience Fund to help producers rebuild their businesses after Covid-.Jenipher Wettaka Sambazi said: ldquoLe is hard.ldquoThe markets are shut so there is nowhere to sell or earn money, or to buy food and basic essentials.ldquoLocal health centres have been shut to reduce the chance of spreading the virus, but since all transport is banned, those who need operations, treatment or antenatal care need to walk  km to the nearest hospital.ldquoTwo women and their unborn babies have died on the way.\"Roger Casey, who attends Tabernacle Baptist Church said: ldquoIt was wonderful to meet Jenipher and hear her story.ldquoWe get through a lot of coffee in our office and meeting a real coffee farmer from Uganda makes you think about the real people and real lives behind that Fairtrade logo.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquoMeeting Jenipher during her visit to Wales earlier this year was inspiring.ldquoThe increasing dficulties facing rural farming communities because of the pandemic has shown how important Fairtrade cooperatives continue to be and I am glad that leaders like Jenipher continue to promote the benefits of Fairtrade and to support communities.National co-ordinator of Fair Trade Wales, Aileen Burmeister added: ldquoFair Trade producers are being impacted by covid- restrictions.ldquoGlobal stock markets are falling, meaning that farmers and workers are receiving far less for their produce.\"It is in these times that we can really see how important the Fairtrade minimum price is. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey

favourite rsquoshoutsrsquo are oddly those which occur in the early hours of the morning on a spring day.ldquoBy the time the job has been completed and the boats are washed down and prepared again for service, we gather on our balcony drinking tea or coffee, watching the sun rise and exchanging with each other our plans for the day ahead, before most other people have woken up.Celebrating the success of the station, current leboat operations manager, Jason Dunlop said ldquoI am incredibly proud to celebrate the stationrsquos -year anniversary.ldquoIt is testament to the community of

Everyone appreciates and takes responsibility for their protection, preservation and enhancement’.”The spokesperson continued: “In addition to a number of active travel projects already completed, the Council is continuing to develop and deliver initiativesto allow it to meet these objectives.“Active travel is a unique resource as a potential driver for economic regeneration and user well beingand the council is currently looking at ‘The One Path’ initiative in order to discuss and understand the issues people face when using shared paths and to collaboratively develop ways which help people to better share the space.“The Council is currently investigating the possibility of delivering a Landcare project in the Carn, Seagoe and Charlestown industrial areas of the Borough with the aim of developing the infrastructure around existing walking and cycling networks.“The Council fully understands the importance of implementing active travel within our infrastructure and is open to exploring all options to help benefit the lives of all who live, work and visit our Borough.”Adam Morton , Local Democracy Reporting Service\"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyNews you can trust since News\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisCoronavirusSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us    "},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1592493837675.jpg--health_minister_issues_shielding_advice.jpg?159249383700","title":"health minister issues shielding advice ","story":"Health Minister Robin Swann has announced plans to pause the shielding advice that was issued to people ahead of the Covid- peak in Northern Ireland. From  July, subject to the rate of community transmission continuing to be low, people will no longer need to shield and should instead follow the same guidance and precautions as those considered to be generally vulnerable. That involves taking particular care when out and about - and strictly maintaining social distancing.Letters will be issued in the coming days to all those covered by shielding informing them of the planned change.Mr Swann stated: “I have been clear that shielding would not last one minute longer than it needed to. We have now reached the point where,the current trends continue, there will be no need for anyone to shield after  July. “I have listened to many of you and to the challenges you have faced during this period. I am in no doubt as to the dficulties shielding has presented for a great many people.“It is unrealistic to think these dficulties will just vanish because the need to shield has ended. That is why the letters we issue will provide details of the support which will continue to be available up to and after  July.“While my announcement today will be welcome news for many who are shielding, some will view the prospect of an end to shielding with great anxiety. I want to assure them that they should decide what to do at their own pace. Everyone will approach this situation dferently.“As is so often the case at present, this will be about weighing up the options and making informed choices. Going outside can bring some degree of potential risk but this can be mitigated and minimised by strict social distancing. Staying indoors indefinitely is not good for anyone’s mental or physical health.“Finally, I would ask everyone to be considerate as people end their periods of shielding.We should all continue to social distance, but in the coming weeks I want you to be particularly understanding of the fact you might be encountering someone who has had to stay at home for many weeks. Please be aware of this, show respect and kindness to all and keep your distance.”  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_ecaecbbaddcaaa   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_debead   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
