This was down from a peak of almost 2,000 on Tuesday last week.A similar downturn has been recorded among 15 to 19-year-olds, from 860-odd to 810 per 10,000, and 5 to 9-year-olds, from 760 to 700.Experts said the downturn before half-term began was likely genuine and thanks to surging immunity levels in the age groups sparked by the back-to-school wave.But some have warned it could be down to a drop in Covid testing, suggesting children were more lax about testing themselves in the run up to half-term. Children are required to test themselves for the virus twice a week and report the results to Test and Trace.Testing figures are not broken down by age group, but figures from the Department of Health suggest the number of swabs carried out barely changed in the two weeks before half-term began.Separate figures from the UK Health Security Agency — which took over from Public Health England — suggested the number of lateral flow tests carried out fell by ten per cent in the week before the holidays.But the test positivity rate also fell, suggesting that the drop in cases is genuine."},{"url":null,"title":"Brazen burglars ransack grandfathers home lay DYING sofa","story":"Share this article Katie\u0027s aunt, who lives across the road, said she saw two men leave the house in the early hours of the morning.Katie explained: \u0027My auntie said she saw two men leaving the house, one on a bike and another with what looked like my dad\u0027s toolbox in their hand.\u0027Katie said the problem isn\u0027t that her father\u0027s stuff has been taken, but that they didn\u0027t think to call for help if they\u0027d known her father had passed away or was dying.She said: \u0027At the minute, we\u0027ve got so many questions going around our heads.

Nobody is coming out to find me in the lost and found. To be honest, sometimes I feel like I’m crying myself to sleep because it’s so unfair.

He can’t get up. He can’t function. He was screaming in pain and that was really, really hard.“The chest cavity is now making direct contact with the pelvis, so you have bone on bone.

Pupils who do not show any symptoms after close contact with someone who has Covid-19 have not been required to restrict their movements since late September, when the Government accepted National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) recommendations on measures for children aged up to 13 years.President of the INTO Joe McKeown told Newstalk Breakfast the rise in Covid-19 infections in the community required the intervention of public health authorities.“We said the Government should take a cautious approach in relation to schools and we said the Government should wait until Halloween before deciding whether or not to remove the risk assessments and the contact tracing. “But the decision was made at the end of September on the basis that numbers were going to stabilise and decline. As you know and we all know that hasn’t happened. Numbers have gone up. ”Mr McKeown said last week 2,393 primary school children tested positive for Covid-19.Schools will reopen next week as planned, despite the rising number of Covid-19 cases among children aged between five and 12.Taoiseach Micheál Martin said no consideration was being given to extending the mid-term break.Tánaiste Leo Varadkar separately said of the possibility of an extended half-term or Christmas break: “We’re not anywhere near that point yet. And the thing we need to prioritise for kids is school because they’ve missed enough school already . . . I think we’d need to see a very serious deterioration in the situation before we’d get to that point.”A further 2,605 new Covid-19 cases were confirmed on Thursday.The INTO has also called for a pilot antigen testing scheme to begin without delay in primary schools. Mr McKeown said antigen testing may have a role in facilitating the attendance of children in school.“We are also in a situation where we know over 2,000 children were out of school with Covid but we have no idea how many parents kept their children outside of school this week because they heard there might have been a case in a class.”HalloweenMr McKeown added that the advice given by deputy chief medical officer Ronan Glynn that parents should restrict the after school activities of their children was a “sensible” intervention.Meanwhile, immunologist at NUI Maynooth Prof Paul Moynagh expressed “surprise” at Dr Glynn’s call to parents , stressing that the focus should be on improving conditions in schools where class sizes can reach up to 30.In an interview on Newstalk Breakfast, Prof Moynagh described children’s activities outside school as generally low risk.“We seem to be saying that the activities outside of school are higher risk than the risk in school where there is 30 children in a room for five hours. I absolutely agree that schools should be open but that to me probably poses a higher risk. ”Prof Moynagh said we should be increasing our emphasis on issues such as ventilation, portable air filtration and antigen testing rather than zoning in on low-risk outdoor activities partaken in by children.He said the messaging around antigen testing had been inconsistent. However, he welcomed suggestions that vaccinated asymptomatic close contacts could potentially receive antigen tests in school.Prof Moynagh said we need to mitigate risks of school with antigen testing.“If we go down the contact tracing close contacts in school and again get parents to use antigen tests and each day they test negative I would suggest allowing the children to go to school. These antigen tests are picking up most of the infectious cases.”Separately, in Northern Ireland seven further deaths of Covid-19 patients were reported on Friday.The North’s Department of Health also reported another 1,321 cases of the virus. – Additional reporting: PAEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"covid s fourth wave if not new restrictions then what is plan b","story":"Nphet showed this week that almost all key metrics are heading in the wrong direction. This at a time when the full impact of increased social mixing, including the effect of nightclubs reopening, has yet to be felt, and before Halloween socialising is factored inFor the first time in this pandemic we are in the midst of a growing wave of infection and illness – the country’s fourth – that is not triggering an aggressive reaction.The National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) is focusing on encouraging bottom-up precautionary actions that we can do inidually rather than recommending top-down Government action to enforce behaviour on us all. After three severe lockdowns there is limited public appetite for a return to the restrictions of the past, and, thankfully, there are alternative tools to try to avoid that option. Nonetheless, rising numbers of infections and hospitalisations are a worry, and chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan has not ruled out more significant action if “small changes” do not work.Nphet showed this week that almost all key metrics are heading in the wrong direction. This at a time when the full impact of increased social mixing, including the effect of nightclubs reopening, has yet to be felt, and before Halloween socialising is factored in too.Then there are the risks from schools reopening after the mid-term break, with many families returning from holidays abroad, and the colder weather pushing us indoors into Covid-friendly gatherings. It all makes for an unsettling picture with Christmas approaching.The conflicting forces of a phenomenal vaccination take-up, waning immunity amongst those vaccinated earliest and the more transmissible Delta variant have left Nphet in an unusual situation. Predicted peakDr Holohan admitted this week that even with its prediction of 700 to 800 people with Covid-19 in general hospital care and 150 to 200 in intensive care by mid-November – the predicted peak of this wave – it is not expecting to recommend any restrictions (though he is not ruling them out either). This suggests Nphet, unusually, sees an acceptable level of pressure on the healthcare system that it can tolerate if this prediction regarding the scale of the peak proves to be accurate. Dr Holohan noted that the models relied upon “have performed extraordinarily well” in the past.To put that projected peak in context, there were 481 people in hospital on Friday, including 97 in intensive care units. This is well in excess of the numbers that triggered the first three lockdowns, though, admittedly, the rising curve previously was heading in a far more vertical direction. But Ireland is in a different place now. The fact that some 90 per cent of people aged 12 and over are vaccinated means the vast majority who become infected will avoid severe illness, putting us in a better position to cope with this wave.Still, Nphet is saying that the future trajectory is “very uncertain”. Breakthrough infections and transmission among vaccinated people make managing the situation more difficult. ‘Knife edge’“We are on more of a knife edge now than we were before in the last couple of months with our vaccination rates as high as they are and we are still in trouble,” said Dr Christine Loscher, professor of immunology at Dublin City University. Despite the strong focus on the unvaccinated minority, she says they are not the only group disproportionately represented in hospitals and ICU: case numbers among the over-55s are also high. Nphet said on Wednesday that one in four people hospitalised in May were aged 65 and older this rate is now a worrying one in two. Cases in the 5-12 age group have risen 64 per cent in a fortnight, the most of any cohort. Nphet has flagged this as “concerning”.But it is not just the children. Infections have risen across older groups too, increasing by 50 to 60 per cent across all four age categories from the age of 35 up to 74 since mid-October. Prof Loscher says these trends should prompt a faster roll out of “booster” vaccine to the over-60s – through pharmacies, for example – and nudge the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) into approving boosters for health workers. It should also get the HSE and Government rolling out antigen testing and reintroducing contact tracing in schools, she says.“The messaging needs to be around people obviously being more cautious about what they do, but I feel like the HSE, the Government and Niac need to do their best because there are things they can be doing and they’re not doing them,” said Prof Loscher.More pressureWeathering a rising wave of cases means there will be even more pressure on a health service that Dr Holohan has said is already under “significant pressure”. “I don’t think anyone is in a position to avoid it and change it – it is what it is there is acceptance across the board that it is not going to be easy,” said Paul Harrington, an orthopaedic surgeon at Our Lady’s Hospital in Navan, where the elective orthopaedic unit has been closed because of the latest Covid-19 spike. In the absence of restrictions, what is the plan B to help the health service cope better?Early evidence points to the benefits of booster vaccines. These third doses have been administered to people aged 80 and over since the start of October, and figures show that infections have fallen in recent days amongst the over-85s, while the increase in cases has been lower among the 75- to 84-year-olds than in other older age groups. Israel’s experience of suppressing a Delta wave with a widespread booster programme points to a road map for Ireland for the weeks and months ahead but this may be short-lived.“Nobody really has a plan to deal with it, other than another booster, but there is no evidence that this will have anything beyond a short-term effect,” said one source with a deep knowledge of tracking and tracing the virus.Living with Covid remains, as ever, deeply complicated and unpredictable.

Wash or sanitise hands frequently and before eating or handling treats.”Dr Holohan advised that children should not go trick-or-treating or meet others if they have symptoms of Covid-19 and they should isolate and get a test, even if symptoms are minor.There were 481 people in hospital with Covid-19, compared with 457 a week ago.

Photograph: Getty A former top British diplomat in Washington has accused Boris Johnson’s government of damagingly downplaying the impact of Brexit on Northern Ireland’s “delicate peace process” in statements intended for an American audience.Alexandra Hall Hall, the lead Brexit envoy to the US who quit her job in late 2019 because she was unwilling to “peddle half-truths on behalf of a government I do not trust”, has condemned Mr Johnson’s government for being “wilfully disingenuous” in the official messages she was asked to deliver about Brexit in the US.In a lengthy article published in a US academic journal, the former career diplomat excoriated the UK government for downplaying the cost and impact of Brexit in “public talking points” aimed at presenting the official UK government line in Washington.“They downplayed the increased friction that was likely for businesses trading between the United Kingdom and the EU countries as well as third countries such as the United States, ” wrote Ms Hall Hall in the Texas National Security Review journal.Enormous damageMs Hall Hall wrote that one colleague at the UK embassy in Washington working on Northern Ireland was “nearly in tears” as he “could not get his minister to register the enormous damage that would be done to the fabric of Northern Ireland, politically and economically, if the United Kingdom left the European Union without a deal”.“A low point for me was when I heard a senior British minister openly and offensively, in front of a US audience, dismiss the impact of a no-deal Brexit on Irish businesses as just affecting ‘a few farmers with turnips in the back of their trucks,’ ” she wrote.The former diplomat said that when she was asked to brief American businesses with significant investments in the UK, she struggled to maintain the line that there would be “no harmful consequences” for them if the UK left the EU without a deal.“I found it hard to brush aside the concerns of congressional aides working for members of the Irish-American caucus,” she wrote.“Sometimes I had no answers to the questions that US stakeholders posed to me. The internal dissonance became acute: the professional ethos of the British diplomatic service was that we were upstanding civil servants, steeped in integrity, who never told lies.“And yet, that was precisely what I was being asked to do.”Ms Hall Hall, a former British ambassador to Georgia, was Britain’s Brexit counsellor in the US from 2018 to December 2019, when she resigned.She said she stepped down because she was asked to convey messages to US representatives and politicians that were “neither fully honest nor politically impartial”.In her resignation letter published at the time, she said that her position had become “unbearable personally” and “untenable professionally”.

Photograph:  EPAVatican media Joe Biden and Pope Francis held talks in the Vatican on Friday in a poignant meeting for the second Catholic US president, as both men strain against conservative critics to set green agendas ahead of the landmark climate summit Cop26.The meeting came as the leaders of the world’s biggest economies came together in Rome to find common ground on fair vaccine distribution and action to combat climate change at a G20 gathering just before the start of the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow.Pope Francis said the world “cannot allow” an uninhabitable planet to be passed down to our grandchildren and exhorted leaders to rise to the challenge of addressing climate change, in a public appeal ahead of the summits.“These crises present us with the need to take decisions, radical decisions that are not always easy. At the same time, moments of difficulty like these also present opportunities. Opportunities that we must not waste,” he said in a message recorded for BBC radio.“The political decision-makers who will meet at Cop26 in Glasgow are urgently summoned to provide effective responses to the present ecological crisis, and in this way to offer concrete hope to future generations,” the pope said.“And it is worth repeating: each of us, whoever and wherever we may be, can play our own part in changing our collective response to the unprecedented threat of climate change, and the degradation of our common home.”Abortion stanceThe leader of the world’s 1.3 billion Catholics met the US president and first lady Jill Biden for over an hour, exchanging views on international affairs including the common commitment to care for the planet “in the context of the upcoming G20 summit in Rome”, a Vatican statement read.Mr Biden, a regular Mass-goer who identifies as an Irish Catholic has met Pope Francis before, but not as US president. The encounter came at a politically resonant moment following criticism from US bishops of Mr Biden’s stance on abortion, with hardliners even calling for the Democrat to be denied communion.The US president praised the pontiff for his “leadership in fighting the climate crisis, as well as his advocacy to ensure the pandemic ends for everyone through vaccine sharing and an equitable global economic recovery”, according to a White House statement.At home, Mr Biden’s ambitions for a\u0026nbsp$3.5 trillion investment package to drive a transition to clean energy and improve social conditions ran into opposition from centrist holdouts within his own party and had to be pared down in size to garner the required support.Vaccine donationsOn the eve of his departure for Europe, the president insisted that though the headline investment figure had halved in size to $1.75 trillion (€1.5 trillion) and no longer contained proposals for guaranteed paid sick leave for workers, it was still “historic” and “the most significant investment in climate ever”.Negotiations at the G20 are focused on speeding up vaccine donations to poorer countries as a gulf in equitable distribution has left richer countries with an excess of supply while most healthcare workers in Africa have yet to be inoculated.Talks are ongoing to try to secure a pledge to phase out coal that would allow the 20 biggest economies to build momentum for Cop26 by showing their commitment to action, but the attendance of the Chinese and Russian leaders\u0026nbspXi Jinping and Vladimir Putin by video link rather than in person has stoked doubts about whether ambitious goals would be set.The G20 leaders are also to discuss the next steps towards finalising an OECD agreement to reform the international system for taxing multinationals and set a minimum 15 per cent rate that has seen Ireland abandon its flagship 12.5 per cent policy.The European Union will bring forward proposals to set the taxation reform down in EU law by the end of 2021, European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said ahead of the summit.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Kremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"britain and france in standoff over fishing boat checks and landings","story":"Fishing boats in Boulogne port: France has threatened to impose extra checks on British lorries in a standoff over fishing licences with crown dependencies Jersey and Guernsey. Photograph: Gareth FullerPA Britain has threatened to target all European Union fishing boats in its territorial waters for “rigorous checks” if France blocks British boats from landing catches at its ports. France has also threatened to impose extra checks on British lorries as part of a package of retaliatory measures in a standoff over fishing licences with crown dependencies Jersey and Guernsey. Britain summoned the French ambassador on Friday and Brexit minister David Frost raised the issue at a meeting with European Commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic in London.“Lord Frost also set out to the vice president our concerns about the unjustified measures announced by France earlier this week to disrupt UK fisheries and wider trade, to threaten energy supplies, and to block further co-operation between the UK and the EU, for example on the Horizon research programme,” a government spokesperson said.\u0026nbsp“Lord Frost made clear that, if these actions were implemented as planned on November 2nd, they would put the European Union in breach of the Trade and Co-operation Agreement (TCA).\u0026nbspThe government is accordingly considering the possibility, in those circumstances, of launching dispute settlement proceedings under the TCA, and of other practical responses, including implementing rigorous enforcement processes and checks on EU fishing activity in UK territorial waters, within the terms of the TCA.”Fishing rightsUnder the terms of the agreement, European fishing boats that can demonstrate that they have been fishing in British coastal waters before Brexit should be given licences to continue fishing there. But Jersey and Guernsey have refused 55 applications from French boats on the grounds that they have not provided sufficient evidence.The issue has come to a head now because temporary licences issued earlier this year expire this weekend and only boats that have been licensed or are still under consideration will be able to continue to fish near Jersey and Guernsey.Boris Johnson, who is due to meet Emmanuel Macron in Rome on Sunday morning during the G20 summit, said he did not believe the French president wanted to threaten Britain.“There may be people on both sides of the Channel who may think they have an interest in promoting disharmony between the UK and France, promoting the impression of disharmony between the UK and France. I don’t think Emmanuel shares that perspective personally at all,” he said.‘Appropriate action’“On the particular issues that we have, we are puzzled about what is going on. We fear that there may be a breach of the terms of the Trade and Co-operation Agreement implicit on what is happening and some of the things that are being said. We stand by to take the appropriate action.”Lord Frost’s meeting with Mr Sefcovic ended without a breakthrough on the Northern Ireland protocol but their negotiating teams will meet again in Brussels next week. Lord Frost acknowledged “some overlap\u0026nbspbetween our positions on a subset of the issues” but said substantial gaps remained.The EU has offered sweeping changes to the way the protocol is implemented, which would eliminate most checks on goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland but will not entertain Lord Frost’s demand to remove the role of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in determining if single market rules are being applied properly.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"angela rayners apology welcome question remains do labour","story":"Angela Rayner has, rightly, received much praise for her long and seemingly sincere apology for her injudicious remarks in which she described her political opponents as “Tory scum”.Writing in the wake of the killing of Conservative MP, Sir David Amess, and having reflected on events during leave to cope with a personal bereavement, the Labour deputy leader said: “While I have been away from the cut and thrust of parliament I have reflected on our political debate and the threats and abuse that now seem to feature all too often.“I have also reflected on what I said at an event at Labour Party conference. I was angry about where our country is headed and policies that have made life harder for so many people I represent.

Following Sir David’s death, it’s hardly surprising that Rayner and others are re-examining the way they refer to their political opponents.Not to devalue the importance of her apology, however, a key question remains unanswered: did she mean what she said at that event at Labour conference? It’s all very well, and perfectly understandable, that she now regrets using the vocabulary that she did. Has she now reconsidered her narrow-minded view of her political opponents and decided that most, if not all of the Conservative MPs sitting opposite are just ordinary people trying to do what’s right for their country, even if their preferred policy solutions conflict with Rayner’s own?Or does she merely regret that she spoke her mind? In private does she remain of the view that the government is a “bunch of scum, homophobic, racist, misogynistic, absolute vile, banana republic, vile, nasty, Etonian piece of scum”?The distinction is an important one. Given the praise from the assembled comrades at the time, given the lukewarm, nervous, half-hearted criticism she received from (a few) fellow front benchers at the time, can she honestly claim that the heart and soul of the Labour Party has disclaimed, as she has, her original criticism?If it has, then the party’s chances of winning the next general election – or any future general election – have improved.It would be a calamitous mistake for Labour strategists to assume that those who previously supported Labour but who voted for Boris Johnson’s Conservatives in December 2019 did so without being fully aware of the magnitude of the step they (we) were taking. There is, I suspect, a view among Labour MPs and activists that such voters were political ingénues, feebly, naively and temporarily succumbing to Johnson’s wiles before waking up on the morning after polling and being stricken by buyers’ regret, like a maiden in a Thomas Hardy novel whose moment of lust with the dashing young squire results in a lifetime of regret and recrimination.They (we) knew exactly what they (we) were doing. It is dangerous for Labour to undervalue the importance of that conscious, deliberate decision by hundreds of thousands of voters to abandon a lifetime of party loyalty, just as it was foolish for Labour to do so in response to the same phenomenon a generation earlier, in 1979. And while we can all separate ourselves and our political identities from the party that last won our support, it would be wrong to suppose that many of those who gave Johnson their support no longer associate themselves with that decision or are hoping that the government fails.People want their decisions, however controversial and unexpected, to be validated. Remainers’ hopes that Brexit Britain collapses in economic turmoil reflect a contempt for every single person who voted Leave. And Labour attacks on the personal integrity of Conservative MPs – for the crime of belonging to their party – reveal a genuine contempt for those who voted for them. It’s unconvincing for politicians to claim that their personal – and frequently unhinged – criticism of their opponents is not also aimed at those who chose to put them into power. And voters know this.If, however, Rayner’s change of heart is a mirror image of the wider party, it might hope to start rebuilding its relationship with those who have been tarred with the same class conscious brush that described three hundred odd MPs as scum.Rayner did not say as much. If she had explicitly stated that she now viewed the government benches as just ordinary public servants pursuing the wrong policies, would she have received as good a press from her own partisans? Improving our use of language is an important first step, but if it stops there, if contempt and even hatred of our political opponents is simply unexpressed, contained inside, then at some point it will manifest itself again.A change of heart, not just vocabulary, is what is required.More from NewsThe hounding of Kathleen Stock and what it means for our freedom of speechLockdown fanatics should be ashamed of themselvesRevealed: how the Queen turned to male role model to mentor Prince CharlesCop26: rather than crippling our industries to no purpose, let’s make the world’s polluters payCop26 protests ‘may look messy’, warns police chiefZayn Malik ordered to attend domestic violence programme after screaming abuse at girlfriend\u0026#39s motherMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"cop26 set appalling display western decadence","story":"What is the government’s principal objective for COP26: to persuade other governments to commit to reaching net zero by 2050, or to show off Britain to the world as a place to do business, build the Prime Minister’s personal brand and pull one over on Nicola Sturgeon by presiding over an international event in her own backyard?If the former, it never did make much sense for the government to reject advice to hold it as a virtual event. Surely, when you are preaching about slashing carbon emissions it would set a better example not to have 30,000 delegates fly in from all over the world. When the world has been forced to do business that way for many months anyway, and the technology for remote meetings has been proven, it is deeply perverse not to employ it for this conference of all conferences. Moreover, had the government held the event online it could have argued that Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin were attending it rather than allowing them to take great delight by snubbing the occasion.  But if the Prime Minister is really more interested in the second set of objectives, holding the event live in Glasgow looks like an even worse decision. Even if the train drivers really have called off their threatened strike, the world will still arrive in Glasgow to find some streets piled with rubbish and a desperate shortage of accommodation. What an image it will send if representatives of indigenous peoples from the Amazon and elsewhere - who say they still don’t have anywhere to stay - end up sleeping rough on Sauchiehall Street while the leaders of the rich world are ensconced in five star hotels.  But then that is the climate change elite all over – determined to enjoy a privileged lifestyle which it wants to deny to the rest of us. For months, ordinary travellers to Britain have been made to take expensive tests, isolate for 10 days, shut themselves away in quarantine at a cost of nearly £2000 a time. Then, with COP26 coming up, the red list was dramatically shrunk, even without any obvious drop in global infection rates. And now, the red list will miraculously be abolished altogether. Suddenly it is fine for tens of thousands of people to descend on a city without observing self-isolation.   This is a model for a future which the great and good of the climate movement would love to impose on us – with global economic growth halted so that much of the world can be returned to living lives of pre-industrial purity. Sir Patrick Vallance wants us to know that he has cut down on flying and started eating less meat in order to tackle climate change. I am sure it will be a terrible hardship for him to take his next holiday by Eurostar and have the occasional seitan and black bean stir fry, but what if you are already struggling to feed your family? I don’t think it will go down too well being told you must curtail your lifestyle for the good of the climate. COP26 is a rich world event. It doesn’t even try to tackle the issues which developing countries would choose to prioritise, and which used to form the body of global summits: clean water, hunger, debt, HIV, malaria, access to western markets. All the world’s problems have been boiled into one: trying to stop the world’s climate from changing. Developing countries will still turn out and discuss other issues but they will have to do so through the lens of climate change. Nigeria wants to talk about locusts, which it now blames on climate change. Nigeria wants developed countries to hand over £100 billion to Africa for ‘climate action’. We can’t carry on as we have been doing, ministers are apt to tell us regarding climate change. Except that at Glasgow they will be doing just that: feasting while they plot to curtail the lifestyles of the rest of us.

Kathleen Stock, professor of philosophy at Sussex University, resigned from her university position this week after a campaign of intimidation by trans rights activists. She had expressed the view that it is not possible to change your biological sex and that people who identify as women should not have the automatic right to enter women-only spaces. In short, she doesn’t think that gender is all in the mind and has said that when it comes to “law and policy”, biological gender trumps “gender identity” (the view that if you think you’re a woman, you are).Until about a decade ago, most people would consider this a simple statement of fact actually, most still would. But it’s not enough nowadays to save you from the trans activists and their supporters in the universities.  Early last month, Tickell said that he would be prepared to take disciplinary action against university members who took part in the online campaign against Stock. “If they’re students, and we can identify them, we will certainly take investigations and disciplinary action, as appropriate under our regulations.” He also suggested that he might discipline academics who supported the campaign. All fine and good. But why so late? Why didn’t the authorities say as much when the campaign to dismiss her first started? Unless universities are prepared to discipline groups who bully iniduals and causes they take issue with – pro-life groups for example – we’re going so see an awful lot more of this.Universities are always going to be places where young, self-righteous and opinionated people shore up each others’ views in the 1970s, it was Marxism that dominated intellectual debate, but at least Marxism had ideological rigour.  Back then, opposition and controversy was visible now it’s not. Most of the hostility towards Stock was expressed online. Without Twitter, this probably wouldn’t have happened. And how do universities deal with groups who operate under the cover of anonymity on Twitter? They could investigate online accounts themselves, or report egregious offenders to the police, Online harassment is the new and sinister aspect of contemporary intolerance at universities.Ivor Gaber, professor of political journalism at Sussex University, who has taught at Sussex since 2014 and has expressed support for Stock, says: “I haven’t seen any of the leafleting on campus. Apart from the demonstration last weekend, there has been no sign of it on campus at all. It has all taken place virtually. In my day when there was student agitation you couldn’t move for leafleters and pamphleteers.”In the case of Stock, the student campaign against her came to a head three weeks ago when it took the form of posters and graffiti (“Stock Out”) calling for her dismissal by and large it was anonymous. But it wasn’t just young LGBTQ students opposing her. Hundreds of academics signed a protest letter when she was awarded an OBE in the New Year’s honours list they condemned academics who use their status to further gender oppression” and said they opposed “transphobia in all its forms”.Stock has previously observed that she is “at odds” with large numbers of academics, including some of her own colleagues. She blames in particular her own former union, the University and College Union, which called for a university-wide investigation of “institutional transphobia”, with her particularly in mind it was they, she said, who “effectively ended” her academic career. But then, academics are often happiest swimming with the ideological tide.Her friends agree that at the start of the bid to get her sacked, the university didn’t do enough to protect her. Simon Fanshawe, a former colleague of Stock and the author of The Power of Difference, to be published in December, says: “What the university’s administration has done is created an atmosphere at Sussex, which saddens me beyond belief, where the legitimate exchange of ideas seems to have been sacrificed to some curious notion of student protest.”Fanshawe, who was chair of Sussex University’s governing body between 2007 and 2013, adds: “I don’t think it is just around this debate. I think this is something happening in political and social debate at the moment.”The campaign against Stock was largely anonymous – as ever, on social media – but an LGBTQ group at the university has claimed victory after her resignation its online statement should give us pause. “This is a monumental victory for trans and non-binary students…And it f-----g worked. Direct action gets the goods, and trans and non-binary students are safer and happier for it.” If “direct action” in the way of intimidation and abuse works, what next? Or rather, who is next?The Stock case has implications beyond the whole issue of trans rights, and the current culture war between feminists and trans activists. It is about the academic freedom to express reasonable opinions with which others may disagree. Without that freedom, academics would operate under totalitarian conditions, whereby dissent is not allowable on given topics – at least, not if you want to keep your position.Gaber says he publicly supported Stock because “I thought I had to stand up. I’ve got no regrets about doing so. I would have tweeted the same had she been making the opposite case. I think it’s really important because over the past few years I think academics have become less assertive of their rights and claim to academic freedom because they are worried about what might happen.”Matthew Goodwin, professor of politics and international relations at Kent University, believes the case is “a watershed moment in the country’s debate over academic and intellectual freedom and I think it is a watershed moment in the global debate about the threat to intellectual freedom in the west. Kathleen Stock’s case underlines the critical point that it is simply no longer credible to argue we don’t have a serious problem with attacks on freedom of speech in our universities.“Her case has pushed that argument out to the open, and everyone can see what happens to non-conformists in UK universities when they violate these new sacred values.”Goodwin’s position is established but what about smaller fry who agree with him? Chantelle Burton, studying for a Masters in Conflict, Security and Development at Sussex, says that she’s been troubled by the treatment of Stock: “The ongoing de-platforming of women is a growing concern. It sends out a clear message to students like me that we must toe the line and not deviate from mainstream perspectives or face an onslaught of abuse. It is also a concern that there are staff at the university who have supported the ‘Stock out’ campaign.” Burton says the events have had “a chilling effect” for her on choosing the topic for her own dissertation. “I originally wanted to explore feminist perspectives on the safety of women and which factors lead to insecurity for women in the UK. Recent events at Sussex have highlighted just how dangerous it is to do this.”The culture of “calling out” non-approved opinions – and there is no more pernicious phrase in the contemporary lexicon – has been going on a long time, with the tacit approval, or connivance of universities. Remember when Jordan Peterson, the Canadian academic, had his invitation to spend a term at Cambridge’s Divinity School withdrawn because he was photographed with a supporter wearing an anti-Muslim T-shirt? That was done by a university faculty.Cancel culture is a new inquisition, except that the actual Inquisition had a proper legal process. Now, academics can be driven from their jobs because someone, some identity group somewhere, has asserted they’ve been disrespected.Right now, the Government is attempting to address the issue. The Higher Education (freedom of speech bill) is currently making its way through Parliament, which would effectively legislate for freedom of speech at universities. But universities shouldn’t be obliged by law to protect dissenters like Kathleen Stock. It’s pretty shameful that it’s come to this.More from NewsPrince Andrew\u0026#39s accuser to use \u0026#39shocking\u0026#39 Newsnight interview against himBBC to analyse all of its programmes for signs of potential biasLockdown fanatics should be ashamed of themselvesRevealed: how the Queen turned to male role model to mentor Prince CharlesCop26: rather than crippling our industries to no purpose, let’s make the world’s polluters payCop26 protests ‘may look messy’, warns police chiefMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"juvenile macron making france look ridiculous","story":"France has always been one of my favourite countries. The food, culture, language, countryside and weather are all world-class. Lunch at Terminus, right by Gare du Nord, is an annual treat, put on hold by Covid, to which I long to return. But, blimey, the French can be childish. And I mean playground “I’m not your friend any more” childish. What on earth are they playing at? Acting like Indian Ocean pirates, French police have impounded a British fishing boat, taken it to Le Havre and questioned the captain for five hours. There’s even going to be a court case. “We need to speak the language of force,” explains one French minister – it’s the only one “the English” understand. Rather blindsided by this, Downing Street says it’s “amazed and concerned”, which sounds completely reasonable. France and Britain have had many disagreements over the last few hundred years. But they’ve all been sincere. Now it’s just arbitrary and silly. Have the French forgotten that the UK-EU Brexit agreement has an established dispute mechanism for situations like this? France has simply and unilaterally bypassed that, ratcheting up tensions that were already at fever pitch, on the grounds that Jersey hasn’t given French fishing enough licences. Perhaps they’re acting in such a witless way because they fear their claims might be dismissed by the independent arbitrator. It seems likely.The underlying reason for this Gallic posturing, of course, is Mr Macron’s precarious position in the polls, with the election just a few months away. The thought of going down in history as a one-term president terrifies him, especially if it means being replaced by a populist like Eric Zemmour. The big electoral issue is identity and France’s place in the world. Even Michel Barnier, a candidate with zero hope of success, is tacking to the right on immigration, with barely a thought given to the hypocrisy involved. Macron hopes that by supporting French fishing boats with a bit of Elysée muscle, he’ll persuade enough French “somewheres”, as David Goodhart puts it, that he’s actually on their side.But it risks backfiring. The French won’t warm to someone lashing out hysterically and irrationally. Yes, a bit of Brit-bashing can go down well, but not if it involves hostile stunts and bullying threats. Gregory Guid, the French-born home affairs minister of Jersey, won’t be alone when he says “I am ashamed of being French right now.”It started with Brexit, as we know. Most EU countries were merely sad that Britain left. Macron was desperate for Britain to suffer. That’s why he was so appalled by the AUKUS deal, because it showed that Britain continues to have clout on the global stage. So, he launched into a toddler tantrum of world-class proportions, and it took a conciliatory phone call from Joe Biden to stop him wailing. And then there’s Northern Ireland, where Macron is like the EU’s rogue general, and an embarrassment to the rest of the continent.Is there a psychological explanation for all this? American author and journalist, Michael Johnson, who’s lived in France for years, told me recently that the French have long felt threatened by what they call “the English language corridor, where things go whoosh from the UK to the US to Australia and New Zealand and back. But the very touchy French admit that they cannot accomplish anything without the rest of Europe getting in line.” That sounds about right.Well, perhaps that’s why France continues to throw its weight around, threatening more border checks on British goods, blocking fishing boats and raising energy tariffs to the Channel Islands. Oh, dearie me. Well, here’s a bit of basic economics for them: France sells far more goods to Britain than we sell to them. Britain represents France\u0027s largest trade surplus. So, if trade is hit, Macron’s histrionics will have seriously damaged French business. Good luck fighting an election on that. More from NewsPrince Andrew\u0026#39s accuser to use \u0026#39shocking\u0026#39 Newsnight interview against himBBC to analyse all of its programmes for signs of potential biasThe hounding of Kathleen Stock and what it means for our freedom of speechLockdown fanatics should be ashamed of themselvesRevealed: how the Queen turned to male role model to mentor Prince CharlesCop26: rather than crippling our industries to no purpose, let’s make the world’s polluters payMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"vulnerable can get covid vaccine boosters earlier six month","story":"Rules insisting upon a six-month wait for Covid vaccination boosters will be relaxed in some circumstances, with medics told the vaccine can be offered up to a month earlier.Care home residents and vulnerable people booked for flu jabs are among those who could receive vaccines sooner, following new guidance drawn up by public health officials.Doctors are being told that flexibility can be shown for “operational reasons” as long as five months has passed since the second jab.The change could enable care home residents to receive booster jabs en masse, making it quicker for vaccination teams to protect all residents.The new guidance from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) also says that those being called for flu jabs could also be offered an early booster at the same time.However, health officials said the most vulnerable were likely to be prioritised for early access to boosters.They said most over 50s should not expect to be called for their jabs earlier than the current six-month timeframe, recommended by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation.The latest advice is published in the UKHSA’s “green book”, which advises all clinicians of the latest advice on vaccines.People who are about to receive immunosuppressive treatment could receive boosters after a gap of four months, to avoid being vaccinated when their immune system is weak, under the guidance. Such patients would get a further booster, six months later, the guidance states.It comes after the deputy chairman of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunsation said that reducing the interval for all over 50s was something that “we will need to consider in due course.”The new advice does not come from the JCVI, but the steps from health officials mean vaccination teams can have more flexibility in administering the programme.Officials said this would speed up the administration of life-saving booster jabs, making it more efficient and much quicker to reach the most vulnerable, helping to ensure they were protected over the winter months.The change reflected the “practical approach to vaccination that has made the programme successful so far”.Sajid Javid, the Health and Social Care Secretary, said on Friday: “We are making great progress with the booster rollout and I want to thank everyone working so hard to get jabs in arms.“This updated guidance will ensure healthcare professionals have the necessary flexibility in the booster programme, allowing more vulnerable people to be vaccinated where it makes operational sense to do so – including our loved ones in care homes.”Latest figures show that more than seven million booster jabs have been administered, including two million in the last week.More than half of over 50s eligible for a booster in England have now taken up the offer.Maggie Throup, the vaccines minister, said: “Covid-19 booster vaccinations are extremely important in keeping people and their loved ones safe this winter, and this updated guidance will ensure the programme can adapt to best protect certain groups.“I encourage everyone eligible for their jab to book theirs as soon as possible and secure this protection.”More from NewsPrince Andrew\u0026#39s accuser to use \u0026#39shocking\u0026#39 Newsnight interview against himBBC to analyse all of its programmes for signs of potential biasThe hounding of Kathleen Stock and what it means for our freedom of speechLockdown fanatics should be ashamed of themselvesRevealed: how the Queen turned to male role model to mentor Prince CharlesCop26: rather than crippling our industries to no purpose, let’s make the world’s polluters payMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"watch boris ambitious liz truss manoeuvres already","story":"Word reaches me that the Foreign Secretary, Liz Truss, held a dinner for five Tory MPs at 5 Hertford Street, the £1,800 a year Mayfair club, on Tuesday night.

But I can reveal there was more to her choice than she may have let on, namely the decision by Labour mayor Sadiq Khan to expand London’s Ultra Low Emission Zone (ULEZ).The extension of the zone to the edge of the north and south circulars means it now covers Stratton’s north London home, which would have left her facing the extortionate £12.50 daily charge for motorists with polluting vehicles.A friend of Stratton told me that while there were a “number of factors” in her choice – including emissions, her son’s love of electric cars and a ruptured Achilles’ tendon she suffered earlier this year – the ULEZ was indeed one of them.MEPs and Brussels officials have been scratching their heads about how to get to Glasgow in the greenest way possible.

Gove noted there was “something of the confessional” about keeping a private record, a hint that all may not be as it seems. Could he be following the advice of Sasha Swire, who kept the existence of her diary secret for 20 years?He certainly has the credentials to be a fine diarist.

Hospital admission numbers are still below levels seen last autumn, although they are rising gradually.According to Professor Neil Ferguson, a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) from Imperial College London, there are “a number of reasons” why the UK currently has higher infection levels than many other European countries.Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, the professor suggested that the UK has “lower functional immunity in our population than most other western European countries” for a number of reasons.According to Professor Ferguson these reasons include the vaccine rollout starting earlier in the UK than elsewhere and the fact that “we relied more on the AstraZeneca vaccine”.There are other suggestions that less mask wearing, more relaxed rules around mixing and a slowing vaccine rollout could also be behind the surge in figures. But why exactly are cases of Covid rising in the UK?Waning immunity?The UK was one of the fastest countries in the world to rollout the Covid-19 vaccine, meaning that immunity of some of those who were first vaccinated may be lower now.A study of Covid test results of vaccinated people who logged their symptoms in an app, suggested that after about five or six months, the protection against catching the virus wanes significantly.Join our new commenting forumJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their repliesView  comments"},{"url":null,"title":"covid stop spread tips winter","story":" simple ways to stop the spread of Covid - including new -minute ruleThe future looks a lot brighter than it did this time last year thanks to the vaccination rollout, but Covid is still here so we must do our bit to prevent its transmissionAdvertorialByDave MastersDigital Commercial Editor:,  Oct Updated:,  Oct Cold and flu season always puts pressure on the NHS, and although the Covid vaccines are the best line of defence against the virus, you can still catch it evenyou’re fully vaccinated. You can spread it to others too, and what might be no worse than a cold for you could spell danger to more vulnerable people. Cases are already high after theto school and university, and as peopleto the workplace and socialise indoors, they could rise further. But there are some simple steps you can take to stay safe... Let fresh air in  You’re much more likely to catch Covid- indoors, especially in a confined space with no ventilation. The risk isn’t just about being near other people – mixing indoors can lead to a build-up of the virus in the atmosphere. Meeting outdoors is safer, but that’s not always possible when it’s cold and raining. So whether you’re at home or at work, let fresh air in wherever you can. Leave vents open and windows ajar. If you’re having visitors round, open the windows for ten minutes before, during and after. Don’t worry about losing heat from the houseyou give it a good blast of fresh air – it will soon build up again. Wear a face covering One in three people with Covid- has no symptoms – and you can still get ityou’re fully vaccinated, so it makes sense to wear a face covering indoors whenever you can. Although the rules no longer require you to do so in some indoor settings, you’re protecting others when you wear it. Make sure it covers both your mouth and nose becauseyou do have Covid-, you can release contagious droplets every time you breathe out. So next time you hop on the bus or pop to the shop, think about wearing a face covering to protect those around you – and hopefully they’ll be doing the same. Get testedTaking regular rapid lateral flow tests gives you peace of mind – they’re free, easy to do and give results within  minutes. Go to nhs.uk get-tested or call  to order a pack.

Labouraposs Deputy Leader said she had reflected on her language during a recent period of bereavement leave after losing a close loved one.Ms Rayner said she unreservedly apologised for her remarks and she would be more careful about the language she uses in future. In the wake of the murder of Tory MP Sir David Amess, which police are treating as a terrorist incident, Ms Rayner said she had thought hard about the threats and abuse that feature in political le. In a statement shared with the Mirror, she said: I was angry about where our country is headed and policies that have made le harder for so many people I represent. But I would like to unreservedly apologise for the language I used, and I would not use it again. I will continue to speak my mind, stand up for Labour values and hold the government to account. But in the future I will be more careful about how I do that and in the language that I choose. Angela Rayneraposs full statement is at the bottom of this article  All of us in positions of leadership have a responsibility for our language and rhetoric, whether towards political opponents or anyone  in society, especially those already most vulnerable. As Deputy Leader of the Labour Party I take this responsibility with the utmost seriousness and I am sure that politicians from all parties, the media and others with a prominent role in our public le will also reflect on this shared responsibility. The row centred on comments Ms Rayner made to Labour members from the North West of England at last monthaposs conference in Brighton.In an informal speech, she joked about the quality of food at conference and slapped down a heckler who apparently urged her to challenge Keir Starmer, saying: Youaposve had all the wine that I havenapost had mate!She told members weaposre at a cross roads like in , saying: We face a global threat again. Many of our comrades havenapost made it. Everyone in this room will know somebody whoaposs been seriously ill or died from Covid. Weaposve been through so much and deserve so much better than what weaposve got. She added: I’m sick of shouting from the sidelines and I bet youse lot are as well. We cannot get any worse than a bunch of scum, homophobic, racist, misogynistic, absolute vile [inaudible] Banana Republic, vile, nasty, Etonian [inaudible] piece of scum.” Ms Rayner originally stood by her remarks despite furious demands from Tory MPs for an apology. Keir Starmer distanced himself from the remarks, saying he would not have used them.  Askedshe was talking about Tories in general, Ms Rayner said last month: No, let me be clear, I am talking about members of the Cabinet. She told Sky News last month: I am not saying that anyone who voted for the Conservatives are racist, scummy and homophobic… I’m saying the Prime Minister has said those things and acted in that way. If the Prime Minister wants to apologise and remove himself from those comments he’s made that are homophobic, racist and misogynistic then I will apologise for calling him scummy. Boris Johnson has faced criticism over his past comments, including when he dubbed gay men tank-topped bum boys and described black people as piccaninnies with watermelon smiles. In a  Spectator column, Mr Johnson described children of single mothers as ill-raised, ignorant, aggressive and illegitimate”. In her statement today, Ms Rayner also spoke out over the terrying threats she has received in the wake of the row over her comments.They have had a devastating impact on me, my children and others close to me, she said.It shakes you when you get these threats. You worry about the safety of your home, your office and everything in your le. And it takes its toll on the people who work for me too. She said her staff should not be required to deal with death threats on a day-to-day basis. Two men have been arrested since yesterday in South Yorkshire and Halax as part of a police investigation into “threatening and abusive phone calls, emails and letters” to Ms Rayner. It is understood further enquiries are still ongoing across multiple police forces. A third man, Benjamin Ilfe, , of Chatteris, Cambridgeshire, today pleaded guilty to sending a threatening email to Ms Rayner, and also pleaded guilty to possessing a quantity of cannabis on Wednesday when he was arrested. The former delivery driver warned Ms Rayner to watch your back and your kids and said I already found your personal home address in the threatening email on October , Huntingdon Magistratesapos Court heard. Ilfe was sentenced to  weeks in prison suspended for  months. A probation officer told the court Ilfe had felt Ms Rayner was partially responsible for the attack on Sir David following her use of language. He was later apologetic and remorseful for sending the threatening e-mail, the court heard.  Angela Rayneraposs statement in full I have been off work over the last couple of weeks after losing a close loved one. Grief is the burden we bear for love and losing someone close is something that we all experience at some point in our lives, but that knowledge doesn’t make it any easier when it happens to you. So I can’t imagine what the family of Sir David Amess are going through, but I know they will be hurting. I send my heartfelt condolences to them. Sir David was a fine parliamentarian, a proud advocate for his constituents and above all such a kind, generous and warm-hearted man. He will be missed on all sides of the House. As a society we need to offer better support to people who are going through bereavement, loss and other traumatic or dficult experiences in their personal lives. I hope that the fact that I took time to deal with a bereavement will encourage other people to do the same when they are going through grief or trauma. While I have been away from the cut and thrust of Parliament I have reflected on our political debate and the threats and abuse that now seem to feature all too often. I have also reflected on what I said at an event at Labour Party conference. I was angry about where our country is headed and policies that have made le harder for so many people I represent. But I would like to unreservedly apologise for the language I used, and I would not use it again. I will continue to speak my mind, stand up for Labour values and hold the government to account. But in the future I will be more careful about how I do that and in the language that I choose. All of us in positions of leadership have a responsibility for our language and rhetoric, whether towards political opponents or anyone  in society, especially those already most vulnerable. As Deputy Leader of the Labour Party I take this responsibility with the utmost seriousness and I am sure that politicians from all parties, the media and others with a prominent role in our public le will also reflect on this shared responsibility. I want to address the threats I have received recently. In the past I have been reluctant to speak out about the abuse that I receive because I fear that doing so will only make the situation worse. However, in recent weeks the threats that I have received against my le and the lives of close family have been so terrying and explicit that I could not stay silent and simply continue to take it as ‘part of the job’. They have had a devastating impact on me, my children and others close to me. It shakes you when you get these threats. You worry about the safety of your home, your office and everything in your le. And it takes its toll on the people who work for me too. My staff come to work and do their jobs with dedication and professionalism. They bear the brunt of much of this abuse and then get on with their working day. Dealing with death threats and liaising with the police about their safety should not be a standard part of the day-to-day working le of a Member of Parliament or their staff. So I want to thank the police officers from Greater Manchester, South Yorkshire and Cambridgeshire Police who have arrested a number of people in recent days and demonstrated the utmost professionalism, courtesy and kindness both in carrying out their investigations and in supporting me, my family and my staff during what has been a very dficult time. I and my team will continue work with them to ensure that the perpetrators of these crimes are brought to justice After attending a funeral on Monday I will be back to work, rolling my sleeves up and standing up for my brilliant constituents in Ashton-under-Lyne, Droylsden and Failsworth – along with everyone who needs a Labour government.

Teachers are often the first to spot the need for children to be referred to social services to assess a child. But over the two lockdowns last year, school referrals fell by %, leaving thousands at risk of criminal exploitation, according to figures from the Department for Education. Kids in London appear to be most at risk with  children with the potential of being lured into gang crime and  children identied as being at risk as a result of sexual exploitation. In the East of England,  children were identied as being at risk as a result of involvement with gangs and  were identied as being at risk as a result of child sexual exploitation. And when assessed by a social worker, more than half of the children in need were experiencing abuse or neglect. . The most common additional factors identied in assessments during the year included concerns about a parent or carer being a victim of domestic violence. A child begins an episode of need when they are referred to children’s social care services.  Anne Longfield, Chair of the Commission on Young Lives and former Children’s Commissioner for England, responding to the figures, said: Even though schools were open for vulnerable children, many did not attend, and it is very concerning that many have dropped off the radar since. “We need to ask why we are still losing thousands of marginalised teenagers to the ruthless criminals who are so adept at spotting and exploiting vulnerable children and how we can find better solutions to stop it from happening. “The number of children being referred to social services because of fears of gang exploitation is extremely troubling and likely only the tip of the iceberg. During a period when the country was in lockdown twice, thousands of vulnerable children were still being sucked into gangs, serious violence and crime or sexually exploited. “I am particularly worried about the very sharp drop in referrals during the two school lockdowns.  “It is clear these problems are not going to solve themselves and we are still giving too many abusers and exploiters a free pass to use and harm children. “The systems that are supposed to be there to help vulnerable children are under pressure and badly need reforming. It is time to find new ways of bringing hope and success to young people who fall through the gaps and end up in danger. Earlier this year, the Childrenaposs Society said more than , children in England are thought to be involved in gangs. In the Autumn Budget, Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced a £m cash injection for youth services and the funding of ‘family hubs’ and £m to support , families who face complex issues that could lead to family breakdown. He claimed it was enough to fund up to  youth clubs across the country. Ms Longfield added: “I welcome the announcements of funding for children and families in the Budget. But this needs to be the start of something much bigger to enable all children and young people to be part of this new era, and so that the most vulnerable children are given the same chances to level up as any other child.” Comment MORE ON PoliticsEducationSchoolsSocial servicesCrimeTeenagers\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

There was no plan to tackle the growing cost of living crisis. No plan to reduce the tax burden on working people and small businesses. No plan to grow our economy in the years ahead or to create the high-wage high skilled jobs of the future. No plan to deal with the huge challenge of climate change for the years ahead. A Labour budget would have been very dferent, because Labour wants a brighter and better future for our country. We’d have invested in dealing with the challenge of climate change and fitting our country for the future - starting with proper insulation for millions of homes to reduce emissions and drive down soaring heating bills.Do you agree  Have your say in the comment section We’d have changed the way the government does business to ensure we buy, make, and sell more in Britain, supporting manufacturers and our amazing small businesses. Growing our economy is the best route to better services and a better future for everyone. It means more jobs and higher tax revenues to invest in our services. Instead, after a decade of weak growth, Wednesday’s budget saw taxation go up to the highest level for seventy years. Working people are paying an ever higher price for eleven years of Tory economic failure. We’d have invested in the future of our public services, especially for children, as we recover from the pandemic, with a properly funded education catch-up plan so every child has the chance to succeed. We only get one chance as a country to get these calls right, and the Tories are getting it wrong. We’d have cancelled the Prime Minister’s new yacht, and spent the money on policing hubs and more special constables.  And we’d have reformed our tax system, as Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves set out at conference. We’d make it fair, so those with the broadest shoulders make the bigger contribution. We’d bring it up to date, so high street family firms face a level playing field with tech giants like Amazon. We’d make it more efficient too, by removing unfair tax breaks, like the one that benefits private schools - and spend that money on giving every child a better start. What we needed was a Budget for our future, for growth, and for our public services. The Tories failed again to deliver what we need. Labour would be building a brighter and better future.

Instead, we got a Chancellor disconnected from the reality of a growing cost of living crisis. As energy bills soar, the Chancellor piled the biggest tax burden in peacetime on working people. As businesses on our high streets are held back by outdated business rates, the Chancellor gave bankers a tax cut. A decade of sluggish growth. Public services cut to the bone. Billions of pounds of taxpayer money wasted. But still, no plan to boost our economy. The Government will always blame others for its failures. But the reality is that working people are paying more for less for three simple reasons. Do you agree  Have your say in the comment section  Economic mismanagement. An unfair tax system. And wasteful spending. Our country deserves better. But they’ll never get it under a Chancellor who gives with one hand, but takes so much more with the other. People are getting wise to this.

Lib Dem MP Munira Wilson hit out at the admission after millions were left out of a rise in benefits in the Budget - despite fears inflation could hit % next year.The Chancellor announced a taper rate boost for .million benefit claimants who work - weeks after cutting UC by £ a week. But the IFS think tank warned millions of claimants who don’t or can’t work will not see an extra penny. They include .million Brits who are not required to work at all due to sickness, disability and caring responsibilities. The IFS said UC looks set to rise by around % next April - but that could be wiped out by % inflation at the same time. Ahead of the Budget, Ms Wilson asked “what research and preparation” the Department for Work and Pensions had done “on the impact ofrising energy prices,rising fuel bills,potential food shortages andthe removal of the £ uplt to universal credit on familiesapos ability to fund their childrensapos meals while at school”.  But DWP minister David Rutley replied: “We have not undertaken research of this kind.” He added the £ uplt was temporary and the government had invested in a plan for jobs, higher Healthy Start food vouchers, a £ million Household Support Fund and the Covid vaccine rollout. Ms Wilson said: “For the government to not commit any research on the impacts of their own damaging policies is complacent at best and heartless at worst. The Tories think they can impose dreadful policies and get away with it, they’re taking the good faith of people across the country for granted.

The Edward Colston statue that was torn down by protesters last summer and now lies in a museum next to factual information that puts the controversial figure in context, is in a far better place.In the majority of pubs, restaurants and cafes, signs hung in windows saying “staff needed”. A grim reality echoed at my hotel, which was happy to charge £. for a gin and tonic but took so long trying to get guests seated for their £ breakfasts, many gave up and left. It wasn’t the fault of the few, virtually all European, staff who were working extremely hard, but the chronic shortage of them. It meant dirty dishes sat on deserted tables as hungry faces frowned in y queues. Someone I spoke to later that day said it had been the same at his hotel so he went back to his room, stuck the kettle on and nibbled on a complimentary biscuit.Do you agree  Have your say in the comment section Four days later, at a restaurant in Liverpool, it was a similar picture. People walking out because they’d waited  minutes for the only waiter to take their drinks order while used plates piled up on the bar. The lie that our expanding ­hospitality sector would cope without EU workers is being brutally exposed. The myth that there was a huge reserve of unemployed Britons crying out to do their jobs, even more so. It didn’t need the Office of Budget Responsibility to tell us this week the UK economy will be twice as badly hit by Brexit than by Covid because we’re seeing the evidence with our own eyes.

The most simplistic hood about Brexit was that the solution to our economic woes was giving British jobs to British workers. The answer to our woefully poor productivity was always about creating well-paid jobs for all people who want to work, regardless of their birthplace. The one good thing that may come out of our self-inflicted economic ­sabotage is that it might make society realise that without the lowest-paid workers doing what are classed as menial jobs, we’re screwed. That the workers who do the dirty tasks for the worst pay are as vital to ­companies as all other employees.

Each month, Camila estimates she spends the equivalent of £ on grooming, food and medication for Miso, Yuumi, Tigger and Zed.

It comes after Catherine Colonna, France’s ambassador to the UK, was summoned to the Foreign Office in London to explain ‘disappointing and disproportionate’ threats of retaliation by Paris over what it claims is a lack of licences for French boats to fish in UK waters.The skipper of the Cornelis, who had not been publicly identied, is specically accused of having fished , kg of scallops in the French exclusive economic zone without holding a valid licence.Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter  He now faces a fine of €,as well as administrative sanctions, said le Havre deputy prosecutor Cyrille Fournier. Mr Fournier said: The captain of the Cornelis Gert Jan was given a summons by maritime police to appear at the hearing of the Criminal Court of Le Havre on August , . The prosecutor added: After verication, the captain of the vessel did not have the authorisation required to fish in the French exclusive economic zone.This was despite claims by the owners of the Cornelis that the boat had been fishing legally when it was detained on Wednesday night.Andrew Brown, director of Scottish firm MacDuff Shellfish, said she was being used as a apospawnapos by angry French ministers. Mr Brown said before news of the court action: MacDuffaposs fishing activity is entirely legal. We are looking to the UK government to defend the rights of the UK fishing fleet and ensure that the fishing rights provided under the Brexit fishing agreement are fully respected by the EU.On Friday morning, the Cornelis was still moored in Le Havre - still banned from leaving the port. The French ambassador has been summoned the Foreign Office in London later today to explain why the boat was detained. The crew of the Cornelis Gert Jan are still onboard as the legal battle rumbles on. It is moored up in a quiet area of the harbour with a sign saying “no unauthorised entry” on the gangplank. Boat owner Andrew Brown insisted they had all the right paperwork and the vessel should be allowed to leave as soon as possible. The boat had headed out from Shoreham, Sussex, early on Tuesday morning, and had expected to spend five days catching scallops in the English Channel.  Her seizure is the latest move by France in an ongoing row with the UK over who has rights to fishing grounds in the Channel now Britain has left the EU. The Cornelis’s haul has been thrown back overboard by the French, while her skipper spoke to an examining magistrate with the help of a French lawyer. Gendarmes on board the Athos – the police boat named after one of the Three Musketeers which detained the Cornelis– also fined a second, unidentied British boat on Wednesday. Her skipper was dealt with for initially refusing police permission to board, but then left toto the UK. Clement Beaune, Franceaposs Europe minister, has said we need to speak the language of force to Britain because it is the only thing this government understands. He was immediately accused of sabre rattling by British critics, as was Annick Girardin, the Maritime Minister in Paris, who said: It’s not war, but it is a fight. Referencing Brexit, Ms Girardin said: We are going to ask the European Commission to tell the United Kingdom that it is not respecting its agreement and therefore that retaliatory measures can be put in place. Before Brexit, French fishermen had free rights to fish in UK waters under EU law and only had to apply to their own government for a licence. But earlier this year the new Brexit Agreement came into force, meaning French fishermen now need to apply to the UK for a licence. All vessels that fished in UK waters aposfor at least four years between  and apos should be granted the same level of access until at least , when it will be up to the UK and France to negotiate new deals. The UK is asking French boats to provide tracking and fishing quota data for those years to qualy for a permit. The French have protested, saying smaller vessels under m do not collect this data and are being unfairly punished. The Brexit Agreement makes no mention of such data, they argue. British environment minister George Eustice told Parliament the seizure of the boat is being aposurgentlyapos looked into, but ruled out any apostit for tatapos retaliation. UK vessels with their licence to fish in EU waters should be allowed to do so uninterrupted, he said.

Two aeration fountains are set to be installed as part of the first phase of the lakeside improvements at the attraction which sees hundreds of thousands of people visit the each year.  The costs for the changes will be covered by recent fundraising efforts from the Make a Change for Ben group. It has donated all funds raised in his memory to date to the Botanic Gardens Community Association, a long-standing voluntary group overseeing maintenance and activities at the park. At the end of August, Sefton Council met with members of the two groups and outlined ideas for up to £, in improvements for the lake and lakeside area.

Thomas Hughes, , and Emma Tustin, , are accused of murdering Arthur Labinjo-Hughes at their home in Solihull, West Midlands.The schoolboy, six, suffered fatal brain damage from an alleged bang to the head and shaking injury on June , , reports Birmingham Live. Coventry Crown Court was told Hughes gave a series of police interviews in the aftermath of Arthuraposs death, and in one told cops: I effectively killed my son. It was not intentional.  Jurors have been hearing horric details of Arthuraposs le, and were told he lived through a campaign of cruelty before his death that matched the “medical definition of child torture”. On Friday, they were told how Arthur told Hughes he was the worldaposs worst dad and recalled the little boy saying he only loved his grandparents and his uncle Blake. Hughes told the court: He said I was the worldaposs worst dad. Said he hated me. Itaposs all words. But words play on people sometimes. He has never been as nasty to me as what he was towards Emma. At times I walked through the door and found Emma in the kitchen crying. Yes she did get snappy. She hated herself for biting back. A post-mortem revealed  bruises on Arthuraposs body, and doctors said he had so much salt in his system he was unable to put up a fight before his death.  Birmingham Crown Court was told he had over six spoons worth of salt in his body - the highest level a medic had ever seen. The little boy was also allegedly segregated and isolated for up to  hours a day - and was deprived of food, a bed and clothes. Hughes admitted in court he could account for most of the bruises on Arthuraposs body, Birmingham Live reports. He said he knew where all of the pressure points were and would pinch Arthuraposs neck for around  seconds with a force of six or seven out of . Hughes said: When he was lying on his back I didnapost want to keep picking him up. I put my foot on his stomach almost to take the wind out of him. It paints me in a dferent light altogether. Three or four out of . Just so I didnapost have to keep picking him up. It paints me as a monster Iaposm aware. Iaposm  years old, nearly , for nearly all of those years Iaposve never been in trouble with the police.  Nobody would have a bad word to say. But the last few weeks they would have lots of bad things to say. That last few months I effectively turned into a monster. Thataposs how Iaposm going to be seen now. Iaposm not going to be the dad whose boy worshipped the ground he walked on. Hughes added: I never intended to hurt him. Itaposs a case of discipline gone too far. Gone horribly wrong.The court was told this week that Arthuraposs grandmother called social services weeks before he died and said she would send them pictures of the bruises but they didnapost want to see them.Tustin and Hughes are accused of multiple counts of child cruelty, which include claims they fed him salt and forced Arthur to endure systematic, cruel behaviour of physical and psychological abuse in the weeks before he died. Prosecutor Jonas Hankin QC said: Both defendants participated in a campaign of cruelty intended to cause Arthur signicant harm and suffering. Violence and intimidation, both physical and verbal, were routine.  “Arthur’s visible injuries, his miserable physical condition and obvious despair provided each defendant with a daily reminder of the s to which the other would go to cause him harm.” Arthuraposs death came only three months after his father had moved into Tustinaposs home, whereas before he lived with Hughes and his extended family, in an annexe in the garden of Hughesapos parents. Arthur had been placed into his dadaposs care after his mother was jailed for  years for stabbing her boyfriend to death. Hughes, , of Stroud Road, Shirley, and Emma Tustin, , of Cranmore Road, Shirley, have both pleaded not guilty to murder. Tustin admitted one count of child cruelty, but has denied further charges of the same offence. Hughes also denies child cruelty offences.

They begin to show themselves when the first leaves fall - usually from the start of September to mid-October.The Mirror reported earlier this month that female spiders are known to stay in one place throughout their lives and establish themselves in our homes, but male of the species are always wandering.During mating season, they search for females, which are often found residing in our homes.  Ecologist Dr Chris Terrell-Nield of Nottingham Trent University says house spiders can be up to cm long and can be as big as a hand. They descend from species that come from the Mediterranean or North Africa, which is why they invade our warm homes.Chris told the Mirror: They have biting fangs. These things have been breeding and started their le span in the spring.He added: This time of the year, August and September, the male spiders have the urge to mate and start wandering and looking for females. When they find them they mate and she lays eggs and the male usually dies.

The Swedish teenage climate star joined protesters calling on big banks to stop funding fossil fuels.Greta,  and who is renown for holding world leaders to account over their failure to do more to tackle the climate crisis, joined the rally outside Standard Chartered. She appeared with a face mask as she stood side by side with other climate activists holding a banner saying aposDefund Climate Chaosapos.The demonstration, which is taking place in the City of London, is one of many being held across  dferent countries ahead of Cop on Sunday. What do you think of this  Let us know in the comments belowThe Day of Action has been tipped to be the largest climate finance protests in history with demonstrations happening in financial hubs across major cities, including New York, San Francisco and Nairobi.The Lloyds of London branch in Bank was the first location targeted by protesters on Friday morning as they where called on the global financial system to stop putting money into the use of fossil fuels. Campaigners also want the banks to cut their support for the building and maintenance of the Silvertown Tunnel under the Thames in east London. Activists chanted Ensure our future, not pollution as they made their way from Lloydaposs of London to Macquarie Capital.  The specic targeting of banks comes after campaigners revealed how they have reportedly paid £. trillion into fossil fuel extraction since the  Paris agreement. The UNaposs th annual conference on climate change will see leaders from all over the world come together to discuss solutions to the climate crisis. The main aim will be to find ways of ensuring temperatures donapost rise beyond the .C limit that countries signed up to at the Paris summit in . World leaders will also discuss strategies to cut carbon emissions to net zero by .  Protesters in central London on Friday morning included Greenwich teacher Kevin Wright, who spoke about the Silvertown Tunnel, saying: We cannot afford it environmentally or financially. There are no grounds that makes it good. It will draw large traffic into the most densely populated parts of the UK. All I see I self-interest in this tunnel, all I see is harm, but to some itaposs big money and toKhan it probably is his pension. A vigil is also set to take place at .pm at the Bank of England. Similar demonstrations against climate change are expected to happen in  cities, including Glasgow, Berlin, Brussels and Paris. Joseph Sikulu, from Pacic Climate Warriors, said: “Financial institutions that continue to invest in dirty fossil fuel projects are also investing in the destruction of our islands and our homes. “It’s time for the corporations who have caused this crisis to be held accountable. “The science is clear. We need to do everything we can to limit global warming to .C, the survival of our islands depends on that. To get there we need to defund the climate chaos.” The International Energy Agency says there can be no further exploration of oil and gas after this year.

It is thought , people die of smoking in England in , with it the largest cause of premature death in the country.The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Industry , is updating its guidance relating to medically licensed E-cigarettes as a tool for people who wish to stop smoking tobacco, paving the way to see them introduced as a legitimately licensed health-care solution.The update could make England the first country in the world to introduce a scheme that would see e-cigarettes used as a fully licensed method to help people quit smoking.  The government has claimed that in - up to % of people who attempted to quit smoking used e-cigarettes alongside Stop Smoking services.Health secretary Sajid Javid said: Opening the door to a licensed e-cigarette prescribed on the NHS has the potential to tackle the stark disparities in smoking rates across the country, helping people stop smoking wherever they live and whatever their background.How could you get an e-cigarette prescription  Getting your hands on an e-cigarette prescription will hinge on a few factors, and most of it wonapost depend on what you do yourself. As it stands, the biggest barrier is whether or not a manufacturer can convince the MHRA they can make a product safe and effective enough to be prescribed through the NHS. All medicines that the NHS uses go through the same regulator process and e-cigarettes are no dferent - what the change of guidance does is provide the opportunity for companies to work with them to produce a suitable product in the first place—before this wasnapost an option. If and when a product receives approval from the MHRA, it will then be down to doctors to decided on a case-by-case basis whether they believe that an e-cigarette is the most appropriate way to help the patient quit. Non-smokers are advised not to use start using e-cigarettes under the scheme people clinicians donapost regard as in need of quitting, i.e they donapost smoke, will not be able to get an e-cigarette through the NHS. Chief executive of the MHRA, Dr June Raine said: The updated guidance on licensing requirements we have published today is a strong first step towards availability of safe and effective licensed e-cigarette products.” A spokesperson for the NHS said: “The NHS will not be prescribing e-cigarettes unless Nice [the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence] recommends them for use.” E-cigarettes will not be prescribed by the NHS until Nice recommends them.

After her untimely death in , it is believed her personal jewellery was ided up between her sons Prince William and Prince Harry.And this means Kate now has the ultimate privilege of wearing some of Dianaaposs dazzling pieces from time to time. Here we look at some of the amazing jewellery both women have worn...

Bryan Sheridan, , went on trial charged with attacking the woman while she was asleep after a party. A court heard Sheridan had talked to her about having a threesome with a friend before they went home together on Boxing Day . She claimed she was woken by Sheridan having sex with her but he maintained she was awake the whole time and the sex was consensual. Sheridan told the court he sent the message because it was what she wanted to hear after she threatened to go to the police. He denied two counts of rape, assault by penetration and attempting to assault by penetration and went on trial at Worcester Crown Court. Sheridan, of Evesham, Worcestershire, was unanimously cleared of all charges by a jury after just under three hours of deliberation yesterday.  Giving evidence, Sheridan said everything sexual that took place between him and the alleged victim that night had been consensual. He said the woman was drunk but was able to walk and communicate when they discussed having a threesome. When asked how he knew that the woman was consenting, he told the court: Because she pulled me on top of her. Michael Anning, defending, asked him: How did she seem  Sheridan replied: Perfectly happy. Mr Anning asked: Who initiated   Sheridan replied: She did. Mr Anning asked: Was she awake  Sheridan replied: Yes. He said later in conversations - on the phone, and in messages - the woman said she thought he had done something to her and raped her while she was asleep. She later sent Sheridan a WhatsApp message which said: Would you admit it is rape to me  I canapost feel anything, I just feel numb. Sheridan replied: Ok, I raped you. Mr Anning asked Sheridan why he sent the WhatsApp message admitting the rape. He replied: She basically saidI didnapost say it she was going to ring the police and Iaposd be arrested. This was what she wanted to hear. Under cross-examination, prosecutor Caroline Goodwin QC asked him: Why did you need to admit something you hadnapost done  Sheridan replied: She said she wanted me to say it so she could move on. The prosecutor also read out a message sent by the woman to Sheridan in which she wrote: Trust me Bryan I would ruin your le, like you did mine. She denied being in a sexual mood that night as she told the court she was raped but the jury of eight men and four women rejected her claims and found Sheridan not guilty.Most ReadFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON WhatsAppCourt caseCrown courtCrimeRape\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The former actress appeared in a video to read aloud her kids book The Bench, filmed for Brightly Storytime.Meghan began by introducing herself by saying I am Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex. She then went on to read her popular story while showing viewers the illustrations.

They are still very much royals, Harry is still a prince by blood and Meghan a princess and duchess by marriage. Another made the point: It’s literally their name.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have joined the World Health Organization and Save the Children in an appeal to G leaders meeting this weekend.Theyaposve urged them to honour promises to get Covid- vaccines to low-income countries where just % of people have had a jab.In a two-page letter, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Save the Children International CEO Inger Ashing and other leading voices in global health called for the world’s wealthiest countries to accelerate long-promised donations of vaccines.They coalition has demanded that the hold pharmaceutical companies have over access to vaccines must be broken.  “Among countries represented at the G, there are a handful with millions of surplus vaccines that are destined to be wasted once they expire,” the letter said. “Every discarded dose of a Covid- vaccine, when there are the mechanisms to donate them, should outrage us all. Each dose represents a real person—a mother, father, daughter, or son—who could have been protected.”  They pointed out that seven billon doses of Covid vaccines have been administered globally but Covax, the initiative designed to help fair achieve global access to vaccines, had only received .% of the promised . billion doses. Global targets have been set to vaccinate % of the population of every country by the end of  and % by the mid-. Decisions made at the G leaders’ summit in Rome this weekend could make or break those targets.  “By delivering already-pledged doses, helping countries manufacture their own vaccines, and prioritizing vaccines for nations in need, the G can help ensure the world delivers on these promises,” said the letter that was also signed by the Vaccine Alliance, UNAIDS, Clinton Foundation, Global Citizen and the Rockefeller Foundation. “We can’t simply hope for the pandemic to end on its own. As the virus progresses through unvaccinated populations, we risk new and more deadly strains sweeping the planet.”In the Spring Prince Harry urged people to “look beyond ourselves with empathy and compassion” during a speech at Vax Live.Harry, appearing without the Duchess of Sussex who was then expecting their second child, praised the world’s frontline medical workers at the concert. “Tonight is a celebration of each of you here, the vaccinated frontline workers in the audience and the millions of frontline heroes around the world,” he said. “You spent the last year battling courageously and selflessly to protect us all.

Leona Christie claims her home in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, is infested with mould and needs work done in every room. She has accused the council of failing to keep their promises, which were made by the large number of inspectors who have attended in recent years. Workmen did turn up at one point in August , but she turned them away fearing Covid could be spread among her family members. Leona and her partner moved in to the flat in , and claim to have been chasing the council ever since. Issues include a hole in the wall of one daughteraposs bedroom and mould in her other girls’ room.  The house also has cracked bathroom tiles and a draft coming from under the bathtub. She also claims the front door poses a fire hazard because it has slumped in its frame, and her kitchen appliances are being held up by bricks. Leona said: It’s just rubbish. I look around every single day and think about the safety of my kids.  Moving into this flat was the worst decision of my le. It feels like nothing will ever be done.

Workmen did turn up in August  - but the mother did not feel it was safe to let them in due to the pandemic. She added: I’ve had about  inspectors come in the past two years. “They come, look around, say they will be in touch and nothing happens. The last was about a month ago. It’s just been hard for me. I’m so tired of it. I’m shipping my kids off to my dad’s this weekend so I can empty the rooms and take pictures to show how bad it is.  It’s just not a place to raise someone.” Councillor Paul Wood, executive member for housing at Sheffield City Council, said: “The Covid pandemic has caused a repairs backlog and we’re working through it as quickly as we can. We carry out , repairs and respond to  emergency repairs in our council homes every week. We have , outstanding repairs and  officers to carry out these repairs.

The story of the courageous group, who mayor Andy Burnham said the city of Manchester was “indebted” to, is more than worthy of inclusion on the shortlist of four for the awardsapos Emergency Services honour.The show, in partnership with TSB, will be broadcast on ITV on November  at pm. Ahead of the big day, Matt Roper hears how the officers bravely ran towards the danger as panic-stricken crowds fled. Four British Transport Police officers were patrolling Manchester’s Victoria railway station on a busy New Year’s Eve when they heard terrying screams from a nearby tram . Have your say on this story in the comment section  Mahdi Mohamud, , had launched a frenzied attack on commuters, shouting ‘Allahu Akbar’ as he attacked one couple from behind, stabbing the man repeatedly in the back, shoulders and head and slashing the woman across her face. As panic-stricken crowds fled, the officers bravely ran towards the danger, putting their lives on the line as they formed a barrier between him and members of the public.  Sgt Lee Valentine, , remembers: “It was a scream I’d never really heard before. Seeing what had happened, and seeing a bloke there brandishing a kne, dancing round, lunging towards people instinct took over.” PC Ashleigh Williams recalls: “When I saw that kne I knew that we needed to get the couple away from that male. Me and Marsha did that by creating almost a barrier between the two.”  Sgt Valentine was stabbed in the shoulder before the kneman was wrestled to the ground and arrested by himself, PC Williams, PC Marsha Selby and PC Tom Wright. Sgt Valentine says: “We all stood our ground he just charged towards me with the kne in his hand like a dagger. He jumped quite high in the air and landed on me with the kne.”  Mohamud later pleaded guilty to three counts of attempted murder and was sentenced to le and detailed at a secure mental hospital. Det Supt Will Chatteron, Head of Investigations for Counter Terrorism for the North West, said: “If the police officers hadn’t been able to respond so quickly then without doubt the injuries would have been a lot lot worse.”  And Manchester mayor Andy Burnham said the city was “indebted” to them: “On behalf of the people of Greater Manchester a huge thank you to those brave officers.The Daily Mirror Pride of Britain Awards, in partnership with TSB, will be shown on ITV on November , at pm.Comment MORE ON British Transport PolicePride of Britain AwardsTerrorismCrimeKne crime\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Our Pride of Britain newsletter brings you awards news and inspiring stories - dont miss out!Sign me upInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Described by Warwickshire Police and Crime Commissioner Philip Seccombe as the bravest of the brave, PC Dearaposs story is more than worthy of inclusion on the shortlist of four for the awardsapos Emergency Services honour. The show, in partnership with TSB, will be broadcast on ITV on November  at pm. Ahead of the big day, PC Dear tells Matt Roper of how, while he is very proud to be nominated for an award, he doesnapost see himself as brave or heroic. PC Dear was the first on the scene of a horric road crash in which a car had been ripped in half and the driver trapped underneath after being thrown through an open sun roof. Have your say on this story in the comment section  But despite fuel leaking from the wreckage which could have caught fire at any moment, the Warwickshire Police officer crawled underneath, then bore its weight on his back to enable the badly injured driver to breathe. He remembers: “We were met with a scene of devastation really, bits of car over both carriageways, an upturned car, the rear axle had been ripped from the car and traveled around  metres and demolished a garden wall. A high speed impact and probably somebody was seriously injured.”  PC Dear, , scrambled into a -inch gap under the roof of the flipped car to ensure an airway was maintained, while also taking some of the weight of the car on his back. And despite being in grave danger himself, he stayed talking to the driver, who was drting in and out of consciousness, refusing to leave the man until a paramedic arrived to stem the bleeding. The policeman said he was driven by “what his family would probably be thinking had he not made it, knowing somebody was there with him when he was injured, trapped – that means everything.”  His actions were even more remarkable given that he was himself suffering PTSD after being in a fatal car crash while off duty nine years earlier, and was seriously injured in another crash while working a sht in , suffering facial injuries and a broken leg. Philip Seccombe, Warwickshire Police and Crime Commissioner, described the policeman as “the bravest of the brave, stepping forward heroically to protect a member of the public without a second thought to his own safety.” Modest PC Dear says: “I’m very proud to be nominated for a Pride of Britain award, although I don’t consider myself brave or heroic. I did my duty.

The stone was bought at a car boot sale many years ago by the woman in her s who had dismissed it as being worthless. But she was convinced to get it valued by a neighbour where she was given the incredible news that the diamond was an “off the scale” in terms of its wealth.Mark Lane, of Featonby’s Auctioneers in North Shields, told the BBC that the woman came off the street into his shop saying “she just thought she would bring it in as she was passing”.He continued: It had been in a box along with her wedding band and a number of low-value costume jewellery items.  We saw quite a large stone, bigger than a pound coin, and I thought it was a CZ [cubic zirconia, a synthetic diamond lookalike]. It sat on my desk for two or three days until I used a diamond tester machine. We then sent it off to our partners in London before it was certied by experts in Antwerp, Belgium, who confirmed it is  carat. The diamond is larger than a £ coin and Mr Lane said it is the biggest that he has seen in five years running the business.  He said that the woman wanted to remain anonymous but she told him she enjoyed going to car boot sales and never for a minute thought it was a real diamond. He added: She told us sheaposd been having a clear out and that it nearly went in the bin before her neighbour suggested bringing her items to us to get valued. The colour, the clarity, the size... to find a -carat diamond is off the scale.

Organisers of Westminster Dog of the Year, the Kennel Club and Dogs Trust, said that French bulldog Vivienne was a fitting winner of this yearaposs competition. In second place was Stanley, a Border Terrier owned by Eddisbury MP Edward Timpson, and Henry, a Labrador owned by North Devon MP Selaine Saxby, came in third. Sir David, the Conservative MP for Southend West, was stabbed to death on October  when meeting constituents at Belfairs Methodist Church in Leigh-on-Sea, in Essex.  Following Sir David’s death, fellow MPs called on the public to cast their votes for his dog to win the esteemed title. The campaign led to a “staggering number” of votes pouring in for Vivienne, according to the Kennel Club. Mark Beazley, chief executive at The Kennel Club, said: “Today we pay tribute to Sir David and all he has done for dog welfare, and hope to honour his legacy to protect and improve the lives of the nation’s pets, who make such a dference to so many.“Crowning Vivienne as Westminster Dog of the Year and the public’s winner is testament to Sir David’s commitment and his passionate campaigning for animals.” The three-year-old dog wore a neckerchief which read “City of Southend”, a nod to Sir David’s long-standing campaign to make Southend a city. She was accompanied at the competition by friends and colleagues of Sir David, MPs Mark Francois and Andrew Rosindell. Andrew Rosindell said: “No one loved animals like David, and no one loved their dog like David. I could not feel more sadness at the fact that it will be me chaperoning Vivienne, his dog, at the Dog of the Year, instead of him, but I also could not feel more pride to be able to pay tribute to him in this small way.” Sir David and his dogs were regulars at Westminster Dog of the Year, with the MP having entered with his pets more than a dozen times.

Renowned for the support he gave to animal welfare issues, in previous years Sir David had used Westminster Dog of the Year as a  to raise awareness about the impact of fireworks on pets, lobbying for a ban on electric shock collars, and pet theft. When entering Vivienne in the competition, Sir David talked about his love of Vivienne: “If I am feeling down, the dog lts my spirits as she is always pleased to see me and she makes me smile.” Sir David added: Every time I walk into the room Vivienne throws herself at me, lies on her back with her legs in the air to be tickled. But before that she always brings a toy so she is of a generous, giving nature.” Sir David Amess was stabbed to death at his constituency surgery in Belfairs Methodist Church in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex, on October .

They seem to think they will be stronger by cutting people out, but they’re really just alienating their families. I think it’s very sad for them both and their children.

He is one of the countryaposs most well-known biographers, having released in-depth unauthorised le stories of famous figures like Richard Branson and Boris Johnson.Bower also isnapost a stranger to writing about royal figures as he released Rebel Prince: The Power, Passion and Defiance of Prince Charles in .

No stone will be left unturned.The announcement of his book about Meghan came just shortly after Harry revealed he would be releasing a tell-all memoir about his le next year.The memoir is set to be the definitive account of the experiences, adventures, losses, and le lessons that have helped shape him, according to publisher Penguin Random House.

Dionne Kidd, , had an interview for a bar role at The Stockton Hotel in Hartburn on Tuesday, which was cut short because of an alleged dress code violation. Dionneaposs mum Donna Williams, , has shared how the teen was left sobbing after the landlady made comments about her skirt. The comments - which Donna says were flagrantly inappropriate - came as the proprietor questioned the teen on her previous waitressing experience.But the Stockton hotel has hit back, claiming the teenaposs outfit was more suited to nightclubbing than waiting tables, Teeside Live reports.“It wasn’t appropriate for an interview - it was very, very short,” licensee Andrew Mark said. Although, he admitted: “Maybe we could have handled it a bit better.”  Mum Donna said the interviewers should have raised their issue earlier.If you didn’t like what she was wearing as you mentioned, as soon as she walked in, why not just end the interview there,” Donna, from Thorpe Thewles, said.Dionne found the job through employment site Indeed and received an interview confirmation at the hotel in Hartburn. Donna dropped her off at the pub, but not long after her daughter called her in tears. She continued sobbing throughout their car journey as she explained to her mum what had happened during the interview and the comments about her skirt. Dionne - who just came to the end of her art and fashion college course - wore a brown skirt with flowers on, black tights, Dr Martens boots, high neck black top with an oversized leather jacket.  But during the interview Dionne said she felt uncomfortable and wrapped her coat around her legs. When questioned about her previous experience, Dionne told licensee Jane Darby she had worked in a café. But when prompted for more information Donna said she was “panicking and forgot the name of the café”. “She was flustered and confused,” the mum said, as she explained the café was “portable”. However, after the interview concluded, Donna banged on the door and asked Jane what the problem was. The mum admits she lost her temper outside the pub while her daughter sobbed in the car. She added: “My daughteraposs confidence has been truly knocked. “If anything you could have advised her and helped hershe was not what you were looking for. “You shouldn’t be judged on what you’re wearing or how you look.Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Interview tipsEmployment rights\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Punters up and down the country have noticed a lack of salt over the past couple of weeks - but a spokesperson has said customers canapost bring their own to dinner.When askedpeople could bring some from home to the pub, a spokesperson told Cornwall Live : “There is a shortage in most pubs – not sure regarding Cornwall.“Wetherspoon is working with a supplier to resolve this. “No, people can’t bring their own into the pubs.” Diners have taken to social media this week complaining about the lack of sachets containing the popular condiment.The Tim Martin-founded chain reportedly blamed supplier disruption for the absent condiment, according to the Sun. One Twitter user ranted that no salt at a Spoons means the country has gone to the dogs and another bemoaned having to eat their fish and chips unseasoned.The punter, at a branch in Piccadilly, Manchester, added: I had to settle for vinegar instead.

Chloe James, from Fleet, was getting changed in a tanning salon cubicle when she saw a phone and a hand above her. The perpetrator, a -year-old man from Aldershot, was arrested but later released with a conditional caution. Chloe said it feels unfair he can carry on with le as normal while she continues to feel the effects. Chloe has waived her right to anonymity, wanting to tell her story to raise awareness and change peopleaposs attitudes towards voyeurism. The -year-old said she sometimes has flashbacks of the incident, the memory of which “sends shudders” through her.“Itaposs not a nice feeling at all,” she toldSurrey Live.I thought I would get over it, but it happened in August. It still upsets me, itaposs an invasion of my privacy completely. Iaposm never going to get that back.A conviction of voyeurism, as defined underSection of the Sexual Offences Act , carries a maximum prison sentence of two years.It was August  when Chloe arrived at Tantastic in North Lane, Aldershot, for her appointment. She recalled: I walked in and the guy was talking to the owner. He kind of looked at me and we exchanged an aposare you alrightapos kind of look you do to someone you donapost know. He saw me walk into the cubicle, and then walked into the one next to me. I was just waiting for the bed to heat up, just standing there. Luckily, I just looked up and then I saw a phone. I just panicked. For him to get his phone over he would have had to have stood on a stool or sunbed or something. Theyaposre high walls. Chloe wasnapost wearing anything at the time and described her initial feeling of disbelief. I doubted myself, aposdid I just see that apos I went out and told the owner and had a complete panic attack and started crying, she said. She said the owner brought the man out and demanded to see his phone, but he refused.Chloe managed to get hold of his name and contacted him on Facebook. Over the app, in a message seen bySurreyLive,he then admitted wrongdoing.Chloe went to police the same day with this evidence. On October , the man was arrested and questioned, but the outcome was not what Chloe had hoped for. After admitting the offence to police, the man was given a conditional caution, ordered to pay £ in compensation to Chloe and attend a Victim Awareness Course by January , . Chloe tried to appeal the conditional caution decision on October , but police said it was not eligible for the Right to Review Scheme. A senior investigative officer did carry out a review, however, but they found the decision to be legal and proportionate, and the outcome was likely to be similar toit had been dealt with at court, a Hampshire Constabulary spokesperson said. Chloe said: Itaposs the first time he has done it, but I donapost think this is just a random thing you just do. Heaposs probably done it before. I went to police becauseit happened to me, this could be the start of something worse. Chloe added: Itaposs unfair I am still having to deal with it, and heaposs got away with it. Sexual assault [and other sexual offences] is happening so much more often, nothing is getting done. There needs to be a change. A Hampshire Constabulary spokesperson said: As a force, we take all allegations of sexual offences very seriously, and we have specialist officers who provide a compassionate and professional response to victims. Investigations into these offences are among the most complex that our officers carry out and cautioning offenders is just one example of formal action open to the police. When considering how best to deal with someone for any offence, we consider many factors including the circumstances of the case, the victimaposs welfare and whether they support a prosecution through the courts, whether there has been an admission of guilt, the offenderaposs situation, and the ages of those involved. Our officers are professional decision makers and on a daily basis make decisions about how to achieve the best outcome, when to give a community resolution, a conditional caution or pursue a charge with the Crown Prosecution Service . We do take the victimaposs wishes into account. Officers are making decisions about whether it is fair and proportionate to give someone a criminal record for their first offence, when theyaposve accepted responsibility, offered to remedy the crime, is considered unlikely to reoffend, and can be given a sanction that deters further offending. Cautions for the most serious offences are only used in exceptional circumstances and after advice is sought from the CPS.

The parent, whoaposs currently expecting her fth child, said that despite its peculiar appearance her chocolate bake still tasted delicious and friends have even requested she makes one for Halloween. She explained: It doesnapost look like a hedgehog. It looks quite creepy. A couple of my friends have asked me to actually make one for Halloween this weekend.

It looks like the character from Hellraiser and a lot of people have been saying it looks like Two-Face from Batman, which made me laugh. The mum continued: A lot of people have said that it needs to go to rehab and that it looks like Wilson from Castaway. It definitely turned out worse than expected and itaposs a bit of a cake fail but it tasted nice. The full-time mum said sheaposs a good cook but when sheaposs tried to bake with her kids in the past nothing has ever gone to plan. Despite aposnot being very artisticapos Lisa wonapost be resorting to shop-bought cakes just yet as Harvey has already requested she rustle up a baby Yoda cake next year. Lisa added: My son was turning . Iaposm not a baker at all and he knows that and he said aposcan you make me a funny cake for my birthday apos So I said aposokapos and I just made him that.

During her wake, a bag containing black trousers and underwear was found instead of her body in the town of Turvo, in the Brazilian state of Santa Catarina. The clothes reportedly belonged to another deceased person in the morgue. Due to the mix-up, the girlaposs burial had to be postponed by a day, and took place on Tuesday, October .  The Instituto Virmond - Hospital Santa Tereza, in the city of Guarapuava, has pointed the finger of blame at the funeral home, which was not named in reports. The COO of the hospital, Michel Cunha, said: The body was prepared and duly identied. The funeral home was meant to take it to the wake. But the undertaker, on entering the morgue, came across a transparent bag with black clothes and no identication. And out of pure distraction, he convinced himself it was the baby and took it to the town asit were the baby. Meanwhile, the child remained in the morgue, wrapped in raffia and duly identied with tags. The parents only became aware of the mix-up after they removed the lid of the coffin during the wake to show their other daughter her sister.  Inside, they found the see-through plastic bag containing black trousers and underwear. Cunha said: We only found out about the funeral homeaposs mistake through social media and the news. We did a quick analysis and followed all the hospital protocols, but the funeral home committed a human error. The baby weighed  grams , far from what a pair of trousers and underwear would weigh.

I moved it two days ago and the whole back of it was absolutely covered in mould, all the toys on it were covered in mould.#I actually have all my clothes in a box because I’m scared to take more furniture for it to get ruined and to have to replace it when I don’t have a lot of money.#I’m on benefits and I only get £ a month, so the stuff I do have is getting ruined.#Despite contacting Aberdeen City Council when she first noticed the mould, Miss Robertson#s home has still been plagued by the issue.The council visited the property once to inspect the problems.She said: #The man told me to just wipe it and handed me a leaflet. He came back the next day and painted over it # then it came back worse.#Meanwhile, no one has visited the property to check the gutters which are causing water to enter the top-floor flat.Having spoken with her neighbours, Miss Robertson discovered they also have a mould problem, just not as bad as her home.#I think they knew the problem was there before they moved me into the house,# she said.#It’s really not good to stay in, especially not with a child so young because you want everything to stay so clean.#The ceiling in her son#s room has cracked under the weight of the damp. Meanwhile, the bathtub has been sealed to the wall by electrical tape and the shower curtain has fallen down.Miss Robertson found mould on her bed.#It#s bringing me down, and I know it#s not my fault but I am embarrassed by it.# She said.#My biggest worry is my health and my son’s health. I’ve had a really bad cough and been getting really out of breath since I moved in and I’m normally in really good health.#I’ve even had to take my son to the doctor because his breathing got quite bad.#The mum has kept in touch with the council and emails them every day to get their attention.She cleans and keeps her windows open for at least two hours every day. Miss Robertson has noticed her heating bill is expensive from trying to warm the flat up for her son.#This is my first home, which is what’s upset me as well. I thought everything was going so good for me then it all just came crashing down like that.#An Aberdeen City Council spokeswoman said: “Works have been arranged to check over the roof and gutters and subsequently carry out any repairs required as a matter of urgency.#We will also arrange to visit Miss Robertson todayto identy any works that may be required inside the property following the external repair.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/10/2.63392762-1zcrffcdm-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/10/2.63392762-1zcrffcdm-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/10/2.63392762-1zcrffcdm-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/10/2.63392762-1zcrffcdm-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"angus macneil i certainly would not bet on the scottish government managing to hold a referendum","story":"Events in politics may now mean for certain that a referendum on Scottish independence is blocked and the only avenue to ask the population the question on independence is at an election, says SNP MP for the Western Isles, Angus MacNeil.

We will see somewhere in the region of  world leaders in Glasgow next month for the COP climate change conference, and that will occupy the front pages for its duration.However, itrsquos clear that the scale of action needed in the face of catastrophic climate change requires strong collective leadership at every level. Where better to begin than education to relay the message of how urgently our behaviours need to change.With that in mind, Scotlandrsquos colleges are providing leadership on a strong collective front. Not only do they need to be the messengers, but they also need to pay attention to the message, with shts in their own working models and practices.Many colleges in Scotland have been working on this steadily. Following the Paris agreement at COP in , colleges have been making good progress in reducing carbon emissions. In fact, since reporting began in  . The sector has achieved an overall % reduction in emissions. This is better progress than the whole of the public sector, which has reduced by % over the same period.Clearly % is impressive but there is work to be done towards achieving the Scottish Government reporting expectations, and the sectorrsquos own statement of commitment, to achieve Net Zero climate emissions by  or earlier.Bringing together the current thinking and setting out a joint agenda, College Development Networkrsquos Climate Emergency Expert Group hosted the inaugural College Climate Change Conference, earlier this month.Held online with representatives of the college expert group and partners, it gave a strategic overview of the climate change actions that the college sector should be engaged in.It follows the development of the Scottish Colleges Statement on the Climate Emergency, which lists  key actions that colleges have committed to delivering.ldquoThe college sectorrsquos role in this is going to be huge, says Jim Metcalfe, Chief Executive of College Development Network . ldquoWe have a role to make sure that our own institutions, campuses, and staff and student travel is Net Zero. We have a role to provide the skills to ensure the economy can reform itself to be Net Zero ndash how we teach and train and develop people. And we have a role in how to influence change in our communities ndash we are crucial anchor institutions across the country that can influence the way our regional economies can change for the better.Skills development is something that is absolutely crucial in the contribution of colleges. The vocational courses that many offer, those that have an impact on our everyday lives will clearly need to change in line with green technologies as well as manufacturing and building practices.ldquoTo achieve Net Zero wersquoll need new green jobs, which in turn means wersquoll need to ensure we have people with the right skills to take up those jobs, says Dr Mike Cantlay OBE, Chair of the Scottish Funding Council.Providing an idea of scale, at the conference he pointed out that one change, the sht to electric vehicles, will require , people to be trained or retrained to support the new technology.ldquoThat means we have huge reskilling and upskilling tasks ahead of us. Through initiatives such as the National Transition Training Fund, colleges are already providing great opportunities for reskilling and upskilling ndash and these examples demonstrate the responsive-ness and agility of the college sector. But our success will rely on our ability to inspire future learners to consider these new career options, and I commend the work of colleges in this crucial task.Its clear that colleges are playing a crucial part in our rapidly changing landscape and as Angela Cox, Principal and CEO of Borders College, explained at the conference, colleges, perhaps more than ever are acting as catalysts of change.Also a lead Principal on the Climate Emergency within the College Principals Group, Angela Cox details some of the changes happening at Borders College.ldquoAll students at Borders college will complete a carbon literacy module at the start of their programme but this is only a small part of their development, she explains. ldquoHowever, that needs to be brought to le in their subject learning. A small but good example is a project with Bordersrsquo hairdressing students looking at the choice of dye products ndash synthetic versus organic and what happens when the waste product including peroxide is rinsed and flows into the water system.Angela Cox points to projects that are initiated by students, and through creating employer partnerships are also powerful catalysts for change. An example is a former Borders College plumbing student who invented a device to stop water leaks immediately while the fault was found. His company Kibosh now operates globally.She says, ldquoWe are also sharing our carbon literacy module with our schools and housing associations and supporting the delivery through a train the trainer approach. Over time this means that students progressing to the college already have the basics and our projects become more innovative and collaborative through our community partnerships.Angela Cox adds, ldquoColleges are in a unique and privileged position to take a leading role in achieving Net Zero. We have the power to influence the behaviours and values of our students, staff and communities. I am proud that Borders College is seizing the opportunity to help secure a sustainable future for the Scottish Borders and beyond.College staff and students have spent a considerable amount of time creating this new culture for colleges, where the consideration of climate impact isnrsquot a tick box but goes to the heart of everything they do.In November  Dundee and Angus College was invited to take part in the pilot of the College Learning for Sustainability Champions course, run by EAUC and Learning for Sustainability Scotland.Christine Calder, Academic Development Lead at the College explained at the conference how important it was for Dundee and Angus to be involved.ldquoOne lecturer from each of our  curricular departments attended the course. This gave us a real opportunity to know who a friend of sustainability was in each department.  lecturers, working with an average of  students. Thatrsquos  people directly affected. Thenwe add in the conversations that have happened in those studentsrsquo homes and with friends or the conversations that the lecturers had within their departments let alone their friends and families as well as students in other classes. Thatrsquos the ripple effect.Dr Katie Paget, Science Lecturer and Learning and Teaching Skills Mentor at Dundee and Angus College was one of the lecturers who was part of the pilot for the science team. She says, ldquoIn many ways the pandemic has brought the themes within the UNrsquos Sustainable Development Goalsinto the limelight, and this gives us a powerful opportunity.ldquoThis academic year we have embedded the SDGs into our Lecturer Professionalism Pathway. Within the course lecturers can reflect on, and share ways that they can embed such themes within their teaching and have the opportunity to try out ideas in a supportive environment.ldquoOur hope is that by weaving these into our curriculum with new lecturers during their early career, linking SDGs in their classrooms can become a foundation within their teaching, and not an extra.Its clear that the sector has put time and effort into creating a climate change strategy with clear goals and is working with a greater shared purpose than ever before.ldquoThe sector is now focused on operationalising those actions and achieving against that statement of commitment, on campuses and in teaching across the country as a sector, adds Jim Metcalfe, Chief Executive of CDN. ldquoIrsquom hopeful and aspirational about this agenda. ____________________________________________________________________Roadmap outlines path towards Net Zero futureWORKING towards the same ends takes collective knowledge and purpose. To that end a Climate Action Roadmap for colleges has been developed by the Climate Commission for UK Higher and Further Education, to support colleges at all stages of their progress towards Net Zero.The roadmap was developed closely with college leaders, students, and partners to ensure that it was relevant to every college, no matter what stage it hasreached on its sustainability journey.Itrsquos a tool that can be a useful gap analysis, to show where you are doing well, but identy where improvements are required. The roadmap alsofactors in cost and time commitments for each action, which helps in that planning.It covers all areas of the college, so you look at distinct areas in detail, such as leadership and governance, teaching and learning, estates and partnerships, and engagement.The Climate Action Roadmap illustrates clearly what an emerging college could look like. It helps colleges to tailor actions to match strategy. This is seen as an opportunity, in advance of COP to show how Scottish colleges are leading the way on climate change.From the date that every college commits to the roadmap, it has a full year to develop targets and show how those will be implemented.Workshops to develop the roadmap were carried out in June, attended by staff, and partners of Scotlandrsquos colleges. Billy Currie, Head of Corporate Services at Dumfries  Galloway College attended those workshops and says he could identy benefits for reviewing climate change plans immediately.Some colleges across the sector havebeen working in this area this since . Billy believes that one of the roadmaprsquos great strengths is its flexibility, where it can strengthen and consolidate the work that has already been done.At the College Climate Change Conference he explained, ldquoAt Dumfries  Galloway we carried out something of a progress review. We have used the Colleges get to work on key climate actions roadmap to reflect on our previous climate change action plan, to see where we could identy successes.ldquoWe could identy elements such as using renewable technologies in new builds, looking at our electric fleet vehicles, and identying partners for our student transport. We also have an established waste network with zerowaste goals for going to landfill.Billy Currie adds that an area that they could strengthen was governance. ldquoWe had already taken steps at Dumfries  Galloway in terms of setting our targets and annual reporting, both to the board and the cross-college Climate Action Group.ldquoBy using the roadmap we were able to declare a climate emergency, signed by the Principal, the Board Chair, and the Studentsrsquo Association President. ldquoThe declaration document commits the college to taking continued action on climate change matters. ldquoClimate change is now embedded into our systems and infrastructure strategies. We also have key performance indicators measuring what wersquore doing year on year ndash these are monitored by the Board, senior leadership and the climate action group.Billy Currie adds that working on awareness among staff and students, particularly in subject areas, is crucial to achieving the sustainable development goals.ldquoClimate change action is embedded at Dumfries  Galloway College, and we now have a revised plan, which is more focused because of the roadmap. As well as identying the key areas where we need to make changes, we can look at not only the college itself but how we fit in to the wider plan, regionally and nationally."},{"url":null,"title":"eyemouth-man-involved-two-domestic-bust-ups-borders","story":"A MAN involved in two domestic bust-ups within the space of a month has been ordered to carry out  hours of unpaid work at Jedburgh Sherf Court.Aleksandrs Kravcovs, , was abusive to the woman at a party in Eyemouth on Christmas Eve and then followed it up by assaulting her a month later.Describing the first incident Depute fiscal Alison Atkins said: \"The accused attended at the locus with a number of people on the evening of Christmas Eve.\"People were consuming alcohol and in good spirits.\"However as the evening progressed the accused became aggressive and wanted to go home and take his young daughter with him.:lsquoMajor incidentrsquo stood down but number of roads still lsquoaffectedrsquo by flooding\"A witness and his partner both said this was not a good idea due to his level of intoxication.\"This caused the accused to become even more aggressive and was shouting and swearing in an aggressive manner.\"He was prevented from entering the daughters bedroom and the police were contacted.\"In January the fish processing factory worker got involved in another argument with his partner which escalated and resulted in him slapping her face and seizing hold of her by her arms.Ms Atkins said: \"She was knocked to the ground.

Surely they could be stored at the council depot, especially when not getting used.The grass throughout was cut and the loose grass was left lying in thick clumps, asit was a playing field, instead of a cemetery.This cemetery, in years past, won an award but I fail to see the same happening again with things as they are of late.The grass around the stones, at the sides and back, is not being cut, resulting in long grass and often ferns growing there are bollards lying loose which will undoubtedly result in damage to a car there are cones at the main car park, restricting the amount of cars that can park there, and there are also cones at the portable cabins the road in the cemetery is a total disgrace!I in no way blame the men who work in the cemetery as they are doing as they have been told to do, and I know they are taken from the cemetery to work where, resulting in those men not having the time to complete the work which is necessary to keep the cemetery in the condition it should be.I understand about cutbacks and lack of funds but I am wondering where the money goes that people have paid for plots and or council tax, which increase and yet there are even more cutbacks.My biggest concern is where has the respect gone The following is in response to the debate about the state of the A over Rest And Be Thankful in the Scottish Parliament last Wednesday, October .I fear that the current Rest and Be Thankful is a catastrophe waiting to happen and I think that there needs to be an urgency from the Scottish Government to deliver a medium-term and long-term solution for the people and businesses of Argyll.The Cabinet Secretary discussed the necessity to collect data for the end long-term solution and, as much as I appreciate that, it should have been done years ago and I completely understand the frustrations felt by businesses and travellers alike.The Cabinet Secretary also invited all contributing MSPs to walk the forestry road with engineers and I am going to write to him to accept that invitation."},{"url":null,"title":"tale of two halves as pupils lose out in paisley","story":"Campbeltown Pupils suffered late heartbreak last Saturday as they suffered a reverse away result to Paisley outfit Glenvale.Leading - at half time, the Pupils played well beneath their top level in the second half and succumbed to a late goal at Ferguslie Sports Centre to lose -.Travelling with a strong squad of , the Pupils looked determined in the first half to take three points back to Kintyre.Moving the ball with precision and purpose the McFadyens-sponsored Pupils were well on top and made a great start within  minutes when Liam Renton’s corner found Ross Souden in the box and the young central defender forced the ball into the net.The Pupils’ front three of Rhys Casci, Scott Souden and Renton were in full flow, keeping the Glenvale defence facing their own goal and latching on to some well-aimed distribution from goalkeeper Alasdair Ferguson.The Pupils doubled their lead before half-time when holding midfielder Ellis Robertson broke free of his marker and guided a sublime curling effort into the Glenvale keeper’s top left-hand corner.What followed in the second half, however, was bitterly disappointing.After fending off some early pressure from their hosts, the Pupils retreated which only served to embolden Glenvale, and sure enough before the hour, their first goal arrived after an onrushing midfielder drove home a low shot from just inside the penalty box.The Pupils struggled for a foothold as the second half progressed, their fluidity furtherMidfielder Stuart Crossan also received a nasty kick to the ankle in attempting to block a Glenvale effort, and was replaced by young forward Conner McMurchy.With only a few minutes remaining, Glenvale scored a third when a through-ball was erted into the path of a Glenvale winger, who burst forward to score.On reflection, it was a confusing Jekyll-and-Hyde performance from the Kintyre Park side, with lessons to be learned in maintaining a level of performance for  minutes.Tomorrowthe Pupils will travel to Petershill Park, Glasgow, for perhaps the most high-profile competitive match in the club’s history to date, when they take on Premier Division Rossvale FC of Bishopbriggs in the WOSFL’s league cup.Those who would like to travel to the game to support the Pupils should check @PupilsAFC and @RossvaleJFC on Twitter for postcode details, or see Campbeltown Football on Facebook."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week october 15 2021","story":"One morning recently, I heard the following two news items on the radio:First was a report about the petrochemical plant at Grangemouth which emits tons of CO into the atmosphere.

Look out for the third and final piece in next week#s paper.Wartime needs created additional traffic and pressures for the two main operators, thereafter, once into peacetime, West Coast Motors and its rival were able to modernise their fleets.McConnachie#s stole a march by bringing Kintyre#s first double decker to the town in , buying two more in the late s which older residents may still remember. However, failing general economics resulted in West Coast acquiring this business in . These #deckers never ran for West Coast and it would be more than  years later before such buses entered their fleet.Liveries iniably provide a recognisable identity for any bus operator and West Coast is no exception. The flowering of the company#s one surely came to its climax in the s with the flowing combination of ivory, red and maroon, set off by polished body trim lines and wheel embellishers. Styles continue to evolve but, in the opinion of this writer, no other Scottish operator has chosen a more distinctive colour scheme than West Coast which still uses two of those principal colours, ivory and red, which it bestowed on its buses  years earlier.During the s and s, West Coast#s modern vehicles were typical examples of their time. In the latter period, new bus grants were obtainable under certain conditions resulting in some splendid coaches being purchased.In post war years, the company gradually built on its service network in Kintyre and Mid Argyll. In , it picked up the East Loch – West Loch Tarbert mail ship link from Tarbert-based Dickies then the Tarbert – Kilberry service from McEacherns in , the Lochgilphead Tayvallich service from McLachans in  and, perhaps somewhat prophetically, the Benderloch-based operations of McColls in .Without doubt, the most signicant developments in West Coast#s history occurred in the - period. During the s, William Craig had attempted to introduce a direct Campbeltown to Glasgow service but failed in this ambition then and at later attempts. Finally, in , these hopes were realised when the company became a joint operator, with Scottish Citylink, of the through service between the two locations.The s continued to see signicant developments. Firstly the acquisition, also in , of the buses and Mid Argyll routes operated by Lochgilphead-based Stag Garage. This was followed, a year later, by the purchase of the old MacBrayne garage in Ardrishaig, giving West Coast an excellent base in the area.The early s saw a further involvement in Oban when West Coast secured responsibility for the Oban to Glasgow service and by  it had acquired the former Alexanders depot in Oban enabling it to build further on its already signicant presence in Argyll.Since , the rate of change has quickened further. West Coast secured the Cowal and Bute area contracts and depots in  and when Bowmans, the long-established Mull services operator retired in , West Coast added this to its portfolio. Their Oban base allows vehicle and manpower deployments on Mullneeded. Of the major Argyll islands, only Islay remains independently served by the Mundell concern of Tarbert, whose lorries are also a familiar sight in the county."},{"url":null,"title":"arkell takes dunaverty golf clubs october medal","story":"Lee Mathieson, first man out, took full advantage of the conditions to record the lowest gross score of the day.He completed the first nine in  strokes which included three birdies and one bogey.Despite having a double bogey at the th and a bogey at the th, two birdies on the way back helped him to  strokes.Donald MacNeil was next best, concluding his round in  strokes, having had two bogies on the front and back nines.James Finlay, out in the sixth group, set a nett target of  for those following him to chase.Match secretary Alex Arkell responded in exemplary fashion by not only posting the third lowest gross score of  but also taking the lead from James with a winning nett .Result:  Alex Arkell -

with  minutes played, after a long-range effort arced beyond Ferguson into his top right-hand corner, after nicking off a Pupils defender.Then, on  minutes, the sixth and final Rossvale goal was scored after Ferguson#s save from a striker#s shot rebounded off the post and into the path of a grateful Rossvale winger, who slotted into the net from point-blank range.Overall, the Pupils can reflect on a respectable cup performance,not a giant-killing, against an established semi-professional outfit, especially with an injury-ravaged squad, as the Kintyre Park club adapts to its busiest fixture schedule in its years in amateur football, with  competitive matches already played by mid-October.Despite the heavy defeat for the Pupils on the field, one notable footnote to the game was the presence of former Tarbert AFC and Pupils player Reverend John McGregor, who is club chaplain for Rossvale, having performed the same role at Dumbarton FC in previous years.After the match, he met and chatted with the Pupils management and the current Pupils squad#s Tarbert contingent, Lewis McNaughton and Rhys Casci.Tomorrow, Saturday, the Pupils are back on league duty, travelling to Paisley to play St Peter#s FC.

out","story":"Campbeltown Pupils were left to rue the loss of another late goal last Saturday after an th-minute strike resigned the Kintyre Park side to a narrow defeat away to St Peter#s.Playing at Renfrew FC#s impressive New Western Park, the McFadyens-sponsored Pupils started the match brightly, despite another y injury list which saw several established first-team players ruled out and others unavailable due to work commitments.The Pupils took the lead before the -minute mark when John McCallum, playing at right wing in a --- formation, reacted quickest to Craig Lamont#s long throw-in, which bounced up on the dry synthetic surface, to guide a deft looping header beyond the reach of the St Peter#s keeper.The Kintyre side had efforts from left winger Scott Souden and lone striker Sean Grady go wide of the target – the latter#s promising effort deflected wide of goal – while McCallum was released by Grady and rounded the hosts# keeper only for his cutback to be cleared for a corner, away from the feet of the waiting Souden.At the other end, the Pupils had a new-look combination in defence, with full backs Craig Lamont and Michael McKinlay, and Ross Souden in central defence partnered by -year-old debutant Antonio Akoulli, studying in Scotland and hailing from Thessaloniki, Greece.The four had to be alert to the efforts of St Peter#s wingers Menzies and Lewis on either flank, and did so very well for the opening  minutes until a lapse in concentration saw Scott Lewis – signed from fellow WoSFL side Benburb FC for a transfer fee – ghost along the edge of the box and slot home a fine finish across keeper Alasdair Ferguson with his weaker left foot, into the young keeper’s bottom left-hand corner to make it -.Impressively, the Pupils rebounded from this setback and scored with  minutes played when Liam Renton, playing as an attacking midfielder, latched onto a ball from Scott Souden just inside the hosts# box, and turned his marker sharply before guiding a left-footed shot beyond the keeper#s grasp.All the while, the Pupils# deep-lying midfield pairing – a real contrast of experience levels between skipper Keith Mitchell, and Conner Brown beside him making his club debut – continued to break up play and keep the Feathers Inn-sponsored side moving forward.Despite this, there was a further scare in the visitors# penalty area when St Peter#s hit the bar from a powerful volleyed shot on the stroke of half time, but the Pupils# lead remained intact.Into the second half, though, the Pupils were pegged back in the opening few minutes of proceedings, a clever turn and precise shot beyond the grasp of Ferguson providing a fine equaliser.Admirably from a Pupils point of view, there was no onslaught from the ision#s third-placed team, also boasting a loan signing from Greenock FC, another semi-professional side, in their midfield ranks, and smatterings of semi-pro experience across their starting .However, what followed instead was a gradual build-up of pressure which the Pupils had to work increasingly hard to contain, the home side#s willing forwards continuing to probe for openings in the visitors# defence.The hard-working pair of Matthew Lang and Calum Houston were introduced in attack for the Pupils with  minutes remaining, with fresh legs required as the embattled visitors# energy levels began to wane.But even the dismissal of Lewis for the hosts, hitting out at Renton in reaction to a robust tackle from the latter, which earned the Pupils man a booking, couldn#t deny the Paisley side a late, late winner, a long ball going undefended in the Pupils ranks, and slotted home in the box by a St Peter#s midfielder to give them all three points, and in turn deny the Pupils a probably deserved draw.The Pupils# management team conveyed thanks to the travelling players for their efforts, even in defeat, and will surely take consolation from giving experience to young talent in the side, with four club debuts made in the space of week – after -year-old Andrew Renton#s appearance against Rossvale on cup duty – and within that clutch, a potentially very useful defensive addition.Tomorrow , the Pupils are at home to Glenvale FC, from Paisley, again on league duty, with kick off at pm.For more information, visit @PupilsAFC on Twitter or Campbeltown Football on Facebook."},{"url":null,"title":"leader october 29

budget, including:"},{"url":null,"title":"budget-today-budget-summary-impacts-scotland","story":"It marks the second budget of the year, with the first taking place just seven months ago in March.With devolution, only certain aspects of the budget announcement apply to people in Scotland.When announcements are England specic,Scotlands overall spending budget will increase thanks to something called the Barnett formula.For example, the UK have proposed to spend pound. billion on dealing with the NHS England backlog, so Scotland will get around .% of this figure because Scotlands population is roughly .% of Englands population.Heres a breakdown of how the budget will impact people in Scotland...Yes - minimum and living wages are not devolved so all changes made by the UK government apply to Scotland.It means that from April  ,those on national living wage in Scotland will be paid pound. hour.The national minimum wage will also see rises:The taper rateis amount your benefit payment reduces asyour income increases.Currently p is takenoff your benefit for every extra pound earned after tax, with the rate set at %.In todays announcement, the chancellor confirmed this taper ratewould be reduced to p, a cut of %.This will benefit low-income families where the adults are in work by increasing their overall income.However, it wont impact families who are out of work, who recently faced the pound cut to universal credit which came into force earlier this month.Since benefits are reserved the Westminster and not devolved to Scotland, this taper rate reduction will apply to people in Scotland.English cities will see money invested to improve transport infrastructure.Transport is a devolved matter, however Scotland will get money through the Barnett formula, which is what the UK government uses when they spend more money in England to keep spending more fair.Although Scotland will get money because England are spending more on transport, the Scottish government can do what they please with this money and do not necessarily need to use it for transport.Health is completely devolved, so announcements regarding funding for the NHS refer to NHS England only.However, Scotland will once again get money through the Barnett system, which they could choose to spend on the NHS.For example, during yesterdays Covid update, Nicola Sturgeon confirmed the Scottish government would spend additional money on NHS Scotland.Fuel duty is a tax included in the price ofpetrol, diesel and other fuels used in vehicles or for heating.It is reserved to Westminster, meaning the freeze to the price of fuel duty will apply to Scotland.Foreign affairs are not devolved, so the UK government is in charge of Great Britains border control.This means that thepoundm to protect UK borders, including poundm for a new fleet of patrol boats, will apply to Scotland.According to the UK government, this fund aims to invest in infrastructures which will improve every day le for people across the UK.This pound million allocated to Scotland will back projects in places including Aberdeen and Lewis, Rishi Sunak said in todays announcement.Through the Barnett formula, there will be an increase to Scottish Governmentfunding in each year by pound. billion, according to the chancellor.Yes, alcohol duty is reserved to Westminster, so the announcement that alcohol dutywill increase on stronger alcohols such as fortied wine and higher volume red wines will apply to Scotland.A new lower rate of alcohol duty on draught beers and cider will also apply to Scotland, as willthe cancellation of theplanned increase in duty on spirits like Scotch Whisky, wine, cider and beer - which will come into action from midnight

The SNP described it as smoke and mirrors. Future generations need to look closely at the SNP reaction to UK spending. It would rather the UK didnrsquot fund projects within Scotland as it highlights the benefit of being part of the UK.The SNP would rather continue wasting money on overseas offices than help those of us here who are desperate for Aberdeen to get a new lease of le. What future do younger generations want for Scotland  A flashy office in Brussels or investment in their cities, making them places they want to spend time Jane Lax, Aberlour.TIME TO CANCEL DEVOLUTION JUST when is the SNP going to grow up and abandon its tiresomely childish tactics  The Chancellor has given Scotland around pound billion extra money over the next three years. The SNPs response to this windfall is predictably to complain. This policy of decrying anything from Westminster as a slight against devolution or similar charges, designed to garner support for independence, is infantile.Perhaps the next referendum put to Scots voters ought to be whether to cancel devolution rather than seek independence. The rather large amount of public money saved by dissolving an under-achieving Holyrood with its huge infrastructure and running costs could be better spent where in Scotland, such as giving it to our local councils instead. They would use the money more wisely and effectively.Dr Gerald Edwards, Glasgow.SUNAK HEADING FOR NO LEAKS to the media and spin set the scene for positive Budget reviews to aid Rishi Sunakrsquos political ambitions. Yet under Mr Sunak as Chancellor, the reality is that the UK economy will have the highest taxation for  years, coupled to high inflation and substantial borrowing.Cuts to future GDP growth are linked to Brexitand Covid- , while large swathes of us now face a real squeeze on our living standards. He has also made the Prime Minister look foolish, with a freeze on fuel duty and a drop in air passenger dutyjust as delegates are arriving for COP . He could easily have made travel by electric aircraft free of duty and doubled it for fossil fuel planes a carrot for green transport and a stick for polluters.Will Mr Sunak soon be PM  He must be favourite, given the absurd ldquopositivity toward him in the Tory media, while doubts about ldquosocialist Boris Johnson, by the same media, are growing.GR Weir, Ochiltree.BUDGET WILL DETER ENTERPRISEBY expanding the state and raising the tax burden to postwar levels this Tory Budget evoked uncomfortable memories of the era of rationing. The Chancellor pledged that every government department would receive an above-inflation spending increase ndash an extra pound billion in public service spending. To pay for such largesse, the tax burden will rise by the end of this parliament to well over one-third of our GDP.This is the kind of high-tax, high-spending economy with low productivity and average public services which would make Gordon Brown blanch. The belief that we can tax our way to wealth has not been borne out in my span of four score years. In fact I have more sympathy with Nigel Lawsonrsquos dictum: ldquoIncome or property belongs to the people who earn it and the case has to be made for taxing it away.This Budget along with previously-announced policies of raising corporate taxation, national insurance contributions and freezing income tax personal allowances will deter enterprise. Britain is plunging down the tax competitiveness rankings and is now nd out of an index of  nations. As social benefits such as the health service get steadily worse, I doubtldquotaxing and intervening is really the way to go.Dr John Cameron, St Andrews.THE DEATH OF LOCAL INCOME TAXFOR once I agree with Peter Russellthat power should be devolved ldquoback to regional authorities and or regional consortia of service providers hellipempowered to raise a Regional Income Tax and act as a major tool of redistribution. However,this is to be done letrsquos do it on an honest basis.First, Mr Russell displays his central belt prejudice by suggesting ldquoGreater Glasgow be first, followed by Edinburgh and Lothians and Fe. What about the rest of Scotland  There well might have to be ied arrangements in parts of Scotland, but surely the approach cannot ignore large parts of our country. And how much local democracy would be lost through the creation of ldquoGreater Glasgow  Secondly, his claim that ldquothe SNP first came to power in  on an explicit manesto commitment to scrap the Hated Council Tax and to replace it with a Local Income Tax , is correct as far as it goes, but omits a crucial detail. LIT had to be given up because Gordon Brownrsquos Government threatened to hold back the council tax rebate, worth about pound million,Scotland changed its system of local taxation. If Mr Russell wants to understand the failure to implement local income tax, he would do well to look to his own party.Mr Russellrsquos proposals are interesting, particularly as local government is in serious need of reform after the gerrymandered system bequeathed to us by the Major government. If, though, LIT could be frustrated in , how is Regional Income Tax likely to fare in  with the current Westminster Government It must therefore be understood that even though such reform lies within the powers of the Scottish Parliament, the chances of success of any scheme will demand the sanction of the London Government.Alasdair Galloway, Dumbarton.PENALISED BY TAX CONFUSIONRORY Mair is quite right to draw attention to officialese disempowering ordinary people .It reminded me of the growing numbers of ordinary people who have to carry out self-assessment for their taxes, whose means are too modest to secure the services of an accountant and therefore risk making a mistake and being penalised. Or those who have been given more flexibility with their pension accruals but no way of knowing what their best option might be. The free government advice is not specic enough, the online pages confusing and full of technical terms, and gone are the days of asking your friendly bank manager for that sort of advice as not only is the manager unlikely to be in the local branch , but bank staff are constrained by law as to the advice they can give.\"Consult your financial adviser\" is the mantra. Do those repeating it not realise that most people do not have such a thing  There must be thousands of people with no idea how to find a financial adviser or how much they would cost , and so are cast adrt and left floundering. As a consequence, there must be many who take the wrong decisions, or, even worse, dont do anything, because there is no affordable way of finding out what the right options for them might be.In the meantime the better-off can afford to pay for expert advice on taxes, pensions and investments, as they have always done, secure in the knowledge that they will secure the best s.Somebody must be making money out of all this confusion and inertia, but sadly it is not the people who could most do with it.Jane Ann Liston, St Andrews.WHY FLOODING WAS INEVITABLEI WAS not surprised to see localised flooding in ious areas of Glasgow. On my way home on Wednesday nightthere was a deluge of water running down Springburn Road to the Hawthorn Street off-ramp where a massive lake had appeared. It looked like none of the gullies drains on the east side of Springburn Road were taking any water.Judging by pictures in the media of Great Western Road, Balgrayhill Road and other locations, I wonder when these locations were visited by a gully cleaner, remember them  Too many kerbside drains appear full to the top with mud stopping the water flowing away into the drains. Perhaps this is yet another example of a lack of spend on roads maintenance.Douglas Jardine, Bishopbriggs.Read more: This was a Budget that was bad for Scotland"},{"url":null,"title":"letters-glasgow-daft-agree-hosting-cop26","story":"In due course, I have no doubt, the upsides for Glasgow and Scotland, including boosts for hotels, restaurants, the tourist industry generally and international publicity, will eventually be weighed in the balance with the downsides, some of which have already evidenced themselves.These downsides include effects on the NHS with a signicant number of hospital appointmentsbeing amended and many staff and patients likely to find their journeys more problematic the demands and pressures on Police Scotland suggest that there will be less resource available for dealing with law enforcement generally the opportunity presented to trade unions to put extra pressure on the employers of their members with regard to wages and other conditions of employment the serious disruption caused to commercial and other road traffic the loss of direct tuition at places of further education with students being directed to work online, and concern about the potential Covid implications of such a substantial number of attendees delegates arriving from countries all over the world.The selection of Glasgow took place some time ago and I appreciate that someone has to do it. However, there have been moments when one is left wondering whether or not those who were looking after the interests of Glasgow during the selection process fully considered and took into account all the implications of hosting such a signicant international event for the communities of the Glasgow area.Ian W Thomson, Lenzie.THE EVERYDAY WASTE OF ENERGYI WONDER to what extent COP or indeed the anti-climate change movement is addressing the issue of energy waste and unnecessary energy usage  Instead of searching for ways to keep up with an apparently ever-increasing demand for energy should they not be seeking ways to encourage a reduction in energy consumption Now that the winter-time dog-walking regime is in place I am becoming aware yet again of the ever-increasing number of houses with unnecessary and often garish under-eaves lighting that serve no useful purpose, routinely unoccupied but fully illuminated rooms, totally superfluous year-round fairy-lights, not to mention illuminated trees, for Petes sake . Do people really need widescreen televisions that take up an entire wall  Does a household really need more than one television, a home cinema, microwave ovens, electronically-operated garage doors, dishwashers and every appliance under the sun you can think of  And as for SUVs and hot tubs...We are told that sending an email is more energy-efficient than sending an item by post but how many totally unnecessary, not to say pointless, emails and texts and social media messages are fired back and forth nowadays  Do people not realise that they use energy  Probably not.Sad to say, but the human race, at least the industrialised, commercialised west, is too egocentric and regards itself to be too entitled, to even consider that these things are adding to the current crisis. And as for giving them up ndash no chance.C Fleming, Kirkintilloch.HEAT PUMPS ARE JUST THE JOBI READ Colin Gunnrsquos letter re heat pumpswith incredulity.

A few months later they were married, and the chic, fun-loving, gregarious Evelyne moved to a specially architect-designed s flat roofed house in the depths of rural Ayrshire.ldquoIt must have been quite a shock for Evelyne but she put up with it for seven years till we moved to the family house in Milton of Campsie, Ronnie recalls. ldquoHowever, she really blossomed when we eventually settled in Glasgowrsquos West End, near friends, art galleries, museums, theatre, concerts and the opera.Both had been married before. Evelyne had a daughter Valerie, and Ronnie, a son, Giles. Seven years later they had a daughter, Josephine. Evelyne loved babies and small children and delighted in her seven grandchildren. With her exuberant hugs, noisy kisses, songs and belly laughs, she made the perfect gran.She had begun le as Evelyne Socquet-Clerc, and never lost her strong French accent. She was just four when the Nazis invaded Paris. Her father, who worked for the French Resistance and was well aware of the dangers involved, sent his three children and her mother out of the city. Evelyne remembered how cold she was as she and her siblings travelled for days on foot.Maybe her early experiences made her into such a good, appreciative and supportive person, because she had a group of lelong women friends, who remember how she could often and easily turn coffee mornings into champagne mornings.Artists such as John Cunningham, Archie Forrest, George Devlin, John Boyd, Christine MacArthur, Norman Edgar, Connie Simmers, Glen Scouller and many others were also friends, as was Gordon Mitchell, convenor of the RGI. Norrie Kirkham painted her portrait and David Donaldson gave her pictures. ldquoEvelyne liked to buy and sell, her husband told me. ldquoShe bought an Alex Goudie still-le of decanters, appropriate for my family connection with Teacherrsquos whisky.Her elder sister, Jeanne Socquet-Clerc, was a big influence. Jeanne had even left home in Paris under disapproving eyes, to follow her career as a painter. Their parents were strictly old-fashioned, believing in conservative professions: secretarial college, not opera. Ever afterwards, Evelyne was determined to support the arts. She and Ronnie were keen concert-goers and members of the Royal Scottish National Orchestra circle. She also supported a couple of Conservatoire students.In later le, and even after the onset of dementia, music and song were hugely important to her. She had done several years of professional classical voice training in Glasgow and loved her singing lessons. ldquoShe got a tremendous amount of joy from learning to sing and finding her voice, says Josephine.Evelyne loved being on stage and in  was involved in Scottish Operarsquos Memory Spinners outreach programme for dementia sufferers. She and her carer attended one rehearsal a week for eight weeks, culminating in a performance with a live orchestra and singers from Scottish Opera in a performance of Die Fiederamaus in the companyrsquos production studios.Surrounded by paintings, to the end she enjoyed conducting music on Spoty from her hospice bed. With the help of technology her family were able to have Evelyne singing at her own funeral, and along with family movie clips and photos gave everyone a touching memorial that I am sure she would have loved. The touching video can be viewed online at http:www.cmtv.biz Evelyne.Evelyne Anderson was a uniquely charismatic figure, able to galvanize others in support of the arts, beloved by all who knew her. We need more people like her. She is survived by Victoria, Josephine and Giles, and her grandchildren.CLARE HENRY"},{"url":null,"title":"scotland-rugby-channel-watch-scotland-v-tonga-weekend-autumn-series","story":"As October draws to a close, the rugby season is well and truly underway, with the match between the teams their first head to head since .It was Scotland who proved triumphant at their last encounter, scoring five tries to beat Tonga - at Kilmarnock.The odds on paper are tipped in Scotlands favour: of the four meetings with Tonga, Scotland have won three.In front of a home crowd at Murrayfield, the team will look to extend this track record to four wins, as the autumn international series gets underway.Heres what you need to know about Saturdays Scotland match against Tonga...The Scotland v Tonga match will take place at Murrayfield on Saturday October at :pm.It marks the start of the autumn international series, which will last throughout November.Amazon Prime hasthe broadcast rights for the autumn international series in the UK.You will need a membership to tune in, butyou dont already have one you can sign up to a -day free trial.If you dont want to continue your trial after the -days however, you will need to remember to cancel your subscription.Here is Scotlands schedule for the autumn series:Scotland v Australia: Sunday November  at :pmScotland v South Africa: Saturday November  at pmScotland v Japan: Saturday November  at pmScotland TeamForwards Pierre Schoeman George Turner Zander Fagerson Jamie Hodgson Rob Harley Jamie Ritchie  Hamish Watson Matt FagersonBacks Ali Price  Blair Kinghorn Rufus McLean Sam Johnson Sione Tuipulotu Kyle Steyn Darcy GrahamReplacements Stuart McInally Jamie Bhatti Oli Kebble Marshall Sykes Luke Crosbie Nick Haining Jamie Dobie Ross Thompson"},{"url":null,"title":"covid-nicola-sturgeon-say-cop26-update-today","story":"During Tuesdays Covid update to Parliament, the first minister warned that Covid hospitalisations were rising, with more cases among the older population.Amid warnings that case numbers could surgefollowing the climate conference, which will see over tens of thousands of people flock to the city, today the first minister outlined how the government aimed to protect both citizens and those visiting.Nicola Sturgeon acknowledged that the summit would bring a certain level of disruption, due to the extremely high profile nature of the event.Heres what we learned from the update today...The first minister encourgaged people to avoid travelling across Glasgow and the central belt where possible, particularly in the first few days of COP.She said that this did not only apply to road travel, but also by rail, following the news that ScotRail workers will no longer be striking during the conference.If travel is necessary, the government advise planning journeys carefully.According to the first minister, the first Sunday, Monday and Tuesday of COP will be particularly busy as world leaders come together.Next Friday and Saturday will see large scale protests across the city, with Saturdays event expected to see up to , people march from Kelvingrove Park to Glasgow Green.Scottish government doing everything they can to mitigate the spread of Covid, according to the first minister.The first minister acknowledged the disruption to the people of Glasgow, and thanked residents for their patience.Police chiefIain Livingstone acknoweldged that the UN was encourgaing people to make their voices heard during the conference, and endorsed this message.However, he addedthat swt action would be taken against those intent on actually disrupting the Covid conference.Police Scotland said that physical interference would be required where protesters were preventing the conference from going ahead.Jason Leitch encouraged people to continue following the remaining Covidrules in Scotland, and urged people to be even more careful over the coming weeks.When asked how emergency services will cope with the added demand and the navigation of protests, Jason Leitch said there was a \"many layered\" approach.He added that Scotland was \"ready\" and the health service was \"prepared\" for COP.The first minister confirmed she would co-host an event on Tuesday afternoon with UK prime minister Boris Johnson.She also added that while the Scottish government and British government had some big dferences, they would work hard to come to the best outcome for the world over the coming days."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/13152351.jpg?type=article-full","title":"best-slots-sites-online-real-money-games-uk","story":"Not all slot sites are created equal, though.

You should check your local laws before setting up an account anywhere.Also, keep in mind that the laws of your jurisdiction arenrsquot the only thing you need to worry about. Your financial institutions may not do business with slot sites, so you should also check with your bank to make sure that you donrsquot get into hot water with them.Can I Trust Slot Sites If you find a reputable online casino, it will be as trustworthy as any gambling house yoursquoll find in Vegas. That being said, not all UK slot sites are reputable, so herersquos what you should look for before you put money down:Are Online Video Slots Rigged As long as you find a reputable casino that has titles from reputable providers, then the games shouldnrsquot be rigged.However, donrsquot make the mistake of assuming that any casino games are beatable just because theyrsquore not rigged. The casinos have to make money somehow, and the odds will always be in their favor.That being said, some slots offer better odds than others. Look for a gamersquos -to-playerpercentage. This will tell you just how big of an edge the house has, andyou can find a title with a high RTP, you can really stretch your gaming budget.Are Online Slots Hard to Play That depends on the slot game you pick. Some slots are almost exactly like the one-armed bandits of yesteryear: they have single reels with clearly-defined ways to win and lose.However, some modern slots are extremely complex, with multiple reels, bonus rounds, and literally thousands of ways to win. While they can be intimidating to novice users, they can also be incredibly fun, and the added complexity makes it less likely that yoursquoll get bored with them quickly.The good news is that many sites have the option of taking practice rounds, allowing you to play the slot without risking any money. This allows you to get the hang of the more complicated games without losing an arm and a leg in the process.At the end of the day, though, you should play whichever games you want to play. If that means sticking to the classic machines and leaving the newfangled ones alone, then thatrsquos perfectly fine.Can I Play Online Slots on My Mobile Device Yes, almost all UK slot sites support mobile play nowadays. The quality of that play will y, however.A few sites have dedicated apps for iOS, Android, or both. These apps usually make for a smoother gaming experience, but theyrsquore still relatively rare in the online gaming industry.Most online casinos require you to play on your browseryoursquore playing on a mobile device, and that experience can y wildly. Some are just as good as playing on your desktop, while others restrict the number of games or features you can use.If you plan on playing quite a bit on your mobile device, itrsquos worth your time to shop around and find a site that offers a high-quality gaming experience.What is RTP and How Does It Affect Me RTP stands for ldquo to player, and it expresses how much money you can expect to win playing a given site. Itrsquos usually described as a percentage, soyou see a machine that has a % RTP, that means that you can expect to win  cents for every dollar you bet.The higher a machinersquos RTP, the more of your money you can expect to get back when you play. Notice we didnrsquot say you could win mdash yoursquore not going to come out ahead in the long run on any slot. Casinos have to make money, after all.If you want to find out exactly what a given machinersquos RTP is, then the best way to do that is Google the name of the machine plus ldquoRTP. This should lead you to the answer, but not all providers list the RTP of their games, so itrsquos not foolproof.What is Volatility in Terms of Online Slots Volatility is closely related to RTP, and it describes how much money you can expect to win and how often. For example, a highly volatile machine wonrsquot pay out very often, but when it does, you can expect to win more money than you would on a machine with less volatility.A progressive jackpot is the ultimate example of a high-volatility option. It can take forever for someone to hit it, but when they do, the payout makes up for all the time they spent trying.Low volatility isnrsquot necessarily better than high volatility mdash itrsquos all a matter of personal preference. Some people prefer to win as often as possible, eventheir wins are on the small side. Others are okay with long dry spells, provided that the occasional wins are big enough to make the wait worthwhile.Are Some Slots ldquoLooser Than Others Yes and no. The idea of a loose slot mdash one that pays out way more than others mdash is largely a myth. Yoursquore not going to find a magical machine that will help you get rich, as theyrsquore all designed to favor the house in the long run.On the other hand, RTP and volatility go a long way towards describing a given slotrsquos looseness. A low-volatility slot with high RTP may seem loose compared to others, in that yoursquoll win on it a lot more than you will others.At the end of the day, wersquod advise you not to pay too much attention to the idea of loose slots. Yoursquore better off picking slots that you enjoy, or seeking out those with the volatility level that you prefer.Is There a Secret to Beating Slot Machines That depends on what you mean. If yoursquore looking for a code or hack that lets you get rich by cheating the machines, yoursquore not going to find it. The casinos and slot developers make too much money to leave loopholes like those lying around.On the other hand, there are some things you need to do in order to win certain bets. For example,you want to hit a jackpot, then you need to bet the max every time. If you donrsquot, yoursquoll never hit a huge payout mdash simple as that.Now, itrsquos important to understand that betting the max wonrsquot make you more likely to win a jackpot than everyone  whorsquos also betting the max. It simply means that you have no shot of hitting a jackpot without betting that way.Is There a Best Time to Play Online Slots This idea is based on an old myth that casinos rigged their slots to pay out more at certain times of the day. These times were usually when the casino experienced the most traffic the idea was that, by articially causing the slots to pay out more while more people were watching, more players would test their luck on slot machines .Therersquos no truth to this, of course. Your odds of winning are the same no matter what time of day you play, so donrsquot worry about trying to pinpoint the golden gambling hour or anything like that.The bottom line is that the best time to play is whenever you feel like playing.Whatrsquos the Best Way to Make Money Playing Online Slots The first thing you need to understand is that you probably wonrsquot make money playing slots. Itrsquos not like poker, where a player with enough skill can earn enough from it to make a living.That means that, rather than asking yourself how to make money at online slots, you should ask yourself how you can make your money last as long as possible. There are ways to stretch your gambling buck,yoursquore shrewd and willing to work at it.The best way to make your money last is by taking advantage of all the promotions that ious online casinos offer. Simply put, the more money you have, the longer you can play mdash so why not use the free money that they hand out That means being sure to use deposit bonuses when you sign up, and check out each sitersquos loyalty program. Many give frequent players extra financial incentives to keep playing, including occasionally handing out cash funds! Donrsquot be afraid to shop around and take advantage of many dferent bonuses, either.Beyond that, itrsquos mainly a matter of playing machines with a high RTP and being smart about managing your bankroll. You may not get rich playing slot machines, but therersquos no reason why you have to dig yourself into a financial hole, either.Are Slot Machines Addictive All forms of gambling can be addictive to people who are predisposed to having a problem, but it certainly seems as though playing slots online can be especially habit-forming.According to a study performed in Rhode Island, people who become addicted to slots move from ldquosocial to ldquopathological gambling  times faster than those who have issues betting on horse racing.Part of the problem is the instant nature of the slot machine. Because the game decidesyou win or lose in seconds, you can play hundreds of times every hour, giving your brain a little jolt of dopamine and adrenaline every time you press the spin button.Online gambling has also been shown to be more addictive than brick-and-mortar betting. The issue is that the virtual casino is always only a few clicks away, which makes it easier to gamble mindlessly and incorporate wagering into your daily le.None of this is said to discourage you from playing online slots games. Theyrsquore a lot of fun mdash but they can also be dangerous, so be careful. If you suspect you have a problem, seek help immediately.How Big Are Slot Jackpots That depends on the slot, as well as whether you mean ldquoregular jackpots or ldquoprogressive jackpots.Each slot has a dferent max payout these can range from a few hundred times the max bet to tens of thousands of times bigger than the max bet. As a general rule, the larger the jackpot each machine offers, the more volatility it will offer as well.Progressive jackpots, on the other hand, can theoretically be limitless. The way they work is they keep growing until somebody hits them, so the longer it takes for someone to get lucky, the larger the jackpot will grow. It works a lot like the lottery in that sense.Yoursquoll see progressive jackpots ranging from five figures all the way into the millions. As with the lottery, the larger the jackpot becomes, the more interest gamblers will take in it, so progressive jackpot slots will explode in popularity when the payout becomes massive enough.What Are Slot Tournaments and How Do They Work Slot tournaments are events where multiple players play a certain title for a set amount of time. At the end of that time period, the player with the most wins takes home the lionrsquos share of the prize pool.Other players can win prizes as well, as the rules will y from tournament to tournament and site to site.Slot tournaments can be incredibly fun, but they require you to play the same game for long periods of time in order to win. As a result, theyrsquore not for everyone.How Do I Get Money On and Off Slots Sites Each site has certain banking options it uses. These can include credit cards like Visa or MasterCard, e-wallets like Neteller, or traditional bank wires. Some even accept cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.Be sure to read the fine print before you hand over your financial information, though. Some levy fees on their transactions, and others have caps on how much you can deposit or withdraw at a time.Is One Banking Method Better Than the Others As a general rule, no. However, since all sites have their own rules and regulations regarding the financial institutions they do business with, some may offer rewards or penalties for using a particular banking method.For example, many sites in the UK are trying to encourage their players to use Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. As a result, theyrsquove begun offering incentives like increased bonuses, special perks, and fewer withdrawal and deposit restrictions for players using cryptocurrency.Other sites may want to steer you towards using an e-wallet like Neteller, and still others prefer traditional methods like Visa or MasterCard. Therersquos no one-size-fits all answer here, so you should do your research and see how a given site treats the ious banking options to see which one is best for you.That being said,you have a banking method you prefer, yoursquoll want to shop around to find the slots site that will give you the best deal on that particular method.Can I Play Online Slots for Free Some sites let you play free slots, yes, but not all of them. Yoursquoll have to look around to find online casinos that allow practice rounds, but theyrsquore not terribly hard to find.Are New Slot Sites Better or Worse Than Brick-and-Mortar Slots That depends on what you value in a slot machine. If you like the feel of touching an old-school machine, oryou just love the thrill of walking into a casino and being surrounded by the flashing lights and the noise, then yoursquoll probably prefer classic slots.Beyond that, though, mobile slot sites generally have the old one-armed bandits beat. You can play thousands more titles at an online casino, online sites usually offer superior slots bonuses, and you donrsquot have to deal with rude people, cigarette smokers, or long commutes.Hitting a jackpot in your living room may not be quite as thrilling as hitting one surrounded by hundreds of strangers mdash but hey, the money spends just as well.Which Software Providers Are the Best ldquoThe best is a subjective term, and so itrsquos hard to give a definitive answer to this question. It all boils down to figuring out what you like in a slot machine and finding a company that provides it.However, some companies definitely have a reputation for being innovative, trustworthy, and exciting. Some of the top software providers pumping out casino games today include:This list isnrsquot comprehensive, of course, and there are a lot of up-and-coming providers that are worth paying attention to. For now, though, you can trust that yoursquore in good handsyou see titles from any of the above providers at your casino of choice.Do UK Slots Sites Offer Bonuses Almost every site offers a welcome bonus of some kind, and most have other promotions that they run regularly as well. These can include deposit bonuses, bonus spins, and tournaments with big prize pools.Many sites also have loyalty or VIP programs that reward players for their patronage. You earn player points while at the tables, and the more points you earn, the higher up the ladder you can climb.

Unite is calling for McVities to do the right thing before they switch off the lights at the Tollcross site.The counter-proposal prepared by a action group including unions, the Scottish Government and Glasgow City Council, outlined a new factory could be built near the existing site.It claimed that closing Tollcross would cost Pladis, over poundm, factoring in costs such as redundancies. Sale of the Tollcross site for housing could also raise poundm.Robert Deavy, GMB Scotland organiser said: \"Whilst GMB are satisfied that the redundancy process was finalised in an amicable manner which proved agreeable to our Union members, it is still a disappointment that no serious consideration was truly given to the counter proposal set out by the action group to keep these vital manufacturing jobs in Scotland.ldquoWhat we are requesting now is that Pladis co-operate with the Government and Trade Unions to ensure that a proper legacy is left at this historic site should the company finalise the decision to vacate.

We had council workers that took on additional and dferent duties and they’ve had no reward.”Responding to the announcement of the strike, an OIC spokeswoman said: “The council was informed in writing by UNISON on Monday afternoon that, following a ballot for industrial action, they would be calling their members who work in school catering, cleaning and janitorial services to participate in strike action during the period November  to November , .“Other trade unions have not established a mandate for industrial action in Orkney.“The action announced is in response to the ongoing national dispute in relation to a pay award for local government staff for the year - which is negotiated between the trade unions and COSLA as the umbrella body for local government.“The council will be evaluating what impact this announcement may have on service provision as a matter of urgency and will ensure appropriate communications are issued in due course.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

On another occasion an attendant has faced verbal abuse from a member of the public as they were dealing with a blocked toilet. Some cases of vandalism have also included fire damage.“These stories are really disappointing to hear about,” said Kenny MacPherson, OIC’s interim head of property, IT and facilities.“Our dedicated and hard-working staff do a fantastic job of keeping our facilities and waiting rooms clean and safe.”“Orkney is often voted as one of the best places to live and work. We all play a part in keeping the place special – including the unsung heroes in our cleaning team who day in, day out, face up to all kinds of situations with dedication and resolve. The ongoing provision of these facilities is a credit to the county while many in other parts of the country are closed. Vandalism and anti-social behaviour detracts from these achievements.“Be kind. Our staff keep the toilets clean and presentable for everyone to use. Staff should not be subjected to verbal or physical abuse when carrying out their duties. There will be times when facilities may temporarily be unavailable due to cleaning operations being carried out and this is to maintain social distancing and everyone’s safety.”If anyone knows any information regarding these incidents of vandalism and antisocial behaviour they can report it to Police Scotland on the non-emergency number  or by contacting Crimestoppers.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It’s the only surviving wholly medieval cathedral in Scotland — all the others were either ruined, rebuilt, or extended in later years. We are the only church in Scotland which still contains the relics of its original saint, and asthat weren’t enough we have two saints!“Although it took nearly  years before it was complete, it has stood the test of time very well. What a vision Earl Rognvald must have had — he wanted to build the most important and the most impressive building in the whole of Orkney — and nearly  years later it still is.#Elaine Grieve, chairwoman of the Society of the Friends of St Magnus Cathedral, added: “There are many supporters of the Cathedral worldwide who, as members of the Society of the Friends of St Magnus Cathedral, have contributed to the maintenance of this wonderful building who will be delighted to read that it features in Simon Jenkins’ book, Europe’s  Best Cathedrals.“But they won’t be surprised. For more than  years the Society has existed primarily to raise funds to ensure the preservation of St Magnus Cathedral as an inspiring place to visit and worship. By contributing to the maintenance of the building, the future of the Cathedral as a place to be enjoyed by future generations has been secured and, through works like such as these, its magnicence has been recognised and once again celebrated in print.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

I sense every step of that journey.In , Borrodale school closed for that last time. And yet,we listen, we can still hear from Borrodale, forever young and in timeless cèilidh.Put in this kind of context we can sense how community relationships are deeply connected to change. The continuity of change, both backwards and forwards, gives us insight, and proximity with dferent and creative ways of being in place.Times change and culture continues. It is important to be hopeful in this and to not perceive the shadows of the past as a fading le force but as an index pointing to future relationships.The second social experience is of course relates to the typical excitement of guising at Oidhche Shamhna. Originally, Oidhche Shamhna was integral toour sense of place and the cultural relationships of le cycles, including time itself.Oidhche Shamhna is ‘the night of summer’s end,’ and in our older understanding of the festival, it reveals that new le begins in darkness and is born into light similarly, just as days used to begin and end at dusk, the move to the darker half of the year is also the continuation of a cycle and is equally about new beginnings.In the deeper memory of Gaelic cosmology, this is the beginning of the new year, and of course, November is still called ‘an t-Samhain’ in Gàidhlig.My earliest memories of guising would be like those of many, our dad taking my sister and I for a few easy visits to long-standing neighbours and family friends. Even though we would only go to a few houses in those early days, the intensity and excitement of the initiation on a cold dark night was largely experienced through the warmth and kindness revealed in the relationships that emerged in the evening.Guising, then, is a form of cèilidh, where the encouraging and nurturing of the gt of exchange is more intangible than we always appreciate. It is that dimension of sustaining or developing relationships that seems most important to me.One of the first homes we would have visited on my first Oidhche Shamhna will have been that of Angus and Effie Ross in Fàsach. In my early years it was a home that we probably had more time in than any house outside of my family.It was a home I visited everyday day walking home from Borrodale school. My errand was to collect our newspapers from the post office, but it wasn’t a job, it was a relationship.Our family had a strong connection with these Rosses. In , Angus Ross’ great-uncle Alexander Ross had been nominated to deliver the prepared statement for the Fàsach croftersto the Napier Commission.In it he testied specically to the clearance of my great-great-grandfather from Ramasaig , who was removed along with all the families from Ramasaig around -, to make way for sheep, congesting further the land in Fàsach. So, it is from at least that time that our family had been friends.Alexander Ross’s brother, Kenneth Ross, also Fàsach, had among his eight children a first son called Neil and a second called Norman, both being young boys during the land wars....I did know Margaret but I never did met James Ross as he had a fatal accident in the early s in Glasgow, outside the BBC.Angus Ross and Seanair worked together on the County lorry . We saw Angus and Effie a lot and my mum credits him with telling her and her siblings about their Cameron origin story in Glendale.A mysterious tale of a man with long grey hair and a beard living in a cave at Scornandaoine on the east side of Loch Poolteil. He had arrived from Lochaber, in the mid to later s, likely a refugee from any number of social problems in the Gàidhealtachd of that time.Even now it still sounds like a good Halloween story. Certainly, my mum has never been a fan of beards in the family, but we were always welcomed by the Rosses in the ceilidh ethic of everyday relationships., Tobraichean a’ Gluasad .Here, ‘Tuam’ talks about his knowledge of local wells the necessity to move between dferent wells for sustenance, and so there will be times when a well in one place becomes dry while water would be plentul in another well.A resource such as Tobar an Dualchais helps us think about our many and ied relationships with culture, place, and time.Part of the intangible gt to be found within the archives, and also with the people and places around us, is how the wells of culture will be found popping up with all their potential, anywhere and everywhere, carried through the voices and relationships we nurture and come to know.Importantly, this can activate new dialogues, experiences, and gestures of cèilidh, and to embrace these for all in our communities, our futures, wherever the wells emerge."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4172051.jpg--.jpg?1634716497000\n","title":"live practices return for seven towers choir","story":"ON a very pleasant note comes the news this week that Ballymena’s Seven Towers Male Voice Choir has ed for live practice!

A long black dress complete with red lipstick makes this an easy yet classic spooky look. For Gomez, try out your local charity shop and look for a striped suit jacket to pair with black trousers.

We were very disappointed that the screening was not completed at the earliest opportunity in the policy development process and we queried the potential for the screening to actually inform the development or delivery of the High Street Scheme.”She added: “The screening lacked data or information on which to determine impacts across the Section  equality grounds and consequently the assessments that there were no impacts for most of those grounds lacked coherence.A more robust and timely equality assessment would have enabled the Department to thoroughly consider and consult on the potential equality impacts.”She said the scheme appeared to be causing problems for specic groups such as some married women and older people who may not have forms of identication such as a driver’s licence or a valid passport required by the scheme.“There is potential for discrimination against some of these groups who may experience less favourable treatment than others, in this case on grounds of their sex,” she said.“We are writing to the Minister for the Economy today to remind him of the importance of adhering to the Section  duties and asking him to review the deadline set for applying for and using the card to ensure some groups of people are not adversely impacted and left out.“Importantly this situation also highlights the lack of protection for older people who are currently not protected against discrimination in the provision of goods, facilities and services, unlike their counterparts in the rest of the UK and Ireland.”Meanwhile, the Ulster Unionist MLA Andy Allen has called on the Economy Minister Gordon Lyons to extend the period for people to spend their £ vouchers after delays of issuing the cards.“Colleagues and I continue to be contacted by a considerable number of constituents, many of whom applied at the outset of the high street voucher application opening, who have still not received their spend local card,” he said.This is against the backdrop of the thousands of people who were contacted because they could not be veried by the automated process, asking them to provide further evidence. Many of them have been informed it is likely to be a number of weeks before they will receive their card.”Mr Allen said it was now “clearly” the case that the Minister could not guarantee everyone would have four weeks to spend their £ and that it was time to review the end date.Most ReadFormer Ireland rugby international David Tweed dies in motorcycle crashGun victim Stephen Barriskill was a key player in dog-fighting ringFamily tributes to former Ulster and Ireland rugby player David Tweed who died in road crashEscape to Craigantlet: Location and lots of space inside and out in heart of Holywood hillsTen vehicles destroyed in arson attack at Ballymena car dealershipTop VideosPlayNightclubs prepare to reopen across Northern IrelandPlayWatch: New trailer for Kenneth Branagh#s Belfast releasedPlayVideo: The moment round-world sailor finds mummied body on drting yachtLatest Northern IrelandNI health service gets £m boost in Stormont spending review allocationsLorry driver who stole a near £, shipment of Jägermeister gets anti-vax lecture from judgeHealth to get lion’s share of October monitoring allocationsNI Protocol: EU to refuse renegotiation on role of European Court of JusticeWhat are the changing Covid rules across the UK’s nations LatestSinn Fein to debate ending total opposition to Special Criminal CourtShania Twain shares surprise message with Strictly Come Dancing’s Sara and AljazPM defends Government after tax burden rises to highest level since sFlood warnings in force as Britain heads for wet weekendSally Challen condemns Penelope Jackson sentence as ‘appalling’,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It comes as part of the Northern Irelands Executives winter Covid contingency plans. The Executive said there was a need to keep as many sectors open to the fullest possible extent. First Minister, Paul Givan said doing that would depend on as many people as possible getting vaccinated.” googletag.cmd.push Just over % of people aged  and above in Northern Ireland had received one dose of the vaccine. Mr Givan said: Our vaccination rates are very good but there is still room for improvement.” Further Covid restrictions are due to be relaxed by the Executive onOctober . This will allow for nightclubs to reopen, restrictions on indoor dancing lted and the requirement to be seated in hospitality to drink and eat food will no longer be in place. Mr Givan said it was a fact of le that Covid remains an ongoing issue, and that the Executive needed to continue to find ways to manage the situation.     The First Minister says that the Executive will launch a new public information campaign before the end of October to build on the need for all of us to keep making safer choices.

Colin has performed a few small gigs since restrictions were lted and had his first postponed ticketed show atBelfast’s Orchestra Hall earlier this month.This was his first show of the set that was due to go ahead in March  before lockdown began. googletag.cmd.push Murphy said it has been a long time coming: I’m just trying to remember the whole set. Its mad- and you have to write a whole new bit as well because you know, obviously stuff has happened. “It’s weird having a stage again, people, an audience. I didnt do any gigs during lockdown. Other people did, and some people really enjoyed them, but that didn’t really appeal to me, so I just decided to wait. “It was pretty scary going back to live shows. It was like starting all over again, like doing a show for the very first time again, which was good. “I had an adrenaline rush for about a week.” Colin decided not to gig virtually during lockdown and spent his time on other things: “We did a couple of series of the Blame Game with the virtual zoom audience. I then did a show on RTE as well, that had no audience. “I had the obligatorypodcast that everybody did. Then I was just doing what everyone  was doing, learning skills. I just amused myself. Painting, just doing stuffto pass the time. “It was a foretaste of what retirement will be like, unless you’re under , and then youre never going to be able to retire. That was your year and a half of retirement.” Colin’s new show, Colonisation, toured theatres across Northern Ireland. He had four shows left, including at the Millenium Forum, before lockdown hit. He last performed in the Millenium in : “I was last performing in Derry with the last tour. I was really annoyed this time because this show sold more tickets than Ive ever sold before in the Millennium and then it was pulled. “Thankfullypeople haven’t asked for their money back, so thank you people of Derry. I need to remind people that the gig is on because people were given these tickets for Christmas presents and so on in , they’ll be sitting on a fridge somewhere covered in coffee stains, so its just to remind people as well that it is actually happening.” Colin isn’t making any drastic plans for the next year and beyond, after everything the last  months has thrown at the entertainment business: “I’m doing the ones that Ive got and then I’ll just see what happens after Christmas. “I’m just excited to get back to a live audience. The virtual audiences you know, theyre not the same. Its just not the same. “The whole thing of being in an audience is the collective feeling of people around you and sharing something and even though you are sort of doing that on Zoom, you’re in your own living room. I know some people are a little bit nervous about being in an audience again, but I think, for the shows, theyre taking all the precautions that they can.” Colin said there will be chat of COVID because we’ve all experienced the pandemic, but there will be other content: “Well be messing around and talking to the audience as usual. “My live shows never really have a theme, its always just what’s been going on in the world and my le.

Mr Eastwood was speaking ahead of the easing of restrictions in the North on Sunday October . SDLP Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon argued for the introduction of vaccine certications at the Executive, but it was opposed by Sinn Feacutein and the DUP. googletag.cmd.push Mr Eastwood said: “The easing of restrictions this weekend has been cause for much excitement. “The public will be happy they can once againto nightclubs and businesses will be rightfully ecstatic to open their doors for the first time in nearly two years. While this is welcome, we cannot ignore the fact that our hospitals are under increasing pressure. “Rarely a day goes by without another horror story about the state our health service is in. This year’s winter pressures have arrived earlier than normal and are affecting services across the board. Our health staff are crying out for help, they know what’s to come.     We are still recording over , new cases of the virus daily and people are dying.“We cannot continue to lt restrictions without mitigations while we are in this situation. Eventually the pressure on our health service will increase and we will be faced with tough decisions. Nobody wants to see another lockdown, it will have a devastating impact on people’s mental health, businesses and their staff. “We have a proven alternative that will allow us to prevent another lockdown while protecting our health service from being overrun – vaccine certications. “The evidence from other jurisdictions is clear – the introduction of vaccine certications encourages vaccine uptake, particularly in younger age groups. Surely this is not too much to ask in the interests of keeping the public, their families and our staff safe. “Our proposals for vaccine certications were blocked at the Executive by Sinn Feacutein and the DUP who instead left the matter in the hands of inidual businesses. This will create confusion and pressure for both businesses and their staff from patrons who may experience dfering rules from one venue to the next.“This decision marks a serious abdication of responsibility and leadership, with the consequences set to play out in our hospitals in the months to come. I hope the impact of this weekend’s reopening will be closely monitored and Sinn Feacutein-DUP ministers will reconsider their decision on vaccine certication before it’s too late.” The Welsh and Scottish Governments have both implemented proof of vaccination in order to enter nightclubs and other large capacity events and venues.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please just kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeMan to stand trial on rape and sexual assault charges overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm. When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny. The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner. An engineer and former Venture Capital Partner, in the  months since Jayne started she’s made a massive dference and she represents Belfast at the digital and innovation negotiating tables in both Westminster and Dublin.

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity. Being part of a community of like-minded people with a mutual love for traditions and heritage.“So much of our young children and adult lives have become about the constant need to train, to diet, to play, to watch, to support, to belong but ultimately to win,” Gael Foacutersa outline in the story on their website.“Gael Foacutersa is about getting away from these pressures and the responsibilities of the game.We want to take it back to the basics. It’s about the enjoyment of it all and putting smiles on peoples faces.“The Gael Foacutersa range offers high-quality, comfortable and eye-catching men’s and ladies leisurewear. It aims to reinforce the customer’s sense of identity. To be more than just about the game. It’s about being part of something bigger.” googletag.cmd.push For the full range, check out their website: www.gaelforsa.ieADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please just kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeMan to stand trial on rape and sexual assault charges overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

So, I told the parents who came to me I would bring it up at council.ldquoThe motion will be seconded by Cllr Sean Carrandit is passed, which I have no doubt it will be, it will become the official corporate position of Derry City and Strabane District Council, which will write to the ious bodies named in the motion.ldquoA lot of it is aspirational but it will highlight the issue and bring it out into the public domain. It will also send a message to the parents who contacted me that we are going to push this agenda and try and ensure Year  who want to do A-Level Irish, we will back them. We are also going to write to the Department of Education and the Education Authority, said Cllr Donnelly.RELATEDIrish is being marginalised and its importance downgradedLegislative authorities,governors and principals have to realise Irish language more than a school subjectA Level Irish provision absolute disasterPolicy of undermining Irish - Aontuacute Education spokespersonAnger at lack of Irish A-Level provision in Derry schoolsNo access for Year  students grossly unfairLast month, Bishop of Derry, Most Reverend Dr Doacutenal McKeown, said the purpose of the Area Learning Communities was that pupils who wished to study a subject like Irish should be able to attend classes in a school.He added: ldquoThat comes down to both planning and agreement between the schools in question. Thus,the Foyle Learning Community has not offered that subject co-operation, it would be appropriate to ask them and the governors of schools that are involved, why not. With plenty of fore-knowledge and forward planning, co-operation ought to be possible.Councillor, Emmet Doyle Aontuacute said he did not understand how timetabling could stand in the way of a childs education.In addition, Professor Malachy Oacute Neill, the director of regional engagement at Ulster University, said he would be following the issue up with the chairperson of the Foyle Learning Community Network in order to clary the situation.Reacuteamonn Oacute Ciaraacutein, the director of education with Gael Linn, placed the blame squarely on the legislative authorities, boards of governors and principals.In September, Mr Oacute Ciaraacutein chaired an online discussion on the critical decline in the uptake of Irish in English-medium post primary schools. The discussion was attended by  teachers who felt compelled to seek urgent and decisive action..They called upon the legislative bodies of the Northern Ireland Assembly, the Department of Education and their armrsquosbodies, such as CCEA, as well as the Education Authority, to intercede as matter of urgency to reverse the worrying trends in the study of the Irish language and other languages in English-medium post-primary schools.Aontuacute education spokesperson and representative for East Derry, Gemma Brolly, expressed wholehearted support for Gael Linns position.She added: ldquoWe would also like to reiterate our demand for accessibility to A Level Irish language courses for our young people throughout the North.ldquoAs education spokes- person and a gaeilgeoir myself, I would like to assure Gael Linn and all involved, we stand firmly, shoulder to shoulder with teachers, academics, authors and Irish language activists in their demand for urgent and decisive action to undo the wrongs and commit to the recommendation of studying a modern language at GCSE Level.Cllr Donnelly said his motion would also acknowledge the proud history of Irish language learning in Derry and Strabane, particularly the rich learning experience afforded to generations of post-primary pupils, instilling a love for Irish language and culture in many of our citizens, and widening career opportunities.ldquoThe motion further states:This council recognises the continuous growth in demand for Irish-medium education in this council area and beyond as reflected in the thriving communities in our local Irish-medium pre-schools and primary schools. Council welcomes the creation of new jobs, career opportunities and pathways in and around the Irish language, particularly in the context of forthcoming legislation.ADVERTISEMENT -- -- Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- -- Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please just kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- -- Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeMan to stand trial on rape and sexual assault charges overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

The scheme is a recycling initiative which he had championed during his time as Environment Minister and has worked to progress in recent years. In response to an Assembly Question tabled by Mr Durkan, the Minister of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs , Edwin Poots reaffirmed his commitment to introduce the scheme, following the department’s joint consultation with DAERA and the Welsh Government. googletag.cmd.push The Foyle MLA said: “I’m pleased that work is continuing to progress a depositscheme for Northern Ireland. “This is a scheme which began work on during my time as Environment Minister, having seen their benefits in other countries. “Unfortunately, at that time my attempts were met with some resistance, both politically and commercially. “In February , the Executive supported my calls for the introduction of a depositscheme and committed to the North’s participation in a proposed UK-wide rollout. I welcome that the consultation process has been completed and welcome Minister Poots commitment to delivering this scheme and move towards a circular economy.     “While awareness in recent years has improved where recycling is concerned, we are still not at the level we need to be. “A cash incentive under a Deposit Return Scheme, in my opinion, is the best way forward and will encourage an uptake in recycling. “Our throw-away culture is completely unsustainable and our planet is bearing the brunt of it. “In recent years, we have witnessed a growing realisation that action must be taken by governments, businesses and iniduals to address the damage being done to our environment. “I would like to see this scheme expanded to include cans and plastic bottles, building on the success of the carrier bag levy, to tackle the scourge of single use plastic on our communities. “I hope the Minister will revisit an all-island approach for this initiative but for now it is crucial that we push forward on implementing this environmentally transformative scheme without further delay. “ ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please just kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeMan to stand trial on rape and sexual assault charges overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

The SDLP leader was speaking after challenging Secretary of State Brandon Lewis on the matter in the House of Commons. He said he wanted to see all of the provisions of the New Decade, New Approach agreement realised, nearly two years on from theof power-sharing. googletag.cmd.push Mr Eastwood said: “When I challenged the Secretary of State today all I received was vague assurances and that just isn’t good enough anymore. “Brandon Lewis and his government have committed themselves to legislating for the Irish language at Westminster and the time has now come to follow through on that promise. “While we have been outspoken about our desire to see the Irish language measures agreed as part of New Decade, New Approach come to fruition that is not the only issue here. “ We want to see all parts of the agreement that the five main parties – including the DUP – signed up to realised.     “Our health and education system are falling apart, we are no closer to seeing , student places for Derry, we have yet to come up with a proper plan to tackle climate change and our politicians are still fighting the same old battles instead of focusing on delivering for people. “The protocol and the Irish language are two separate issues and neither should be used as pawns by parties for their own selfish interests. By playing politics with our institutions our people’s futures are being put at risk. “We need to resolve these issues and get back to focusing on cleaning up the mess that Sinn Feacutein and the DUP have made of this place over the past  years.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please just kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeMan to stand trial on rape and sexual assault charges overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

The Foyle MLA was speaking after the publishing of the Executive Office’s Wellbeing in Northern Ireland Report  . Le satisfaction, happiness, anxiety and loneliness measures showed a signicant decline in wellbeing over the past year, while women have reported signicantly lower levels of wellbeing than men. googletag.cmd.push Ms McLaughlin, who is also the SDLP’s spokesperson on Covid- recovery, said: “This report highlights how people in the North have been feeling over the past year. “It’s extremely concerning that people are reporting lower le satisfaction and happiness, while anxiety and loneliness have increased signicantly. Women are also reporting signicantly lower levels of wellbeing than men. “These figures are hardly surprising considering what people here have been through over the past year. From the onset of the coronavirus pandemic people’s lives have been changed dramatically. “For months people were cut off from friends and families with many working from home and having less interaction with others on a day to day basis.     “The pandemic has exacerbated the already high levels of mental health issues in the North. “As we emerge from the restrictions of the last year and a half we must now deal with the effects they have had on people, or we risk our current mental health crisis getting even worse. “We need to see the Department of Health follow through with it’s mental health strategy with the Finance Minister ensuring it is properly funded. “We must also see an overall Covid- recovery plan from the Executive Office to address the issues raised, including society’s gender imbalance.

Cllr Harkin had tabled a motion calling for Council to support retail workers right to receive time off during the Christmas and New Year period. googletag.cmd.push The Foyleside councillor cited a survey conducted by trade union Usdaw that consulted its members across the north of Ireland with a vast majority in favour of such a measure. Cllr Harkin also cited that other trade unions in the north had backed Usdaws demands. Cllr Harkins motion read: “Council notes its concern that many workers in a wide range of dferent sectors are not receiving a decent break from work over the Christmas and New Year holiday period. “Council notes the results of the Christmas and New Year working surveys by Usdaw which show  per cent of respondents from across the North said that they spend too little time at Christmas with family and friends. Christmas Day trading legislation means that nearly all shops do not trade on Christmas Day. “However, many retail workers report that for them, Christmas is just a day off, not a holiday. Long hours in the run-up to Christmas and shops re-opening early on Boxing Day leaves many retail workers too exhausted and with insufficient time off to enjoy the Christmas holiday. “Council commits to supporting the campaign to allow retail workers to have quality time with family and enjoy the benefit of the break in the way so many of us do rather than use Christmas Day as a day of recuperation. “Council supports Usdaws call, backed by the March  NIC-ICTU Biennial Delegate Conference, for early closure on Christmas Eve and New Year’s Eve Closure on Christmas Day, Boxing Day and New Year’s Day and no loss of pay for retail workers when stores are closed. “Council will write to large retailers in our district area and to the Stormont Executive requesting they support these demands.”  Trade Union Usdaw are campaigning for time off for retail workers in Derry and across the north of Ireland However, Cllr Brian Tierneytabled an amendment saying the motion should encourage dialogue between employers and employees as he had spoken with a number of workers this past week and was told that working the festive period should still be there for them to do. Cllr Tierneys amendment put forward the removal of the last paragraph of Cllr Harkins motion and replace it with: “Council will write to large retailers encouraging them to begin meaningful discussion with their employees around opening times on Christmas Day, Boxing Day and New Years Day.” In explaining his reasons for the amendment, Cllr Tierney said: “This motion states a lot of facts but from what I can see from the motion its Usdaws responses from its members across the north of Ireland. It doesnt tell me anything about retail workers from across this city and district. “Theres no doubt that the workers deserve this time off and theres no doubt they have worked hard right throughout the entire year. “But we dont actually knowretail workers across this city and district want these demands met. Ive spoken to retail workers over the last number of days who have told me that they take a benefit for working these particular days over Christmas. “A majority of them are getting double-time because the pay-cycle is so long over December that many people actually budget the double-time they receive for the following January. “By supporting the motion as it is, we could be taking that leline away. We are all for getting good terms and conditions for workers. “But they have to be terms and conditions that those workers want, not what Usdaw wants. We want and encourage employers to speak to their employees and come up with reasonable ways forward.” Cllr Harkin was not happy with what he saw as Cllr Tierney diluting his motion and responded in no uncertain terms his anger at the amendment. He said: “There is no level playing field here. What you have here are big corporations making tremendous amounts of money and not treating their workers properly – be that with low wages, forcing them to work far too many hours and making them work right through the festive period. “I think what the SDLP are saying here is absolute anti- union nonsense.Brianhas talked to a few people in Derry who say I am not sure about this. “The entire trade union movement across the northis backing this demand from Usdaw. Theyve been campaigning for it for years. “Ive talked to lots of workers who tell me all the time that they hate the fact that they have to work right through the Christmas period. “The demand actually makes it clear that workers who are scheduled to work should suffer no loss of pay. Thats a demand we have to take to these corporations. “We have to send a clear message to the bosses that they need to start treating their workers a lot better. “Thisis trying to appease the employers and make it seem like workers are happy to be working at six am on Boxing Day. “This just seems to me that the SDLP are saying that they know better than the entire trade union movement across the north. Usdaws demand has been supported by every trade union in the north of Ireland. “The amendment doesnt have my support as it loses the point.” Cllr Gary Donnellyalso voiced his opposition to the amendment adding: “I had no problem with the motion as it stood until the SDLP tried to ride two horses here by bringing in a half-a-loaf anti- union amendment. And this from a so-called Labour party. Its not even surprising.” The amendment was voted on and the SDLP amendment was passed by  to  – with eight votes from unionist members being pivotal in carrying it through. Despite the amendment being accepted, Cllr Harkin did not withdraw the motion. He said: “This motion can still send a clear message to employers because the demands havent been stripped out by the SDLP and the DUP. They havent stripped out that Usdaw did do a survey on this. “Trade unions are attempting to campaign for a better deal for ordinary people. But its going to be hard and its going to be harder because political parties are not willing to actually stand up to corporations. “They are willing to have a very blaseacute approach to workers rights and I think we have to start being clear that patting people on the back and thanking them for being there during the pandemic just doesnt cut it anymore. “People deserve to see real gains but those gains arent just going to be gted to them. They are going to have to be fought for.” The motion with the amendment was passed unanimously by Council.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please just kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeMan to stand trial on rape and sexual assault charges overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Available exclusively in Attitude Black paintwork, the new Sport Black Edition brings a distinctive sporty look to Toyota’s fth-generation RAV, and is available in front-wheel-driveguise only.  googletag.cmd.push   However, for buyers looking for the added security of an all-wheel-drivedrivetrain in their new RAV, there is the option of AWD in Sol, Sport and Platinum iants, while the entry-level Luna model is FWD only.Petrol Electric PowertrainLike every iant in the RAV range, the Sport Black Edition is powered by a .-litre four-cylinder petrol-electric hybrid powertrain, which produces bhp and Nm of torque and enables the five-seat family SUV to sprint from -km h in just over  seconds. Standard across the entire RAV range is a suite of safety features which offer maximum protection for all occupants, while providing the RAV driver with the latest technology in driver assistance systems.         Collectively called Toyota Safety Sense  , features include Pre-Collision Assistance , Speed Assistance , Lane Keepingand Automatic High Beam Assist.Gracious Exterior, Spacious InteriorThe exterior design of the new RAV is more appealing and less anonymous that its predecessor, and this is gained by way of boxy wheel arches, a squared-off nose with a large grille, and angular edges and creases in the bodywork. I feel that Toyota has done a great job of making the new RAV look and feel more ‘premium’ than ever, while also offering more interior space than any of its predecessors.Cabin quality is exceptional, with sturdy and durable materials used throughout, while overall passenger space is generous in every respect. This has been made possible by placing the front and rear axles mm further apart than before, and even tall adults will be able to sit in the rear seats comfortably, with plenty of legroom and headroom on offer.The RAV’s battery is located under the floor, but its boxy dimensions help to hide it well, with a slightly higher boot floor the only clue to what lies beneath.Compared to its predecessor, the RAV’s boot capacity has grown to -litres , with a massive ,-litres available when the rear seats are folded down.The RAV was awarded a full five stars by Euro NCAP in  and that was thanks in part to an upgrade to the second-generation of Toyota Safety Sense for the latest model.Test CarMy test car was a RAV Sport Black Edition which drew lots of admiring glances due to its terric road presence and distinctive design details.An impressive array of standard equipment includes TEX leather black upholstery with heated front seats, powered driver seat, auto-dimming interior mirror, front and rear parking sensors, rear view camera, auto lights and wipers, LED front light guide with daytime running lights, LED projector headlights, electrically operated boot door, ” Toyota Touch multimedia system, dual zone climate control, rear privacy glass, satellite navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, black headliner cloth, paddle sht, light blue ambient lighting, and illuminated entry along with many more comfort, convenience, safety and infotainment features.As is the case across all models in the RAV line-up, fuel consumption as low as .l km is achievable on a WLTP combined driving cycle, while Co emissions of between  and g kmensures low annual road tax in addition to low overall running costs.Toyota’s advanced hybrid technology ensures that the RAV’s petrol engine and electric motor combine seamlessly to deliver extra performance and outstanding fuel efficiency, while remaining ultra-smooth and extremely quiet when driving in electric mode.Toyota claim that up to % of the time you drive a Toyota Hybrid, you are in electric mode, with the added advantage that you never have to plug the car in to charge the battery.Toyota’s self-charging hybrid harvests the energy normally lost from deceleration and braking into a small battery. This unit doesn’t have enough capacity to propel the RAV alone for any considerable distance, but it does offer the convenience of being able to charge itself without any input from the driver.The RAV sits on Toyota’s New Global Architecture, which is also used in the Toyota Prius, C-HR and Corolla models. It brings big benefits in ride and handling, with more sophisticated suspension than the old model, so the RAV is capable of turning into corners with a surprising amount of poise and precision, with plenty of grip while resisting dramatic levels of body lean.The RAV’s CVTtransmission is smooth and slick in its operation, while a well-insulated cabin ensures that on-road refinement is top class. When travelling through towns and cities at low speed, the RAV’s electric motor is barely audible, with the engine shutting off entirely when stationary in traffic. At motorway cruising speeds, the RAV settles into a quiet hum, with only small amounts of tyre and wind noise getting through to the cabin.Verdict, Cost and WarrantyWith its unique and distinctive modern styling, faultless build quality, impressive tally of standard equipment and frugal petrol electric hybrid technology, the new RAV has all the necessary ingredients to comfortably fulfil the needs of a growing family.The new RAV Sport Black Edition represents great value. The new Toyota RAV is backed by a three-year ,km warranty, along with a five-year ,km warranty on hybrid components.Additionally, a hybrid battery warranty of up to an incredible -years is available upon completing an annual hybrid health check through Toyota’s nationwide dealer network.

Hyundai’s newest offering is an appealing small SUV, which slots into position between the new i and new Kona in terms of its exterior dimensions.Hyundai claim that the Bayon is a ‘small on the outside, big on the inside’ urban crossover SUV that is designed to make a lasting impression. Boasting best-in-class safety and connectivity features, the Bayon comes with lots of smart technology as standard.  googletag.cmd.push   Eye-Catching ProportionsWith its sharp lines and eye-catching proportions, the new Bayon really stands out from the crowd. Sleek and stylish, it elegantly combines Hyundai’s award-winning SUV heritage with a visually stunning interpretation of Hyundai’s new Sensuous Sportiness design language — defined by the harmony between proportion, architecture, styling and technology.The arrow-shaped headlamps and wide grille harmonise with the sleek air intake band and narrow LED daytime running-lights on top, to give the front a purposeful, unique look. A dynamic shoulder line provides visual drama to the Bayon’s sporty wedge-shaped profile while, at the rear, arrow-shaped LED rear lights are connected by a red accent line. Positioned far out to the sides, the rear lights enhance the visual impression of width.    The new Bayon is shorter, narrower and lower than its Kona sibling, but stands a fraction taller than the i supermini upon which it is based. While the Kona is offered with an all-electric version, the new Bayon is powered solely by a .-litre MPIfour-cylinder petrol engine across all iants.The ingenious MPI system injects fuel at each cylinder, allowing much greater control over how much fuel the engine burns, leading to impressive fuel efficiency.Well-Appointed Trim LevelsThe new Bayon is available in a choice of three trim levels, namely Comfort Plus, Executive and Executive with a two-tone roof. Standard features from entry level include a rear spoiler, roof rails, sports-style driver and passenger front seats, driver seat height adjuster, height and reach adjustable leather-wrapped steering wheel, air-conditioning, auto light control , temporary spare wheel, cargo net, multi- steering wheel controls, central door locking, Bluetooth, DAB radio, cruise control, and a tyre pressure monitoring system, along with a host of safety features for peace-of-mind motoring.Upgrade to the Executive trimand additional standard features include ” alloy wheels, chrome belt line finisher, body coloured bumpers, shark-fin ariel, aluminium foot pedals, heated front seats, heated steering wheel, automatic air-conditioning, automatic window defogging , power-folding electric mirrors, rear privacy glass, auto wipers, remote central locking, voice recognition, Android Auto  Apple CarPlay, ” audio display, .” LCD supervision cluster, USB charger, wireless phone charger, rear parking sensors, and a rear view camera with dynamic guidelines, along with additional safety tech.Test CarMy test car was a new Bayon Executive .litre MPI, which was finished in elegant Aurora Gray Pearl paintwork that compliments its strong SUV design.Producing PSand Nm of torque, the Bayon can reach km h in .-seconds, while ing up to .mpgon a WLTP combined driving cycle.A low Co emission figure of g km translates to annual road tax of just €.On the road is where the new Bayon really excels, with a terric mix of comfort, control, poise and precision on offer. Road imperfections are dealt with swtly, while noises and knocks from the suspension are well isolated from the cabin.For a relatively small car, the Bayon’s motorway refinement and stability are impressive, while the car corners keenly on twisty roads. A precise steering response ensures that the Bayon is a delight to drive around town, while the standard rear parking sensors and rear view camera in my test car made parking a doddle too.The family-friendly cabin space in the new Bayon is impressive, with rear legroom deserving particular praise.Interior storage comprises a of a deep glovebox, front and rear door bins that can accommodate a large bottle, and a flat shelf for a smartphone at the bottom of the well-constructed dashboard.Boot capacity of -litres can be transformed into a ,-litre space when the rear seat backs are folded down, while an intelligent trunk cover can be stowed away safely within the boot when not in use.The new Hyundai Bayon is available in a multitude of stylish exterior colours, along with the option of a two-tone roof and matching door mirror housings in Phantom Black to create a car perfectly matched to inidual taste. The new Bayon truly is ready to reach new heights in the competitive small crossover SUV market segment.Hyundai’s comprehensive -year unlimited mileage warranty comes as standard, as does a -year AA Roadside Assistance and Free Vehicle Health Check package.

Based on the A-Class of the time, Mercedes-Benz gave its smallest model some SUV flavour with clever body cladding and a raised ride height.  googletag.cmd.push   More SUV-Like Than EverLaunched in , the second-generation GLA also shares its DNA with the latest A-Class, but it gained a more traditional SUV shape. Standing cm taller than its predecessor, the new GLA’s wheel arches are more squared-off in shape and are clad in protective black plastic. Its wheelbase has also been increased to create more passenger space, while the wheels are pushed out to each corner, resulting in much shorter front and rear overhangs.Pitched directly against rivals like the BMW X and Volvo XC hybrids, the new GLA  e uses the same powertrain as the plug-in A-Class— a .-litre petrol engine and bhp electric motor, drawing power from a .kWh battery. The fuel tank in the GLA  e is located ahead of the car’s front axle, which leaves space under the boot to fit the hybrid battery. Importantly, this means that the GLA avoids the awkward box-shaped intrusion into the boot area seen in some plug-in hybrid cars.         Specication DetailsThe new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is available in a choice of two generously-equipped specication levels — Progressive and AMG Line — both of which come with standard features such as stylish five-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, parking sensors with reversing camera, LED high performance headlamps, Light and Sight package, hard-disc navigation, MBUX multimedia system, digital radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Seat Comfort package with heated front seats, automatic climate control, roof liner in black fabric, Mercedes-Benz emergency call system, galvanised steering-wheel gearsht paddles, Easy-Pack tailgate, Dynamic Select, acoustic ambient protection, Active Lane Keep Assist, and Speed Limit Assist, along with many more comfort, convenience and security features.Additional AMG Line specication includes lowered comfort suspension, AMG body styling, carbon-structure trim, ” AMG -twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, Artico leather Dinamica microfibre black upholstery, and AMG floor mats.Test CarMy GLA  e ‘Progressive’ test car was finished in Night Black paintwith contrasting Macchiato Beige Black Artico leather upholsteryfor maximum impact.With a % battery charge, my test car estimated its own electric range to be km’s. The car defaults to Hybrid mode when started up, so you proceed in zero-emission fashion at speeds of up to km h, as long as the battery has charge and you accelerate gently.When the petrol engine cuts in performance is strong, as it and the electric motor combine their power in a smooth and orderly fashion. With a combined power output of bhp and a mighty Nm of torque, the GLA  e can sprint from -km h in as little as . seconds, and can achieve a top speed of km h .The petrol engine only really makes its presence known when you ask for more performance, while neat handling and sufficient grip from the driven front wheels provides great confidence on the road. The car’s steering is light but direct, and the ride is more than comfortable enough to deal with rutted road surfaces and speed ramps with ease.Cabin space is impressive, with excellent head, leg and elbow room available for all occupants, while a -litre boot capacity will be more than adequate for most families. However, the GLA’s standard split-folding rear seat backs allow for the transportation of larger items when called upon, with up to ,-litres of space on offer in this mode.The cabin of the new GLA certainly feels vastly improved over the original GLA in every respect. This has been made possible by the latest Mercedes-Benz MBUX interior layout, with crisp digital displays replacing the analogue instrument dials and flowing across onto the dashboard.Buttons have been largely replaced by a controller ahead of the gear-lever and voice control, which uses articial intelligence similar to that found in home smart devices to recognise more natural speech and commands. The turbine air vents from the original GLA have been retained, but the dashboard has been slimmed-down for a more spacious feel.VerdictOverall, the new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is a competent all-rounder that offers a decent electric range, low emissions, predictable handling and a luxurious, technology-filled cabin — encased in a stylish and practical premium compact SUV body.

The comments were made during a Government press conference on Tuesday October th, after the announcement of the countrysrevised reopening plan, where Taoiseach Micheaacutel Martin confirmed all of the restrictions set to ease from Friday,  October and the restrictions that will remain in place. googletag.cmd.push The pandemic isnt over yet. Unfortunately, were going to have to get through at least another winter before we can safely say that its behind us, Varadkar said at the press conference. The situation took a turn for the worse about two or three weeks ago and since then, weve seen rising case numbers, rising hospitalisations and rising ICU numbers.So, were not where we hoped to be or expected to be for  October... were not past the peak of the Delta wave. Later in the press conference, he said the government would be meeting with unions and employer representatives to update the Work Safely Protocol.     Well have that done over the next couple of days and essentially what were saying is that a staggered and phasedto the office is possible, he explained. So, people going back to the office for a specic business purpose, like a meeting or a training, for example, or inductions - that is allowed. But certainly people who can work from home and want to continue to work from home, their employer should facilitate that. But bear in mind, there are also people whove been working from home with a laptop on a bed for  months now and they really want to get back to the office. Andthat can be facilitated,they can be in an office on their own or in an office where theyre socially distanced from other people, that should be facilitated too.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall.

Saturday will mark the Derry mens first final since , with three of the current squad – Kevin Nixon, captain Paul Melaugh and Joe Gallagher all featuring in the title success. googletag.cmd.push After overcoming Magilligan and Moneymore, manager Ciaran Wilkinson says the group are wearing the underdogs tag comfortably. “They are massive favourites, and theyre not massive favourites for nothing,” he said. “Were well aware of what were up against, but we always like being underdogs. Thats when we perform. “We like to prove people wrong were a product of our own environment, but we respect who we are playing. “Theyll respect us too. Were not there just to make up the numbers or for a day out.” The semi final evidenced Wilkinsons words, as Dolans shook off a cagey start to power home with composure and verve.     CAOLAN MCCOSKER Caolan McCoskers line breaking, Kevin Nixons movement, and a touch of class from Odhran McKanes finishing helped them to a four-point victory. The forwards are joined by a defence eager to get involved, and the energy from corner backs Ruairiacute Thompson and Ryan McLaughlin was noticeable the last day out. There was elation after the final whistle in Ballinascreen. “All year weve talked about the next game, but they just felt the buzz of making the final, because nobody gave us a snf at the start of the year,” he said. “They were delighted, after the effort they put in, that they were getting a final out of it. If we can get off to a far better start in the final, like we have in some games, well be harder to beat.” The Dolans manager has seen plenty of Desertmartin. “They work it to their shooters and work on the loop, so we have to find a way of stopping it,” he said. “Well keep watching them and pass that onto the players, seewe can come up with something. Its one thing noticing it its another putting something in place to stop it though.” KEVIN ONEILL Big Brother works both ways, and Desertmartin have had their eye on Sean Dolans as well. “They are a physical team and have very strong runners as well,” said manager Kevin ONeill. “We have to find the best way to counteract their positives. We show teams respect and plan as best we can for them and thats what we did with Craigbane.” The south Derry side will be without corner back Ryan McGuckin, who suffered an injury towards the end of the semi final, while Marty Breen and goalkeeper Aidy McGuigan are also doubtful. ONeill presides over a squad who relieved the pressure of a long famine earlier this year by winning their first adult title since . “It was huge to get over the line in that final because of how long its been since Desertmartin had any success at that level,” he said. “In that game, the nerves were to the fore, and having watched it back, our performance probably wasnt that great to be honest. “We got over the line and that was the main thing. The focus now this year is to try and do themselves justice and theyve done that so far. “Having won last years final, it probably takes a wee bit of the edge off, but you have to constantly remind them they have to back up what was done as well.” DESERTMARTIN WON THE  TITLE EARLIER THIS YEAR Desertmartin have set about their bid for a second consecutive title in some style. Racking up of - in championship action compared to Dolans -, they are in fearsome form. Eunan McElhennon and Ryan McEldowneys runs from deep cause panic in defences, with the precocious Lachlan Murray and experienced Enda McGuckin leading the attack. With the taboo subject of an Ulster run hanging in the air, manager ONeill has had a job keeping a lid on some more giddy expectations within the club. “The chairman said to me that Desertmartin have never played in Ulster, so there are people thinking along those lines,” he said. “We cant get too far ahead of ourselves, and my job is to keep their feet on the ground and prepare for this final,” he added. Both sides know each other well, have their homework completed and ready to hand in on Saturday afternoon. However, there is only one gold star available, and as in any championship match, a battle will be required.

They lost heavily to the city side at the group stage, finding themselves on the wrong end of a - to - drubbing in between victories over Ballymaguigan and Lissan. googletag.cmd.push In a Halloween date with Steelstown, manager Karl Diamond is expecting to have to quell fireworks in the opposition forward line. “They have four or five marquee forwards, which not a lot of clubs at intermediate level would have,” he said. “You have a real top quality forward line and well find it dficult to hold those boys. We played them last year in the league section. “Theyd only half a team out and they beat us comfortably, and then they beat us again in the league section this year by ,  points. “Itll probably be a step too far, but well give it a rattle.”     Diamond can point to a number of dangerous forwards of his own, with Cormac Quigley and Richard King joined by Ruairiacute Hasson and John Butcher. Cormac Quigley will be crucial for Limavady. Full forward focal point Quigley pillaged - against St Marys last time out, with Richard King registering -. Both will be key to the Limavady effort, as the underdogs will need to hurt Steelstown with every opportunity that comes their way. Limavady will be sweating on the fitness of Aaron McGregor and John Butcher as they bid to reach their first intermediate final since , but the vibes are good on Roeside at present. “Its a massive club. With the number of chimney pots around Limavady, it should be punching a lot higher than it actually is,” said Karl Diamond. “There is a nucleus of five or six within the club who are driving it hard. They are as passionate about football in Limavady as they are in Bellaghy, but passion doesnt do it alone. “Were not short of talent, but playing junior football doesnt give you the know-how to play top level games. “It was a big bonus to get out of junior football and hopefully next year well compete better and have the good training of B football. “It [the Faughanvale win] defnitely gave them a lt. Weve worked very hard all year and a lot of things just seemed to click for us on the day. “I suppose the shock was in the result, not from the performance on the day. We totally outplayed Faughanvale and they maybe came into the game taking it for granted a bit. Hugh McGrath “They are a good side and we caught them on the hop, but were well capable of performing at that level and we need to carry on doing so.” Steelstown have experienced the ultimate stage as recently as last year, when Greenlough inflicted the heartbreak of their third final loss. Manager Hugh McGrath has reported a clean bill of health, and said the quarter final win over bogey team Castledawson was a means to an end. “Theyve been a team weve always had an issue getting past. Are we happy with our performance on the day  Absolutely not,” he said. “These things are about getting over the line and getting into the semi final, not about how pretty it is.” Ben McCarron proved vital to their success last time out, hitting -, and led by the experienced Neil Forester, Steelstown weathered a late storm to see them home. McGrath praised his sides resilience in the face of past disappointment. “We have a very good bunch and not a lot fazes them,” he said. “Weve been knocked back before, its never been an issue getting back up and going again. This season has just proven that the guys have a lot of heart and determination to eventually get over the line.” He is wary of the threat posed by their opponents, who he watched dispose of Faughanvale in the semi final. “Its not the semi final we thought we were going to get, but It will be a test for us, and we have to work very hard to end up on the right side of it.” VERDICT: STEELSTOWN CHAMPIONSHIP STATISTICS: ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please just kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeMan to stand trial on rape and sexual assault charges overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

They lost heavily to the city side at the group stage, finding themselves on the wrong end of a - to - drubbing in between victories over Ballymaguigan and Lissan. googletag.cmd.push In a Halloween date with Steelstown, manager Karl Diamond is expecting to have to quell fireworks in the opposition forward line. “They have four or five marquee forwards, which not a lot of clubs at intermediate level would have,” he said. “You have a real top quality forward line and well find it dficult to hold those boys. We played them last year in the league section. “Theyd only half a team out and they beat us comfortably, and then they beat us again in the league section this year by ,  points. “Itll probably be a step too far, but well give it a rattle.” Diamond can point to a number of dangerous forwards of his own, with Cormac Quigley and Richard King joined by Ruairiacute Hasson and John Butcher. Cormac Quigley will be crucial for Limavady. Full forward focal point Quigley pillaged - against St Marys last time out, with Richard King registering -. Both will be key to the Limavady effort, as the underdogs will need to hurt Steelstown with every opportunity that comes their way. Limavady will be sweating on the fitness of Aaron McGregor and John Butcher as they bid to reach their first intermediate final since , but the vibes are good on Roeside at present. “Its a massive club. With the number of chimney pots around Limavady, it should be punching a lot higher than it actually is,” said Karl Diamond. “There is a nucleus of five or six within the club who are driving it hard. They are as passionate about football in Limavady as they are in Bellaghy, but passion doesnt do it alone. “Were not short of talent, but playing junior football doesnt give you the know-how to play top level games. “It was a big bonus to get out of junior football and hopefully next year well compete better and have the good training of B football. “It [the Faughanvale win] defnitely gave them a lt. Weve worked very hard all year and a lot of things just seemed to click for us on the day. “I suppose the shock was in the result, not from the performance on the day. We totally outplayed Faughanvale and they maybe came into the game taking it for granted a bit. Hugh McGrath “They are a good side and we caught them on the hop, but were well capable of performing at that level and we need to carry on doing so.” Steelstown have experienced the ultimate stage as recently as last year, when Greenlough inflicted the heartbreak of their third final loss. Manager Hugh McGrath has reported a clean bill of health, and said the quarter final win over bogey team Castledawson was a means to an end. “Theyve been a team weve always had an issue getting past. Are we happy with our performance on the day  Absolutely not,” he said. “These things are about getting over the line and getting into the semi final, not about how pretty it is.” Ben McCarron proved vital to their success last time out, hitting -, and led by the experienced Neil Forester, Steelstown weathered a late storm to see them home. McGrath praised his sides resilience in the face of past disappointment. “We have a very good bunch and not a lot fazes them,” he said. “Weve been knocked back before, its never been an issue getting back up and going again. This season has just proven that the guys have a lot of heart and determination to eventually get over the line.” He is wary of the threat posed by their opponents, who he watched dispose of Faughanvale in the semi final. “Its not the semi final we thought we were going to get, but It will be a test for us, and we have to work very hard to end up on the right side of it.” VERDICT: STEELSTOWN CHAMPIONSHIP STATISTICS: ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please just kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeMan to stand trial on rape and sexual assault charges overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

And so it proved. St Patricks are back in the last four for the second year running under the tutelage of Bradley and Antrim native Kevin Brady. googletag.cmd.push The Loughshore side have hit an impressive  goals in championship football, winning all but one game a group clash with Dungiven. Joint manager Kevin Brady says the scores are a sign of the players footballing intelligence. “The boys have taken the goals well and the boys themselves on the field sense when a goal opportunity is on,” he said. “We have quite smart players in that regard, and so far, they have executed them well. They will probably be fewer and farther between in terms of the chances that Glen will give us. “Weve unearthed another couple of players, not necessarily young players, but guys who are early to mid-s who might not have been making the senior team previously.     Loup manager Paddy Bradley. “Theyve taken their chance. Some players have seen that was the case last year and a few other fellas have stepped up and staked their claim for a place.” That progress will be needed as they prepare to take on Watty Grahams. The  finalists misfired in last years championship, exiting to fierce rivals and eventual winners Slaughtneil at the quarter final stage. Glen have set about righting that wrong with a vengeance and showed their intent in appointing Malachy ORourke as manager. They have amassed a - championship haul over five games, with goals from Paul Gunning and Conleth McGuckian easing them past Swatragh in this years quarter final. It is a side sprinkled with talent and the mercurial Conor Glass and Ciaran McFaul at its heart, and the conveyor belt has created a cohesive blend of youth and experience. Terence OBriens renaissance has had a big impact for Loup, and the big midfielder fired home a goal in the win over Bellaghy. Midfield partner Paddy Coney also chipped in with a goal in that game, and the ever-present trio of Anthony ONeill, Ciaran Devlin and Caolan Devlin are a handful for any defence. Defensively, the lads from the Glenshane have the edge, conceding -to Loups -throughout the championship, but the figures suggest it could be an open game. Malachy ORourke is in charge of Glen. Kevin Brady says thats not necessarily the case. “Hopefully it will be an entertaining game from a neutral point of view,” he said. “Glen certainly put you under a lot of pressure. You dont really get any time to catch your breath, so I expect it to be high intensity. “Its sometimes hard to know. A goal going in at some point can make the other team come out and play. “Hopefully the disappointment of last year will spur our boys on to go one step further and make the final this year.” The bookies will certainly favour Glen, but Loups traditionally attack-minded managerial duo will be relishing a chance to lock horns with Malachy ORourke in the heat of championship battle. The Owenbeg pitch is in better condition than it has been in previous years, and will help create firm enough underfoot conditions for both these sides to serve up an entertaining battle. Loup have managed an average of three goals per game, and this game could well all come down to how well Loup manage to balance the guages of risk and reward on Sunday evening.

Greyhound racing willto the venue, which has been closed since August , under its new owners, The Lford Greyhound Racing Club . Contracts were signed this week and Derry Now understands that a date of March ,  has been pencilled in for theof racing at the border venue. The news is welcomed not just by sporting enthusiasts in the area, but the venues impending reopening also serves as a signicant employment boost. googletag.cmd.push In June, Greyhound Racing Irelandapproved Lford’s application for a licence. A signicant investment into the stadium reopening came from the UK Tote Group, who will also operate at the stadium. The new owners are made up of a group of businessmen from England and Ireland with greyhound enthusiast Harry Findlay said to be the driving force.  Earlier this year, it emerged that Paul Lawrence, the former Crayford racing manager, and Lorraine Sams, an ex-GB Greyhound Board stipendiary steward, were to head up the management team having agreed terms with the consortium, who purchased the stadium from the Duffy family. The Stadium, which underwent a €million refurbishment in , was put up for sale in , tagged with a €.million price. In August , the traps were closed for the last time, the owners citing a lack of support from the sport’s hierarchy. Lford Stadium was first opened in  and the . acre site includes a -seater restaurant overlooking the track. The  Indecon Report, which identied Lford among the tracks for closure, said: ‘An important point to note is that there may be opportunities for inidual stadia to continue to operate without IGB prize money or with lower fundingthey can generate resources from sponsorship, fundraising or local support, or sufficiently reduce costs.’ The new owners have already confirmed that they will be in a position to operate without a reliance on government funding.

Greyhound racing willto the venue, which has been closed since August , under its new owners, The Lford Greyhound Racing Club . Contracts were signed this week and Derry Now understands that a date of March ,  has been pencilled in for theof racing at the border venue. The news is welcomed not just by sporting enthusiasts in the area, but the venues impending reopening also serves as a signicant employment boost. googletag.cmd.push In June, Greyhound Racing Irelandapproved Lford’s application for a licence. A signicant investment into the stadium reopening came from the UK Tote Group, who will also operate at the stadium. The new owners are made up of a group of businessmen from England and Ireland with greyhound enthusiast Harry Findlay said to be the driving force.  Earlier this year, it emerged that Paul Lawrence, the former Crayford racing manager, and Lorraine Sams, an ex-GB Greyhound Board stipendiary steward, were to head up the management team having agreed terms with the consortium, who purchased the stadium from the Duffy family.     The Stadium, which underwent a €million refurbishment in , was put up for sale in , tagged with a €.million price. In August , the traps were closed for the last time, the owners citing a lack of support from the sport’s hierarchy. Lford Stadium was first opened in  and the . acre site includes a -seater restaurant overlooking the track. The  Indecon Report, which identied Lford among the tracks for closure, said: ‘An important point to note is that there may be opportunities for inidual stadia to continue to operate without IGB prize money or with lower fundingthey can generate resources from sponsorship, fundraising or local support, or sufficiently reduce costs.’ The new owners have already confirmed that they will be in a position to operate without a reliance on government funding.

AlthoughHannah Peel loses both the NI Music Prize AND The Mercury Music Prize you can safely assume that the Irish music scene has imploded. googletag.cmd.push Incidentally, Andrew McGibbon’s Northern Gothic was the best album released in the last year, including re-released eps, Waldorf  Cannon’s We Are Your Government was the best single. There haven’t been any new bands apparently to contend with nor was there any live acts to mention…but were there in   Anyway. Stendhal. For some unknown reason people tend to review bands at festivals and neglect the organisation. John once said: “The first festival back felt a bit magical. Before the event, setting up it felt like the whole placewere sitting simmering to deliver something very special. “Everyone who turned out, be it artists audiences or crew, just got into the spirit of what it was and how much it meant after a long  months. July’s instalment of Stendhal Festival was a success on several dferent levels. From finally being allowed to provide artists a live  to a captivated responsive crowd, bringing much needed economic benefit to the local area which depends so much on tourism, to helping find a way forward for the events industry in a post pandemic environment. The team at Stendhal have again done the event proud in their endeavours to find a balance in providing a safe yet welcoming environment. “On a personal note, being able to see the excitement of the artists, festival heads and families over the course of the weekend brought a smile to my face”. And Colm O’Donnell once added “After a long  months, July’s instalment of Stendhal Festival was a success on a number of dferent levels. From finally being allowed to provide artists a live  to a captivated responsive crowd, bringing much needed economic benefit to the local area which depends so much on tourism, to helping find a way forward for the events industry in a post pandemic environment. With those in attendance noticeably enjoying theof live music to the farm, it’s made the work behind the scenes worthwhile. “The team at Stendhal have again done the event proud in their endeavours to find a balance in providing a safe yet welcoming environment. On a personal note, being able to see the excitement of the artists, festival heads and families over the course of the weekend definitely brought a smile to my face.” Following their ambitious endeavour in producing two covid compliant music festivals in , Stendhal Festival has announced that it will be ing to the one festival format in  and that their one festival will begin on the very last day of June , running to July nd. The two smaller events which instigated numerous social distancing protocols combined to create the largest gathering of tents at a music festival anywhere in Ireland in  and with that experience under their belts, the team behind the multi-award- winning event have decided that the best way to try and get back to normality is to press forward with one larger event for approximately , people. Festival Director Ross Parkhill explained: “Despite the dficulties, the uncertainties and all the additional rules and regulations we had to impose, both events in  went off really well and people really worked incredibly well with us to ensure that was the case. “Running two events provided big challenges for us but happily, as always, our amazing team rose to the occasion twice and more people camped at a music festival at Stendhal than anywhere  on the Island of Ireland this year, something we can really be proud of.” Ross continued: “Going forward though, to continue with the model of two smaller events would not be practical for us and we are confident that people are a bit more confident themselves now about ing to large scale outdoor gigs, as witnessed at a number of events in Belfast throughout September. “With that in mind, with the eradication of social distancing rules for outdoor spaces and with plenty of lessons learned from our events in , we are confident that we canto our usual event set up in  and safely welcome over , patrons to the farm once again.” Super Saver Early bird tickets for Stendhal  will be on sale on October thth at pm and will be available until January th, when the organisers are hoping to make their first batch of line-up announcements. “By moving the event forward by about  weeks we have to hit the ground running,” added Ross, “we also don’t have any major uncertainties aboutwe can run or not next year so expect us to have plenty of info regrading Stendhal  out early in the new year, when we will also be opening our annual artists submission process.” For tickets and more info regarding Stendhal Festival , visit www.stendhalfestival  Magee on Music: London Calling with Derry-born Stephen McLaughlin  Kevin Magee speaks with Derry-born and London-based artist Stephen McLaughlin    Magee on Music: New Sounds with Conor Cummings  Kevin Magee speaks with Derry based singer Conor Cummings    Magee on Music: Not Peter Gabriel  Kevin Magee speaks to Derry band members Invaderband on the upcoming launch of their new album  ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please just kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeMan to stand trial on rape and sexual assault charges overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

The replica kits were brilliant even though the shorts were a wee bit too long for my liking, said Tollymore club chairman Adrian Howard.ldquoOur guys really got into the spirit of things with the  moustaches and at one point I thought history was repeating itself with the teams locked at -. But it wasnrsquot to be with the English boys winning -.After such a wet and dismal start to last week, Donard Park was bathed in sunshine for the match and despite all the best laid plans, the England team was delayed on route from the airport.However, this gave Mr Lewis the opportunity to meet some volunteer coaches and officials from the Tollymore club. He chatted to coaches Simon Thornton and Dr Gavin Devlin about their involvement with the club and volunteering in general.Mr Lewis also met Seamus Heath and Mark Hughes, from the NI Veterans team who were involved in organising the fixture.The project is one of  funded through the Shared History Fund which supports groups to mark the Centenary, in a thoughtful, inclusive and engaging way.The Tollymore Club has been working on its project since October last year and was very pleased to hear that it had been awarded funding to deliver the project and to date the ious events have been extremely well received.ldquoI would like to thank everyone for taking part and making this part of our project such a success, in particular, the guests for attending and Rob Manley of the Anchor Bar for providing gts for the Secretary of State, council chairwoman Cathy Mason and Darren Rice from Heritage Lottery NI, said Adrian.The Tollymore club presented a number of gts to the Secretary of State including a framed print of Newcastle, circa , provided by Mr Ivor Anderson. He also received a replica  England top and The Friend at Hand Irish Whiskey presentation box.Gts of The Friend at Hand Irish Whiskey were also made to the council chairwoman and Mr Darren Rice.Also in attendance at the event was South Down MLA Jim Wells, a huge Northern Football fan and regular attender at the teamrsquos home fixtures.The latest football match starring the veterans is a testament to how far the teams have developed over the past few years.Formed almost  years ago after Tollymore United organised a long running five-a-side football programme, the NI Veterans encourage men that had stopped playing regular football to get back playing.The veterans believe that age should not be a barrier to playing football and that there are incalculable health benefits, both physical and mental, to keeping active.Players ages range from rsquos through to rsquos with teams at over rsquos, over rsquos, over rsquos and over rsquos age groups.Every year the NI Veterans take part in a home internationals tournament with their English, Scottish and Welsh counterparts and travel to venues across the UK, with the home internationals played in a dferent country each year.Players meet their own travel and accommodation costs with Tollymore United offering their pitch for home fixtures and the Anchor Bar providing visiting teams with food and refreshments.Veteranrsquos football is huge in England and Wales with organised leagues and dozens of teams. It is also becoming increasingly popular in Europe with the NI Veterans having played European opposition.Last Fridayrsquos football match was the third of four events that the Tollymore club is delivering as part of their project.The first part of the project was a talk on the events leading up to lsquoThe Partition of Irelandrsquo with leading historian Dr Cormac Moore and took place in July.

In my opinion this does not appear to be consistent with the regulations which clearly suggest mph was more appropriate, but it is still a positive result after many years of campaigning.ldquoRoad Service Officials confirmed to me last January that the mph limit would be introduced this year and we have all been tenterhooks waiting delivery day.

It didnrsquot even rain on the day. All in all, it was a good way to start the season.The event included a full programme of junior racing so the atmosphere was buzzing by the time the seniors arrived at the Billy Neill playing fields in Comber.As the last junior race finished, the senior women swarmed to the start area. East Down AC was out in force with  females on the start list plus Wayne Giles by virtue of being in the Male  plus age group was in the same race.The runners were herded into pens to await the whistle and in fact when the race started two minutes early, some of the team were nearly caught on the hop as they were facing the wrong way getting their photo taken.Off they went at a pace across the level grass of the pitches stretching out quickly from a pack to a winding snake of coloured vests.They then turned sharply to get on to the hilliest section for the first time.This part is a gradual but leg sapping climb with the odd flatter bit for respite.Even after reaching the top, there are a few lumpy bits before a welcome downhill section. The runners then have a road crossing to contend with before sweeping round to the next loop.For women and male plus, it was three laps to make the k which meant three chances to try dfering techniques on the hill.At the end of the last lap there was an added cruel twist - a steep uphill to the finish which seemed primarily to be for the entertainment of spectators.It required huge reserves to push to the very end but the cheering onlookers provided the much needed encouragement with gusto.Caroline MacNabb led the team in with a gutsy run. She went out strongly and kept pushing to keep in contention. This earned her eighth overall in . and should encourage her that her consistent training is paying off.Catherine OrsquoConnor not far behind was forced to work hard for her tenth place coming home in  minutes exactly. This placed her first in her age category.Further back the rest of the team were all putting in the hard yards and finished in the following order: Sharon Madine , Wendy Findlay , Maureen Kelly and Janine Murray, who spent the entire race neck and neck, crossed the line together in ., Roisin Gaffney , Alison Carroll , Shauna McGreevyand Rachel Madine .Wayne Giles smiling as always placed nine  veteran men.The women had no time to relax as they took on the supporting role to pay back the shouts given by the EDAC men earlier. The men had an even bigger team.This level of participation is a sign of the numbers currently attending training. The club has definitely bounced back post Covid- and the enthusiasm to race is ing.Neil McCartan was out to show that his recent speedy . for K was no fluke so he was gunning for action.He along with a bunch of sharp shooters came out of the pens at a rate of knots, fighting to get away from the melee and make sure that they were not impeded in any way.Aaron McGrady also close to the front at the start was determined not to get sucked into a chase situation but found it hard to stay controlled when he saw the way the pack was breaking up.Neil ended up having to run solo as the top three were hammering on but to his credit he stayed solid and claimed a worthy fth place finishing in . for K.Aaron settled as per plan and worked his way through the field each lap ending up ninth overall .Gordy Graham wasnrsquot a fan of cross country before and hadnrsquot changed his opinion after but still managed to come th in ..The rest of the team streamed in not far behind.Neil Curran , Conaill MacNabb , Martin Willcox , Jonny Holmes , Barrie Atkinson , Dee Murray , Mark OrsquoConnor , Eamon Holmes , Seamus Savageand John Taylor .Cross country is definitely a dferent kettle of fish from a road race and many found that the iation in terrain made for an interesting outing while others found it an extremely hard session.The truth is that cross country is the most valuable way to pass the winter as it adds strength and stamina and the camaraderie almost makes up for the pain.Hopefully the turnout at Ballyclare in a couple of weeks time will show that that our members have been convinced of the merits.Declan Teague is continuing to push himself by completing multiple marathons in a short time frame.This weekend he headed to Kildare for his third crack at the . miles in five weeks. EDAC was well represented as Phillip Vint, completing his th marathon, and Dermot Cahill were also on the start list for the Thoroughbred Autumn Marathon.They had taken part in this event before but on a two lap route. This time it was one lap which was ldquotough enough according to Declan.He described it as rolling countryside and said that it felt like there was more up than down, with a bit of a headwind for good measure.On a positive note there were many plus points such as welcome sunshine and blue skies, plenty of support along the road, a great t-shirt and medal and best of all chicken curry at the finish.No wonder they recommend this race. All three men were pleased with their run. Declan set himself a target of : and worked hard up to  miles to give himself a cushion for the inevitable slowing after miles.His strategy worked well as he completed in three hours  minutes. Phillip Vint ran a commendable three hours  showing no repercussions from his recent efforts in the London Marathon and Dermot Cahill was pleased to lead the trio home in three hours .They were th, th and st respectively out of the  entries. A great showing on behalf of the club.Sam Anderson headed for Shanersquos Castle for the Championship Half Marathon to make the most of the long miles of training that she has put in for the recent Belfast full marathon.She might also have thought that she was escaping the mud of the cross country as the two events coincided.She was wrong though as overnight rain had left the estate very mucky and their mud was mixed with manure so it was a very smelly, sludgy . miles for Sam.With her usual stoicism, she coped with the adversity and came home smiling in two hours .On Sunday, the junior cross-country season got off with a bang at Billy Neill playing fields in Comber.It was the NI and Ulster Even Age Group Championships and there was a massive entry at all ages. Memories of the horrendous weather the last time it was hosted two years ago were still fresh in everyonersquos minds but it couldnrsquot have been more dferent.The sun shone, the wind was light and the ground was dry even though it had poured the night before.The East Down AC junior entry list was depleted over the days beforehand for a number of reasons but in the end the club had eight runners in five races.The runners were in age categories U-, U-, U-, U- and U- based on their age before the end of December .Luke Napier was first up running in the U- boys racewith his sister Cara running in the U- girls racejust after.Cara was also the clubrsquos only female junior running. This was their first race at this level and although they found the pace tough going they really enjoyed it and were excited to be part of an Ulster race with runners from all parts.Luke came nd out of  runners, the biggest junior field on the day, and Cara came th out of  runners.Alex Robinson, Finn Gibney and Freddie Ferguson were next with ,m in the U- boysrsquo race. As always the start was a mad stampede.As with the Napiers, Alex and Freddie were young in their category and it was Freddiersquos first race of this scale.At the finish Alex said he went off too hard but despite this he managed to come th out of  runners. Finn came th and Freddie st.As the runners get older the distance increases and so it was a tough ,m which faced the U- boys.Jacob Crawford and Oliver Robinson have been training hard over the last few months under the watchful eye of their coaches and race tactics were much discussed before the race.Ollie likes to lead from the front but was given strong advice to sit with the pack. He wasnrsquot surethat helped when he got hemmed in on the first shorter lap of the course in the big leading bunch.Jacob was wisely sat close to Ollie but managed to stay out of trouble. The U- race was the first to include a bigger lap which started with a long uphill section.Thankfully the wind was behind them for part of the lap as it had picked up a bit. This was Jacobrsquos first XC race for EDAC and he did the club proud coming th out of  runners.Ollie was just behind in th place with a sprint finish after struggling with a stitch for over half of the race. Last up for the juniors was MacKenzie Murray in the ,m U- boys race.He stayed resolute with the tough competition and came rd out of  runners. The standard at the age groups is high so all the EDAC Juniors should be proud of how they performed.As well as medals and podiums on the day, runners are seeking qualication for the All-Irelands either as an inidual or via slots based on the placing of their club or county.It is fantastic that as a result of their efforts that Alex Robinson and Finn Gibney , Jacob Crawford and Ollie Robinsonand Mackenzie Murrayhave all qualied to run for the County Down team in Santry Dublin on November .This All-Ireland event will literally take them to another level and is an exciting achievement.

work to repair Shrigley clock  ","story":"FRESH appeals have been issued for the restoration of the historic Shrigley clock, with Stormont communities minister Deirdre Hargey urged to step in to help put the tick back in the ageing structure.Owned by the Housing Executive, the Martin Memorial clock dates back to the Victorian era, with ious calls made over many decades for it to be restored to its former glory.The latest politicians to throw their weight behind the campaign are Strangford MLAs Michelle McIlveen and Harry Harvey who, in addition to raising the issue with Ms Hargey, have contacted Housing Executive chief executive Grainia Long.The housing body is responsible for the clock which had its bell and interior mechanism removed over three decades ago and placed in storage.Many are concerned to see the historic landmark falling into disrepair, but hopeful that it can be restored to be enjoyed for generations to come to reinforce its connection with the villagersquos industrial past.Shrigley was founded by the Martin family, who came from Pott Shrigley in Cheshire in  and who owned the spinning factory in the village.It was powered by water supplied from the nearby Clea Lough and while the mill mdash which is reported to have employed  people at one time mdash has long gone, the clock tower erected by the people of Shrigley in  in honour of the Martin family remains.Ms McIlveen mdash who is also the current Stormont education minister mdash said the clock which enjoys protected status and is one of the last remaining pieces of Victorian architecture in the village.She said while full restoration could be very expensive, there is a need to focus on what can be done in the interim to prevent further deterioration of the clock.ldquoIt is unacceptable that an old clock of this signicance and splendour should be allowed to fall into such a sad state of repair, she declared.Ms McIlveen said that previously, funding was provided for a conservation management plan by the Department for Communities Historic Environment Division which was developed on behalf of the Follies Trust.She said the report found that it would cost almost pound, to fully restore the Shrigley clock tower, a cost which the Housing Executive was unwilling to meet.Ms McIlveen and Mr Harvey said they have written to the housing body to not only highlight its public responsibility to maintain this listed property in its possession, but stressed the importance of the monument to the people of Shrigley:ldquoMonuments such as these are an important snapshot of our history and part of the fabric of our built heritage which should be cherished and protected said Ms McIlveen.ldquoWe have asked chief executive Grainia Long to outline what measures can be put in place ahead of a full restoration of the clock.The MLAs added: ldquoWhile I appreciate that full renovation works might be extremely expensive, it is very important that further deterioration of the monument does not occur.In a response to the Strangford Assembly members, Ms Long confirmed the clock is owned by the Housing Executive and sits on land transferred to it in the early s by the local council.She continued: ldquoThe condition of the monument has been raised with us and other agencies on a number of occasions and I can assure you that I appreciate the interest in our plans for it. ldquoHowever, while we have recently undertaken minor works to de-weed the monument and address any potential health and safety issues, it is our position that, at a time at which we have a signicant funding shortfall for investment in our tenantsrsquo homes, it would not be appropriate to use income derived from rents to fund the considerable costs that would be required to undertake a full restoration.The Housing Executive chief executive said that over the years, the organisation has explored options with others to secure the restoration and long-term sustainability of the monument but that these had proved unsuccessful.However, Ms Long said the Executive remains open to speaking to any interested parties and looking at any proposals.She added: ldquoThe establishment of a trust or the monumentrsquos disposal to, for example, a heritage organisation appear to be the best long-term courses of action and we would be happy to discuss these again with Newry, Mourne and Council and others..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27October2021_vandals.jpg","title":"Vandals target special school  ","story":"A SPECIAL

at Knockevin Senior School which recently opened at the site of the former Castlewellan Primary at Mill Hill.Following one recent incident, staff were forced to close the school.Attempts have been made to strip lead from the roof of the building and, more worryingly, drug paraphernalia has been found in the school grounds and in the vicinity of St Paulrsquos Church of Ireland church which is next door.Underage drinking in the school grounds has also been reported, while electrics and a satellite dish have also been damaged, with staff concerned about the risk the ongoing trouble poses to vulnerable students.Police have been asked to increase patrols and it has been confirmed that additional security measures are to be implemented, with politicians hoping that there are no further incidents during the Halloween holiday.The elected representatives, who have been liaising with Education Authority outreach workers and the anti-social behaviour committee attached to the districtrsquos Policing and Community Safety Partnership , have called for the Castlewellan trouble to end.They have warned that Halloween must not be used by troublemakers as an opportunity to step up their anti-social behaviour, appealing to those involved in recent incidents to show more respect to education and church properties.Slieve Croob councillors Alan Lewis, Roiacutesiacuten Howell and Cathy Mason mdash who have appealed to anyone who knows those involved in anti-social behaviour to contact police mdash say the trouble must stop.Cllr Lewis, the current PCSP chairman, has appealed to young people to stay away from Knockevin school and the nearby church. He said teenagers who are not a ldquopositive part of the Castlewellan community should remain at home.He visited the school last week where a Halloween party was in full swing and revealed he was disappointed to learn of further incidents of anti-social behaviour.ldquoOnce again, youths had entered the school grounds, climbed on the roof and attempted to remove led, with drug paraphernalia and empty medication packets also found, confirmed Cllr Lewis.ldquoMembers of St Paulrsquos Church leaving a service found empty pill boxes littering the area outside. The fact that a service was taking place did not put these people off and the mentality and lack of respect which is being shown is shocking beyond reason.Cllr Lewis said empty packets of Pregabalin are routinely found at the school and church and warned those who consume them are potentially at risk from blackouts or death.He added: ldquoThere is a fear that over Halloween that the anti-social behaviour will intensy and we hope that does not happen. I will be working with local council staff, police, youth workers and colleagues to ensure the Halloween period is quiet and appeal for a no-nonsense approach to this issue.Cllr Howell she and Cllr Mason recently visited the new school to welcome staff, pupils and parents to the Castlewellan community.ldquoI was deeply disappointed when contacted by the school last week to learn about the anti-social behaviour taking place in the grounds. In one incident, vandalism caused to the property led to the closure of the building, she confirmed.ldquoI am disappointed and frustrated that a small number of youths are causing these issues to a special school. I know first-hand the work and commitment that is put in to delivering the curriculum to the Knockevin children.Confirming that she and her colleague have raised these issues with the PSNI and asked for increased patrols in the vicinity of the school, Cllr Howell said she has also been liaising with Education Authority outreach workers and the PCSP to ensure everything possible is being done to alleviate the ongoing trouble.ldquoNo school should have to face these issues and I would ask for the wider community to be vigilant and report any activity of this nature to police as soon as they become aware of it, she added.Describing the Castlewellan trouble as ldquocompletely unacceptable, Cllr Mason said it will not be tolerated by the community in Castlewellan which is a safe and pleasant place to live.She added: ldquoThe management of the school have reported incidents such as underage drinking, damage to electrics and a satellite dish and roof tiles being broken, along with drug paraphernalia being left on the ground and a multitude of rubbish.ldquoStaff are understandably concerned about the potential risk to pupilsthey were to find any of these items, as well as the potential risk to the youths themselves on top of a school building..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27October2021_hinch.jpg","title":"Victory for ‘Hinch men  ","story":"THIS Intermediate League game started at a fast pace, with both teams wanting to retain possession.Although CI got the ball into the Hinch , the home side showed some great defending and quickly cleared the danger.Hinch continued to display some skilful hockey passing the ball around the back from Andrew Mulholland, Ray Coffey to either Ashley Brown or Craig Harkness on the wings.This enabled Hinch to tactically move the ball up the pitch, allowing Matthew Martin to have a shot on goal.Unfortunately, it went wide hitting the side of the goal while, at the other end, Aaron Donnell was on form in nets, saving any balls getting through the strong defence.During play, Coffey was able to find the back of the net, unfortunately he was just slightly outside the CI circle.The second quarter began with the Hinch men in defensive mode and able to keep the ball out of the net.As time progressed, they settled into the game and pushing the ball up the pitch towards Martin and Adam Dodds while there was some great passing across the back from Mulholland to Harkness across to Brown.The latter was able to work the ball up the pitch, passing to Jason Campbell who saw the opportunity to knit the ball across the CI goal, to be tapped in by the prolic Alex Millar.Quarter three began with Hinch gaining the first of several penalty corners, although were unable to break though the CI defence. aEnd to end play continued with each team determined to score.

It would be a travestythe rest of the world were to think that the service was reflective of opinion in NI. Photo by Jonathan Porter   Press EyeI, like many others, looked forward to a year of events during  that would appropriately mark the centenary of our country, Northern Ireland. Indeed, the selective, cherry-picked  chosen by the NIO to advise on this momentous year promised as much.Regrettably, and notwithstanding the unforeseen impact of the Covid pandemic, the actual outworking of the centenary commemorations has been woeful and downright insulting to the four generations who have worked to make Northern Ireland a successful and valued member of the United Kingdom over the past hundred years.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

My naive hope was that this would be in a large, national Cathedral namely St Anne’s in Belfast and that all sections of Northern Ireland’s communities would be able to attend and participate and collectively give thanks to Almighty God for preserving our nation despite the most despicable threats and attacks over that century.Instead, a small exclusive congregation, assembled under strict invitation only, to hear an hour or so of humbug. The scene was set in the very first sentence pronounced by the BBC presenter who advised us that this service was ‘to commemorate  years since the partition of Ireland ...’ There then followed an hour of homilies to political correctness in which the words ‘Northern Ireland’ were scarcely mentioned. At least three of the church leaders should be shamed of themselves for allowing this insult to our country and its centenary to be perpetrated. They should be aware of the deep hurt and offense that has been caused throughout Northern Ireland, not least in their congregations.In , as the then chairman of the Ulster Unionist Party I convened a committee of representatives of all the unionist parties and loyal organisations to consider and plan for a decade of centenaries. Through the hard work of many, exceptional commemorations were held to mark the centenaries of important events such as the  covenant and the Battle of the Somme. The events were attended by thousands of proud Ulstermen and women and were respectful and peaceful. We made a grave error however in leaving the organisation of our national centenary to those who from the outset refused to recognise the centenary of Northern Ireland as a cause for celebration.At the risk of being presumptive, I have written to the unionist leaders and others, to seek the reformation of the Centenary Committee to plan for a proper commemoration and celebration of Northern Ireland’s centenary. It would be an inexcusable travestythe rest of the world were to think that last week’s service were reflective of opinion throughout Northern Ireland.David Campbell, Co Antrim• Other reactions to the service below, and beneath that information on how to subscribe to the News Letter• Ben Lowry:Centenary church service should have celebrated Northern Ireland• Henry McDonald: Absence of Queen at centenary service was spun beyond credulity• John Cushnahan: To those who distorted nature of centenary service — Shame on you!• Billy Kennedy: Queen’s absence left a huge void at centenary service• Letter: I’m sorry the Queen is unwell but do not regret the fact she missed the Armagh service• Editorial: Armagh centenary service was not a celebration of Northern Ireland• Doug Beattie: Sinn Fein incredibly small-minded over NI centenary event• ‘Sinn Fein determined to start culture war with unionism’: Sir Jeffrey Donaldson——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

What’s it been like working with her “It’s completely dferent,” says Riley. “We used to all be in the same room together but because of coronavirus everyone’s off separately having their make-up done so we don’t see each other as much. We’ve not really done much team bonding.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...Rachel with her now husband Pasha Kovalev during rehearsals for Strictly Come Dancing in “Obviously, we had  years with Nickand we really knew each other. Sheis a completely dferent character.”For now, the -year-old maths whizz is understandably much more focused on motherhood. Her Russian husband Pasha Kovalev, erstwhile dance partner from Strictly in , has been fantastic with their toddler daughter, Maven, who turns two in December.“He’s the best dad in the world,” Riley beams. “He’s amazingly patient and will let me sleep in in the morning and look after her when I’ve been up working late.“He’s taken to being a dad like a duck to water. And Maven looks just like him. He goes to the soft play, the bouncy castle and the park – then I get home and he’s made dinner!”Rachel Riley has decided to remind us all how to ide and conquer once more, mostly by mastering long ision, fractions and alegbraThe presenter started dating Kovalev after orcing her husband, Jamie Gilbert, who was a fellow Oxford University student, in .Today, she is clearly still besotted with her professional dancer other half. “He’s the most unique person I’ve ever met. He’s such a chilled, calming influence. Nothing fazes him.”She’s planning to have her second baby at homeand isn’t intending on going on a massive drive toto her pre-pregnancy weight quickly.“I’ll be breastfeeding, so you need the calories. If you are losing it really quickly it just means you are probably not giving your baby what it needs. The weight comes off in its own time and I’ve got a whole range of dresses ready in dferent sizes for when I go back to work.”She’s still breastfeeding Maven, although she hopes that will subside in the New Year, and hopes to be back at work in January, she says.“When you have a newborn, and especially when you have a toddler as well, you don’t have time for a shower. So when I get back to work someone will be paid to do my hair and make-up. You don’t recognise yourself the first time you go back because you’ve just been in mum mode and haven’t washed your hair for a while.”She and her family live in London and also have an apartment in Manchester, where Countdown is filmed. Kovalev will look after the children while Riley is working on the show, taking the baby in for breastfeeding when she’s on a break.They don’t want any more children after the new baby, she says.“We only want two. You can fit two in the car, that kind of stuff. It was a maths decision,” she says, laughing.They married in Las Vegas in  when she was pregnant with Maven, she recalls.“My friend was taking a sabbatical in the States. She said she was going to Vegas and askedI wanted to come to see Robbie Williams. We said, great. Then, when I was four months pregnant, just before the trip, Pasha said, ‘Shall we get married next week ’ We found a little chapel and I bought my dress the day before the wedding.”This year Riley has written At Sixes And Sevens, a maths book for adults, featuring tips and tricks on how to navigate your way through the minefield of equations, formulas, fractions, algebra and BODMAS , among other conundrums.“I’ve always enjoyed making maths accessible and trying to demysty it, even when I was at school,” she says.Her acumen is clearly rubbing off. “My daughter has already started counting on her hands, one, two, three,” she enthuses. “And she can do it in Russian as well.”Riley, who grew up in Essex, studied maths at Oxford University and clinched the Countdown job pretty soon afterwards. As a top maths scholar, did she ever feel her brain could be better utilised than it is on a popular show “I enjoy what I do,” she says simply. “Being on TV has afforded me lots of opportunities and I’m lucky I get to use my maths background as an advocate for maths and science and numeracy.“Through programmes like It’s Not Rocket Science I get to meet people who want to break the land speed record with the fastest car in the world, I got to interview Tim Peake. I’ve got the background to give me enough confidence to interview these people.”For now though, she is having to take things a bit easier. While knowing that sleep deprivation is coming with the new arrival, she is trying to enjoy her Friday night treat – episodes of Ted Lasso, supporting Manchester Utd , going to the park and meeting friends and family.Riley and Kovalev don’t watch Strictly these days, but do keep in touch with some of her old Strictly cohorts, Sophie Ellis-Bextor and Deborah Meaden, and a while ago they went to Majorca to see Brendan Cole and his family.And though she might feel tired right now, Riley is also planning an energetic future for when she is ready: “Once I’m back on my feet, I’ll be ready for a new challenge,” she says.Thanks to Rachel you can master long ision and fractions once moreOn Countdown, Rachel famously replaced the long-serving fellow maths wizard Carol Vorderman. Like Vorderman, Riley’s role is to handle the placement of tiles on the board for the letters and numbers rounds and to find an exact solution in the numbers roundsthe contestants are unable to do so.Riley’s appointment to Countdown was announced at the same time as new main host Jeff Stelling replaced Des O’Connor the duo of Stelling and Riley was in place for the new series beginning in January .Although she had never had any ambition to become a television presenter, Rachel was encouraged to apply for the show by her mother, and decided to do so because she was interested in the numbers part of the game. Having beaten , applicants for the role, she said: “There’s only one cool maths job around and I was lucky enough to get it so I’m absolutely thrilled”.Since it was first broadcast on January , , Riley has also performed her Countdown role on the comedy crossover spin-off version,  Out of  Cats Does Countdown, alongside comedian and host Jimmy Carr, team masters Susie Dent and Jon Richardson and a revolving door of guest stars including Bob Mortimer, David Mitchell, Richard Aoyade and other comedy greats of our time. While Countdown is seen as a straight light entertainment show, in explaining the dference between the two, Riley sees Countdown as the role she is “happy for her grandmother to see”, while Cats Does Countdown is the more risqué, cheeky role which she shows to her friends.Her new book, At Sixes and Sevens, is described as “an engaging, accessible introduction into how numbers work and why we shouldn’t be afraid of them.”It’s designed for those of us who don’t know our fractions from our percentages, or what is adjacent to the hypotenuse on a triangle or exactly how to help your offspring with long ision since those brain cells very likely perished long ago.According to the blurb: “You won’t be At Sixes and Sevens for long. In this brilliant, well-rounded guide, Rachel Riley will take you back to the very basics, allow you to revisit what you learnt at school , build your understanding of maths from the get-go and provide you with the essential toolkit to gain confidence in your numerical abilities.”Sounds like a tome the less numerically literate could definitely benefit from reading -though flashbacks from the agony of double maths at school may ensue.At Sixes And Sevens by Rachel Riley is published by HarperCollins, priced £..Maven  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularFormer Ulster and Ireland rugby player David Tweed dies in motorbike crashBryson: DUP will collapse Stormont on two conditionsNI High Street Voucher: How long can it take to get spend local card and what to doyou havent received itQUB professor defends use of LucidTalk for public poll on ProtocolTUV leader Jim Allister asks what happened DUP’s October deadline for NI ProtocolMost PopularDonaldson: NI Protocol talks cannot be put on long fingerPeter Robinson: Sinn Fein finance minister’s fiscal policy is to hold out his hand for more UK cashTrial scheme in which councils will give people free money takes step closerTroubles amnesty: ‘This government has stabbed victims in the back’ says former UDR man whose big brother was killed by IRA‘So very wrong’: UDR families react to amnesty plan                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperCoronavirusMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPublic NoticesContact UsFree Happy AdsFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

I think this is why my we and I enjoy a nostalgic steam journey when we visit an area with a preserved railway, which we did recently.Although more modern engines are more efficient and cleaner, they seem to me to not have the raw power of a steam locomotive and particularly those that used to haul express trains.This book has made me think of the power we need to live in our journey of le.There may seem to be more modern ways of living with many ideas offered, but the nothing beats the power of God.It may seem old fashioned and nostalgic to think like this, but when I see Godrsquos power at work all other efforts pale into insignicance.The Bible shows Godrsquos power with Jesus healing people, raising the dead and feeding large crowds among other things.It was supremely shown when He died and rose again which is central to the Christian faith.That power is still at work today with countless lives changed when people have an encounter with Jesus and see His power at work on their behalf.We all need help in the journey of le and God is always there for us.May I suggest that we do what The Bible says this week:\"Ask where the good way is, and walk in it and you will find rest for your souls\"PhilipGet involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We have had great success with online bridge during the pandemic, but now we have reopened for Face-to-Face bridge our numbers are too small to be viable.Please come and support this historic club. However, letrsquos be positive. We are exploring merging our Tuesday and Friday evening sessions with another club.And,all fails, we will resume online bridge. Penarth Bridge Club will live on!So, here is a recent hand played at a Face-to-Face session where careful judgment by both declarer and the defence were required to achieve the optimum result.The AuctionNorth had seven spades and just seven points, ideal for a pre-emptive opening of three spades. The aim of pre-emptive bids is to put a spanner in the wheel of the defence.However, the danger always is that, as here, your partner has a good hand and so has a dficult decision to make on whether to pass or bid on for game. After some thought, South could see at least six spade tricks, evenhis partner did not have the king of spades.There were also two certain heart tricks, and it ought to be possible to rustle up a trick in diamonds and one more from Northrsquos hand. So, South bid four spades.The playTrick  ndash East was on lead and did not fancy a diamond or a club. And the jack of hearts lead was fraught with danger. So, interestingly, East chose to lead the five of spades, reasoning that his king was safe for a trickNorth held the ace.And evenSouth held three spades to the ace, North must surely have an entry somewhere to take the spade finesse. Anyway, declarer paused to consider the hand.Without the trump lead the contract would have been secure as he could have ruffed a losing club in dummy. But now things were dficult.North decided to play the ace of spades, hoping to drop a singleton king in Westrsquos hand. But no luck. Tricks  and  ndash Declarer then played a club to his ace, followed by a small club from hand, the trick being won by Eastrsquos king.East was now quite pleased he had decided to lead a trump at the first trick. Trick  - East won the next trick with the king of spades, preventing declarer from ruffing his losing club.Trick  ndash East then led his ace of diamonds, which was ruffed by declarer in hand. Trick  ndash Declarer drew Eastrsquos last trump with his queen, discarding a heart from dummy. But he could now see he still had a losing club and a losing heart, one down, having already lost two tricks.But could there be a squeeze on  Tricks , ,  and  ndash Declarer then rattled off his last four spades, forcing four discards from both East and West. East could see that dummy had to discard before West, so he jettisoned his remaining four diamonds, keeping the jack of clubs and two hearts.Declarer decided to discard one more heart and the rest of dummyrsquos diamonds. West had to hope his partner East held the jack of clubs, otherwise he was genuinely squeezed. So, he discarded the rest of his clubs, keeping his three hearts to the queen.Declarer then played a small heart to dummyrsquos ace. He followed this with the king of hearts. Bad luck, Eastrsquos jack dropped but not Westrsquos queen. Trick  - West then won the last trick with his queen of hearts, declarer only making nine tricks - six spades, two hearts, and one club, one down for a loss of  points.Four spades was a perfectly reasonable bid by South. But well done by the defence for the opening lead and care in their discards.What have we learnt . areful judgement is needed when responding to partnerrsquos opening pre-emptive bid, particularly when non vulnerable, since the pre-emptive bid is likely to be quite weak.. Sometimes it can quite be safe to lead a trump from three to king, as here.Penarth club resultsFriday  October: . Joy Seculer and Mike Downey. Peter Craig and Sean Macdougall.

Northern Ireland has experienced a .% increase in average rental values this year[]. With the price increase, OFTEC, representing the liquid fuel industry in Ireland, is concerned that students may take cheaper accommodation options without properly inspecting the property. With this in mind, OFTEC has issued advise to help students ensure their accommodation is safe before they sign the dotted line. Raise the alarm – Currently, it is not a mandatory requirement for private landlords to provide smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, but the HSENI recommend that they do. It is a legal requirement to fit a carbon monoxide detector when a fossil fuel appliance has been replaced. Carbon monoxide is potentially lethal as it has no smell, taste or colour. Without a working alarm, it is impossible to identy carbon monoxide leaks. OFTEC’s advise is to ensure that there are working fire and CO alarms in the property, and that they are tested on a regular basis.Heating requirements - The Health  Safety Executive recommend that all boilers should be serviced annually and tenants should ask for evidence of recent servicing. If you have concerns, ask for a CD  Landlord Oil Installation Check which is carried out by an OFTEC registered technician and will give you peace of mind. For a gas heated property, ask for a copy of the annual gas safety check.Look for damp – It is easy to hide damp patches with a coat of paint, soyour house smells musty or you see evidence of mould, find out how the landlord is planning to fix the problem. Mould has no place in the home as it can cause respiratory problems and headaches.Furniture and fittings – Ask the landlord for a list of everything that is included and make note of any damage that is there before you move it. Check any beds, sofas and chairs are in good condition.Secure your home – burglars may target student areas because of lax security. Ask your landlord to fit key operating locks on the windows and lever deadlocks on external doors.  OFTEC Ireland Manager, David Blevings, said: “Quite often the excitement of moving in with friends can overshadow the concerns about the accommodation itself. We are urging students to play it safe this year and carry out these essential checks before signing a lease and moving in. “Asking a landlord about safety may seem awkward, but it could prevent you from living in a potentially dangerous property for the next  months. It’s vital that your new home is not a burden as you start your time at university.
