Writing in The Mail on Sunday, Justin revealed his ‘shock and heartbreak’ and fears for the future. Today, in his own words, Sam, now 18, paints a resoundingly positive picture. And his father admits that he, too, is almost ready to stop worrying...  Sam\u0027s story I was recently flicking through some old photographs and found a picture of my eight-year-old self on a family holiday, standing by a swimming pool, my eyes squinting in the sunlight, chocolate ice cream spilled across my white shirt. I was grinning, unburdened and happy, as a child ought to be.Just a few weeks later I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, and everything changed.I’d been tired quite a lot. And, embarrassingly, I’d wet the bed a couple of times, which given my age, was a concern. I was constantly thirsty, and hungry.And so on one sunny day, with Christmas around the corner, I sat waiting to be seen in a doctor’s office.To persuade me to go without making a fuss, Dad promised me I wouldn’t have to have any injections.The rest of the day is a bit of a blur – although I do recall quite a few injections, which I wasn’t too happy about.A doctor said to me: ‘I’m really sorry, but you have type 1 diabetes.’I didn’t understand what I was being told, but I could see from the worried expressions on my parents’ faces that it was serious.          Without insulin, sugar builds up in the blood and causes damage. So we type 1 diabetics have to inject a synthetic version of the hormone after eating. And then there is the constant finger-pricking to draw the blood needed to test sugar levelsThere was a stuffy grey lift which stank of disinfectant, and when the doors closed, the sounds of the hospital – the beeping noises, the crying babies – were gone.A musical melody played in the background, my parents were squeezing my shoulders, and a nurse was with us. After a while she looked at me and asked: ‘Did you ever want to be a pilot anyway?’The tension broke. My parents laughed. ‘Not really,’ I told her, blushing slightly, as the doors opened, and the noises recommenced.Back in my bedroom, I remember thinking it was all over. It wasn’t, of course. Life changed, but it did go on. I slowly discovered more about my condition.My pancreas had packed up – doctors still don’t know why it happens – and so I no longer produced my own insulin, the hormone that helps the body’s cells use sugar for energy.Without insulin, sugar builds up in the blood and causes damage. So we type 1 diabetics have to inject a synthetic version of the hormone after eating. And then there is the constant finger-pricking to draw the blood needed to test sugar levels.It’s a balancing act. You need to take enough insulin to keep blood sugar normal because if it’s high, it starts to cause irreversible damage throughout the body.But if you inject too much, blood sugar can plummet. This is called hypoglycaemia, or a hypo. You feel very wobbly, and confused, and it can even lead to blackouts.Womb cleanses, healing drums and crystals... why do...Share this articleThis is why type 1 diabetics, it was later explained to me, weren’t allowed a commercial pilot’s licence. It is no longer a disqualifying factor – the law changed in 2012 – but I still don’t want to be a pilot.Since the age of about nine, I’ve used an insulin pump, which is an electronic gadget that’s permanently attached to me, delivering insulin as and when I need it, so I don’t need to inject myself.I don’t need to prick my finger all the time either, thanks to my Freestyle Libre, a tiny sensor stuck to my arm which sends my blood sugar levels, wirelessly, to an app on my mobile phone. The Prime Minister, Theresa May, who also has type 1 diabetes, has one too.Ten years on from my diagnosis, the condition doesn’t stop me from doing anything.When Mrs May announced she had type 1 diabetes, my dad wrote that she was proof I could grow up to be whatever I wanted to be, even the PM.And he’s right, but instead I’d quite like to be a writer, or a film director, or an actor.I’m taking a gap year right now, currently working to save up for a bit of travelling in January – where to, I’m not sure.Next year I’m going to read English literature with creative writing at the University of East Anglia.And life at university will have it’s challenges. For a start, I don’t eat pizza. I could if I wanted to. But pizza contains slow-release carbohydrates, which makes it harder to control blood sugar with insulin after eating it. So I tend to avoid it.I also don’t really drink alcohol, and I definitely don’t get ‘sloshed’. Alcohol puts a strain on the liver which has a knock-on effect on blood sugar control, causing it to fluctuate. Mixing booze with my insulin medication means there is a risk that I could have a hypo. If this happens at night, it can be particularly worrying.On the plus side, diabetes has forced me into making healthier decisions about what I eat, and what I avoid. But feeling disconnected from the social scene can be quite upsetting.My twin sister Martha lives a very different life to mine: she drinks and eats normally because she doesn’t have diabetes. It’s tough, but there is no escaping this disease.A close friend handed me a shot of tequila at a party recently and shouted: ‘Down it! Down it!’ I wanted to have fun, but I would be taking a huge risk.          A big part of managing diabetes is handling how other people feel about it, whether that’s friends who may or may not think I’m being boring, or my parents’ worriesI looked at my friend, and said ‘No thanks’, and gave him the shot. He looked disappointed, but I know I made the right decision.A big part of managing diabetes is handling how other people feel about it, whether that’s friends who may or may not think I’m being boring, or my parents’ worries.Thanks to the Freestyle Libre, Dad is also able to remotely monitor my blood sugar levels via his smartphone. I don’t see it as in invasion of privacy, or feel I’m being watched over.You see, I know I’m OK, but it helps him to know that too, which is a good thing. Once I’ve left home, he might stop, but if he doesn’t, it doesn’t bother me.It was strange to read the first piece my Dad wrote for this newspaper in 2009 about my illness.He feared for my future, which I never have.Treatment advances mean that this once fatal disease is now manageable with a bit of effort. Yes, there are days when it can feel almost impossible to deal with, but that just motivates me more in the end. Diabetes is a challenge, not a catastrophe. It is difficult, but never impossible.Perseverance is essential.  Justin\u0027s story He is still alive! And so are his parents, though only just. Ten years after Sam’s diagnosis, a young adult is ready to leave home and ready to find his way in the world. And my wife Sarah and I are ready for a rest.Not a physical rest. Sam has looked after himself for years now. But mentally: from the constant out-of-one-corner-of-the-eye monitoring, chivvying, worrying. You cannot help yourself: ‘What’s your blood sugar number?’ ‘Is that a bit high, or a bit low?’ ‘How many carbs in a peach?’I said in my piece for this newspaper all those years ago that a chronic illness in a child changes everything, and it does. It tightens something inside you that can never be loosened again.I also said that I was all too aware that other parents have received worse diagnoses.And after ten years of coping with Sam’s condition I am even more aware that, as he puts it, type 1 diabetes is a challenge, not a catastrophe.I talked about a cure. Well, there is no cure and, frankly, little prospect of one in Sam’s lifetime.But (and it’s a huge but) as Sam says, there is massive progress on the kit and caboodle that can help you cope with type 1 and control it in a fashion that gives a more decent chance of a long and healthy life. So there is progress.And we have brought up a boy who has a sense of humour and a love of literature and travel a boy who must struggle to keep well and has much more to cope with than most young men, but who is not defined by his condition.Ten years ago, if I could have settled for this, I would have taken it like a shot. Here’s to the next ten. And if you have type 1 diabetes in your life: good luck. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/21/00/517848FE00000578-6298871-The_couple_will_present_medals_to_the_winners_of_the_cycling_com-a-373_1540077653075.jpg","title":"Prince Harry Meghan Markles packed schedule Day 1 Invictus Games","story":"Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will spend Day 1 of the Invictus Games watching the cycling and sailing competitions, and meeting with leaders from mental health and support services for veterans          The couple will present medals to the winners of the cycling competition, before ducking off for a private lunch at the Pavilion restaurant in The Domain After this official reception, held at the Pavilion restaurant in The Domain, the couple will board a family and friends boat in Farm Cove to watch the Invictus Games sailing final.The day will end with a private function at Government House to celebrate the Invictus Foundation. Thomas Markle: When I heard my daughter Meghan\u0027s baby news...Harry shares his and Meghan\u0027s \u0027personal joy\u0027 of forthcoming...Share this articleLast night, Prince Harry opened the games with a moving tribute to veterans who had overcome mental and physical injuries following their time at war, telling the crowd the Invictus generation was the \u0027unconquered generation\u0027. \u0027With the help of medical science, the Invictus generation has not only survived injuries that in past conflicts would have been fatal, but has also chosen to fight back from the darkest of places to be here tonight,\u0027 he told the crowd of competitors, family, friends and fans at the Opera House Forecourt on Saturday night.

The first time was by my father – The Prince of Wales – in Bundaberg earlier this year when he was visiting. I now have the privilege of unveiling it in situ,\u0027 Prince Harry said in his speech. \u0027I know that my father came to K\u0027gari in 1994 for a \u0027\u0027day off\u0027\u0027 during a Royal Tour so he has an appreciation of the importance of this place. Luckily we are both highly skilled when it comes to unveiling plaques.\u0027The Queen\u0027s Commonwealth Canopy is an opportunity for the Commonwealth to unite to protect one of the world\u0027s most important natural habitats – forests. \u0027Forty-two out of the 53 countries are now taking part and I hope that others will join soon. The programme is committed to raising awareness of the value of indigenous forests and to saving them for future generations. Put simply, without trees and forests, we don\u0027t survive. It is a symbiotic relationship, and one that so many people still fail to realise. \u0027As you all know too well, K\u0027gari means \u0027paradise\u0027, and that is certainly what we\u0027ve experienced today surrounded by the towering Kauri pines, 1000 year-old satinay trees and ancient giant ferns. It is up to us now to protect this paradise together – not just because it looks beautiful - but because it is an essential part of our existence, and will continue to be for our children and their children\u0027s children.\u0027The Duke of Sussex was left blushing after a pensioner told him he was \u0027much better looking in person\u0027 at the plaque unveiling.Sassy Mally Clarke, 72, called out to the royal as he attended a ceremony on the island in the Pile Valley rainforest, with the father-to-be looking at his notes and saying \u0027I\u0027ll take that as a compliment!\u0027Rejuvenated Meghan beams lovingly at Harry as they attend an...¿She¿s only pregnant ¿ not ill!¿: Fury as trolls slam...Prince Harry reveals he wants a baby GIRL with wife Meghan...Extreme tiredness, nausea and vomiting: Pregnancy expert...Share this articleAsked by MailOnline why she said it, Mally, a Butchulla elder, said afterwards: \u0027Because he is!

Aides insist Meghan is not sick but simply tired. And the bumpy terrain of the World Heritage island, the largest sand island in the world, simply isn\u0027t suitable for an expectant woman.The Fraser Island rainforest is home to the Island\u0027s satinay trees which, known for their hardiness in water, were used to build the London docks in the 1930s. The island has a total of 206,970 acres of protected forest and some trees are more than 1, 000 years old.           Meghan Markle arrives on Queensland\u0027s Fraser Island on Monday as part of her and Prince Harry\u0027s Australian royal tour   Meghan (pictured left and right) arrived on the island after travelling on a whale watching boat, separate to her husband, who was transported on a barge          The mother-to-be was presented with a bouquet of flowers to mark her arrival to Fraser Island, the world\u0027s largest sand island          The expecting Duchess of Sussex will forgo her royal duties for the day due to the rough terrain of the island          Meghan delighted the crowd of onlookers who turned out to see her arrival on Fraser Island, giving a wave to royal fans before she was taken to a luxury resortThe Duke gazed up in awe at the 1,000 year old Satinay trees as he was led into the forest to a clearing around a sacred Spirit Tree. Butchulla Land and Sea Ranger Conway Burns explained: \u0027When we die, we go through an initiation.\u0027Our spirit goes through our body and through our sacred lakes and up to the sky.

He has denied stories claiming that Doria revealed the news to him before the official announcement. She is understood to be planning to move to Britain to help care for the baby.Mr Markle refuses to say anything negative about his daughter and Prince Harry, and said he was only speaking out publicly in the hope it would alleviate some of the intense media scrutiny that continues around him. He says: ‘I have seven cars outside my house with reporters and photographers in them – it’s a gross invasion of my privacy.’It may strike some as unnecessarily cruel and unkind that Meghan’s mother was included in the official statement while her father was left to find out along with the rest of the world, given the controversy that has surrounded Mr Markle .He became estranged from Meghan days before the Royal Wedding in May after hanging up on Prince Harry – the prince had called to chastise him for co-operating with paparazzi pictures which showed, among other things, Mr Markle being ‘fitted’ for a wedding suit.Then he was unable to walk his daughter down the aisle at St George’s Chapel, Windsor, after suffering two heart attacks. In an interview with this newspaper – one of only three he has given – Mr Markle apologised for his lack of judgment in co-operating with the paparazzi.     Dad and daughter on a family outingIt was, he said, a misguided attempt to improve his image after being hounded as he went about his daily business.Mr Markle is yet to meet his son-in-law.But he said: ‘I don’t want anyone to feel sorry for me. Me not getting a call is most likely a misunderstanding about my two back-to-back heart attacks and me missing the wedding.‘There has been so much misinformation and lies that perhaps made them mistrust me.’But he congratulated the couple and said his daughter would be a wonderful mother.‘I wasn’t surprised by the baby announcement. Meghan loves children and she and Harry have been talking about wanting a family from the start. I’m delighted for them both.‘She’s always been wonderful with children and most of her friends have families so she’s used to being around kids. She will make a fantastic mother.’Mr Markle added he was ‘full of pride’ for the way his daughter was handling her first overseas tour, saying: ‘She’s doing so well winning the hearts and minds of everyone in Australia.’After the news of Meghan’s pregnancy, Mr Markle is clearly revelling in his happy memories of the little girl he affectionately called ‘Meggie’ and ‘Bean’. He says some of his happiest times with Meghan as a baby were the ‘quiet’ moments they spent together.Mr Markle was 37 when Meghan was born and was already a highly successful Emmy award-winning Hollywood lighting director, working on the top-rated TV soap General Hospital.He and Doria, who is 12 years his junior, raised their daughter in the affluent Los Angeles suburb of Woodland Hills.With a heavy work schedule, Mr Markle relished his time with Meghan. He said: ‘My greatest joy was coming home from work, picking her up and just walking back and forth with her in the kitchen. Holding her in my arms. She would listen to the hum of the refrigerator and it would lull her to sleep.‘My other favourite memory is of walking outside with her in the garden and I would point up at the moon and say, “That’s Meggie’s moon.” I did that for so long that eventually she was able to look up, point and say, “Meggie’s moon.” ’    Mr Markle and reporter Caroline in Mexico Although Mr Markle split with Ms Ragland when Meghan was three, he remained closely involved in his daughter’s upbringing.‘I would see her all the time. I had her every weekend. We lived close and Meghan went between the two homes very happily.’Meghan lived full-time with her father from the age of 12 until she was 18.He said: ‘I would take her to school every morning because it was on my way to work at the studio. If I could, I would pick her up in the afternoon or I’d send a limo or one of the crew to pick her up and bring her to the set.’Suits actress Meghan, 37, has spoken in the past about how her father instilled in her a love of acting and showbusiness.In one touching Father’s Day post on Instagram, which was taken down after she met Prince Harry, she posted a picture of herself as a baby laying on her father’s chest and wrote: ‘To this day your hugs are still the very best in the whole wide world. \u0027Thanks for my work ethic, my love of Busby Berkeley films \u0026amp club sandwiches, for teaching me the importance of handwritten thank you notes, and for giving me that signature Markle nose. I love you xo – Bean.’Mr Markle, who retired to Mexico six years ago, said: ‘I love my daughter and always will. She will be a great mum. I wish her and Harry nothing but the best.’Mr Markle neither asked for nor received any payment for this interview."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/20/22/3F36CF4500000578-0-image-a-16_1540072275158.jpg","title":"Proof diabetes live life full","story":"    Ten years ago, broadcaster Justin Webb’s son Sam, then eight, was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. Writing in The Mail on Sunday, Justin revealed his ‘shock and heartbreak’ and fears for the future. Today, in his own words, Sam, now 18, paints a resoundingly positive picture. And his father admits that he, too, is almost ready to stop worrying...  Sam\u0027s story I was recently flicking through some old photographs and found a picture of my eight-year-old self on a family holiday, standing by a swimming pool, my eyes squinting in the sunlight, chocolate ice cream spilled across my white shirt. I was grinning, unburdened and happy, as a child ought to be.Just a few weeks later I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, and everything changed.I’d been tired quite a lot. And, embarrassingly, I’d wet the bed a couple of times, which given my age, was a concern. I was constantly thirsty, and hungry.And so on one sunny day, with Christmas around the corner, I sat waiting to be seen in a doctor’s office.To persuade me to go without making a fuss, Dad promised me I wouldn’t have to have any injections.The rest of the day is a bit of a blur – although I do recall quite a few injections, which I wasn’t too happy about.A doctor said to me: ‘I’m really sorry, but you have type 1 diabetes.’I didn’t understand what I was being told, but I could see from the worried expressions on my parents’ faces that it was serious.          Without insulin, sugar builds up in the blood and causes damage. So we type 1 diabetics have to inject a synthetic version of the hormone after eating. And then there is the constant finger-pricking to draw the blood needed to test sugar levelsThere was a stuffy grey lift which stank of disinfectant, and when the doors closed, the sounds of the hospital – the beeping noises, the crying babies – were gone.A musical melody played in the background, my parents were squeezing my shoulders, and a nurse was with us. After a while she looked at me and asked: ‘Did you ever want to be a pilot anyway?’The tension broke. My parents laughed. ‘Not really,’ I told her, blushing slightly, as the doors opened, and the noises recommenced.Back in my bedroom, I remember thinking it was all over. It wasn’t, of course. Life changed, but it did go on. I slowly discovered more about my condition.My pancreas had packed up – doctors still don’t know why it happens – and so I no longer produced my own insulin, the hormone that helps the body’s cells use sugar for energy.Without insulin, sugar builds up in the blood and causes damage. So we type 1 diabetics have to inject a synthetic version of the hormone after eating. And then there is the constant finger-pricking to draw the blood needed to test sugar levels.It’s a balancing act. You need to take enough insulin to keep blood sugar normal because if it’s high, it starts to cause irreversible damage throughout the body.But if you inject too much, blood sugar can plummet. This is called hypoglycaemia, or a hypo. You feel very wobbly, and confused, and it can even lead to blackouts.Womb cleanses, healing drums and crystals... why do...Share this articleThis is why type 1 diabetics, it was later explained to me, weren’t allowed a commercial pilot’s licence. It is no longer a disqualifying factor – the law changed in 2012 – but I still don’t want to be a pilot.Since the age of about nine, I’ve used an insulin pump, which is an electronic gadget that’s permanently attached to me, delivering insulin as and when I need it, so I don’t need to inject myself.I don’t need to prick my finger all the time either, thanks to my Freestyle Libre, a tiny sensor stuck to my arm which sends my blood sugar levels, wirelessly, to an app on my mobile phone. The Prime Minister, Theresa May, who also has type 1 diabetes, has one too.Ten years on from my diagnosis, the condition doesn’t stop me from doing anything.When Mrs May announced she had type 1 diabetes, my dad wrote that she was proof I could grow up to be whatever I wanted to be, even the PM.And he’s right, but instead I’d quite like to be a writer, or a film director, or an actor.I’m taking a gap year right now, currently working to save up for a bit of travelling in January – where to, I’m not sure.Next year I’m going to read English literature with creative writing at the University of East Anglia.And life at university will have it’s challenges. For a start, I don’t eat pizza. I could if I wanted to. But pizza contains slow-release carbohydrates, which makes it harder to control blood sugar with insulin after eating it. So I tend to avoid it.I also don’t really drink alcohol, and I definitely don’t get ‘sloshed’. Alcohol puts a strain on the liver which has a knock-on effect on blood sugar control, causing it to fluctuate. Mixing booze with my insulin medication means there is a risk that I could have a hypo. If this happens at night, it can be particularly worrying.On the plus side, diabetes has forced me into making healthier decisions about what I eat, and what I avoid. But feeling disconnected from the social scene can be quite upsetting.My twin sister Martha lives a very different life to mine: she drinks and eats normally because she doesn’t have diabetes. It’s tough, but there is no escaping this disease.A close friend handed me a shot of tequila at a party recently and shouted: ‘Down it! Down it!’ I wanted to have fun, but I would be taking a huge risk.          A big part of managing diabetes is handling how other people feel about it, whether that’s friends who may or may not think I’m being boring, or my parents’ worriesI looked at my friend, and said ‘No thanks’, and gave him the shot. He looked disappointed, but I know I made the right decision.A big part of managing diabetes is handling how other people feel about it, whether that’s friends who may or may not think I’m being boring, or my parents’ worries.Thanks to the Freestyle Libre, Dad is also able to remotely monitor my blood sugar levels via his smartphone. I don’t see it as in invasion of privacy, or feel I’m being watched over.You see, I know I’m OK, but it helps him to know that too, which is a good thing. Once I’ve left home, he might stop, but if he doesn’t, it doesn’t bother me.It was strange to read the first piece my Dad wrote for this newspaper in 2009 about my illness.He feared for my future, which I never have.Treatment advances mean that this once fatal disease is now manageable with a bit of effort. Yes, there are days when it can feel almost impossible to deal with, but that just motivates me more in the end. Diabetes is a challenge, not a catastrophe. It is difficult, but never impossible.Perseverance is essential.  Justin\u0027s story He is still alive! And so are his parents, though only just. Ten years after Sam’s diagnosis, a young adult is ready to leave home and ready to find his way in the world. And my wife Sarah and I are ready for a rest.Not a physical rest. Sam has looked after himself for years now. But mentally: from the constant out-of-one-corner-of-the-eye monitoring, chivvying, worrying. You cannot help yourself: ‘What’s your blood sugar number?’ ‘Is that a bit high, or a bit low?’ ‘How many carbs in a peach?’I said in my piece for this newspaper all those years ago that a chronic illness in a child changes everything, and it does. It tightens something inside you that can never be loosened again.I also said that I was all too aware that other parents have received worse diagnoses.And after ten years of coping with Sam’s condition I am even more aware that, as he puts it, type 1 diabetes is a challenge, not a catastrophe.I talked about a cure. Well, there is no cure and, frankly, little prospect of one in Sam’s lifetime.But (and it’s a huge but) as Sam says, there is massive progress on the kit and caboodle that can help you cope with type 1 and control it in a fashion that gives a more decent chance of a long and healthy life. So there is progress.And we have brought up a boy who has a sense of humour and a love of literature and travel a boy who must struggle to keep well and has much more to cope with than most young men, but who is not defined by his condition.Ten years ago, if I could have settled for this, I would have taken it like a shot. Here’s to the next ten. And if you have type 1 diabetes in your life: good luck. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/21/11/517F7FBD00000578-6299155-duchess_reappeared_join_her_husband_for_a_lunch_hosted_by_the_Au-m-23_1540118463334.jpg","title":"Pregnant Meghan pulls Invictus Games event Sydney","story":"Hold your head up high like Meghan in a halterneck dress by Jason WuBuy it at Bergdorf Goodman!Another engagement for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex on their royal tour, and another very chic outfit change for mum-to-be Meghan.

Harry asked what Invictus has meant to our family, about our son’s journey - and he also asked after his mental health. It was so easy to talk to them. Harry said it was good that he had been brought in to the programme early on - people can plateau or spiral downwards. We were watching the race and Australia was winning, he said: ‘Sorry about that’.’‘Meghan was asking where we were from, she had gone to university in Chicago near us, and said that she loved Chicago.’Mr Novack told the couple that his son had to wear a TLSO – ‘like a big turtle shell’ – as part of his treatment and had written the Invictus poem on the back of it.‘We showed Harry pictures, we didn’t know he would be a part of it back then,\u0027 he added.The boat was owned by Cam Wayland and his partner Aisleen Patterson.Mr Wayland is part of an organisation called RANSA (the Royal Australian Naval Sailing Association) and had volunteered his boat for Invictus family and friends.He was only informed on Monday that they had two VIP guests and was told not to tell anyone.

But I think it actually reflects a much, much bigger group, I think both Leave and Remain, who are utterly losing confidence in the Prime Minister’s ability to bring back a deal.

The first time was by my father – The Prince of Wales – in Bundaberg earlier this year when he was visiting. I now have the privilege of unveiling it in situ,\u0027 Prince Harry said in his speech. \u0027I know that my father came to K\u0027gari in 1994 for a \u0027\u0027day off\u0027\u0027 during a Royal Tour so he has an appreciation of the importance of this place. Luckily we are both highly skilled when it comes to unveiling plaques.\u0027The Queen\u0027s Commonwealth Canopy is an opportunity for the Commonwealth to unite to protect one of the world\u0027s most important natural habitats – forests. \u0027Forty-two out of the 53 countries are now taking part and I hope that others will join soon. The programme is committed to raising awareness of the value of indigenous forests and to saving them for future generations. Put simply, without trees and forests, we don\u0027t survive. It is a symbiotic relationship, and one that so many people still fail to realise. \u0027As you all know too well, K\u0027gari means \u0027paradise\u0027, and that is certainly what we\u0027ve experienced today surrounded by the towering Kauri pines, 1000 year-old satinay trees and ancient giant ferns.

Aides insist Meghan is not sick but simply tired. And the bumpy terrain of the World Heritage island, the largest sand island in the world, simply isn\u0027t suitable for an expectant woman.The Fraser Island rainforest is home to the Island\u0027s satinay trees which, known for their hardiness in water, were used to build the London docks in the 1930s.

Can their maker work the same magic in Liverpool? A couple of years ago, seven stacks of multicoloured boulders appeared in the Nevada desert. Drivers passing by on Interstate 15 must have wondered what exactly these 10-metre towers were. Teetering piles of gambling chips won by giants in nearby Las Vegas? Cairns erected by shamanic hikers on acid? Proof that neolithic man had pop art colours in his palette?Graffiti quickly offered other interpretations. A spray-painted “666” on one boulder suggested this was work of the devil, while some scrawled genitals associated the boulders with the rites of a fertility cult. And nobody knows what the jokers who wrote “Hella Spiders” on one boulder were on about.The towers turned out to be a $3m limestone sculpture by Swiss artist Ugo Rondinone. Called Seven Magic Mountains, they were inspired by naturally occurring hoodoos, or spires of rock, and the art of meditative rock-balancing. “The attacks started two weeks after we put them up,” says Rondinone of the graffiti. Was that upsetting? “Public art always draws protests. I see my work as communal art so I can’t complain. You could not tell if these mountains were stone – or plastic or styrofoam. They’re completely artificial in a natural environment. That contrariness appeals to me.”Rondinone’s works are nothing if not contrary. In 2013, he erected austere rock figures in the square in front of New York’s Rockefeller Center and called it Human Nature. “My idea,” he says, “was that it was something very raw in one of our most artificial environments.” Seven Magic Mountains came from the opposite impulse: to put something artificial in nature. His work teems with such oppositions: nature v art, ephemeral v permanent, dark v light.This week, Merseyside will get its own Day-Glo cairn when Rondinone unveils his Liverpool Mountain, at the Mermaid Courtyard by Albert Dock as part of the city’s biennial. What’s that all about? “In Nevada, I wanted to make the mountains pop out of a grey and brown landscape. In Liverpool, I want to make them pop too. The city is so grey – it needs some strong, aggressive colours.” The safe money says any Scouse graffiti attacks will be more imaginative than Nevada’s.Rondinone wants the work to become a Merseyside icon. “I love the Eiffel Tower and the Statue of Liberty. And that little Mannekin Pis, you know it?” He means the bronze statue of a boy urinating into a Brussels fountain. “I always hope my public art will be embraced like that.”Could the Liverpool Mountain become, as he hopes, a destination for art-lovers and selfie-takers? That’s what happened in Nevada: after a difficult start, Seven Magic Mountains has become incredibly popular – with 16 million people visiting it in the past two years. “It was embraced by the neighbourhood, who started protecting it from attacks. The police check it regularly, too. It became a place to get some culture after the casinos and the Strip.”That popularity has been boosted by his idea of a monthly Instagram contest showcasing the best Seven Magic Mountains photos. It has all helped with the rebranding of Las Vegas as more than a gambling-fixated cultural dustbowl, so much so that the installation’s two-year lease has now been extended to 20 years. “The ephemeral has become the permanent,” says the gentle New York-based 55 year old, eyes twinkling.Rondinone’s art sometimes goes in the opposite direction, disappearing from view all too quickly. For his show Thank You Silence, at Belgium’s Museum Leuven, he wrote poetry in scarcely visible pencil on the walls. It was easily erased by careless visitors brushing against it, but Rondinone didn’t mind: doing art and being an artist, he has said, is a philosophical task rather than one to do with producing objects.He resisted bids from China and other countries, who wanted to airlift his mountains from the Nevada desert. Though the work isn’t quite site-specific, he thinks it belongs where it is. “I gave Seven Magic Mountains free to Nevada,” he says. Why? “It’s where land art comes from,” he replies. Artists Robert Smithson, Michael Heizer and Jean Tinguely used this desert as a vast canvas in the 1960s. His mountains are a jaunty retort to their work. “What they did is camouflage their art in nature so you have to look for it to find it. I wanted to do the opposite.”Rondinone and I are chatting in a Maltese garden, an oasis of green in a city of rock. The garden is part of a military complex outside the fortified walls of Valletta, the capital, overlooking a harbour teeming with superyachts. The military complex, known as Ospizio, was used by Knights of the Order of St John resisting the Ottomans in the 1500s, and later by Allied troops defending Malta from the Nazis. Now this long-derelict sprawl is being converted into the Malta International Contemporary Art Space, to open in 2021. For centuries, the role of these buildings was to repel invaders. Now they’re being repurposed to lure them in.He has been invited here to launch two new works that riff off each other. Before us in the garden is The Radiant, a huge stone human painted blue and looking very menacing. Meanwhile, hanging above us in the trees and tinkling in the breeze, are 172 bells, an airy antidote to all that hard rock. This is called Joy. Each bell has a little tag dangling from it inscribed with a communal wish offered by children from 172 schools on the island, written in the lovely Maltese language. What sort of wishes are they? “They’re about saving the planet, fighting racism and so on.”There is a refreshingly uncynical ardour to Rondinone’s most sophisticated work. Take the ardent title of a vast sprawling piece dedicated to his husband, the New York beat poet and performance artist John Giorno (who was the subject of Andy Warhol’s film Sleep). The work consisted of 18 immersive installations – from paintings to sound pieces, from drawings to archive footage – celebrating his partner’s many interests, which include Aids activism. He called it Ugo Rondinone: I ♥︎ John Giorno and put it on simultaneously at 13 not-for-profit spaces in Manhattan. “I was celebrating my husband through his work, my work and those of others,” he says. “It took a long time and I wanted to do it right. I had seen a Jean Cocteau exhibition at the Pompidou and everything was in the dark. That was not how I wanted my husband to be celebrated. I wanted to bring him into the light.”Rondinone’s work is so multi-faceted, his exhibitions often get mistaken for group shows. Good Evening Beautiful Blue, his recent 30-year retrospective that toured to Rotterdam, Cincinnati and Miami, was a dizzying multimedia odyssey. It included Vocabulary of Solitude, in which 45 resin clowns reclined in private thought, and Clockwork for Oracles II in which 52 coloured mirrors that reflected the viewer. The show culminated in a six-channel video in a room swathed in blue light. It was given what may be the longest title in art history: It’s Late and The Wind Carries a Faint Sound As It Moves Through the Trees. It Could Be Anything. The Jingling of Little Bells Perhaps Or the Tiny Flickering Out of Tiny Lives. I Stroll Down the Sidewalk and Close My Eyes and Open Them and Wait For My Mind to Go Perfectly Blank. Like a Room No One Has Ever Entered, a Room Without Any Doors or Windows. A Place Where Nothing Happens.Despite its ersity, Rondinone’s work does have unifying themes, most notably time and meditation. He once said: “I like to slow down and prolong the temporality in which nothing would ever end or be abandoned where everything can reappear or reanimate itself where past, present and future belong to one single and unique loop.” You can see that desire in Let’s Turn Back Time, Let’s Start This Day Again, a cast aluminium sculpture of a 2,000-year-old olive tree from Naples. The metal rendering preserves what was previously perishable, while simultaneously capturing two millennia of growth.A shower is raging in off the Mediterranean and we scamper for cover. “I deal with very basic symbols that everybody can relate to,” Rondinone says as we take shelter. “Mountains, stones, a bird, a sun. Maybe you have different levels of appreciation, but the simplicity is always there. Look.”And we look out at the sweetly tinkling bells and the dangling messages of hope written by children, blowing gently in the Maltese breeze.• Liverpool Mountain opens on 23 October "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e71ef20d71d42f935d296ef13b4c5c4e7bc03a9e/0_48_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=453712b3636a071f58341ccdd4fa99e9","title":"matisse to modernity the evolution of black female models in art","story":"A new exhibition explores the progression of black women within artwork from crass caricatures to figures in control of their sexualityIn 1863, the French artist Édouard Manet painted Olympia, a reclining nude prostitute, shedding a scandalous light on Parisian brothel culture. But while much of the attention has been on the white model in the painting, Victorine Meurent, the black model beside her, Laure, has been largely overlooked by art historians.“People have told me, ‘It’s not that I didn’t see the black maid in the painting, I just didn’t know what to say about her’,” said the curator Denise Murrell. “I always felt she is presented in a more stronger light than maids usually are, and I wondered what could be said about her, even though art history said very little.”This one painting then sparked the exhibition which Murrell has curated, Posing Modernity: The Black Model from Manet and Matisse to Today, opening at Columbia University’s Wallach Art Gallery in New York on 24 October.From photography to painting and sculpture, as well as film and print correspondence, this exhibit traces how the black figure has been key to the development of modern art over the past 150 years. Many of the artists here bring to light much of what art history has ignored.“I’m looking for angles that are more relevant than just the standard narrative of the art world,” said Murrell. “I’m giving a number of different narratives that can be discussed around the black figure there is a wider variety of black models, especially the black female figure, in broader, social roles.”Among the artists in the exhibit, there are works by Henri Matisse, including Dame à la robe blanche (Woman in white), from 1946, showing a black model in a white dress. The painting was made after the artist’s visit to Harlem in the 1930s, where he met local artists as part of the Harlem Renaissance, a black arts movement which celebrated African American culture.Laura Wheeler Waring, one member of the group, was a painter who made portraits of African American civil rights figures, like author WEB Du Bois and soul singer Marian Anderson.“It shows the historical weight and significance of what Harlem artists were doing at the time,” said Murrell. “African American slavery or enslaved iniduals were stereotyped and caricatured, and one thing Harlem Renaissance artists wanted to do was give dignity to black female figures, or to black figures, period.”The other Harlem Renaissance painters in the exhibit include William H Johnson, who captured the everyday lives of African Americans, whether it was groups of friends in urban settings to rural families, all of which tell “the critical story of modern portrayals of black figures”, said Murrell.There are also works by Charles Alston, who was known locally for painting murals in Harlem hospitals, but was also recognized as a painter for his portraits of musicians, groups of cotton workers and family portraits. Alston is widely recognized for his bust of Martin Luther King Jr, which today sits in the White House. “He shows African Americans as the urban middle class,” said Murrell. “All aspects of life, high and low, are captured in his paintings.”The more recent artworks in the exhibit, made over the past 50 years, are different from those, say, 100 years ago. “It’s more empowered because we now have a presence, artists of color,” she said. “You have black portraits by black artists, which broadens the range of artistic styles and strategies.”There are paintings by female artists such as Mickalene Thomas, who recently captured Cardi B for the cover of W Magazine’s art issue. In Din, une très belle négresse, from 2012, is a portrait of a black woman painted colorfully in retro garb.“She takes 19th-century black women portrayals, but shows them in expressive ways, with rhinestones, afro wigs and a 1970s look,” said Murrell. “They’re women portrayed as sensual but in control of their sensuality, in a manner that shows a black woman who wants to be herself.“And it’s not just black women, but women period, as sensual but in control of their sensuality and not just for the gaze of the presumed viewer, the white male,” adds Murrell, “You see that perspective unfolding to a more erse group of artists and subjects of art.”The exhibit features works by black female artists like Faith Ringgold, known for her quilts portraying black figures like Aunt Jemima, alongside Ellen Gallagher, who has cut up old advertisements of black women to offer her own perspective.“You can see the evolution as the black figure comes closer to subjectivity, or agency, portrayed by women artists,” said Murrell, “or by showing black women in a way that’s closer to their own modes of self-representation.”Though the black female figure in art has changed over the past 150 years, there is still progress to be made ahead. “There’s still an underrepresentation of black women artists, and black artists, in the contemporary art world,” said Murrell.The exhibit is complete in one way, but incomplete in another. “I hope it gives a sense of history to the kind of art we look at today,” said Murrell. “There was a black presence in modern art, we see that in this show and I hope we start seeing more of it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e0652246cbc67b77a028c7d41ab51b244b728d3b/113_101_2381_1429/master/2381.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=41cbadd0e3f68007908639c2ff4d79a2","title":"good grief artists reimagine peanuts in pictures","story":"From 1950 to 2000, Charles M Schulz’s daily comic strip Peanuts took the adventures of Charlie Brown, Snoopy, Linus and Peppermint Patty around the globe.

The chapter I read out of sequence chronicles her evening with Donald Trump after a California golf tournament in 2006 – three hours listening to his self-puffery, then a scant two minutes enduring “the least impressive sex I’ve ever had”.Afterwards, Trump lavished praise on his own performance Stormy shrugged “yeah”, meaning “whatever”, and fled. Quite apart from his clumsy kissing, his feeble attempt to talk dirty, his lack of finesse when astride her and the mess he made on her stomach by not rubbering up, he didn’t even provide the dinner he’d promised when he invited her.Emetic as it all is to remember, Stormy knows that she has a responsibility to history. “The world is waiting to hear about his penis,” she says and obliges in emasculating detail. For the record, it’s smallish and Trump had to “fumble” it into her – not a compliment to its hydraulics. It looks repellently fungoid, with a head that she first likens to a mushroom and then – determined to spare him no humiliation – to a toadstool. She can’t report on his balls, which in her opinion “he needs to shave” they skulked in a tangled thicket of “yeti pubes”. A transplant might be in order, since Stormy reports that “his hair down there was better than what was on his head”.Even deadlier is her account of Trump’s simpering demeanour. Rather than playing the virile seducer, he behaved as if it was his role to be seductive. He received her in his hotel suite wearing black silk pyjamas and slippers. “Go put some fucking clothes on,” Stormy ordered. He meekly complied, after which she demanded that he bend over to be ked. “It was a power moment,” she gloats his “peacock plumage” wilted and she amused herself by plucking further feathers from his vainglorious tail. After an eternity of tedious chitchat, she made the mistake of going to the bathroom. When she returned, she found Trump perched on the bed in his undies, “like he had tried out different poses” in “a poor attempt at looking powerful”.Trump is as good as gelded by her description: no wonder he’s so terrified of sharks, since Stormy rears up like Jaws to menace his mushroom with her jagged incisors. The creepiest moment comes when, in a “grossly vulnerable voice”, he pleads to see her again. That exactly catches the whiny tone you hear behind his bilious rants – a needy craving for validation, adulation and immunity from prosecution.Before and after this encounter, Stormy’s book reveals what a defiant, unsinkable woman she is, brought up in squalor by a mother who calls her a “cunt” and says: “I wish I’d aborted you”, terrorised by a stepfather who shot holes through the walls, raped in childhood by a neighbour, consoled mainly by the horses she adored. As a teenager, she stripped in a “titty bar” housed in a trailer. Graduating to porn, she rapidly advanced from performing to writing and directing her own features. She has no shame about her work, though with live-in men she prudishly insists on separate bathrooms. She is pleased that she never heard her long-term lover fart or burp, “so outside of sex, our bodily functions were mysterious”. As she says: “I’m a fucking lady, thank you” – and you’d better not speak disrespectfully of what she calls her “ladyparts”.Stormy boasts that she has “grown balls”. Given her “alpha-dogging” of Trump and her jokes about his furry sporran, who knows whether this is more than a metaphor? She sees herself as an elemental force, as she proclaimed when she changed her name. She was christened Stephanie, but realised “I couldn’t rule the world with a name like that”. After becoming Stormy, she extended the meteorological conceit by nicknaming her surgically augmented breasts Thunder and Lightning.Her invented surname came from the label of a Jack Daniel’s whisky bottle and it transformed a person into a brand. The code name used by her bodyguards is even more telling, because its source is a myth: the goons call her Daenerys, the mother of dragons in Game of Thrones. Capable of unleashing tempests or attacks by a menagerie of scaly monsters, Stormy belongs in the same pantheon as the goddess Kali, whose neckwear was a string of human skulls she has taken at least one scalp, which has an orange comb-over.If all this sounds as overblown as Stormy’s triple-D mammaries, then that’s because she is on a cosmic mission. After she fingered Trump, fans urged her to save the world recently, she reports, they’ve “upgraded my job to saving the universe”. Like Wonder Woman, she accepts the challenge, though we shouldn’t expect an apocalyptic showdown, with Thunder and Lightning discharging fire and fury. Stormy has already done her bit by belittling Trump’s tackle and making him look, to use his own most hurtful word, like a loser. When he bragged about his epochal achievements in a speech to the UN in late September, the visiting heads of state immediately began to titter. Autocrats may survive protest marches and impeachment proceedings, but they have no defence against ridicule.• Full Disclosure by Stormy Daniels is published by Pan Macmillan (£18.99).

Underlying profits rose to £50m in the year to March as sales increased by a fifth to £348.6m. The boot designed for workers has been championed by fashion influencers from Bella and Gigi Hadid to Cardi B and Miley Cyrus, as well as teenagers wanting to put their own spin on styles their parents once wore.Dr Martens first set trends when it was adopted by skinheads, a 60s youth subculture whose style expressed working-class solidarity. Since then, various fashion tribes from mods to 90s Britpop kids have embraced the thick-soled footwear.“This, in the context of the wider macroeconomic uncertainty that exists in a few of our key markets, is testament to both the strength of our brand, our heritage and consumer proposition and the execution of our strategy.”Founded in 1960, the brand was owned by the Northamptonshire-based Griggs family, who sold a majority stake to the private equity firm Permira in a £300m deal in 2014. In the early noughties, when clumpy footwear fell out of fashion, Dr Martens struggled for survival. In 2000, the company moved production to China and Thailand.Seven years later, the Griggs family reopened the brand’s original factory in Wollaston, Northamptonshire, to revive its iconic vintage styles. And this year, Dr Martens poached the former Cath Kidston and Levi’s executive Kenny Wilson to take the helm."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e455ae6a8e1c3db3e9b75b7b72abcf1238d39a69/0_338_3024_1814/master/3024.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=49bad9f326cc4ad09c29b7f204b832cb","title":"disneyland for adults john portman dizzying interior legacy","story":"The Atlanta architect known for his ‘Jesus moments’ – when visitors would look up and exclaim ‘Jesus!’ – remade his home town in ways few get toAtlanta is the future. At least, makers of films and TV series think so, especially those who create visions of times to come. In The Hunger Games, The Walking Dead and Divergent, the city appears, unnamed, as the setting for omnipotent rulers and dark deeds. Sometimes you see its towers sometimes soaring, swirling atria of unreadable scale. They tend to convey megalomania, dystopia and disorientation.This cinematic Atlanta was shaped by one man in particular, the architect-developer John Portman, who until he died last year spent almost all his 93 years in the city. The hotels, malls and offices that from the early 1960s started to define the downtown – the Merchandise Mart, the Hyatt Regency hotel, the Peachtree Center, the Marriott Marquis – are his work. These were not just profitable commercial ventures – Portman ended up with a personal wealth of hundreds of millions of dollars – but, in his eyes, works of art.They were also engines to stop Atlanta becoming one of America’s “donut cities”, their centres hollowed out by the flight to the suburbs of middle classes and the taxes they paid. For Andrew Young, the city’s mayor from 1982 to 1990, the architect’s designs contributed (as an Esquire article once reported) to Atlanta’s “peaceful passage” through the turbulent 60s.Portman incurred the mistrust of critics and his fellow professionals, in particular for combining the role of developer and architect. He was dangerously conflicted, they thought. For Portman, development was a means to achieve his artistic goals. “Architecture is what I’m about,” was one of his declarations. He also said: “I came to the conclusion that if I were to have an impact – and not be just part of a process I could not control – I should understand the entire project from conception through completion. That led me to real estate.” On another occasion he put the same point, pithily but grandiosely, like this: “I’m the Medici to my own Leonardo.”He liked to paint and sculpt as well. He took to heart the advice Frank Lloyd Wright gave him when a student – “young man, go seek Emerson” – by which the famous old architect meant that Portman should learn from the famous dead poet’s self-reliance and faith in nature. And so – first in Atlanta, later in several more American cities, and later again in China – he came to create the hotels for which he is most famous, whose dynamic and vertiginous atria are garnished with vegetation and animated by water features. Sometimes piped birdsong plays. It’s nature, if not as Emerson would have known it.Portman was a pioneer of the devices with which somber modernism was given glitz: mirror-glass, wall-climbing glass lifts, sky bridges, swooping curves. He described some gaudy candelabra he put around a piano stage in the Atlanta Marriott Marquis as a “homage to Liberace”. His buildings became known for their “Jesus moments”, those times when, emerging from a deliberately understated entry into some architectural emulation of the Grand Canyon, a visitor would reliably exclaim, “Jesus!”The rewards for his audacity included his projects’ filmography. There were, as well as the recent movies and television shows listed above, The Towering Inferno (1974), Sharky’s Machine (1981), True Lies (1994), Grosse Pointe Blank (1997) and Mission: Impossible III (2006). Mel Brooks’s Hitchcock spoof High Anxiety (1977) exploited the vertiginous properties of Portman’s Hyatt Regency in San Francisco. Critics, in a classic standoff of specialist and popular taste, were less impressed. “Disneyland for adults”, his works were called. Portman would retort by pointing to signs of their popular success, such as their high occupancy rates and the people queuing just to get a look inside.The most significant effects of Portman’s work go beyond taste. He was a city-shaper who remade his home town in ways that few architects get to do. In addition to his prolific output, he used his position on planning groups to campaign for the wider interests of the city, as well as his own. He successfully opposed the relocation of Atlanta’s airport – which would have taken jobs away from an area that needed them – and successfully advocated deep tunnelling for its subway, which minimised disruption to his properties.As Young said, Portman reinvigorated Atlanta’s downtown at a time when other city centers went into decline. “My idea was that I just couldn’t see abandoning the cities to the poor,” was Portman’s way of putting it. “I want to bring the middle class back.” But this statement is two-edged – the wish to help downtowns comes with an unfriendly tone towards “the poor” – and his developments came with conditions attached. The price of competing with the suburbs was to make the center more suburb-like: managed, secure, controlling. The traditional street was seen as threatening – “sidewalks and congested areas have a lot of anxiety,” he said, “and I wanted to create a release from that anxiety.”What he created were internalised, self-sufficient worlds, where every need is satisfied, where the paying customer has as little need as possible to stray outside. His architecture is notably interior the exteriors can be as blunt and anonymous as tax-collecting offices. “I’m building a city that will become the modern Venice,” was how Portman put it. “The streets down there are canals for cars, while these bridges are clean, safe, climate-controlled. People can walk here at any hour.”Some points in his defense: an obituary in a local news outlet reported that his developments included some of the first integrated restaurants in racially segregated Atlanta a recent study by Harvard’s Graduate School of Design argues that his projects offer “lots of opportunities to link back to the city, to link back to the street outside” Portman made modest efforts to encourage people to walk inside his complexes.But he was also a leading progenitor of what is now a ubiquitous way of building, to be seen in the US, the Gulf, south-east Asia and pretty much everywhere else – those bland, soothing, air-conditioned, all-encompassing environments that first exclude what Portman called the turmoil of city life and then repackage it as visual spectacle. Perhaps this is why all those film-makers, even though Portman often said that he was only trying to make people feel good, see a dark side in his spaces. For they are driven in part by fear, an anxiety about the world outside that is manifested in the architecture. Cities is live in Atlanta for a special series of in-depth reporting.

The novel is about a teenage girl living in an unnamed Northern Irish city during the Troubles, who is being pursued by an older paramilitary dubbed the Milkman – and Burns managed to write it in chronic pain, while on benefits. The £50,000 prize would help to clear her debts, she said. In the acknowledgements, she thanked her local food bank, housing charity and the Department for Work and Pensions, as well as other governmental and non-governmental bodies set up to help people in poverty. If there were to be a Booker winner to blow Julian Barnes’s description of the Booker as “posh bingo” out of the water, this is it.Burns’s win will give hope to other poor artists, especially those struggling and skint, with no connections, who went to crap schools or are suffering rubbish circumstances – stuck with “shit life syndrome” in other words. What a symbol of the times we live in, that a woman who was forced to rely on food banks to survive has won the most prestigious literary prize in the country.We hear so much about the cultural sector being dominated by upper-middle class tastemakers, some of them horrendous snobs, many of whom know each other. And there is truth to this: it is a tiny bubble. But Burns shows you can be radically different and still burst the bubble open.The author gives hope to her left-behind community, too. “She was not born with a silver spoon in her mouth and had no advantages bestowed upon her. This honestly is brilliant, it’s just so great for people from north Belfast, in a place that lacks hope, to see one of our own do so well,” said fellow writer Lyra McKee, who went to the same school. Her win is timely for all sorts of reasons – the #MeToo movement, Brexit reviving the prospect of a hard border in Northern Ireland – but what I find most moving is buried in those words: the notion that things like this don’t normally happen to “people like us”. It’s true, they don’t.Perhaps this is why the reception to the news in some quarters has been bizarre. Milkman has been branded a difficult book. It isn’t. It’s written how many people speak. To a normal reader, from a normal background, it reads like a girl from school trotting alongside you down the road, telling you a story. Often, there is an implication that people who are disadvantaged can’t cope with literary fiction. Milkman turns this on its head: if you went to public school, didn’t grow up in a working-class community and only read a certain type of novel, then yes, you might find it difficult – opaque, even. “I couldn’t put it down and I was brought up on a council estate. That may be the point,” wrote one reader to this newspaper. “The embattled working-class community and the mock-heroic demotic are done brilliantly.” As is so often the case in Britain, whether you get Milkman or not could be a class thing.The rags-to-riches nature of Burns’s story is the good news many of us need and it is appealing to the media for obvious reasons. Nonetheless, I am wary of it being romanticised as an “artist starving in garret” narrative – more La Bohème than I, Daniel Blake. There are already people calling Burns a scrounger, even though the idea that, in this day and age you could simply sign on to pursue your art without drawing the attention of the authorities, is orced from reality. This isn’t the 1980s or even the 90s, which gave birth to so much cultural brilliance for precisely that reason (Jarvis Cocker once said that Pulp wouldn’t exist without the dole: well, he’s paid the public purse back and then some). These days, it’s more along the lines of: “You can lift a paintbrush, you say? We’ll put you to work picking asparagus. Never mind that you don’t have any legs, you can drag yourself along the ground as you go.”Let those people moan. It’s a symptom of how often creativity is seen as an indulgence until it pays off. If it’s not part of the market, it doesn’t matter. We forget how many people use it as a tool to survive, if not financially, then emotionally, for their mental health how they squeeze it in around everything else. According to the Society of Authors, the average full-time writer earns £5.73 an hour, less than minimum wage. People write for reasons other than money, and always have. The publishing industry is making great efforts to improve access to working-class writers and the writers themselves, such as Kit de Waal, are speaking up courageously and demanding to be seen. Burns’s win adds more fuel to the fire.Milkman has become a top seller on Amazon, and Faber has now printed more than 150,000 copies. It may read like a fairytale, but it’s also a lesson."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ccce39405785d5ffa3f6cd9ae910f6af40bea72/0_0_3001_1801/master/3001.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d9957af30a54a4b90391aee16dafe2c3","title":"centrist dad march peoples vote first step second referendum","story":"On Saturday I joined 700,000 people on the streets of London to demand a people’s vote on Brexit. The atmosphere was vibrant, friendly and politely furious. From all over the country people came, anxious to make their anger, despair and incredulity known. It was fun and important. The mainstream has been abandoned on Brexit by our political class and there is a catharsis to taking to the streets and demanding that our politicians listen.I have to confess, street politics are not my usual style. I have been called many things in public life, but the cap that best fits is that of the centrist dad. In my career and in my jobs in government I have tended to look for the solution and to try to avoid the ideology. I began the academies programme because I wanted to do what worked for disadvantaged kids, not cling to models that looked good and delivered little. I drove HS2 through parliament and worked for cross-party support because I knew that productivity and inequality in this country could only be tackled by massive long-term infrastructure investment. Despite my deep misgivings about austerity and the harm it would do, I agreed to chair the national infrastructure commission under a Tory government, because I believed that delivering infrastructure investment could help build a brighter future for businesses and families. I am a pragmatist. I do what works.So why, then, in middle age have I picked up a placard and taken to the streets? Why am I protesting rather than participating? Why, like hundreds of thousands of other otherwise sensible and moderate people, was I in Parliament Square on a sunny afternoon cheering my lungs out at Delia Smith? Well, because there simply is no way to make this Brexit thing work.In the end, pragmatism requires a workable compromise. But none exists on Brexit. When we voted in 2016 we were offered not two alternative destinies but thousands of parallel futures. The two leave campaigns contained within them a violent disorder of multiple personalities. Boris Johnson claimed we could remain in the single market and leave the EU – the origin and definition of “cakeism” as a political style. Nigel Farage warned of imminent Turkish accession while insisting that leave was all about getting our old passports back and exciting new trade deals around the world. Jacob Rees-Mogg reassured his friends in the City that post-Brexit Britain would be a haven for them, a sort of Singapore-on-Sea, while “lexiteers” like Kate Hoey promised us a massive programme of state aid. Had this been a general election, with leave as a party proposing to govern, this mishmash of pipe dreams and contradictory fantasies would have been laughed out of town. In a referendum, they got away with it.Two and a half years on, the Brexiteers still can’t agree on what Brexit actually means. They are tearing each other apart – over “Chequers”, “Canada-plus-plus”, Efta and everything in between – and in the process they are tearing the country apart. Why? Because no Brexit deal can deliver to British voters on the inconsistent but alluring mess that they were promised in 2016.That’s why I marched on Saturday. That’s why this centrist dad – alongside hundreds of thousands of other marchers – took to the streets to demand a people’s vote. Not because I am an enthusiast for referendums but because a referendum on what we know is the only way to overcome the problems created by a referendum that was won by promising the impossible. I marched for a referendum because the last referendum has left me – and our country – with no choice.Angry as I am, the pragmatist remains. No amount of chanting or of marching can extinguish in me that most centrist-dad of characteristics: the desire to actually fix the thing rather than merely to protest against it.And so I have to say this: the march was a wonderful, impactful moment that showed the political class we are serious – but it is just the first step. What is coming next is not a battle of public will but of parliamentary pressure – we face a Commons crisis the likes of which we have not seen since 1940. Now, as then, MPs have the choice between working across party lines to achieve what is right – Churchill as PM, a referendum on Europe, or doing the easy thing – Chamberlain continues, Britain drifts out of the EU. The moment is historic and each of our representatives in parliament should understand that the choice they make on this vital matter will lately determine how they are remembered. Were they brave, wise and patriotic? Or did they simply throw their hands up, mumble something about how it was all “very complicated” and vote to make their constituents poorer and less safe without giving them a say?That is the sure and certain knowledge our MPs must take into the lobbies when a vote comes – as it will – on giving the British people the final say. That history and their constituents will judge them fiercely if they try to silence us. So I say to my fellow centrist mums and dads, sons and daughters – write to your MP now, today. Tell them you are watching and history is too. Demand your say. The march let them see we are here. Now we need them to actually listen. We need sensible people to stop being quiet and to plod – pragmatically, passionately – on.• Andrew Adonis is a Labour peer and former minister"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c4eacdbf8c4f43e498d700f1dbfef737ebe16ad3/316_116_2673_1604/master/2673.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ecae234225baa54226cd789dcbc45547","title":"theresa may brexit enemies transition deal eu tories","story":"The prime minister has two oppositions, her majesty’s loyal opposition, aka the Labour party, and her own disloyal one, some 40 Tory MPs.

Business universally wanted it. Employers wanted it. Opinion polls wanted it. There was never any lobby for hard Brexit. The prime minister should have grasped that fact.Given her decision to leave hard Brexit roaming free, May had the option of recruiting a wider coalition of parliamentary support for remaining in the customs union, certainly among Labour and the Scots. Instead she left herself exposed on both sides. Now there are just weeks to go. No one with an ounce of responsibility believes the UK’s best interest lies in “crashing out”. It will cause commercial chaos and real human disruption. May has to negotiate a deal, and has to be supported by parliament in doing so.The vitriol directed at May by some of her supporters may not be surprising. What is surprising is the absence of support from other MPs who must recognise her difficulty – and the necessity of what she is seeking. At least raw sympathy might be in order. May has made mistakes, in her time in the Home Office as well as Downing Street. They have not won her the affection of the public or of many of her colleagues. But then neither had her predecessor, Margaret Thatcher, in similar trouble in 1980-81.That is for tomorrow. At this turn in the nation’s affairs, only one thing matters, a workable Brexit transition. For Tory and Labour MPs merely to knock down each proposal as it surfaces, and savage the woman putting it forward, is not loyal opposition but disregard of the national interest. Just now, it is not a prime minister who is on trial, but British politics. Its current image is appalling."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a30868ba078649ebbbc07f9cf53409dad6b2d42/0_72_4901_2940/master/4901.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3df32a0e63d83ebfa85bfc20adf14329","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of hidden","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘hidden’The closing date is Wednesday 24 October at 10am.

Her remarks touched on her childhood interest in performing and included thinly veiled references to Kavanaugh.Louis-Dreyfus is a graduate of the elite Holton-Arms school, alma mater of Dr Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Kavanaugh of sexual assault, which Kavanaugh vehemently denied.“It has been in the news lately,” she said, before launching into a bit about performing in the school’s production of Serendipity.“I can remember every single aspect of that play that night, so much so that I would testify under oath about it,” she said, referencing Blasey Ford’s testimony to the Senate judiciary committee. “But I can’t remember who drove me there or who drove me home.”“Or if Squee or Tobin were there. Or if Bart put it on his weird wall calendar.”That was a reference to Kavanaugh’s calendar from high school, which detailed his social life at high school and was used as evidence in a Senate hearing.“This, by the way, is totally true and not some kind of subtle attack on our newest supreme court justice,” Louis-Dreyfus said. “ For God’s sake, the man has suffered enough.”In September, Louis-Dreyfus joined more than 600 other Holton-Arms alumnae in signing a letter of support for Ford.Politics was never far from the Mark Twain ceremony. Fey referenced her famous role playing the 2008 Republican vice-presidential candidate, Sarah Palin, on Saturday Night Live, saying she and Louis-Dreyfus “both won Emmys for playing people who should never be vice-president”.“By the way, everyone talks about all the parallels between Veep and the current administration,” Fey said. “But I think it’s more like Seinfeld: just a bunch of selfish dicks who don’t give a crap about anyone other than themselves.”Fey, who like Louis-Dreyfus came out of Chicago’s Second City comedy scene, praised the star of the night for the “secret precision” of her comedy and her willingness to make her Seinfeld character so flawed.“Julia let Elaine be selfish and petty and sarcastic and a terrible, terrible dancer,” Fey said. “Julia’s never been afraid to be unlikable – not on screen and not in person.”Louis-Dreyfus is the 21st Mark Twain recipient, joining a list that includes Richard Pryor, George Carlin and Carol Burnett. Bill Cosby won in 2009 but had his award rescinded earlier this year after he was convicted of three counts of aggravated indecent assault.Louis-Dreyfus joined the cast of Saturday Night Live before a nine-year run on Seinfeld. She won her first lead comedy actor Emmy for the sitcom the The New Adventures of Old Christine then six more for her role as Vice-President Selina Meyer on Veep.Veep’s seventh and final season is in production, after being delayed as Louis-Dreyfus received treatment for breast cancer.The Mark Twain prize event is scheduled to air in the US on 19 November, on PBS."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a76dbe9278c4623be17cbaf17e8464b87220c8a/0_192_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=68bb5c44d51f1f56bcbafb33124440a5","title":"applying to university heres our step by step guide","story":"Ucas is open for university applications for 2019. Here’s all you need to knowMaybe it’s all you’ve been thinking about through years of school lessons, or maybe you’ve just started wondering whether uni could be for you – either way, it’s time to crack the application process. You’re going to come across confusing-sounding buzzwords and acronyms, and “Ucas” will become the most-used four letter word in your vocab – but the process is fairly simple.How do I apply?Pick up to five (or four for medical and vet applicants) of your favourite university courses, then register on Ucas’s Apply website. You’ll need to fill in your personal details, and the unique Ucas code for each course you’re applying for: there’s no preference order and none of the universities or colleges you list will be able to see where else you’ve applied. You then add your personal statement – basically an “about me”, see below for details. Check through your details, get a reference from a teacher or other professional, pay the application fee (£18 for one course, £24 to apply for more than one) – then click send. And cross your fingers.Does it matter when I apply?The deadline for most applications is 15 January. There’s no benefit in rushing: “Universities are committed to considering all applications received by January 15 equally,” says Andrew Homer, director of admissions at Kingston University. “There’s no advantage to getting yours in early. However, once you’ve pressed send, remember that your Ucas form needs to go to a teacher or lecturer for a reference, so allow plenty of time for that.” You can start with one or two course choices, and add more as you do more research.What happens if I miss the deadline?Applications can still be made after January but receiving an offer will be dependent on places still being available. “Some candidates only make the decision to apply for a university place at a later stage, perhaps after performing well in mock exams,” says Deborah Green, director of student recruitment at the University of Hull. “If that’s the case, don’t be deterred from applying late in the cycle as universities are always willing to consider strong candidates.” And if you’re really late, you should keep an eye out for Ucas Clearing.I’m obsessed with one course – do I really need an insurance choice when I’ve heard universities are fighting for students?“The insurance choice is a back-up, or a plan B,” says Sarah Hannaford, head of admissions at Loughborough University, “in case you don’t meet the conditions of your firm choice university and they are unable to accept you. With something as important as your university future, it is a good idea to have a plan B.” It will help ease the pressure, too, if you know that even if one exam goes wrong or your grades slip, you can still get into a course you’d love to study.I’m applying for a few different courses - how can I avoid making that obvious in my personal statement?“Tailor your personal statement to the primary course you want to study. If you generalise your application too much, there is a possibility you will not meet the shortlisting criteria for your preferred course,” says Claire Pryke, head of recruitment at the University of Bradford. “You can contact the university of your choice to find out if they will accept an alternative personal statement for a different course before submitting your application – many do.” A personal statement should explain why you want to go to uni, what you love learning and extra-curricular passions, plus any skills or experiences that could help you be a successful student. Don’t mention any institution by name in your personal statement and you don’t need to be specific about course names either, admissions tutors don’t expect it.Do unis care about the Duke of Edinburgh award? Or any of my hobbies?Yes – going to uni is not just about qualifications, it’s about new experiences, new environments and lots of opportunities. “It’s about becoming a rounded inidual,” says Horner. “Learning a bit about your extra-curricular activities helps universities understand more about you and how you can make a success of your life.” Some courses might require specific work experience – so research your options carefully to check for any additional entry requirements."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ec41d3978bb0867b0cfef7399bca8f13408b306/0_191_3200_1920/master/3200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9d7837a100027cbe3e43f6147fa3b3e4","title":"secondary school bans talking in the corridors to keep children calm","story":"Parents of pupils at Ninestiles in Birmingham complain the academy will ‘feel like prison’A secondary school has banned pupils from talking between lessons, threatening detention to children who break the rule.In a letter to parents, Ninestiles school in Acocks Green, Birmingham, said pupils would be expected to move around the building in silence when they return after the half-term holidays.“We know that behaviour is already of a high standard but we want and expect more from our learners, and so from Monday 5th November students will move around the building in silence during change over times,” the letter read.“This will ensure students arrive calmly and ready to learn and staff can give out any information they need to swiftly and easily.”The school said that “all student movement including to and from assembly, at lesson changeover and towards communal areas at break and lunch” would be carried out in silence, but that pupils would be able to speak to each other in designated areas at break and lunch times.“The sanction for breaking the silent corridor rule will initially be a 20-minute detention any repeated failure to follow the school policy will result in an appropriate escalation of sanctions,” the letter said.Some parents have criticised the announcement, with one woman, who didn’t want to be named, telling BirminghamLive, that she could not see the educational purpose of silent corridors. “It alienates young people and makes school feel like a prison rather than a place of learning,” she said.“Would any of us go to a workplace where this was the case? As a parent, I feel this is creating an environment that works against learning, against what the school is there to do, which is to educate, not control and punish.”Ninestiles, an academy school with 1,345 pupils aged 11-18, is rated “outstanding” by Ofsted. In a joint statement, acting co-headteachers Alex Hughes and Andrea Stephens defended the policy, but said it would be reviewed at the end of the autumn term.“Ninestiles is committed to the highest standards of behaviour and we know that students arriving to lessons ready to learn can be further supported by doing so in silence at certain points in the day,” they said.“This is already an expectation for arrival at exams and during fire drills and, as such, is simply an extension of that code of behaviour. We will review this change at the end of Term 2 and the views of our students, parents and carers will be welcomed as part of that process.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ecb714834db18244ef43d9238bfe6e152eea7191/0_170_1764_1058/master/1764.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f8e3c2da67c919db8dfa508a515df3c4","title":"tell us how does it feel to watch a classic film on first release","story":"As audio of frenzied audience reactions to the original Halloween has gone viral, we want to hear your stories of seeing defining films at the cinemaThe much-hyped release of the latest Halloween installment (tipped to break records with a $70m opening) has led many to think back to the film that started it all back in 1978.While there have been rankings aplenty, there’s also been a rather fascinating video going viral that gives us an idea of what it would have been like to see the original on the big screen.

In a column titled “The death threat of live television”, Lacey predicted: “Matches shown on the small screen, warts and all, far from stimulating interest, would be more likely to have the opposite effect,” and suggested: “A televised match would become the complete alternative to paying to watch football and more fans than ever would have reason to stay away.”Lacey was far from alone. Years before the dawn of the Premier League Brian Clough thought too much live TV would kill football. And, indeed, as far back as 1931 the BBC stopped radio broadcasts of Football League games because of fears they were damaging attendances.The logic appeared sound enough. Yet when it comes to live football on TV the horse has not merely bolted but is doing cartwheels across multiple continents while sticking up one finger at the doubters. This week an astonishing 87 games will be legally shown or streamed live in Britain – a number that would be higher still if Eleven Sports had not temporarily stopped broadcasting European football games during the 3pm Saturday blackout.Few expect the blackout, that oasis between 2.45pm and 5pm every Saturday where no live football is allowed to be shown, to stand up to legal scrutiny. Indeed the direction of travel is for viewers to one day be able to watch every game, home and away, without running the gauntlet of dozens of pop-ups on a dodgy internet site. That might sound tremendous for fans, but the Premier League has always been wary – understandably fearing it would lead to a drop in attendances, a decline in atmosphere and less money the next time it hawked its product to broadcasters.Less discussed are the effects on smaller clubs lower down the English league food chain if there is a broadcasting free-for-all. But compelling new research from three academics – Babatunde Buraimo of the University of Liverpool, and Jake Owen and Rob Simmons of Lancaster University – does not paint a rosy picture.The academics trawled through 27,000 Football League matches between 2000 and 2018 to answer a simple question: what happens to attendances at Championship, League One and League Two matches when TV is showing a midweek Premier League or Champions League match at the same time?It would be unwise to infer too much into a small sample given there are many confounding factors, such as timing of games and form and status of the teams involved which would vary between seasons. Yet it is not hard to discern where the winds are blowing. We know that Champions League games affect the gates of lower-league clubs. So, probably, does streaming matches. Lifting the blackout would be another blow. And some clubs’ finances are so parlous it could make insolvency a more likely prospect.Which is why the academics suggest it might be time to reappraise the “solidarity payments” paid by the Premier League – which are made in recognition of a need to preserve a financially viable professional league structure of 92 teams – to give more help to smaller clubs.In effect it would be an added form of compensation for the negative consequences inflicted on League One and League Two clubs by Premier League sides playing in the Champions League at the same time as them.As Buraimo points out: “Our research shows the degree of suffering from high-end football. If football is truly a sport where solidarity and the grass roots matters then increasing the level of subsidy further down the pyramid is quite affordable.”Cynics will say it is asking too much for bigger clubs to dip deeper into their pockets. Altruism is not exactly their forte, after all. But if the broadcasting market does turn into a massive free-for-all, and more fans stay away from lower league stadiums, something will need to be done. Otherwise Lacey’s gloomy prediction could yet come true."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e2a96378c8200a36986db3301900da132ee05349/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f8b87b1c9dd56fa361a573c5ee451603","title":"premier league 10 talking points from the weekends action","story":"Woefully leaky Fulham are on course to concede 100 goals, and is it nearly time for Álvaro Morata and Chelsea to part ways?On the eve of the new season Slavisa Jokanovic said Fulham “don’t have to change much but we need to be intelligent. We need to grow up.” Two months down the line and either Jokanovic underestimated how much Fulham needed to adapt to be ready for the Premier League or his players are not being as smart as he had hoped. Whatever the answer, Fulham did not spend more than £100m in the summer to be languishing in the relegation zone with one win from nine games and a defensive record that is in danger of becoming an embarrassment. Alarm bells should be ringing after Cardiff, who had scored only four times in their opening eight games, doubled their tally for the season against Jokanovic’s porous team. As things stand, Fulham are on course to concede more than 100 goals this season. They need to wise up fast. Stuart JamesThe nature of football, society – and José Mourinho – means that Mourinho is often viewed through a Fisher-Price prism that offers neither nuance nor context, and as such anyone deemed to oppose him is rhapsodised as hero, genius and martyr. Anthony Martial has benefited from this inclination, but the reality is less basic. Mourinho probably should be more nurturing, definitely should not drop him after every bad half, and absolutely put Alexis Sánchez in front of him when he was flying. But Martial probably could toughen up, definitely should run in behind, and must take possession on the move. But perhaps the two have finally reached an understanding if each can learn from the other, it will elevate both. Daniel Harris• Match report: Chelsea 2-2 Manchester United• Chelsea and Man Utd likely to be warned by FA after chaotic scenes• Jonathan Wilson: How should Mourinho fix his defence? By attackingÁlvaro Morata was yet again ineffective for Chelsea at the weekend and, if there was a moment that summed up his general contribution for the club, it came, somewhat ironically, in the move that led to the opening goal. Eden Hazard picked up the ball in the right channel of Manchester United’s area, looked across the line for somebody to pass to and saw nobody there. Morata was behind Hazard and the situation called on him to drive forward. Instead the Spaniard stood where he was, passive and flat-footed, and watched as the Belgian’s cross was cleared for the corner that Antonio Rüdiger subsequently converted. Morata has three goals in 12 games for Chelsea this season with Saturday’s fixture the eighth in the league in which he has failed to feature for 90 minutes. That is simply not good enough for a £58m centre-forward and Maurizio Sarri may now be wondering if January would be the best time for him and the club to cut their losses. Sachin Nakrani• Karen Carney misses penalty as Birmingham City hold ChelseaBrendan Rodgers once said managing a football team is like building an airplane while it is flying. Many of the Celtic manager’s maxims are easy to mock but that is a pretty good line and plenty of Premier League managers, who often are not allowed time to take a moment to breathe and think, would probably agree. Mark Hughes had some of that time over the international break and seemingly used it well, the work done with a surprise central-defensive selection of Wesley Hoedt and Jack Stephens paying off in Southampton’s best performance of the season against Bournemouth. “Probably the selection of the back four was a little bit of a surprise to some of you guys but it was a reflection of the work that was done,” Hughes said. Despite Manolo Gabbiadini’s glaring miss, the point gained and the way the Saints stymied their hitherto rampant opponents will provide plenty of encouragement. Nick MillerCompared with last season’s start of no points and no goals after seven games Crystal Palace are in relative good health with seven points on the board from nine matches. Their performance at Everton should have increased that tally and, but for Jordan Pickford’s fine penalty save from Luka Milivojevic, they would have had a platform to frustrate Marco Silva’s designs on a third straight Premier League win. But their weakness in front of goal presents a major obstacle to Roy Hodgson’s plans to turn promise into progress. Only Huddersfield have scored fewer goals in the Premier League this season and a test of Palace’s patience and confidence lies ahead with Arsenal, Chelsea, Tottenham and Manchester United to play in the next four games. “My mindset will be to continue doing what we are doing,” Hodgson said. “In the last few games we have not been staring down the barrel of the gun in terms of the opponents scoring but we can do more ourselves.” Andy HunterXherdan Shaqiri, in his first 90-minute display for Liverpool in the Premier League on Saturday, brought welcome creativity to the team’s midfield without shirking defensive duties. He was given a deeper role than the one he is accustomed to but he was “absolutely OK” according to Jürgen Klopp. “It’s an interesting position,” said the player himself. “I don’t play it often but maybe I have more of the ball there.” He is, then, a useful option for Wednesday’s Champions League game against Red Star Belgrade – for more than one reason. After being fined by Fifa for a double-headed eagle celebration after scoring against Serbia for Switzerland during the World Cup, the Kosovo-born player says Wednesday’s fixture carries no extra significance for him beyond the three points. “Maybe there are going to be some people who will whistle at me but I treat every game the same,” he says. “It’s just a football game. Sport is not politics.” Paul Doyle• Match report: Huddersfield 0-1 Liverpool• Klopp regrets Liverpool’s lack of final-ball finesse at HuddersfieldManchester City have now kept five league clean sheets in a row. Admittedly the last was against an outclassed Burnley but the one before that was at Anfield and Pep Guardiola is pleased at the way his defence has tightened up. “We are not giving away any goals, we are not even giving away chances,” the City manager said. “Burnley had no attempts on target, at Liverpool they had maybe one. We have been solid.” Greater tests will arrive in the next couple of weeks but City can also take heart from the fact that their five goals came from five different scorers. “We have more attacking options now,” Guardiola said. He can say that again. Kevin De Bruyne made his comeback in this match, Raheem Sterling was an unused substitute and Riyad Mahrez is going to take some shifting after a wonderful goal capped his most convincing performance since leaving Leicester. Paul WilsonHow will West Ham be feeling now the dust has settled on their defeat by Tottenham? Almost certainly they will feel positive, and with some measure of just cause. Tactically, Manuel Pellegrini’s team were well set up and in the first half had success with their ploy of quickly springing the ball inside Spurs’ full-backs. That approach was ultimately scuppered by the untimely injury to Andriy Yarmolenko but, while the home side lost some of their attacking edge, they stayed solid throughout (not always something that could be said of them in recent years). Issa Diop gave Harry Kane no quarter and once again Declan Rice cruised through the game at the base of midfield. Add Marko Arnautovic, who just gets better and better and deserved a goal, and West Ham have a spine that – if it stays fit – gives rational grounds for ongoing optimism. Paul MacInnes• Match report: West Ham 0-1 Tottenham• Spurs’ Sissoko emerges from shadows with a crucial assist“It’s a good question,” admitted Nuno Espírito Santo. The Wolves manager had just been asked whether the surprise defeat by Watford would encourage him to shuffle his pack for their trip to Brighton on Saturday, having previously opted to field the same starting XI for all nine Premier League matches so far. But while there is certainly no need for him to panic yet, the under-par first-half display at Molineux that saw Wolves concede two goals inside a minute would have been concerning for the former goalkeeper. The 3-4-3 formation that has served them so well relies on João Moutinho and Rúben Neves dominating central midfield but they were overpowered by the physicality of Abdoulaye Doucouré and Étienne Capoue on Saturday. If his side is going to maintain its excellent start to life in the top flight, Nuno may need to find a plan B for when the tide is against them.

Raphaël Varane’s handball had actually been in the area, VAR decided, so instead of a free-kick it was a penalty, which was why just 14 minutes into this weekend’s opening game, Levante were 2-0 up at the Santiago Bernabéu, Real Madrid heading for another defeat and Roger Martí heading for the south-west corner, celebrating. On the opposite touchline Madrid’s manager stood motionless, hands in his pockets, gone. A few rows above, at that precise moment, someone tapped the president on the shoulder and gave him a phone. Florentino Pérez took it, looked at the screen, lifted it to his ear, and a million memes were born: bring me the head of Julen Lopetegui.Monday is Lopetegui’s 131st day as manager of Madrid. It may also be his last. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow but one day and soon, he will be sacked. The same lack of alternatives and time that helped put him in the job in the first place are all that keep him in the job. It’s not easy to find the man to replace him or the moment to do it: Madrid play in the Champions League on Tuesday on Sunday they face Barcelona. That match – the first clásico without Messi or Ronaldo for a decade – becomes even more of a defining moment than usual, a reason both to wait and to act: in some odd way, the only thing as bad as losing to Barcelona is beating them with Lopetegui still there. Let the clásico decide, sure, but what if it decides the wrong thing?So, let’s just check … yep, still there. Or maybe not by the time you read this. But for now there he is, wearing shades, leading training in the sunshine, even though he knows Madrid have suspected he was the wrong man for a while and became even more convinced this weekend – it’s not just that faith is lost, and with remarkable speed, that’s a recurring problem it’s that the lack of faith is shared, conveyed through public voices, increasing the pressure and widening fault lines that preferences are pushed and players are swiftly aware, losing faith as he loses authority.There’s another, fundamental reason. Foundational, in fact: there wasn’t that much faith to start with. And since then the accusations against Lopetegui have accumulated, some familiar themes: he didn’t play 18-year-old Vinícius Júnior he was indulgent of a squad some in power mistrust, Sergio Ramos particularly the team are not in great physical condition he has rotated Keylor Navas and Thibaut Courtois and failed to define a starting XI. Saturday’s team – no Bale, Benzema, or Kroos, Vinícius not in the squad – was especially striking, like the last gesture of a condemned man. On the touchline in Vitoria he ranted, wild as his team lost to Alavés this time he seemed resigned to it, no fight left. Only there he is now, saying he will “fight”.There was no other way. Time became too tight. It’s only nine weeks into the season but the regret at some levels of the club now is having waited this long. Meanwhile, names continue to emerge – it’s a fortnight since Antonio Conte was called. He has a court case with Chelsea pending, and soon. Persuading Zinedine Zidane to return is an idea some clung to someone like him, from within, is another. Xabi Alonso and Raúl don’t yet have the full qualifications, but could join an experienced coach. Santiago Solari, in charge at Castilla, does. Roberto Martínez, Michael Laudrup, Laurent Blanc, the list goes on (how long before Jogi Löw and Arsène Wenger join it?)The need grows more pressing, too. When Varane handled the ball the ball on Saturday, he requested the referee look again, hoping he would change his mind. VAR looked at the scene, not the crime, offering up a lesson that things can always get worse, and for Madrid they have. Beaten in Seville, beaten in Moscow, beaten in Vitoria, they were beaten again by Levante. There’s been an impotence about them, a fatalism that grows with each minute: worse and worse. When Marcelo scored on Saturday it finally ended a wait that had felt eternal: it was their first goal for eight hours and one minute, supposedly the longest drought in their entire history until someone finally noticed one of the games during their previous “best” in 1985 had gone to extra time.This then, isn’t the worst Madrid ever, after all. It’s still bad, though. “This team is in ruins,” ran the cover of Marca on Sunday. AS called it a “total write-off”. Marcelo’s goal, with 18 minutes left, 13 minutes short of that actual record, was their first in a month, and it proved worthless. Defeated again, Madrid have lost three in a row and four of their last five – and they didn’t win the fifth either, a 0-0 draw with Atlético. Even the game before that run, their 1-0 win over Eyol, hadn’t impressed. The one before that, by contrast, really had: their 3-0 win over Roma suggested a new identity could be forged, only to be quickly forgotten. Lopetegui has lost as many competitive games as he has won. He has five defeats in his 12 games in charge.A post-World Cup season often poses extra problems. Lopetegui did not get the players he wanted: there was no replacement for Mateo Kovacic or Cristiano Ronaldo, whose importance may even have been underestimated. There have been injuries. With Neymar the only player they were prepared to spend big on and the realities of the market shifting, the squad has got weaker over the last three years – even if it is certainly strong enough to be better than this. This season has been bad, but it’s not so out of keeping with last season, when they finished 17 points behind Barcelona. At this point last year, week nine, they had been beaten by Betis and held by Valencia and Levante in week 10 Girona beat them. Barcelona won the clásico 3-0.Lopetegui has talked about “a culmination of misfortune”: if it wasn’t for bad luck, he wouldn’t have any luck at all. There may be something in that even if it doesn’t entirely convince and his Madrid career was born under a bad sign, that’s for sure. This goes back to the beginning, and beyond – the inception of it all. That everything has happened quickly shouldn’t hide the fact that it runs deep.Life comes at you fast. Barely seconds after Madrid won their third consecutive European Cup, before they’d even collected the trophy, Ronaldo said he was going. A few minutes later, Gareth Bale said he might be too. Before either of them actually had, Zinedine Zidane did. Five days after Kiev, he resigned. In part because he could, but there was a warning there too: he spoke of the need for a change. He knew there were problems, knew that this was unsustainable. Ronaldo did leave, taking more than goals with him Inter hoped Modric would follow.Sitting alongside him, Pérez looked defeated. He had not expected this. During the previous season he had expressed doubts about Zidane, and those whispers had reached his manager, but there had been no plans for this to happen, no expectation that he would resign. Thrust into a situation they had not foreseen, Madrid were under pressure and in a hurry with no candidate and nowhere to turn. They needed to get a manager and announce him, to fill the void and reduce the uncertainty. Mauricio Pochettino couldn’t leave Spurs. Max Allegri turned it down: follow Zidane? No thanks. Jürgen Klopp was impossible. Löw too. Few doors were open and those that were swiftly closed.Lopetegui was some way down the list – fifth, sixth, maybe lower – and was about to lead Spain into the World Cup. He was in Russia, two days before the tournament began, when Madrid announced it, the new Federation president Luis Rubiales, under intense pressure too, furiously claiming he’d been given just five minutes’ warning, not even afforded the margin to minimise the damage. The cost for the coach was colossal. Rubiales flew south, stayed up all night, and sacked Lopetegui the next day, sending him home in silence, barely able to believe it had played out like this. The following day, he was presented at Madrid: there was an hour’s difference between the press conference he gave in Spain and the one he had been supposed to give, 3,569km away in Sochi.Lopetegui thought the chance to manage Madrid would never come again the chance to manage Spain at the World Cup certainly won’t, and even back then it was easy, if cruel, to envisage a moment six months further down the line when he was inevitably sacked at Madrid and wondered: I gave up all that for this?! His might have been the chronicle of a death foretold what few imagined was the story would quite so quickly unfold.He knew the risk, but embraced the opportunity. Momentarily, he appeared to be winning. Over the last month, though, Madrid began losing, defeats racking up, the sense of impotence growing with every missed chance. On Saturday there were 34 of them: they hit the bar, the post and the goalkeeper. By then, that seemed almost inevitable, like fatalism had taken over. “I have more energy than ever,” he said on Saturday, but his words were empty “if you’re looking for a sunken man, don’t look at me,” he said on Monday, but that’s what most had seen two days before. It was as if he already knew as if they all did.“We’re with the manager to the death,” Sergio Ramos and Marcelo said. The question is: whose death? The answer, they know, is his.• “The league is lovely,” Diego Simeone said. The table’s pretty special, that’s for sure. A Barcelona city one and two. Just two points between the top five. Six points between the top 10. One in which Valencia, Champions League representatives, have won just one and Villarreal, Europa League representatives, haven’t won at home. In which Valladolid have not lost away, and are in a European place. In which Madrid aren’t. Where two teams who are yet to lose away are within a point of relegation. And Getafe, Levante and Betis are all within two points of Madrid. In which Eyol and Alavés are second and third and six different teams could go top next week. In which Barcelona are top now, but at the cost of Messi breaking his arm, meaning that he’s going to be out for three weeks. “It’s fantastic,” Simeone said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f52580988670041f9037fddce66d67eda4745921/0_0_3186_2123/master/3186.jpg?width=1010\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=94463240eeb3f0219c4d91f18a6c1859 2020w","title":"girl who didnt hide overcoming odds burkina faso tetra amelia syndrome","story":"Born with a rare condition that affects limb development, Wendabo was disowned by her father and shunned by neighbours. Now the 12-year-old is at school and thriving, thanks to local supportAngèle Bouda was walking through the market in Gogo, near the district capital Manga, when she saw the crowd. People were gathered around, clapping a young girl with severe disabilities who was dancing to music as her mother collected money from onlookers.Bouda, who works with disabled people, was intrigued by the little family and stayed behind to talk to Wendabo, aged eight at the time, and her mother Pascaline. It is unusual for disabled children in Burkina Faso to be so visible normally, Bouda’s team have to go door to door to find children who are kept hidden away.Wendoba has tetra-amelia syndrome, a rare genetic condition that affects limb development in the womb. Pascaline’s husband blamed his wife for their daughter’s disabilities and left soon after the girl was born. As she grew older, Wendabo’s dancing became the family’s main source of income. “On big market days, she could bring in 5,000 CFAs (£6.70) in a day, on smaller ones it would be two or three thousand,” says Pascaline. “I was disappointed at first when he left, but who else is going to take care of my baby if he won’t? I had to get on with it.”The family rent their hut for 2,000 CFA a month. It’s a stretch, both financially and physically. Wendabo, her two sisters and their mother, unable to fit inside together, often sleep in the open, even in the rainy season.When Bouda first met the family, none of the girls were in school. To prepare for Wendabo to go to school, through its community-based rehabilitation programme, the NGO Light for the World provided physio and a wheelchair, helped with teacher training, provided an access ramp for her classroom and sought to raise awareness among her fellow pupils. Today, Wendabo is a lively schoolgirl, popular and outgoing.“It was difficult at the beginning, it was the first time I’d encountered such a child. But I knew, as she is God’s creature, I should accept her in class,” says Eboubié Kamouni, her teacher for the past four years.In a class of 74, learning is inevitably teacher-centred, attention maintained with the crack of a stick on a desk, as pupils write and calculate in French rather than the Mooré language they speak at home.Wendabo writes with her stumps rather than her prosthetics, finding it easier, and her mother has been shown daily exercises with which she can help her.It takes time to establish a working relationship with parents some mothers initially fear their child may be taken away from them. Pascaline was used to coping alone. On the day Wendabo was born, a neighbour dropped in to visit. Even though her contractions had started, Pascaline did what she could not to let them show until her visitor left.“When the child started to appear, I lifted myself up and I could see that she didn’t have hands, just two upper arms. I continued pushing and when she came out, I noticed that she had no lower limbs either.”Pascaline cleaned up the newborn to show her husband. But he would not touch his daughter and hasn’t to this day.Neighbours in the community were curious to see the new baby that Pascaline named “will of God”, even as others labelled her a monster. There were rumours that the father and a local official would “get rid of her”, until Pascaline felt she had no choice but to move away. So began several itinerant years, until the family settled in the small hut in the village of Kaolin.When Wendabo did begin school, her teacher says, her attendance wasn’t regular and support workers realised she was still going to market to dance and beg. They talked with Pascaline and worked out a solution for an alternative source of income. She was given a canopy, pots and pans to set up a cooked rice market stall.Wendabo’s elder sister, Wendami, 16, used to push her wheelchair down the rough footpath to school. But Wendami has left school. Older than her classmates, and with the overcrowding at home, she’s had to move to her father’s place near the mine where he works. She’s looking forward to coming home permanently.Wendkouni has stepped in as her sister’s escort. Now seven, she was at first too young to start school, so she waited under a tree while Wendabo was in class until support workers persuaded the school director to admit her early. Teachers say she’s flourishing.Now 12, Wendabo says she likes school, being sociable and making friends and wants to be a teacher when she’s older.Once embedded in the school community, the next challenge was to improve Wendabo’s living conditions. It took four years of patient negotiations to find somewhere better. A local priest convinced an elderly gentleman to give the family a small plot of land not far from their current hut. The new breeze block house is modest, but rainproof, with a small area to grow beans, okra and peanuts. The family will move in a few weeks, after their millet is harvested.Light for the World and a local partner, the Organisation Catholique pour le Développement et la Solidarité, raised 261,300 CFA to build the little house.Wendabo’s mother aspires for her to become a respected member of their community, and to be able to take care of herself and her mother in her old age.Emmanuel Guigma is one of Wendabo’s modestly paid support workers. “Today you can see how Wendabo is a genuine centre of interest at school. Children with a disability suffer so much, as all too often people reject them – as Wendabo’s father did – and they remain isolated at home.“What motivates me to walk door to door in communities to help them is to see her newfound independence. I want to help protect children like her so that they are accepted. To see her empowerment and integration quite simply makes me happy.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c92a3f220bdd1c99c8cb10d823b6bc1fa1eda3e9/0_87_1733_1040/master/1733.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f1cef98ebb03bf4e9f0aab975a46e79f","title":"is my child old enough for a mobile phone","story":"No matter when parents choose to entrust their offspring with a smartphone – and it very much depends on the child in question – there’s agreement that boundaries about usage must be establishedThere are many milestones in the relationship between parents and their children. The first step. The first word. The first time they turn to you and say: “Please stop, you are embarrassing me.” To these, we can now add the moment a parent solemnly hands their child their first mobile phone. But what’s the right age for this to happen? According to Dr Linda Papadopoulos – a child psychologist and ambassador for Internet Matters, a not-for-profit organisation dedicated to children’s online security – the beginning of secondary school is a good starting point. “It makes them contactable and means they can get in touch with their parents if things go wrong,” she says. “A lot of their peers will get a phone at that age, so it means they can communicate with their friends and feel part of that.” Some believe that the right age may be even earlier. The moment when children start travelling alone on a regular basis is a commonly recommended start point for a phone – which in some cases could be a year or two before or after they start secondary school. Sean Hargrave, a tech journalist and father of three, says: “It’s when your children are spending more time on their own. Their independence and geographic borders start to widen, so it makes sense to trust them with a smartphone.” Statistics suggest that most parents tend to agree that secondary school is the right age for a phone, with a July 2018 survey of 1,000 parents by Tesco Mobile concluding that the mean age most think a child should have their first phone is 11. But a mobile is more than just a phone, it offers access to a multitude of information and ideas. Much of this is positive – a child can use the phone to look up bus timetables and talk to friends, as well as let adults know when they require the parental taxi service – but parents still need to remain engaged, continually talking to children about their internet use and monitoring the sites they access and the amount of time they are online. For this reason, some experts suggest that there’s no such thing as a right age for a phone, with it depending entirely on the inidual child, the parents and the circumstances.  “When a child first receives a smartphone is a parent’s choice,” says Andy Burrows, head of child safety online at the NSPCC – which has introduced a guide to children’s online safety called Net Aware. “What’s most important is that mums, dads and carers have early conversations with their children.” For Papadopoulos, it is essential to have these conversations. These shouldn’t be lectures, but instead should encourage a child to think critically. “Until now, they will mainly have communicated face-to-face now they are communicating using texts, memes and emojis. What does it mean if they send a picture to one friend and not another? How do group chat dynamics work? Invite them to talk to you and think about these things.”  Having seen three children reach an age where they are entrusted with a phone, Hargrave has had some testing moments, but also feels children get a lot from their new devices. “They are using them for so many different things – they might be playing games, making films, watching TV, chatting to friends, researching homework,” says Hargrave. “It’s not just sitting in an armchair tapping screens. One of my kids makes films, another does arty stuff, one researches astronomy. They are a force for good, it’s just about having parameters.” And once the boundaries are established, children will be better equipped to enjoy their new device no matter what their age. Encouraging a healthy dynamic around mobile phone usage might even be easier if children get their first phone at a younger age. Hargrave believes that retaining parental access to the phone is essential, which is easier to do with an 11-year-old than a teenager. “The phone is a great safety device and it’s also great for them to communicate with their peers, but you need to keep an eye on it,” he says. “You need to have a conversation, let them know you will look at their phone periodically. You should only do it when they are there and the phone is in front of you. It’s not right to rifle around behind their backs.” It’s natural for parents to worry about their child in any new situation, and mobiles are no exception. While that can be mitigated by the use of parental controls and location tracking, these technological solutions don’t absolve parents from the responsibility of parenting. “We know that this is something parents worry about,” says Papadopoulos. “Up to now, everything the child has done the parent will have done first. But now the child will be using apps the parents have never heard of. It can make us feel insecure. But you do need to engage. You can’t just say: ‘I don’t understand.’ That’s not good enough. You need to understand, you need to get on the apps and figure them out for yourself.”Visit Tesco Mobile for more information and content on families and mobile"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a1d46ed8f254cd42e43d3462d33d479d30a479c/0_384_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=55eb7ee5e3effe9648f7f54c0b1db999","title":"how to curate the perfect instagram profile according to teens","story":"There are many ways to mess up as an Instagrammer – trying too hard, putting ‘lol’ in your captions or going crazy with your edits – but with these tips from teenage snappers you’ll soon be totting up the likesEight years ago, Instagram had 1 million users and one single, simple party trick. The photo-sharing app revolutionised smartphone photography by giving users a series of filters. You could flick through your options (moody Sierra, cosy Nashville, or nostalgic Valencia?) and in an instant everyone was able to look like a professional photographer.Don’t ‘over back’ it “The biggest mistake people make when uploading pictures is effectively ‘over backing’ the image,” explains Francesca, a 16-year-old with just over 1,000 followers. “This is when someone over-edits the photo and the result is tacky.”This is such a key lesson to learn that if Instagram had a constitution, “Don’t over-edit” would be the No 1 rule, and the punishment would be zero likes. “A lot of people put way too many filters on a picture,” says Vinnie Cohen, a 14-year-old with nearly 2,500 followers.“I used to want to go out with loads of cameras and stuff but it’s too much, the image looks forced, it looks too professional, it doesn’t look authentic.”Don’t mess up the captionA picture is worth a thousand words, but sometimes words are worth a thousand pictures (which are worth a thousand words). So it’s important to make sure that you get the caption right.“Never say ‘cool’ or ‘lol’ – that’s so five years ago,” advises Molly Gibson, a 14-year-old who uses the app to post pictures of her friends. “And don’t like comments on other people’s posts – it makes you look like a stalker with loads of free time.”Francesca’s most popular post was a simple shot in her family home, but she believes it got so many likes because the caption was about saying goodbye to her friends after her GCSEs. “The best captions tell a story,” she says.Download editing appsThe Instagram filter is dead – long live the non-Instagram filter. Isla Brewer, a 15-year-old with roughly 2,000 followers, recommends VCSO and Afterlight as alternative editing apps.“The best filters on Afterlight for me are Woods, Flora and Cape,” she says. “On VSCO, my favourite filters are A6, HB1 and P5.” If that sounds a little complicated, don’t worry – Isla says pictures with no filter are “a huge thing right now”.If you forgo the filter, Isla recommends Snapseed to make small adjustments for brightness and contrast. “The Selective tool is also very useful if there are certain parts of the image you need to make adjustments to,” she says. “I always try to crop my pictures 4x5, because then it takes up more space on the feed.”Forgo a theme – and think in threesA few short years ago, anyone who was anyone had an Instagram “theme”. In short, this meant all their pictures matched a certain aesthetic – the same colours, borders, or angles were used in every shot. Nowadays, however, it’s all about the rule of threes.“The best tip I can give for curation is to remember your profile shows your photos in sets of threes,” Francesca says, “so it is important to make sure sets of three images look good together and don’t clash – it can ruin your profile.”The most important thing to remember – Molly says – is that you shouldn’t “spam” your followers by posting too much. “Otherwise people will get bored and you won’t get as many likes.”Location, location, locationIn case it needs stating, the backdrop for your photo is important. “The colours in your picture do have to semi-match,” warns Vinnie. “Obviously you’ve got to match your background with your outfit a little bit.” The teen advises against “random colours all over the place” and “loads of random people in the background”.Isla adds that angles are everything. “Before I take any pictures, the first thing I’ll do is take a look on Pinterest to give me ideas for poses and backgrounds. Then I’ll take a few practice shots.“I like to take around 100-200 photos before making a decision.”Get time on your sideAll agree there’s little more important than the timing for uploading your photo.“It’s important to post your photo when your followers are most likely to be on their phone,” Francesca says. That means first thing in the morning or at night (Isla likes to post between 6pm and 8pm).“If you don’t do this your post will most likely be ‘drowned’ by other people’s.”Be yourselfVinnie worries that popular posts are often devoid of personality, and is working hard to make sure his pictures say more about him and his life.“I know a lot of people who go out of their way to take pictures, but for me I feel like you get a much purer image of what you want from just finding it in your daily routine,” he says.“I want to portray an image that I feel is true to what I am, instead of just what people want to see.”Visit Tesco Mobile for more information and content on families and mobile"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/53efb5bcbe0e31b0cd8cd53a12a39d55b697f039/1167_388_793_476/master/793.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a83244ae88d43ef66f040b233427c664","title":"teens without screens one familys attempt to rein in mobile phone usage","story":"How would writer  John Lewis and his family fare when they tried to limit their mobile phone usage? We challenged him to limit his family’s mobile usage for a week. Could it bring them closer? This is his diary.SaturdayWe are sitting down to dinner, all four of us, something that only happens a few times a week. My 13-year-old son Harry has his headphones on and is giggling at a YouTube video on his phone, occasionally getting cables caught up in his fork. My 16-year-old daughter Laurie is also multitasking as she eats, scrolling through memes on Instagram and getting flecks of fish curry on her screen.This is no way to eat a meal.My wife and I once tried restricting mobile phone use. We turned off the wifi at night, but my children used their phones in bed and ate through their data allowance in a couple of days. Looking at my family, though, it’s obvious we need to address the situation again. This time, we’ll do it using the “contract” about family phone usage that Tesco Mobile has devised with family tech expert Andy Robertson.“Right,” I announce, in my best Victorian Father voice. “The entire family is going to reduce its reliance on mobiles.”After much mocking laughter, we eventually agree on some basic rules. No phones at the dinner table. We will try to limit our mobile phone use. The children won’t accept friend requests from – or talk online to – anyone they don’t know. And this time, to avoid nocturnal data problems, everyone will leave their phone in another room when it comes to bedtime.SundaySitting on the sofa, I realise that I am baffled by what my children really do while pretending to watch their favourite TV shows.“What are you actually looking at?” I ask my daughter, whose face is glued to her phone.“Just … stuff. Instagram. Tumblr. WhatsApp. I can’t actually watch TV on its own. I have to have something else to do.”“This,” says my wife, “is why I used to smoke.”To distract our children from their phones, we play board games for the evening. It actually works – although, after an hour of hilarity and excitement, the game descends into rage, bitterness and tantrums.MondayWe are on holiday abroad. Within minutes of stopping at a restaurant or museum, the children have worked out the wifi password and are busy scrolling through Instagram and watching YouTube videos.So we pledge to completely avoid phone use when out and about. For a couple of hours, this is great – they engage with the sights, photograph buildings, ask questions and patiently listen as I bluff my answers. And then we get hopelessly lost and end up having to resort to Google Maps to navigate our way around the city.TuesdayIt is evening in the holiday apartment, and we play cards. As the only games we can actually play are Snap and Go Fish, we try to learn the rules to poker. Of course, we have to look them up online, on our phones, and have to repeatedly check back on whether a flush beats a straight.WednesdayWe continue our lengthy poker session. My wife and I are surprised when my son clarifies some of the more arcane rules and then explains, in great detail, how to play a variant of poker called Texas hold ‘em. It turns out that he has been playing a Texas hold ‘em app on his phone for much of the day. We have unwittingly created a gambling expert.ThursdayThanks to this experiment making me engage with my children’s phone usage far more, I realise that I now know what my children actually do on their phones. My son plays ridiculous shoot-em-up games, discovers obscure music on Spotify and YouTube, and watches endless drumming tutorials. He is also adept at quickly looking up information to use as ammunition in an argument, making him invariably right about all sorts of things.My daughter is scrolling through endless memes on social media and watching episodes of John Oliver and Trevor Noah giggling at comedy videos about history or playing logic puzzles or quizzes on the Sporcle website.During our holiday she read an entire playscript in German on her phone. Frankly, this is a relief. My wife and I have long lived in fear that dark forces on the internet could be preying on her, so we’re far happier with the German theatre discovery.FridayThe week is now over. Cutting down on phone use has not been easy. You realise how reliant we are on them for things such as maps and basic information.But I’ve realised something: there’s no problem with this. The problem is the kind of listless, passive reliance on your mobile for the sake of it. Restricting phone use actually reminds you that the internet is quite amazing. You could be learning Italian on Duolingo, teaching yourself how to change the oil in your car using an online tutorial, reading thousands of academic papers, or watching countless arts documentaries.I pick up my phone, flick through social media and consider getting into a furious political argument with someone on Twitter. Instead, I put the phone away and start reading a book. I should do this more often.Photography: Laura McCluskey for Visit Tesco Mobile for more information and content on families and mobile"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b779d08d21d8f1ead6a47e388f85c203e479b05f/76_173_5176_3105/master/5176.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b717f303f62c5d71625f010f098df632","title":"cant sleep perhaps youre overtired","story":"Nerina Ramlakhan remembers when her daughter was a toddler, and how if she got too tired she would be unable to switch off. “There was a healthy level of tiredness,” she says. “But if she went beyond that, she would be running on a kind of false energy. And then she wouldn’t be able to switch off when she went to bed.”Overtiredness is recognised the world over in young children – but it is seemingly more and more common in adults. Dr Ramlakhan should know: she is a sleep psychologist and is increasingly seeing people who remind her of her little girl when she was younger.There’s certainly an irony that in our sophisticated, hi-tech, busy world we appear to be reverting to behaviour that we recognise and know how to treat in kids, but are somehow failing to deal with as adults. Overtiredness, sleep experts agree, is down to our always-on existence. In the past, says Ramlakhan, the author of The Little Book of Sleep, our days had naturally built-in downtime that gave us short snatches of rest. Today, that has disappeared for many of us. “We have become restless as a society – and that places more demands on us when we get into bed at night,” she says. “We have lost the rituals and practices that gave us little respites during the day. In the past, you would go to the supermarket and, while you were waiting in the queue, you’d daydream, be a bit bored, look around. Now, any window like that will be filled by looking at your phone, answering some emails, sorting out your Amazon account.”You may think you are putting the time to good use – but that’s not how your brain interprets it. There’s a complex neurophysiology that requires breaks in tasks and concentration if it’s constantly bombarded, the brain becomes overloaded. The result, says Ramlakhan, is that it goes into what we might call survival mode: it assumes that something bad is about to happen, it ups the adrenaline and it puts out an urgent call for sugary snacks to provide quick-release energy.And there’s more: if your brain has become tuned to always reaching for the next thing to do, to never taking a moment to just pause and rest, then it will gradually become harder and harder to switch off at night. It’s almost as if we’re losing the ability to let go and the biggest letting-go of all is falling asleep, which Ramlakhan describes as an act of trust. “There’s a growing tendency to hold on, to keep on going, and it’s manifesting in our sleep patterns as well. People say to me that they feel they’re on the edge of sleep all night. They’re getting up in the morning feeling exhausted. They say they keep waking up at night and can’t get back to sleep. But it’s normal to wake up at night most of the time, we just go back to sleep.”What are the signs that you may be overtired? If you get into bed at night and find your mind is still racing with what has been going on through the day, overtiredness could be to blame. During the day, you may find it difficult to concentrate or to see the wood for the trees in your professional and your personal lives. You perhaps catch a lot of colds, especially when you’re winding down for a holiday. You’re irritable and you find yourself reaching for sugary snacks to keep yourself going during the day.Vik Veer is an ear, nose and throat consultant who specialises in sleep apnoea. But he has become something of a sleep expert because so many people who consult him turn out to have different sleep issues, including – he believes – overtiredness. “It’s about struggling to survive on less sleep than you really need,” he says. “We’re talking about people who typically have coffee in the morning to wake themselves up and then alcohol in the evening to try to switch themselves off for sleep. They’re those people who seem to just about get by – because if you do it enough, your body habituates to it. You see people looking haggard and tired, and only just making it through.”Who is at particular risk of overtiredness? Veer says thirty- and fortysomethings are especially vulnerable: they often have a great deal on their plates and they feel they have to keep on going, however tough the terrain. They are less likely than older people to build breaks and switch-off time into their days they have high expectations of their social life as well as their professional life, so a busy day at the office is followed by a busy evening out in a bar or meeting friends.Even when they fall into bed at night, they remember that TV programme everyone is talking about, which they didn’t have time to see when it was on the telly. So, they decide to spend another hour watching the first of the box set and then a second and before they turn out the light, they reach again for their phone for a quick update on messages and news.No wonder it has all gone pear-shaped for sleep: what we are doing, says the consultant clinical psychologist Dr Anna Symonds, who works in Nottinghamshire, is inverting Maslow’s hierarchy of needs. In 1943, the American psychologist put physiological requirements, including sleep, food, water and shelter, at the bottom of his pyramid self-actualisation, such as seeking happiness, pursuing a goal, using our talents, are at the top. Today, we are inverting the triangle: we prioritise the top elements and skimp on what’s lower down. As it is harder to go without food, water and shelter, we have decided sleep is expendable.But it’s not – and overtiredness is one of the signs that we are getting it wrong. Paradoxically, another society-wide symptom, says Ramlakhan, is our communal obsession with sleep. “We’re sleeping in better conditions than ever before we know more about it than ever before we have better duvets, more comfortable pillows,” she says. So, it’s not the mechanics of sleep that are failing us it’s our inability to pace our day and to understand that some of the business of rest at night is actually done during the day – and especially during the evening.How do we banish overtiredness? Symonds says we need to look at how we deal with the condition in kids and put the same wisdom to use in our own lives. “We’re good at knowing we should limit screen time for our children, but not so good with ourselves,” she says. Veer recommends sleep hygiene techniques, especially cutting out coffee in the second half of the day and having a wind-down routine, just as children do. Ramlakhan says we should also drink more water, get to bed earlier at least three nights a week – maybe as early as 9.30pm – and, crucially, cultivate a rather more healthy relationship with our technology.We are, after all, mere toddlers in the digital world like little kids who don’t know when they have had enough chocolate. We haven’t learned as a society when to say no to being “always on” – and overtiredness is one of the many consequences."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c7b7f0d79bb88472ca555f7e6be2252d21df48d2/237_620_2619_1571/master/2619.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=077e081755e3f15bd5aa1e8beaf01aa1","title":"simon mayo to leave radio 2 drivetime show","story":"Mayo to focus on book deal and 5 Live film show as Whiley moves to an evening slotSimon Mayo and Jo Whiley are to leave the BBC Radio 2 Drivetime show, as part of a shake-up at the UK’s most popular radio station.Mayo has hosted the show since 2010, but tensions are thought to have arisen after the addition of Jo Whiley as a co-presenter for the 5pm-8pm slot in May, which prompted a backlash from listeners.Whiley will remain with the station but move to a 7pm-9pm slot from January, meaning Radio 2 requires a new team of Drivetime presenters.Whiley was the only female presenter on the Radio 2 daytime schedule, and the station will come under pressure to appoint another woman to the role, with Sara Cox likely to be considered.Mayo will continue to work with the BBC – including the 5 Live film show he co-presents with Mark Kermode – but said he would instead concentrate on his two-book deal with the publisher Transworld.“Radio 2 has been a quite wonderful experience – my happiest in radio I think – but new adventures beckon and I cannot wait to get started,” said Mayo.He later tweeted: “Maybe it needs to be said, maybe not but so there is no room for argument I’ll be clear. I’ve loved working with the exceptional Jo Whiley and when the show was ‘reconfigured’ she was my first and only choice. Some of the abuse she has had here has been appalling. Support for a show is one thing, assaulting the dignity of a warmhearted and loyal friend is another.”Whiley said Mayo was a “great friend” and said of her move to an evening slot: “I’m very much looking forward to hosting a new show for a new year which will have music at the very heart of it as well as guests and live sessions. Dream show, actually. Can’t wait!”The station’s Breakfast show host, Chris Evans, was poached by Virgin Radio this year. He will be replaced by Zoë Ball.Mayo has written a trilogy of children’s novels and the first one, Itch, is to be adapted by ABC Television in Australia later this year.

The Indian academic, who holds a British residence permit, never got further than the Wizz Air check-in desk at Luton airport. Staff told him he could not travel without a visa and refused to check him in even when he produced an email from the Georgian embassy confirming that British residence permit holders are exempt from visas for short stays.Warrier had to return home to Cambridge while his travel companions took off without him. “Wizz Air staff did not accept responsibility and said it was between the Georgian embassy and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO),” Warrier says. “The FCO said it is a matter between Wizz Air and the passenger.” The airline refunded Warrier after the Observer intervened and a spokesperson admits he was incorrectly barred due to “a misunderstanding with travel documentation”.Warrier’s ordeal is not an isolated one. Airlines face a fine of between €3,000 (£2,640) and €5,000 if they are found to have flown non-EU nationals who have inadequate or forged documentation into the European Economic Area. In the same way that banks dodge potential anti-money-laundering penalties by freezing accounts of customers from countries deemed risky, it would seem that some airlines are overcautious – or under-informed – when faced with travel documents other than an EU passport in order to avoid a penalty.In March, the Observer highlighted the plight of Ibrahim Wako (not his real name) and his young family who were turned away at the departure gate at Gatwick by easyJet staff as they were about to board a flight to Berlin. Wako had successfully passed through immigration control with his UK travel document, issued by the Home Office to stateless refugees and asylum seekers, but easyJet staff insisted he needed a visa. Wako, along with his pregnant wife and two toddlers, who have British passports, had to retrieve their luggage and return home after seven hours at the airport.When he visited the German embassy the next day to apply for a visa he was told he did not require one. EasyJet was unmoved and pointed him to the TravelDoc website – which also confirmed that he did not need a visa. EasyJet refused to refund the cost of the tickets or pay “denied boarding” compensation, claiming that airlines could deny boarding at their discretion. “I believe the decision was based on racial profiling and discrimination,” Wako says. “We have had to put our travels on hold as this has made us very wary.”EasyJet eventually paid up, six weeks later, after the Observer got involved, and it blamed “a misunderstanding with travel documentation”.It is small wonder that airlines appear to be worried. Under EU rules, they have to fly a passenger back to the country they flew from if they are refused entry to their destination country and governments impose fines if they are found to have travelled with invalid paperwork. Carriers are also obliged to assume responsibility for passengers who are turned back from a border until they can return them to their starting point, potentially including footing bills for accommodation or healthcare. The rules emerged from the 1985 Schengen agreement, which, in abolishing internal border checks, effectively appointed airline staff as immigration controllers.The UK government set the fine at £2,000 per inadequately documented arrival (IDA) in the 1999 Immigration and Asylum Act. Last year, 5,791 IDAs arrived in the UK and 1,195 fines totalling nearly £2.5m were imposed on airlines that were deemed responsible, even though many of the travellers had passed successfully through national border controls.Critics claim the rules privatise immigration controls and put onerous responsibility on airline staff who lack the expertise of border police. They also disproportionately affect ethnic minority travellers and refugees. Amnesty International argues that those obliged to flee their homeland are often unable to obtain proper documentation in time.“Imposing liabilities on carriers gravely increases risks of arbitrariness and racial discrimination, by providing a strong incentive, even licence, for carriers and their employees to refuse passage on the basis of suspicion and prejudice to avoid the risk of a fine or other penalty,” says Steve Valdez-Symonds of Amnesty International UK.The Home Office insists holding airlines liable for immigration breaches is justified. “Passengers who travel to the UK with inadequate documentation can incur a significant cost to the UK taxpayer,” it says. “The government works closely with carriers and provides training to help prevent this.”Figures suggest the sanctions led to a sharp drop in the number of IDAs in the UK in the first 10 years after they were imposed, but the Home Office is concerned that the numbers have remained static since then. A no-deal Brexit is likely to wreak havoc with the system if visas are imposed for all passengers travelling between the UK and the EU, and airline staff have to police them.The rules cost the airline industry millions each year in training, technology, staffing and sanctions, but it is passengers who pay the ultimate price. Those denied boarding because of doubts over their paperwork may not be entitled to claim statutory compensation from the airline, even if it made the wrong decision. A disproportionate number of those passengers are ethnic minority immigrants who face losing the cost of a holiday because airline staff are left to police borders. Ali Nazari (not his real name) and his British wife were deprived of a holiday in Austria when easyJet refused to let him board, insisting he needed a visa to travel within the EU. The marine engineer holds a residence permit and a visa is not required in his case.Meanwhile, Aadila Ghali (not her real name) and her husband missed a friend’s wedding in Poland after Wizz Air staff at Luton told her that her UK travel document and residence permit were insufficient. The couple called the Polish embassy from the airport and staff there confirmed to Wizz Air that a visa was not required, but the airline refused to back down.“They said they do not allow anyone with a travel document, even with a visa, to travel to Poland,” she says. “When I asked them to show me this on their website, they didn’t have any answer.”EasyJet says Nazari was barred in error. “There are varying types of residence permits and combinations of documents required in order for us to be able to allow travel and this is sometimes complex,” it says. “On further investigation it is clear he should have been able to travel and we will arrange a refund of his flight and compensation.”Wizz Air now claims that Ghali was denied boarding because she produced a copy of her residence permit rather than the original, an allegation Ghali denies.Warrier says his experience cost him far more than the holiday he lost. “I’ve travelled widely and, as an Indian citizen, have had to apply for several visas, but I’ve never been barred from travelling anywhere before,” he says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40f866afd85de9ef6dbc72a603ef1967beed8d07/30_0_900_540/master/900.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=406d62f9dc8d10e2d2d35fa6d1cb42bd","title":"ai artificial intelligence composing","story":"Breakthroughs in artificial intelligence make music composition easier than ever – because a machine is doing half the work. Could computers soon go it alone?The first testing sessions for SampleRNN – an artificially intelligent software developed by computer scientist duo CJ Carr and Zach Zukowski, AKA Dadabots – sounded more like a screamo gig than a machine-learning experiment. Carr and Zukowski hoped their program could generate full-length black metal and math rock albums by feeding it small chunks of sound. The first trial consisted of encoding and entering in a few Nirvana a cappellas. “When it produced its first output,” Carr tells me over email, “I was expecting to hear silence or noise because of an error we made, or else some semblance of singing. But no. The first thing it did was scream about Jesus. We looked at each other like, ‘What the fuck?’” But while the platform could convert Cobain’s grizzled pining into bizarre testimonies to the goodness of the Lord, it couldn’t keep a steady rhythm, much less create a coherent song.Artificial intelligence is already used in music by streaming services such as Spotify, which scan what we listen to so they can better recommend what we might enjoy next. But AI is increasingly being asked to compose music itself – and this is the problem confronting many more computer scientists besides Dadabots.Musicians – popular, experimental and otherwise – have been using AI to varying degrees over the last three decades. Pop’s chief theoretician, Brian Eno, used it not only to create new endlessly perpetuating music on his recent album Reflection but to render an entire visual experience in 2016’s The Ship. The arrangements on Mexican composer Ivan Paz’s album Visions of Space, which sounds a bit like an intergalactic traffic jam, were done by algorithms he created himself. Most recently, producer Baauer – who topped the US charts in 2012 with his viral track Harlem Shake – made Hate Me with Lil Miquela, an artificial digital Instagram avatar. The next step for synthetic beings like these is to create music on their own – that is, if they can get the software to shut up about Jesus.The first computer-generated score, a string quartet called the Illiac Suite, was developed in 1957 by Lejaren Hiller, and was met with massive controversy among the classical community. Composers at the time were intensely purist. “Most musicians, academic or composers, have always held this idea that the creation of music is innately human,” Californian music professor David Cope explains. “Somehow the computer program was a threat to that unique human aspect of creation.” Fast forward to 1980, and after an insufferable bout of composer’s block, Cope began building a computer that could read music from a database written in numerical code. Seven years later, he’d created Emi (Experiments in Musical Intelligence, pronounced “Emmy”). Cope would compose a piece of music and pass it along to his staff to transcribe the notation into code for Emi to analyse. After many hours of digestion, Emi would spit out an entirely new composition written in code that Cope’s staff would re-transcribe on to staves. Emi could respond not just to Cope’s music, but take in the sounds of Bach, Mozart and other classical music staples and conjure a piece that could fit their compositional style. In the nearly 40 years since, this foundational process has been improved in all manner of ways.YouTube singing sensation Taryn Southern has constructed an LP composed and produced completely by AI using a reworking of Cope’s methods. On her album I AM AI, Southern uses an open source AI platform called Amper to input preferences such as genre, instrumentation, key and beats per minute. Amper is an artificially intelligent music composer founded by film composers Drew Silverstein, Sam Estes and Michael Hobe: it takes commands such as “moody pop” or “modern classical” and creates mostly coherent records that match in tone. From there, an artist can choose to select specific changes in melody, rhythm instrumentation and more.Southern, who says she “doesn’t have a traditional music background,” sometimes rejects as many as 30 versions of each song generated by Amper from her parameters once Amper creates something she likes the sound of, she exports it to GarageBand, arranges what the program has come up with and adds lyrics. Southern’s DIY model foretells a future of musicians making music with AI on their personal computers. “As an artist,” she says, “if you have a barrier to entry, like whether costs are prohibiting you to make something or not having a team, you kind of hack your way into figuring it out.” Her persistence in low-cost collaboration opened up partnerships with Samsung, Google and HTC, and she is now working on ways to make AI and VR art more accessible.AI isn’t just a useful tool, though – it can be used to explore vital questions about the nature of human expression. This self-reflective impulse epitomises the ethic of New York’s art-tech collective the Mill. “The overarching theme of my work,” explains creative director Rama Allen, “is playing with the concept of the ‘ghost in the machine’: the ghost being the human spirit and the machine being whatever advanced technology we try to apply. I’m interested in the collaboration between the two and the unexpected results that can come from it.” This is the central theme behind the Mill’s musical AI project See Sound, which debuted at last year’s SXSW festival in Austin – a highly reactive sound-sculpture program engineered by the human voice. Hum, sing or rap and See Sound etches a digital sculpture from your vocals on its colourful interface. From there, Allen and his team 3D-print the brand new shape. The sculptures themselves are, Allen says, “like a fingerprint”.The project was born when Allen saw London beatboxer Reeps One live and began to think about the reciprocal relationship between his machine mimicry and music. “I thought, what if I could create another piece of technology that allows him to visualise a shape in his mind, and breathe that shape into existence?” See Sound is one of the most intriguing examples of the ways artists and AI can learn from one another to create something new – advancing the idea of data-driven input into a more reciprocal relationship between man and machine.But while Allen, Southern and Dadabots exemplify an ideal harmony, the reality is that artificial intelligence is an industry, and the utopian synergy of the experimenters’ projects will undoubtedly give way to manipulation – even outright exploitation – by commerce. Spotify’s brilliant machine-learning program delivers recommendations to its listeners, and the company hired AI savant François Pachet to further the company’s entrenchment in the field. Pachet worked on Sony’s Flow Machines, a program that uses AI to compose pop songs. Spotify has already been accused of pushing fake artists in its playlists – mere pseudonyms for conveyor-belt pop made by a team of shadowy producers to evade royalty payouts, a charge it denies – so will they begin to produce their own AI-developed music? Amazon’s AI assistant Alexa features a new skill called DeepMusic which interweaves layers of audio samples to match the vibe set by users. And while the tunes sound too much like a computer drummed them up, that Amazon can already pipe music developed by AI into homes makes for a murky interplay between corporation, in-home AI assistant and creator.As the  reported last year, startups such as AI Music are working on tools that “shape shift” existing songs to match the context in which they’re played such as switching up the rhythms while driving or increasing the bass as the listener is jogging. Patrick Stobbs, co-founder of AI music composer Jukedeck, recently mentioned that the program would move from tweaking music to actually synthesising it. The London-based company, whose customer base requires what has been described as “functional music”, has already produced work for the likes of Coca-Cola and Google. You can imagine a future where not only hold music is produced by AI, but also music for adverts, TV series and unobtrusive dinner party soundtracks as well as the blue- and increasingly white-collar workers whose jobs are being replaced by AI, composers could be under threat too.But artists who use AI are steadfast that their work aims to augment the lives of artists and non-artists alike, not replace them. “At this point it’s more surprising to us to hear what humans will do with it,” Carr of Dadabots tells me. “Everything we’re doing is one big scheme to collaborate with bands we love.”An AI-assisted future raises questions around existing inequalities, corporate domination, and artistic integrity: how can we thrive in a world of automation and AI-assisted work without exacerbating the social and economic schisms that have persisted for centuries? It’s likely we won’t. But in the most utopian vision, music will be the first foray into machine-learning for many people, allowing collaboration that edifies the listener, the musician and the machine."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4521076e3ebf7d701f475dae351ddd42aa63fe1b/0_138_2429_1456/master/2429.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=af7aa49b7c18f0d38a94009251740045","title":"ian hunter mott the hoople interview david bowie","story":"His newly reissued memoir of life as a rock star is full of ennui, crap gigs and cat faeces – but at 79, the Mott the Hoople frontman is still going and ‘won’t stop unless I have to’It’s November 1972, and Ian Hunter is preparing to leave his home in Wembley, London, to go on a US tour with Mott the Hoople. Mott had their first big hit – All the Young Dudes, written for them by David Bowie – earlier that year, but Hunter’s last-minute chores rather bely the title of the book in which he detailed them, Diary of a Rock’n’Roll Star.“I cleaned the flat up a bit – mopped the cat shit up from the kitchen floor, had a bath and washed my hair,” he writes. “Pull the TV plug out, pull the fridge plug out stereo, Revox, hairdryer all pulled out. Send the landlord the advanced rent and settle the red electricity bill before it’s cut off.” Still, while he’s away he’s going to get his car done up in rock’n’roll fashion – spray painted black and gold. Except the car in question is not a Cadillac or a Jag. It’s a Ford Anglia.Forty-six years later, on the phone from his home in Connecticut, Hunter wonders what he was thinking. “I went down the garage to pick it up, and they looked at me, like, ‘What the fuck have you done?’ It looked ridiculous.” But there was something in Mott that rather prevented them getting the whole rock star thing right. “We were normal people, and we got lucky. I didn’t feel any reason to feel superior, just because I had the gene in me that could write songs.”Diary of a Rock’n’Roll Star, which has just been reissued, is one of the best books ever written about the actual job of being in a band. It’s not glamorous: there are a lot of buses, planes, hotels and dressing rooms opening slots where the sound is terrible gigs cancelled when the promoter has screwed up. It captures the full meaning of Charlie Watts’ mordant description of life in the Rolling Stones: “Five years playing 20 years hanging around.” The difference being that Mott didn’t have enough money to make the most of the hanging around.He still sounds astonished Bowie took an interest in them – without All the Young Dudes, it is likely Mott would have split in 1972 without a hit and Hunter would not have the reputation, at 79, that enables him to work as a full-time musician still. “Who else at that stage in his career would start giving away time and songs to other people? Which he did with me and Mott, Lou Reed, Iggy. How did he find the time for that? He was extremely ambitious, but still found time to do other things as well, which I think is quite remarkable.”Nevertheless, Hunter thinks Bowie had misjudged Mott. Maybe because they were from Hereford and he was from Mars, and who would come from Hereford but thugs? “The first time he met us, it took him four hours to get ready. I know this because Angie told me. He thought I was the head of a motorcycle gang. He was very into the macho thing. And he thought I was macho. And he probably liked Lou Reed for the same reason. He seemed to like people like that.”What Bowie had that set him apart – aside from a prodigious work ethic – was boundless confidence, Hunter says. “We were doing a session with him and he said, ‘Come with me.’ And we go into another room and he played me John, I’m Only Dancing. And when it finished, he did such a sales job on me, about how wonderful it was, how he’d wanted to do it for years. I thought it was crap. But he astonished me – when I play somebody something, I cringe. Still, to this day. I’m terrified in case they hate it. With David, there was nobody else in the world: ‘This is fantastic!’ And that’s what innovators do.”Diary of a Rock’n’Roll Star was meant to capture the start of Mott’s ascension. But although their most commercially successful period followed, it really portrayed an ending. Within months of the US tour it depicted, keyboard player Verden Allen and guitarist Mick Ralphs had left, the latter to form Bad Company with Paul Rodgers. Hunter followed in December 1974.It was, he says, a relief to have a fresh start, to not be responsible for Mott’s success. And for 44 years, he has made music as he chooses. A little guiltily, I confess I hadn’t listened to his recent solo albums until the day I spoke to him, and that I was surprised how good they were. He laughs. “I won’t stop unless I have to. Two things could stop me: one, there’s nobody turning up two, there’s something wrong with me. And they’re still turning up and there’s nothing wrong with me.”The only sad thing – from my point of view, not his – is that Hunter doesn’t sound terribly in love with rock’n’roll any more. Given how many of Mott’s best songs were about the marvel of rock itself, or Mott’s place within it, that seems a little surprising. He doesn’t care about new music: “Simon Cowell murdered it. Corporations murdered it in the 80s. Nobody gives a fuck and the vast unwashed think it’s great. I’m not bitter. I couldn’t care less. It’s given me a great life. But you want to listen to that? Some people don’t know bad acting when they see it.”Nor does he listen to old music. “I don’t have a stereo. People are horrified. They come to stay and they expect a stereo. When I was in London I went to Johnny Depp’s house and he’s got a complete wall. Massive speakers and a huge screen and it’s going on 24 hours a day. And I said, ‘Can you turn it down a bit?’”He laughs. And then he turns it all around: music for him is about the making. “If you’re lucky enough to have a passion – most people aren’t – grab it. And that’s what you do for the rest of your life. It might take a while and it might not be easy. But grab it and you’ll be happy. Fuck the money. That’ll come or it won’t. But you’ll be doing what you want to do and that’s what life is supposed to be.” This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

The DUP is poised to back an amendment tabled by Steve Baker, a leading light of the ERG and former Brexit minister, which would effectively make the European Union’s backstop proposal illegal.The bill is ostensibly to give Belfast civil servants more power, in the absence of a functioning Northern Ireland executive. But Baker’s amendment would prevent officials implementing any trade or regulatory barriers between Northern Ireland and mainland Britain.The amendment is now likely to have more than enough Tory and DUP MPs to pass - but only with Labour’s backing as well. And Labour sources have said they are unlikely to back the move - but the numbers of rebels will be interesting (if the amendment is chosen for debate). “We don’t mess around on emergency legislation,” a Labour source told the . “As usual we’ll take a proper look at the detail, but this just show the absolute state of this government.”This is Jessica Elgot taking over for the afternoon, where I’ll take you through two very interesting urgent questions coming up in the Commons, one on the meaningful vote and one on the cost of extending the transition period.That should start at 3.30 and then it will be on to the PM’s statement to the Commons on Brexit. Debate around all three should be... lively.Just 71 of the more than 800 statutory instruments needed to prepare the statute book for Brexit have been laid before parliament, according to a new analysis by the Hansard Society.The society’s full analysis of SIs (essentially the rules and regulations made by ministers under powers given to them by acts of parliament) is here, where it notes: The government promised that, as far as possible, it would plan the laying of its Brexit SIs in order to avoid a ‘peak and trough’ approach that would inhibit parliament’s capacity to scrutinise the proposed changes.Following the granting of royal assent to the EU (Withdrawal) Act on 26 June, there were 40 weeks until exit day (of which week 1 was not a full working week, as royal assent was granted on a Tuesday).If a minimum target of 800 SIs have to be laid, then an average of 20 SIs had to be laid in each of those 40 weeks.Public faith in the UK government’s handling of the Brexit negotiations has been taking a bit of a battering over recent weeks, according to other parts of the polling published today by YouGov.Thirty three percent (up from 29 percent) said the government was handling things “fairly badly”.The chancellor is considering making changes to England’s planning system to accelerate the conversion of empty shops into homes, the Financial Times reports ahead of this month’s budget.The move - which is aimed at tackling the housing crisis - comes as Philip Hammond is resisting calls to use his main policy intervention of the year to carry out a major overhaul of business rates, the FT adds.Hard Brexiters are expected to stage a rebellion tonight against government plans to ban .50 calibre high-energy rifles that have the power to stop a vehicle at a distance of a mile. Three dozen Tory MPs have signed up to the most contentious amendment to the offensive weapons bill, aimed at striking out the Home Office’s proposed ban on guns that police admit they have do not have the resources to deal with if one were ever to fall into the hands of terrorist. The latest signatories include David Davis, the former Brexit secretary, Jacob Rees-Mogg, the chairman of the hard Brexit ERG. Others who have signed up include Steve Baker, Sir Bernard Jenkin and Sir Bill Cash, as well as some DUP MPs and Labour’s Kate Hoey. Brexiters are looking for opportunities to stand up and be counted in the Commons and argue that .50 calibre rifles are held securely at specialist sporting clubs. Labour, however, is expected to vote against the amendment, so the ban on the guns is expected to be passed into law. Louise Haigh, the shadow policing minister, said: “If you think that hijacking an important firearms debate for a proxy row over Brexit is acceptable, you’re not fit for public office.”Robert Halfon, a Tory MP for the sometimes bellwether seat of Harlow, has been on the airwaves again after warning at the weekend that his party faces an “existential crisis”.The violent imagery voiced by anonymous fellow Tories simply promoted an image of their party as “an awful party in the eyes of the public”, he told BBC’s World at One.Halfon went on to say that the party needed to get away from being seen as obsessed with Brexit, adding that the prime minister needed to “lead from the front”.“She did this when she got in in 2016 that was one of the reasons why the public rallied behind her and we were high in the opinion polls,” he said.Halfon said that the party needed to grasp the social justice agenda like it really meant it through tackling “extortionate” rail fares and the cost of living.Not entirely a shock this, but ratchets up the stakes..Iain Duncan Smith has said that the “full weight of the Conservative party” should be brought down on whoever was responsible for the violent imagery which has been directed at the prime minister.The former cabinet minister and prominent Brexiter was speaking after he joined two fellow members of the European Research Group (ERG) - Owen Patterson and David Trimble - to meet the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier. The ERG members denied that they were undermining Theresa May.Smith was speaking after the trio were asked by reporters if any of them had been responsible for some of the language which made its way into the weekend papers.The Sunday Times quoted one unnamed Tory MP as saying: “The moment is coming when the knife gets heated, stuck in her front and twisted. She’ll be dead soon.”Another said May was now entering “the killing zone”, and a third remarked: “Assassination is in the air.” In the Mail on Sunday, another source was quoted as saying that May should “bring her own noose” to a meeting of backbench Tories.“I don’t know anything about that other than what I have heard. All I can say is that whoever did that needs to have the fullest weight of the Conservative party on them, or whoever,” said Smith“It has nothing to do with this issue.”Asked if Theresa May had his full support, he replied: “I have always done I am an ex-leader. The prime minister gets my full support. That’s it.”A delegation from the pro-Brexit European Research Group (ERG) of Tory parliamentarians have been in Brussels to meet the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier.Asked if they were undermining the prime minister, Ian Duncan Smith said that they were simply “presenting some ideas” from a paper which the ERG had put out earlier in the year.The former environment minister Owen Paterson, who was with Duncan Smith and David Trimble, gave the impression afterwards that much of the discussion had involved the issue of how to resolve the Irish border question.“We believe that using existing techniques, existing processes and all within existing EU law we can continue to trade pretty well seamlessly across all borders without damaging the integrity of European customs union and single market, which is obviously fundamental for them,” he said.“We had a long and constructive meeting with Mr Barnier and his staff and we are now going to go back and report in detail to our colleagues.”Here’s another headache to add to Theresa May’s growing list - she faces a potential rebellion this evening on a bill designed to ban rifles of a certain calibre. My colleague Dan Sabbagh also wrote about the issue last week.At first glance it’s not a Brexit-related issue, but some in her party are rowing in behind it, and it is an opportunity for a show of strength by rebels.The former trade minister Greg Hands has penned a piece for the  on why he believes that staying in a customs union would be “dire” for British trade.A wide range of key British interests – from Welsh and Teesside steel workers, the Stoke ceramics industry and Asian diaspora communities, to mainstream importers and exporters – could lose out. All this illustrates the hazards of being the world’s fifth-largest economy, with a large part of our economic policy contracted out to others. We shouldn’t let it happen.Good afternoon. This is Ben Quinn picking up the liveblog from SarahTheresa May’s office has said “personal vitriol has no place in our politics”, after dehumanising and derogatory comments were made about the prime minister’s position.On Sunday, Tory MP Johnny Mercer said he could not continue to “support an administration that cannot function” on issues from Brexit to the Grenfell Tower disaster and the Windrush scandal.He spoke out as numerous Conservative politicians said May was on course to face a vote of no confidence this week as all wings of the party united against her.Reports include threats about how May is in entering “the killing zone” with “assassination in the air”.The Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab, urged the plotters to ignore the “jitters” and hold their nerve for a Brexit deal. Raab laughed off the lurid claims about a “killing field”, pointing out that May’s future is regularly gossiped about with little action from her political enemies.Karen Bradley, the secretary of state for Northern Ireland, today gave assurances that the British government was not about to renege on the “backstop” commitment made over the Irish border Brexit issue. Referring to the joint report in December, in which Theresa May and EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier signed off on the need for a “backstop” insurance policy for Ireland in the event of no deal, she said that commitment still stood.“We are committed to everything we have agreed to in the joint report and we will ensure there is no border on the island of Ireland,” she told the British Irish Parliamentary Assembly in London on Monday. She was told by a series of Irish politicians present that people in Ireland were now getting very concerned about Brexit and the Irish border and suggestions over the weekend that the December report was irrelevant. “I am very very concerned at the mood in the last few days,” said Irish senator Frank Feighan, who belongs to the government party Fine Gael. “Could the UK every be trusted again if it were to renege on a written deal,” he asked. The Northern Ireland secretary, Karen Bradley, has said that she will ensure there is no border on the island of Ireland.Addressing a meeting of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly in London, Bradley said: “A suggestion has been put forward last week at the European council regarding an extension of the implementation period as a way to deal with the border ... Now, we are looking at that. It is early days. It is a suggestion that has been put forward by the EU. “And I want to be clear that we are committed to everything that we have agreed to in the joint report and we will ensure that there is no border on the island of Ireland,” she said.Some responses to Chris Grayling’s appearance on Radio 4 Today programme.The foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, will make a statement in the House of Commons about the Jamal Khashoggi case this afternoon.

The British driver is still in a commanding position to take the title and insisted he would regroup with the team to ensure they were in the best possible position to finish the job at the next round in Mexico this weekend.The race in Austin was won by Ferrari’s Kimi Räikkönen, while Hamilton ended up third behind the Red Bull of Max Verstappen. Sebastian Vettel’s fourth place ensured the title fight continued, with the German trailing by 70 points with only three rounds remaining.Hamilton was beaten off the line by Räikkönen and then Mercedes opted to use a two-stop strategy, hoping to pass the Finn, who was one-stopping, in the final stages. However Räikkönen skilfully held Hamilton up and Mercedes kept the British driver out too long while he also lost time to traffic and due to his tyres blistering. Mercedes’s team principal Toto Wolff admitted “we were probably a lap too late pitting Lewis as his tyres really dropped off.”After Hamilton’s second stop he emerged behind Verstappen and despite a charge was unable to make any progress against the two leaders.“There are a lot of things that we could have done better on Sunday,” Hamilton said. “There were certain things that weren’t optimum for us, which made it look worse than it was.”However the 33-year-old insisted the setback would act as an incentive rather than provoke a descent into finger-pointing.• Lewis Hamilton has a 70-point lead over Sebastian Vettel and there are a maximum of 75 points available from the final three races, so Hamilton needs just five points to secure the F1 title (Hamilton wins if the pair finish level on points as the British driver has won more races).• Vettel must win all three races to claim the title, so if he fails to win at the next grand prix in Mexico, Hamilton will win the championship – even if he does not finish the race.• If Vettel does win in Mexico, Hamilton can still win if he finishes seventh or higher.“We will go back to the drawing board – that’s why we’re the best as a team,” he said. “Because no one is to blame, we all take the blame together, we all kick ourselves up the backside and realise we have to keep working and keep pushing. I know the guys will do great analysis from this weekend for the next couple of days and I know we will come back strong in the next race.”Seventh place or better next weekend in Mexico will ensure Hamilton wins his fifth title to equal Juan Manuel Fangio. But he was taking nothing for granted and emphasised that Mercedes needed to address why they had been unable to match the Ferraris’ race pace at the Circuit of the Americas.“We didn’t have great pace and we had worse tyre usage than everyone else, which is rarely ever the case,” he said. “So I think we were forced into a two-stop for certain things we had that were not ideal with the car. We didn’t know that was going to be the case when we went into the race, but it was a real struggle. The car was a real handful.”Hamilton admitted it was combination of factors that proved costly, beyond the team’s strategy. “They gained some pace but we had lost some, I’ve asked them to try and find out why but there is more on top of that,” he said. “There was debris and some damage on the floor, all these things add up through the race. Then we had another problem but we don’t know how much time that cost.” He declined to elaborate on what the specific other issue with the car had been."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/130d61e25302017731a674e7a320c0b9bf3f11da/0_207_4048_2430/master/4048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=67669eebdc74242e2614cf56669fd40c","title":"malcolm jenkins eric reid scuffle nfl colin kaepernick","story":"Eric Reid and Malcolm Jenkins, two of the most prominent players in the protest movement, clashed on Sunday. The winners were NFL ownersTempers flared in Philadelphia on Sunday before the Eagles’ game against the Carolina Panthers as Eric Reid and Malcolm Jenkins, two central figures in the NFL protests against social injustice, got into a scuffle at the coin toss.Reid, now with the Panthers, was the first member of the San Francisco 49ers to join Colin Kaepernick in taking a knee during the national anthem in 2016. And the safety has remained one of the most outspoken players on the subject of racial injustice in the United States since.At the heart of the disagreement is Jenkins’ role within the Players Coalition, a collection of NFL players committed to addressing issues of social injustice. “He was corrupt from the jump,” Reid said in the locker room postgame. “He knew what he was doing from the offset. His goal was to sell us, and he did that.”Jenkins, a safety with the Eagles who had been raising a fist for two seasons during the anthem, had been in discussions with NFL commissioner Roger Goodell and the league’s player liaison Troy Vincent about a deal that would see the owners donate a large sum to community initiatives.In exchange, it was expected the players would end their protests during the anthem. “If they were to agree to this, do you think you’d be more comfortable with ending the demonstrations?” Jenkins texted the group earlier this year, according to ESPN. Reid and others saw the deal as a pay-off. After the plan was announced, Reid and other members of the coalition opted to leave the group.Sunday was the first time Reid and Jenkins had shared a field since their relationship fractured.Reid went unsigned throughout the offseason and training camp after leaving the 49ers, despite the fact that he is a good player still in his prime. He was eventually picked up by the Panthers in week five after the team suffered injuries. Reid was in the process of litigation against the league, claiming he had been blackballed in a lawsuit similar to the one filed by Kaepernick (Jenkins was one of the players who spoke up in support of Reid).But the bad blood runs deep. While a free agent, Reid had criticized the Players Coalition as “an NFL funded subversion group.” Reid’s emotions spilled over during the coin toss on Sunday, and he had to be held back by teammates. It continued throughout the early portion of the game, as the safety was flagged for a personal foul penalty for tossing tight end Zach Ertz to the ground.Disagreements and physical confrontations are expected in the NFL – even teammates go at it. That’s the sport. What happened pre-game in Philadelphia, though, was much more than the usual to and fro. It was about ethics and perceived rights and wrongs. Justified or not, Reid feels the movement he, Kaepernick and others worked for was co-opted and sullied by Jenkins. The Eagles safety crossed the picket line, in other words. “I would say he’s a neo-colonialist,” Reid told reporters postgame. “He is a sell-out.”This has always been the dichotomy among NFL’s workforce. United, they’re a powerful force. Yet too often they are ided, and the NFL’s owners are only too happy to exploit that.“The players had real leverage,” an NFL owner told ESPN in January. “But we knew we could sit back and watch them implode.” That implosion spilled from group chats to the field on Sunday. And in doing so, did the cause the players have fought for a disservice.A split award this week. First up…Andrew Luck, QB, Indianapolis Colts. Remember when we were all worried about Andrew Luck’s health after the Colts subbed him out for a Hail Mary attempt? Maybe his shoulder hadn’t fully healed. Perhaps he was rushed back.Since then, he’s thrown more passes than any quarterback in the NFL – and he leads the league in touchdowns in that  too.Peak-Luck is a joy to behold, a blend of John Elway’s post-snap recklessness mixed with a dash of Peyton Manning’s pre-snap cunning. The Bills stood no chance as Luck gutted them to the tune of four touchdowns, completing 17 of his 23 attempts for 156 yards. At times it looked easy.Luck’s past three performances have been his best stretch of games since he dragged a dud of a group to the AFC Championship game in the 2014 season. The Colts are a flawed, young team but the biggest question hovering over their franchise has been answered: Luck is going to be fine.DeShaun Watson, QB, Houston Texans. Watson’s on-field performance wasn’t as striking as Luck’s. But the fact he was even on the field was a marvel. Check this out, via Jay Glazer of Fox Sports:Yes, you read that right. Watson was healthy enough to have Yannick Ngakoue and Dante Fowler Jr sandwich him at a combined 30 miles an hour, but not to take a flight. Instead, he was forced to take a 12-hour bus to Jacksonville, which sounds almost as painful as his lung injury.It takes me 30 minutes, minimum, to recover from a stubbed toe. Watson played every offensive snap in a pro football game with a partially collapsed lung. He didn’t play brilliantly, completing just 12 of his 24 throws for 139 yards and a touchdown. And he carried the ball seven times for a measly 13 yards. But the fact he was even able to take a snap is ludicrous. The 20-7 win sent the Texans top of the AFC South too.On Mitch Trubisky’s eight-yard rushing touchdown, the quarterback actually ran 71-yards, per NFL Next Gen Stats.Trubisky somehow pirouetted away from a pair of Patriots pass-rushers, turning his back towards the end zone and winding up back at the 30-yard line. The Bears quarterback has truly embraced the art of the no-no-no-yes play in his second year. You won’t find a better example than the beauty above from Sunday.Somehow that wasn’t the most frenzied play of the day. With time expiring, Trubisky launched a Hail Mary, caught by Kevin White, that came up half a yard short of tying the game and sending it to overtime.The Patriots were perfectly prepared for the play. Watch how cornerback Jonathan Jones peels off his man as the ball is in flight and tackles low on White, stopping the receiver from churning his legs towards the end zone. As Devin McCourty pointed out post-game, that’s exactly how Bill Belichick teaches it, because of course he does. New England designate one player to attack the ball in the air – usually Rob Gronkowski, but Josh Gordon picked up the reins this week with the tight end injured – while the rest of the defenders prepare to tackle in case the receiver catches the ball.Situational football at its finest. Feel free to groan at Belichick’s brilliance once again.There’s a lot going on here. First, there’s Jacksonville’s offense, which is a horrible mess. Losing Leonard Fournette for an extended period of time hurts. The running back is capable of shifting the pile, popping explosive runs, and forces opposing defenses to load the box, making things easier on Blake Bortles, who has been brutal the past couple of weeks. Doug Marrone finally relented on Sunday and benched his quarterback.The true story here is Jacksonville’s defense, though. Last year, the Jaguars young group broke through. They played suffocating man-coverage. Linebackers and safeties interchanged assignments. They played with a swagger we haven’t seen since the Legion of Boom was doing its most dastardly work in Seattle.This year the group has been so-so by their own high standards. The Jaguars entered the weekend fifth in defensive DVOA, the single best measure of defensive success. They’ve been good, not great. All the characters are the same, but something seems off.• The Kansas City Chiefs are still the most exciting team in the league. If they were suffering from a hangover after their loss to the Patriots last week, they weren’t showing it. They destroyed the Bengals (who were 4-2 coming into the game), 45-10 and Patrick Mahomes is making the game look very easy indeed, he threw for four touchdowns again. The Chiefs’ meeting with the 7-0 Rams on 19 November is one to look forward to.• Credit to Mike Vrabel and Doug Pederson, both losing coaches on Sunday, who showed aggressiveness in unusual spots: Vrabel in going for two on the final play of the game when an extra-point would have tied the score Pederson in going for it on fourth-down multiple times on early drives. If you’re a results-oriented person, you’ll probably criticize both calls. But if like me, you prefer to focus on the process, you’ll appreciate a pair of coaches who followed the numbers and backed up the typical coaching rhetoric by playing to win.• Patriots running back Sony Michel appeared to suffer a nasty knee injury in Chicago. The rookie has been a revelation for the Patriots. He brings a different element to their offense and was just hitting his stride. Losing him for a prolonged period would have a big impact on the AFC race and possibly the Super Bowl.• Adam Thielen tied an NFL record on Sunday with his seventh consecutive 100-yard game to begin a season. he made nine catches for 110 yards and a touchdown in his team’s 37-17 victory over the Jets. He’s now one-game behind Calvin Johnson’s all-time record for consecutive games with 100-yards at any point in a season.• The Browns have played four overtime games in seven games. That’s the most since 2011.• Cam Newton had 68 yards passing in the first three quarters and 201 in the fourth, as he helped dig the Panthers out of a 17-0 hole against the Eagles. Newton went 17 of 23 for 210 yards and two touchdowns in the fourth quarter, with a two-point conversion tacked on for good measure. Carolina beat the Super Bowl champions 21-17.• Justin Tucker had made 222 consecutive extra-point attempts before Sunday. His first ever miss was a costly one: the Ravens lost their game against the Saints by a single point."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c397d6bac26624375fe4dbbef36e6d777f2299d8/45_49_2994_1796/master/2994.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=adf167da005ceab58f058d2785a33c62","title":"marc marquez messi woods bolt hendrix motogp","story":"Spaniard’s fifth world title displayed his ability to create a spectacle that leaves everyone, including rival riders, shaking their heads in wondermentOn Sunday at the Motegi circuit in Japan, Marc Márquez pulled off what Lewis Hamilton could not quite manage to achieve 15 hours later and 6,500 miles away in Texas: he won his fifth world championship in the top tier of his sport with three races to go. Now he stands level with Mick Doohan, the Australian ace of the 1990s, and only two titles away from Valentino Rossi’s seven and three from Giacomo Agostini, who won his eight championships between 1966 and 1975.The Catalan’s five MotoGP titles have come in the six seasons since he graduated from Moto2. Since he is only 25, and there is no sign that success is taking the edge off his appetite, there is every likelihood he will match and then surpass Agostini’s total. This would be a fair reflection of a talent that could be likened to those displayed by Lionel Messi in football, Brian Lara in cricket, Simone Biles in gymnastics and Roger Federer in tennis: the ability to take a given set of parameters and bend them into new shapes, creating a spectacle that leaves everyone, including their rivals, shaking their heads in wonderment.Márquez was given his first motorbike at the age of four, as a Christmas present. Twenty-one years later he rides his Honda RC213V as if he were born on it, communicating a childlike sense of enjoyment even when the battle is at its most intense. To watch him cornering his machine at high speed with its two wheels pointing in different directions, the calculation of brake, throttle and lean angle forming a constantly changing equation to set against a feel for the grip of rubber on asphalt, is to witness the highest level of virtuosity. Sometimes the machine seems more like a dance partner than a motorcycle – and a dance on ice, at that.Mat Oxley, the most perceptive of the current generation of writers on motorcycle racing, likens him to Jimi Hendrix – the Hendrix who played guitar with his teeth, going beyond accepted technical limits. But Hendrix, knowing he did not play the guitar nearly as well with his teeth as with his fingers, performed that trick for show. When Márquez explores a new technique, it’s for go. It’s to get him through a corner faster that the guy whose exhaust fumes he has been breathing.He does not so much break the rules as redefine them, forcing everyone who wants to compete with him – and all young riders joining the sport in his wake – to adapt their styles in order to stand a chance of keeping up. Others have made a similar impact before, notably Rossi, but Márquez has gone much further and made the sport a more thrilling spectacle as a result.This is not a matter of being on the best machine, as is sometimes the case with Formula One’s champions. MotoGP’s rules generally succeed in creating a relatively even competitive balance between the top works teams – Honda, Ducati, Yamaha, Suzuki – while leaving enough room for each manufacturer to create a bike that has its own inidual characteristics in terms of power or handling. So on Sunday morning we watched Márquez exploiting his Honda’s agility to stalk Andrea Dovizioso’s smooth-riding Ducati, squeezing past the Italian to take the lead in the later stages and provoking him into the desperate counterattack that led to him sliding off the track on the penultimate lap.He and Dovizioso have fought tooth and nail throughout the season, with several last-corner dramas. Before that his chief rival was Jorge Lorenzo, the Spaniard who succeeded in interrupted Márquez’s run of titles in 2015 on a Yamaha. Next season Lorenzo will leave Ducati – for whom he has won three races this season, to Márquez’s eight and Dovizioso’s three - to join Márquez at Repsol Honda. “I asked for a strong teammate,” Márquez said when the move was announced, “but not that strong.”With any luck, this will be like Mansell and Piquet at Williams or Senna and Prost at McLaren: two strong-willed competitors of matching talent and contrasting character who are not afraid to clash off the bike as well as on it. They have tangled on many occasions, notably this season at Misano, where Lorenzo admitted culpability, and at Aragon, where he said: “Marc destroyed my race, destroyed my foot, destroyed the big possibility I had to win.” The injury forced him to miss the next two races.For all his angelic smile, Márquez is a hard and ruthless competitor who was given a 30-second penalty and a stern warning after riding Rossi off the track during a wild race in changing conditions in Argentina in April. He could be seen as marrying some of the qualities of Gilles Villeneuve, who believed in driving the wheels off his car in all circumstances, with those of Max Verstappen, a prodigy who sees no reason why anybody, ever, should be in front of him (and whose drive from 18th on Sunday’s grid in Austin to second on the podium was rather overlooked in the celebration of Kimi Räikkönen’s win).MotoGP is lucky to have Márquez, and Márquez is lucky to have landed in MotoGP at a time when such intense rivalries are made possible by the emergence of a generation of extremely talented riders with strong and ergent personalities – a bit like the big four in men’s tennis over the past decade. He is the kind of figure all sports dream of unearthing: a Tiger Woods, a Katarina Witt, a Usain Bolt, a unique inidual whose combination of charisma and technical brilliance bursts through the limits and disciplines of their sport and engages multitudes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c07c72a4021030341ef5ffa338bc44a52ad785f2/148_0_3051_1832/master/3051.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9385707869df83d658ffea70fff46c31","title":"naomi osaka v sloane stephens wta finals live","story":"Sloane Stephens got her tournament off to a good start, overcoming the US Open in three sets in SingaporeThat’s all from me. Thanks for reading. I’ll be back with more coverage tomorrow. Bye!Sloane Stephens speaks! “I knew I was going to have to compete from start to finish and stay really positive and try to execute my plan. I thought I did those things really well and most importantly I stayed positive. I’m just happy to be through. I like the slow court but this one is a little different. The bounces are a little weird. But it’s the same for everybody. She played a good game. Sometimes it doesn’t go your way so you have to stay positive. She’s been playing well so you have to compete no matter what.”So Sloane Stephens opens the Red Group with a gritty win. The first two sets were tense but Stephens was very good in the third and Naomi Osaka, who’s still very young, faded badly.Serving to stay in the match, Osaka’s on the brink after a double-fault makes it 0-30. Osaka clambers back to 30-all but Stephens soon carves out a match point. Osaka saves it with a clever serve down the middle. But Stephens has another chance and all she has to do is wait for Osaka to double-fault again.Third set: Osaka 5-7, 6-4, 1-5 Stephens* (*denotes server): Stephens breezes into a 40-0 lead. She holds with some fine serving. She’s a game from victory.Third set: Osaka* 5-7, 6-4, 1-4 Stephens (*denotes server): Faced by three break points, Osaka keeps fighting. She drags herself to 30-40. But Stephens is on the prowl and she converts the third break point to establish a healthy lead.Third set: Osaka 5-7, 6-4, 1-3 Stephens* (*denotes server): The game goes to 30-all. A glimmer for Osaka. But Stephens is too solid at the moment. She ticks off another game.Third set: Osaka* 5-7, 6-4, 1-2 Stephens (*denotes server): These are difficult times for Osaka, who hits wide to give Stephens a break point. She saves, it though, and holds when a backhand kisses the line. Only one break in it.Third set: Osaka* 5-7, 6-4, 0-2 Stephens (*denotes server): Stephens can’t believe it. After breaking, she quickly finds herself trailing 0-40. She pulls herself together and fights to 30-40. Then it looks like she’s missed a second serve. It’s overruled and she gets a second chance at a first serve. Osaka chooses not to challenge. Weird. Stephens makes the most of her good fortune and just lands a forehand inside the line. She consolidates the break.Third set: Osaka* 5-7, 6-4, 0-1 Stephens (*denotes server): After a quick chat with the coaches, the decider begins with Osaka serving. But it’s Stephens who looks sprightlier, constructing a neat point to take a 15-40 lead. Osaka saves the first with an inside-out forehand and then she’s relieved to see Stephens knock a crosscourt forehand wide. Stephens earns another chance, though, and breaks at the third time of asking. Osaka shakes her head clear again and earns two set points with a charge to the net. She nets a backhand return off the first. Then Stephens double-faults. Oh dear.Second set: Osaka* 5-7, 5-4 Stephens (*denotes server): Serving to level the match, Osaka begins nervily, sending a forehand wide for 0-15. Then Stephens wrongfoots her with a backhand down the line for 0-30. Osaka summons some resilience to fight back to 30-all. But Stephens earns a break point and converts it when some magnificent defending forces Osaka to blooter an easy volley off target!Second set: Osaka 5-7, 5-3 Stephens* (*denotes server): Serving to keep the set alive, Stephens sends a forehand down the line for 15-0. She holds.Second set: Osaka 5-7, 5-2 Stephens* (*denotes server): Osaka isn’t having it her own way yet, with Stephens scrambling to earn a break point. Osaka saves it and eventually knuckles down to hold.Second set: Osaka 5-7, 4-2 Stephens* (*denotes server): At deuce, Osaka attacks a second serve and Stephens can only net a forehand. Given something to think about, Stephen predictably double-faults. Osaka breaks!Second set: Osaka* 5-7, 3-2 Stephens (*denotes server): Stephens has a spring in her step after that reprieve and she bounces into a 15-30 lead. Osaka, wobbling, shanks one wide to hand Stephens two break points. The American can’t take the first. Then Osaka just about deals with a backhand drive volley to force deuce. From there, she’s able to hold. Unpredictable stuff.Second set: Osaka 5-7, 2-2 Stephens* (*denotes server): All of a sudden, Osaka finds herself with three break points. Stephens wipes out the first with an ace. Somehow she saves the next two as well, Osaka unable to find her range. Stephens clings on. That could be huge.Second set: Osaka* 5-7, 2-1 Stephens (*denotes server): Osaka holds comfortably enough. She hasn’t really been at her best yet but she’s still in this.Second set: Osaka 5-7, 1-1 Stephens* (*denotes server): Stephens holds to 30, Osaka whacking a forehand into the net.Second set: Osaka* 5-7, 1-0 Stephens (*denotes server): It’s important that Osaka quickly shakes off the disappointment of losing the first set. Otherwise this match will be over before she knows it. And it’s a good sign that she responds to losing the first point of this game by holding to 15, four straight points doing the job.Serving for the set, Stephens nails a forehand down the line for 15-0. An irritable Osaka nets a forehand for 30-0 and it’s not long before Stephens has three set points. Osaka saves the first with a backhand down the line, though, and Stephens wastes the second with an errant backhand. Stephens has to knuckle down and she’s patient enough to wait for Osaka to net a forehand, bringing a tight opening set to a close.First set: Osaka* 5-6 Stephens (*denotes server): At 30-all, Osaka knocks a tame backhand long. She slaps her knee with her racquet. Another break point. Another error. Stephens breaks for a third time and will serve for the set. First set: Osaka 5-5 Stephens* (*denotes server): Serving to stay in the set, Stephens begins by pulling a forehand wide for 0-15. But she wins the next two points after pulling Osaka off balance. Stephens passes the test quickly enough.First set: Osaka* 5-4 Stephens (*denotes server): Stephens is annoyed with herself for missing a backhand at 15-30. That was a chance. The game goes to deuce. Osaka nets a backhand. Break point. Osaka looks unhappy. So she comes up with an ace. She holds. Stephens is under pressure now.First set: Osaka 4-4 Stephens* (*denotes server): Osaka digs deep on the baseline and outlasts Stephens during a long rally at 30-15. Meanwhile a cockroach has wandered on to court. What are security playing at? A ball boy has a look and decides to fetch a towel. He clears things up and play can resume at 30-all. Stephens isn’t flustered, knocking a short forehand away for 40-30. But she can’t get over the line, two double-faults handing Osaka a break point. A tense rally ensues and Osaka takes control with a huge backhand that allows her to charge the net and whip a forehand down the line.First set: Osaka* 3-4 Stephens (*denotes server): Out of nowhere, Stephens increases the pressure. At 15-all, she takes Osaka apart at the net. Osaka’s inconsistencies flare and a poor error hands Stephens two break points.

The Japanese fans in the crowd enjoyed that.First set: Osaka 2-2 Stephens* (*denotes server): The first two points are shared. Stephens soon scoots into a 40-15 lead. It’s low-key stuff.

She holds.First set: Osaka* 2-1 Stephens (*denotes server): That’s more like it from Osaka, who breezes to an easy love hold. This could be tight.First set: Osaka 1-1 Stephens* (*denotes server): Both players are struggling to find their aim. This game goes to 30-all, with Stephens going for too much on a forehand. Osaka earns a break point when Stephens nets a forehand. Osaka breaks back thanks to another error from the American.First set: Osaka* 0-1 Stephens (*denotes server): Naomi Osaka opens the serving and, unsurprisingly, we begin with a long, cautious rally. Sloane Stephens wins it and Osaka immediately looks edgy on this slow court, netting a forehand to gift her opponent two break points. Osaka saves the first with an ace but Stephens goes on the offensive and breaks when Osaka knocks a backhand pass wide.Here come the players. We’ll have tennis soon.In the White Group, Elina Svitolina beat Petra Kvitova 6-3, 6-3 and Karolina Pliskova beat Caroline Wozniacki 6-2, 6-4 yesterday.Sloane Stephens speaks! “She’s very hard hitting and aggressive. I’m going to try to have to stay in there. And also try to be aggressive and take my opportunities.”Naomi Osaka speaks! “Everyone knows Sloane is a really great player. She’s a grand slam champion. I played her once and didn’t win.”These two have only met once before. Sloane Stephens leads their head-to-head 1-0. She beat Naomi Osaka in straight sets in Acapulco in 2016.Hello. With Angelique Kerber and Kiki Bertens scheduled to meet later, the first match in the Red Group at the WTA Finals sees a super soaker take on a sponge. This one is hard to call. Fresh from her rather eventful victory over Serena Williams in the final of the US Open last month, Naomi Osaka is having a whale of a time at the moment. Japan’s first ever grand slam champion has the game to match her winning personality and the powerful 21-year-old has shown no sign of letting up since making her breakthrough at Flushing Meadows. This is the first time she’s qualified for this tournament and it won’t be a surprise if she rounds off an unforgettable year in style.But this could be an awkward test for Osaka. As hard as she pounds the ball here, she might find that Sloane Stephens is more than capable of getting it back. Stephens, who won her breakthrough grand slam at the US Open in 2017 and is also making her Singapore debut, is an expert defender and the 25-year-old American, who has made a wonderful comeback from a serious foot injury, possesses the smarts to frustrate any opponent. She’ll probe for angles and look to force errors with her intelligent hustling. Osaka will hope to cut through all that with her awesome array of groundstrokes. It’s a fascinating clash of styles!Play begins at 12.30pm BST."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d6ebbd52149e12e6ab498fb8fda6757939f112e/0_0_4510_2706/master/4510.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6cc89f8ee0b1175c43c9d260e4374cfe","title":"google home hub review smart display buy google assistant digital photo frame","story":"This gadget is your Google Assistant, smart-home dashboard and digital photo frame in one – and it’s good for cooking, tooThe Home Hub is Google’s first own-brand smart display, combining Google Assistant, advanced smart-home control and a digital photo frame into a neat and tidy package.Google isn’t the first to market with smart displays. Amazon’s Echo Show put the company’s Alexa on a screen a year ago, while Google Assistant smart displays made by Harman, Lenovo and LG were released a few months ago.But Google’s Home Hub is slightly different. Firstly, it doesn’t have a camera on it, which Google goes to great lengths to repeatedly tell you in the hope you will find it less creepy and feel more comfortable putting it in places like your bedroom. It still has a pair of microphones, of course.The second is that it’s a lot smaller than the competition, designed to blend in rather than be a statement piece in your house.At its most basic, the Home Hub is a 7in digital photo frame with Google Assistant built in. It works just like any other Google Home, Mini or Max, answering your questions, playing music and controlling smart-home devices, but with the added twist of visual information displayed on the touchscreen.The screen is the best I’ve seen on a smart display thus far, being brighter, crisper and clearer than the first-generation of Amazon’s Echo Show, for instance. It’s got an ambient light sensor that, like Apple’s iPhone XS and iPad Pro line, tweaks the brightness and colour of the display to provide consistently good-looking images on screen adjusting to the light in the room.The Ambient EQ system makes your photos look realistic in colour in varying lighting conditions, but it was a bit dim in low-level lighting for my liking. You can boost or reduce the brightness by a couple of notches in the Google Home app, but changing the brightness on Home Hub itself disables Ambient EQ. Swipe up from the bottom to access manual brightness and volume controls.The home screen can display a choice of clock faces, images or photos from your Google Photos library. You can also ask for photos via voice, such as pictures from Portland or King’s Cross, or of people you’ve tagged in your image library. It all works very well.When resting, the Home Hub can also display the primary user’s calendar, the weather, news stories and content from apps such as Spotify playlists, which you can swipe through with your finger and jump straight to an activity.Google Assistant is by far the most capable of the virtual assistants at understanding and answering questions, and can hear you just as well on the smart display as Google’s Home smart speakers. Mess up a query or command and nine times out of 10 you’ll still get the right result, which can’t be said for Alexa, Microsoft’s Cortana or Apple’s Siri.On the Home Hub answers are accompanied by visual information, such as the hourly or daily weather forecast or a photo of Jeff Goldblum as it explains he is 65 years old.Many of these information cards are also interactive. Asking how to get to somewhere displays a map into which you can zoom with your fingers on the touchscreen. Using Google’s Voice Match recognition system the Home Hub can identify who is asking a question or giving a command and provide personalised answers. Ask for how your commute looks and it gives you your commute, not another member of your household’s. The same goes for music libraries and calendars.Google Assistant will also ping the phone of the person who asked the question with more information for navigation options and other queries that would he helpful to look into more detail or take with you.Recipes are really good on the Home Hub. Ask how to make beef bourguignon and the screen will display a selection of recipes from the web. Selecting one shows you the recipe, from which you can tap to start cooking and get step-by-step instructions read out and displayed on screen one at a time. Progress through the recipe by tapping or asking for the next step, or jump back one to view the whole thing. It’s well designed and easy to use.Google Assistant has a bunch of routines you can trigger with voice commands. By default saying “good morning” will show the weather, your commute, what’s on your calendar and show any reminders, then it’ll play your choice of news sources, music, radio, podcasts or audiobook. It can even switch on lights and other smart home devices.You can set up routines to do lots of different things and tie them to your own custom phrases. You need to invest a bit of time to figure out what you want to do, but it’s a really powerful system worth trying out.Having started slowly with third-party smart home device integration, Google can now control almost any smart home device, from lights, to cameras, thermostats and even locks, with notable exceptions being Amazon’s Ring and Sonos speakers.Recently Google turned its Home app into a one-stop-shop for controlling connected devices. The Home Hub takes that easy all-in-one control station to the next level.Swipe down from the top to reveal a panel with all your Google Assistant connected smart home devices. From there you can turn on lights and adjust their brightness and colours, see cameras, adjust the temperature or do anything else from an easy to use command and control screen. There’s even a button to turn it all off, right from the screen.Expensive, custom installation smart homes have had this kind of touchscreen dashboard system for a while, but it’s been difficult to achieve with off-the-shelf kit until now. Voice control is great, but when you’re trying to do lots of things at once and see the status of devices, touchscreen buttons are better.Google’s recent push into digital wellbeing extends to the Home Hub. You can set scheduled downtime blocking responses from Assistant as well as music and video on the display, while leaving alarms and timers accessible.Filters can also restrict YouTube to certain content, such as that included in YouTube Kids, or block it entirely. They can also block explicit music tracks or all music, block voice calls, restrict Assistant’s answers to basic things like the weather and block third-party app actions except for those specifically designed for families.These filters can be applied wholesale on the device or only for supervised accounts or guests, so if you don’t want your kids watching YouTube you can block access to it.It does a great job of rendering the Assistant’s voice, and works perfectly well for watching YouTube videos and news broadcasts. But it doesn’t really compare to the audio you get from Amazon’s first-generation Echo Show.The Google Home Hub costs £139 and is available in grey, black, turquoise or pink.The Google Home Hub is arguably the best smart display on the market. It’s much smaller than you might expect, with a really good-looking 7in screen that appears to be mounted into a small fabric cushion that’s only visible at the bottom.It’s a simple, understated design that blends in well with furnishings, and would be as at home on a book case or mantle piece as on a table or work surface side. The lack of a camera is probably a plus point for those, like me, who will never video call anyone, and you can still do things on the touchscreen with the mic muted.Recipes are particularly good on the Home Hub, while the added one-touch smart home control, status and camera display is brilliant. It’s not a great music speaker for the money though and the fabric surface is going to be more difficult to keep clean in a kitchen.But the Home Hub is cheaper than most of the competition and gets much more than just the basics right. If you swim in Google’s ecosystem, this is the smart display for you.Pros: great touchscreen, minimalist design, Bluetooth, Google Assistant, can hear you well, excellent smart home control, great recipes, cheaper than the competitionCons: no 3.5mm socket, fabric could get dirty in a kitchen, need to dig into the Google Home app to change almost any setting, only Google services This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

It’s easy to get to, and although it’s not very high, the snow is usually good. The whole place has the feel of a Tuscan town, as opposed to a ski resort. There are a number of comfortable hotels along the single main road, and several restaurants selling rustic Tuscan mountain fare such as polenta with boar sauce. It’s perfect for families, less so for those looking for nightlife, as there isn’t very much. • abetoneFederico MoscogiuriA snowy train ride from the city of Liberec, through forested foothills, takes you to this gem of a small ski resort.

Church bells were rung in towns and villages across the UK, for the first time since the war began, both as a symbolic gesture and to let people know the war was over.Though this was a joyous moment for the allies at least, the devastating loss of life affected many families and communities in Britain and across the world.

Lifeboats were launched and a helicopter was scrambled but had to turn back because of the poor visibility.Rescuers confirmed that nobody had been knocked into the water. Forty passengers who were on board the ferry, Red Falcon, made it to dry land safely after being trapped on board for three hours while the vessel was re-floated.On Monday a spokeswoman for Red Funnel described the suspensions as “standard practice in any maritime incident of this nature”.The firm’s chief executive, Fran Collins, said the boats involved in the collision were “unmanned, moored yachts” and no injuries were reported.She said: “On behalf of Red Funnel, I would like to apologise to all passengers disrupted by this incident, and emphasise that we give the safety of our passengers and crew the highest priority.”Red Funnel said an inspection of Red Falcon found it was not damaged. It returned to service and a normal timetable operated on Monday.The Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB) have dispatched investigators to begin gathering evidence.Investigators were already looking into an incident on 29 September in which Red Falcon was involved in a collision with a motor cruiser off the coast of Hampshire.Just two days before that a different Red Funnel ferry, Red Eagle, was involved in another incident in dense fog, colliding with a catamaran and a channel marker post.The company said it was too soon to speculate about any similarities between Monday’s incident and the September 27 one but because both happened in restricted visibility it was making immediate changes to its operating procedures.Red Funnel describes itself as “the original Isle of Wight ferry company” with roots going back to 1820. Based in Southampton, it employs some 460 people.The company carries 2.3 million passengers and over 857,000 vehicles on its ferry route between Southampton and East Cowes and over 1.1 million passengers between Southampton and West Cowes on its Red Jet Hi-Speed service."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69f1aad8db68831bfda59b3fa024789c0876abec/0_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=341e7adf3962b86e859a9e73f18b7f79","title":"italian politics for dummies documentary ismaele la vardera palermo","story":"Ismaele La Vardera, who stood for mayor in Palermo, used secret cameras to capture dealmakingIn early 2017, Ismaele La Vardera, a 22-year-old Sicilian journalist, surprised the Italian political scene when he announced his candidacy for mayor in the southern city of Palermo. Even more surprising was his decision to stand for the League, whose leader, Italy’s interior minister, Matteo Salvini, has repeatedly denigrated southern Italians.The footage has been made into a documentary called Italian Politics for Dummies. Scheduled for release at the end of November, the film shines a light on the workings of Italy’s populist parties, as well as alleged mafia interference.“While I was on the campaign trail, I was amazed by certain things that were happening to me,” La Vardera said in an interview. “That’s when I decided it might be worth it to record everything.”La Vardera styled himself as a David battling the Goliaths of the political establishment. He was immediately courted by Salvini’s party, who were interested in marketing him as an anti-establishment outsider. Salvini formalised the party’s endorsement during a two-hour conversation with La Vardera that was secretly filmed. He told the young candidate the party would present him as “something totally new in the swamp of old politics”.La Vardera was also courted by Giorgia Meloni, the leader of the far-right party Fratelli d’Italia, who offered to put him on the party slate.The most striking segment of the film takes place in the basement of an apartment building in the Kalsa neighbourhood of Palermo, a Sicilian mafia stronghold. La Vardera had been accompanied to the apartment by a former Palermo councilman to meet a relative of the imprisoned mafia boss Gino “U Mitra” Abbate.The relative offered a deal: “We can deliver 300 votes in this district, but they’ll cost you €30 (£26) each. Here, people need food. Here, we decide who people will vote for, otherwise they don’t vote.”“I was astonished,” La Vardera said after. “I thought, is this really happening to me?” As for his League endorsement, La Vardera said the party would never have found out about the deal. “Anyone who makes a deal with a boss doesn’t talk about it,” he said.In another scene from the film, La Vardera is invited to the home of the former Sicilian governor Salvatore Cuffaro, who served nearly five years in prison for aiding the Cosa Nostra. In the event of a second ballot, Cuffaro tried to convince him to support the candidate running for mayor with another party, Forza Italia.In exchange, Cuffaro suggested he could work out a position for La Vardera in local government or “in a coalition during the next round of Italian elections”. “If you play with us, I will do what it takes so that you’ll be elected,” Cuffaro said. The implication, La Vardera said, was that despite his criminal conviction, Cuffaro was acting as political matchmaker.When La Vardera went public after the election and admitted to having recorded his meetings on hidden camera, a frenzied debated ensued around the ethics of his work. Had he offered a fake candidacy with the sole purpose of making a film? A judge has since ruled that his campaign was authentic.After the vote the journalist went back to the people he had secretly filmed, including Cuffaro and Meloni. “There are already tons of wiretaps about me in court,” Cuffaro joked. “The conversations you have recorded between me and you, will not change anything’’.Meloni, who had publicly endorsed La Vardera, said she was “disappointed with him”. “If you are trying to prove we all suck then do it,” Meloni told him. She said she would not pursue him in the courts. Salvini declined to comment.Davide Parenti, one of the most famous television producers in Italy, co-produced the film. He said he hoped it would shed light on the workings of Italian politics. “The logic of the old system was ‘I scratch your back, you scratch mine,’” Parenti said. “Today’s politicians in Italy work toward immediate consensus,” he added, referring to the advances made by the League and Fratelli d’Italia towards La Vardera.The irony, Parenti said, is that for Italy’s populists, “everything is live and measurable by social media, as if no action makes sense unless it’s recorded by someone. Who knows how they’ll react to the fact that we recorded everything? Even them.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/59a87fe599c95048e135b5379116c5d9f8f93049/144_201_5714_3428/master/5714.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=39bfda511183054580428982c5ff26e1","title":"longest sea bridge to open china hong kong zhuhai macau permit","story":"Chinese project is one of the most criticised initiatives in Hong Kong, where the bridge is seen as another way for Beijing to extend its controlby  Lily Kuo in BeijingThe world’s longest sea bridge is set to open this week, linking the cities of Hong Kong and Macau to the Chinese mainland as part of a broader contentious plan to integrate the special administrative regions into China.The $20bn Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau bridge officially opens on Tuesday in a ceremony that Chinese president Xi Jinping is reportedly planning to attend. Officials are billing the 55km bridge as a key part of the Greater Bay Area plan, a campaign to connect Hong Kong and Macau to 11 Chinese cities to form a high-tech region to rival Silicon Valley.The bridge links Hong Kong’s Lantau island to Zhuhai on the southern coast of Guangdong province and the gambling hub of Macau, a popular tourist spot for Chinese visitors.“The bridge is not just a mega transport infrastructure jointly built by Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macau,” Hong Kong’s secretary for transport and housing, Frank Chan Fan, said on Friday.“The collaboration between Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao in terms of trade, finance, logistics and tourism will be strengthened. Hong Kong will assume a more proactive role in the development of the Greater Bay Area.”However, private cars will only be able to use it after applying for a special permit.The crossing will mostly be used by private shuttle buses and freight vehicles. The bridge is not served by public transport.Since its inception, it has been one of the most criticised initiatives in Hong Kong, where residents believe it is a poor use of taxpayer funds. Conservationists have blamed bridge construction for falling numbers of the threatened Chinese white dolphin. Others say the bridge is another way for Beijing to bind the autonomous administrative regions closer to China.Under construction since 2009, the structure is supported by three cable-stayed bridges and designed to withstand winds of up to 340km an hour. A 6.7km undersea tunnel has been built to avoid disrupting shipping lanes, connected by two artificial islands.Towers above the bridge are designed to look like dolphins, in honour of the white dolphin, Chinese knots and a boat’s mast, according to the bridge’s designer. The curves of the road are meant to resemble a snake. Originally slated to open in 2016, the bridge has been dogged by construction delays, budget overruns, and safety issues. Nine workers have died and more than 200 others have been injured building the bridge. This year, six subcontractors have been fined for endangering workers.Earlier this year, concrete blocks around the artificial island appeared to be floating away, prompting criticism of the quality of the bridge. Officials said the placement was deliberate.Some say the bridge is not needed, given existing transport links to mainland China. “I don’t think people are too excited about it. It’s been dragged on for so long and it’s so expensive, and there are already means of going to the western side of the Pearl River Delta,” said Mee Kam Ng, a professor at the department of geography at the Chinese University in Hong Kong.In some ways, the bridge does advance integration of the three cities. Commuters on the bridge will go through three different checkpoints for Hong Kong, Macau, and Zhuhai.“From the opening of the bridge to the eventual integration of these three different places, with three different sets of institutions, regulatory regimes, and very different histories and cultures, it is an interesting experiment,” Ng said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/97611e832dd06ade9bdb38ddeab70a09dc2dc021/0_241_4698_2818/master/4698.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e55282f7f37bf5693478cf397eb19a13","title":"macedonia name change north us diplomacy greece skopje","story":"Senior official’s visit comes after Skopje parliament approved start of constitutional processWashington is sending a senior diplomat to Macedonia as international support for the country’s name change intensifies, days after MPs took a decisive step towards approving the measure.In what will be the latest example of western backing for the strategic Balkan state’s membership of Nato and the EU, Matthew Palmer, the US deputy assistant secretary of state, arrives in Skopje on Monday.Palmer’s visit comes barely 48 hours after Macedonian politicians agreed to initiate the constitutional changes needed to rename the former Yugoslav republic North Macedonia. The knife-edge vote late on Friday followed hours of high drama in Macedonia’s 120-seat parliament.The US state department went out of its way to welcome the parliamentary result, which was opposed by Russia. In a tweet over the weekend, the department’s spokesperson Heather Nauert said: “The US believes that the Prespa Agreement is a historic opportunity to advance stability, security and prosperity throughout the region.”The accord – reached with Greece after 27 years of bitter wrangling over the republic’s name – is fiercely contested by Moscow, which has long viewed the ex-communist region as a traditional sphere of influence. Athens says it will lift its decade-long veto against the landlocked state joining Nato after the change of name, which Greeks have long believed implied territorial ambitions against their own adjacent province of Macedonia.Rightwing nationalists in the opposition VMRO party, backed by Russia, had sought hard to prevent any colleagues endorsing Prime Minister Zoran Zaev’s attempt to amend the constitution – the first step in an arduous process for the country to adopt a new name.With just 72 MPs, Zaev’s two-party coalition fell eight short of being able to pass the motion without opposition support.The dissident MPs were immediately ejected from the VMRO party – making it easier, analysts said, for parliament to endorse further votes in the weeks ahead.The Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, praised the ballot on Saturday as he assumed the post of foreign minister following the abrupt resignation of Nikos Kotzias last week. In a tweet congratulating Zaev, he described the vote as “a big step towards our common success. A very important step to a prosperous future for our people!”Under the deal, Greece’s 300-member parliament must follow MPs in Skopje by ratifying the agreement.Tsipras, whose leftist Syriza party views resolution of the row as a major foreign policy success, vowed to remain in post for “as long as it takes” to see the Macedonia deal through.But, echoing the drama that has gripped Skopje, Panos Kammenos, who heads the small nationalist Independent Greeks, the coalition’s junior partner, pledged to withdraw its support for the government when politicians were called to endorse the accord. “Our cooperation with Syriza in government, our presence in government … will be until such time when the agreement comes to parliament,” he said Sunday. “Then honestly and cleanly, as we have said, we will withdraw. Our position couldn’t be clearer.”Kammenos claimed that opposition MPs in Skopje had only agreed to support the name change after receiving €2m (£1.76) in bribes."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3671668.1540215405!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit explained what is the transition period and why is it linked to the backstop","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tProtesters participate in an anti-Brexit demonstration in central Belfast. File photograph: Clodagh KilcoyneReutersThe Brexit talks have entered a new jungle of jargon, full of talk of the transition period and the backstop. Let’s look at the key points and, crucially how they are – or are not – linked together.What is the transition period?The United Kingdom and the European Union have been negotiating a withdrawal agreement which provides the details of how the UK will exit the EU in March 2019. Part of that agreement is the transition period. Assuming there is a withdrawal agreement, during the transition period a kind of standstill will be in place where current trading arrangements between the EU and UK will continue, as will freedom of movement of citizens. The idea is to give time for a new deal on the future relationship between the EU and UK to be worked out after the UK leaves. During the transition period the UK agrees to continue to abide by the EU’s rules and to be subject to the rulings of EU courts, but will have no say around the EU table. This is an aspect of the transition that is not popular with the hard Brexiteers. Partly due to such sensitivities, the UK side often refer to it as the “implementation period”, presumably to give the impression that it is all about getting on with leaving. So now they are talking about extending it?Yes, at the recent EU summit, one option being discussed was that the transition period be extended. Reports suggested that the EU side were willing to extend it by one year, to the end of December 2021. This suggestion led to predictable ire from the Brexiteers, who complain that during the transition the UK has to follow EU rules without having any say. Subsequently Theresa May seemed to row back and say any extension of the transition might be for a “ few months.” And the link to the backstop?But some UK commentary has been suggesting that an extended transition period was a substitute for a backstop?Yes, indeed. In a newspaper article, UK Brexit secretary Dominic Raab, said that the UK could only sign up to an extended transition period as an alternative to the backstop plan put forward by Brussels. So he has turned a concession from the EU side – an extended transition period –into something the UK itself would only offer if the EU dropped its insistence on the backstop. No wonder this is confusing.Not surprisingly, the Irish side have been out in response. They are saying that whatever happens with the transition period, the Border backstop must stay in place as an insurance policy. They also point out that the UK signed up to this last December. Ireland would be happy to see an extended transition period as well – it gives more time for businesses to adjust and hopefully for future trade talks. But an extended transition was never seen as some kind of substitute for the backstop and Ireland will be concerned that the UK commitment to the backstop has not yet been agreed in a legal form as part of the withdrawal agreement.The talks are due to go on – though it is not clear if political events in the UK, which now include rumours of a heave against Theresa May, will intervene. If the talks do progress, the EU side will insist that its concept of a backstop must remain, though presumably an extended transition may also feature in the mix. There is speculation that the EU is open to also allowing all of the UK to remain in the EU customs union – which allows movement of goods free of customs controls –for some kind of interim period, as a way to avoid some of the Irish Border problems. The UK has also suggested that there must be some time-limit to the backstop, or some mechanism to end it, another suggestion objected to by the EU side as it would undermine the idea of the backstop as a permanent insurance policy.If there is no withdrawal agreement then there is no transition period either. This means the UK leaves the EU on March 29 2019 and new trading and regulatory rules come into play overnight, a potentially chaotic scenario. This is what is called a “no-deal” or “cliff-edge” Brexit. The final point to note is that pretty much everyone agrees that a transition period up to December 2020 will not be enough time to negotiate and agree all future trading arrangements between the EU and UK, barring a UK reversal of course on what is it looking for. So even if there current hurdle is jumped and we do get a withdrawal agreement, more drama lies ahead.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

The Tory politician said had “disturbing echoes” of the MPs’ expenses scandal.However the Bank’s chair of court, Bradley Fried,\u0026nbsphas also since sought to correct the revelation over the £11,000 flight taken by Mr\u0026nbspKashyap, claiming the cost in fact covered four transatlantic airfares and has now been amended on the Bank’s website.The newly-released\u0026nbspfigures show that between March and May Mr Kashyap spent £22,266 on travel costs, including three return flights from Chicago to London.His car hire and taxi costs added £337 on top.Mr\u0026nbspKohn, the US-based FPC\u0026nbspmember, spent nearly £31,000 on his own travel, including three return flights from Washington to London. He spent\u0026nbspanother £595 on car hire and taxis.Mr Fried\u0026nbsptold the Treasury Select Committee following the June hearing that the Bank would continue to “review and refresh” its travel and expenses policy and report back.Ms Morgan said: “The Committee will keep a watchful eye on the review, and its impact on the Bank’s expenses.”Mr Carney has already sought to defend the Bank’s spending, claiming in June the foreign travel expenses were justified.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Former politan Police commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe who has called for an urgent review of the evidence around legislation of cannabis.

Jobs will be lost and supply chains moved,” Ms Fairburn said.“The knock-on effect for the UK economy would be significant. Living standards would be affected and less money would be available for vital public services including schools, hospitals and housing.“Uncertainty is draining investment from the UK, with Brexit having a negative impact on 8 in 10 businesses.\u0026nbsp“From a multinational plastics manufacturer which has cancelled a £7m investment, to a fashion house shelving £50m plans for a new UK factory, these are grave losses to our economy.”At the latest EU summit, negotiators made little in the way of concrete progress, and leaders agreed to shelve a planned November meeting where a Brexit deal was supposed to be finalised – stating that “decisive progress” had not been made in time.“Ninety percent of the accord on the table has been agreed with Britain,” Mr Barnier told French broadcaster Inter radio.“I’m convinced a deal is necessary, I’m still not sure we’ll get one.Confederation of British IndustryShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The Tory politician said had “disturbing echoes” of the MPs’ expenses scandal.However the Bank’s chair of court, Bradley Fried,\u0026nbsphas also since sought to correct the revelation over the £11,000 flight taken by Mr\u0026nbspKashyap, claiming the cost in fact covered four transatlantic airfares and has now been amended on the Bank’s website.The newly-released\u0026nbspfigures show that between March and May Mr Kashyap spent £22,266 on travel costs, including three return flights from Chicago to London.His car hire and taxi costs added £337 on top.Mr\u0026nbspKohn, the US-based FPC\u0026nbspmember, spent nearly £31,000 on his own travel, including three return flights from Washington to London. He spent\u0026nbspanother £595 on car hire and taxis.Mr Fried\u0026nbsptold the Treasury Select Committee following the June hearing that the Bank would continue to “review and refresh” its travel and expenses policy and report back.Ms Morgan said: “The Committee will keep a watchful eye on the review, and its impact on the Bank’s expenses.”Mr Carney has already sought to defend the Bank’s spending, claiming in June the foreign travel expenses were justified.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Former politan Police commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe who has called for an urgent review of the evidence around legislation of cannabis.

Jobs will be lost and supply chains moved,” Ms Fairburn said.“The knock-on effect for the UK economy would be significant. Living standards would be affected and less money would be available for vital public services including schools, hospitals and housing.“Uncertainty is draining investment from the UK, with Brexit having a negative impact on 8 in 10 businesses.\u0026nbsp“From a multinational plastics manufacturer which has cancelled a £7m investment, to a fashion house shelving £50m plans for a new UK factory, these are grave losses to our economy.”At the latest EU summit, negotiators made little in the way of concrete progress, and leaders agreed to shelve a planned November meeting where a Brexit deal was supposed to be finalised – stating that “decisive progress” had not been made in time.“Ninety percent of the accord on the table has been agreed with Britain,” Mr Barnier told French broadcaster Inter radio.“I’m convinced a deal is necessary, I’m still not sure we’ll get one.Confederation of British IndustryShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

By 2010, the energy-producing kites were being built with rigid wings that could harness more power from a higher lift.The most recent version of the Makani kite was first flown in test flights in December 2016, performing loop-the-loops in a wide circle in the skies that produced up to 600 kW – enough electricity to power around 300 homes.It is estimated that wind power has the potential to meet the world\u0027s energy need 100-times over,\u0026nbspalthough only four\u0026nbspper cent of the world\u0027s electricity is currently generated from wind.Makani believes that it\u0027s possible to unlock additional wind resources that aren\u0027t accessible or cost effective today, the project\u0027s website states.\u0026nbspOur low mass opens up new possibilities for wind power in deepwater offshore sites. We continue to design, prototype and test energy kites so that more people around the world can have access to clean, affordable wind power.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It also comes in a whole host of looks, with Apple re-introducing brighter colours to its range.Beyond the design, the features of the iPhone Xr are almost the same as its more expensive sibling. It still features the beefed up A12 bionic processor and the improved camera.But it also removes some of the more expensive features, too. The Xr has an LCD screen rather than the richer OLED found on the Xs, and features only one camera on the back instead of two.The Xr starts at $749 in the US, or roughly in the same in pounds and euros. The same carriers that offered deals on the Xs are doing so for the Xr.The handset will actually go on sale – and arrive with people who pre-order it – just a few days before Apple\u0027s next big launch event. On 30 October in New York, it is expected to show off new updates to the iPad\u0026nbspPro and its Macs.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

While the Richard Curtis film features an\u0026nbspensemble cast,\u0026nbspwith Hugh Grant as top billing, some viewers are seeing\u0026nbspChiwetel Ejiofor\u0026nbspon the film’s Netflix thumbnail\u0026nbspdespite the British actor only having a minor role (he does not feature on the theatrical poster).\u0026nbspSimilarly,\u0026nbspthe streaming service is promoting their original series The Good Cop, a murder mystery, with\u0026nbspblack characters front and centre on the thumbnail\u0026nbspthe series’\u0026nbspprincipal cast are majority white.On Twitter, writer Stacia L Brown pointed out how the poster for the Kelsey Grammer\u0026nbspand Kristen Bell-starring\u0026nbspLike Father was appearing with two black actors on the thumbnail.“Other Black Netflix users: does your queue do this? Generate posters with the Black cast members on them to try to compel you to watch?” she wrote.“This film stars Kristen BellKelsey Grammer and these actors had maaaaybe a 10 cumulative minutes of screen time. 20 lines between them, tops.”Tolani Shoneye, who hosts The Receipts Podcast, told\u0026nbsp:\u0026nbsp“It’s intrusive. It’s the dark side of marketing. I noticed it a while ago with a Zac Efron film that I’d already seen, but Netflix kept showing me it as a Michael B Jordan movie.”She continued: “There was 30 minutes of a romcom I ended up watching last week because I thought it was about the black couple I was shown on the poster. I want to see those stories. They know I want to see those stories. Why don’t they just make more of them?”\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.The 25 best TV shows on Netflix UK Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A cartoon about a talking horse, starring the goofy older brother from Arrested Development… on paper little about BoJack Horseman screams “must watch”. Yet the series almost immediately transcended its format to deliver a moving and very funny rumination on depression and middle-age malaise. Will Arnett plays BoJack – one time star of Nineties hit sitcom Horsin’ Around – as a lost soul whose turbo-charged narcissism prevents him getting his life together. A valentine to the Spielberg school of Eighties blockbuster, with Winona Ryder as a small town mom whose son is abducted by a transdimensional monster. ET, Goonies, Close Encounters, Alien and everything Stephen King wrote between 1975 and 1990 are all tossed into the blender by Millennial writer-creators the Duffer brothers. It was clear Stranger Things was going to be a mega-smash when Barb – the “best friend” character eaten in the second episode – went viral the weekend it dropped. Netflix’s Marvel shows tend towards the overlong and turgid. An exception is the high-kicking Daredevil, with Charlie Cox’s blind lawyercrimefighter banishing all memory of Ben Affleck\u0027s turn donning the red jumpsuit in 2003. With New York’s Hell’s Kitchen neighbourhood as backdrop, Daredevil is caked in street-level grit and features a searing series one performance by Vincent D\u0027Onofrio as the villainous Kingpin. The perfect antidote to the deafening bombast of the big screen Marvel movies. Did he do it? Does it matter considering the lengths the Durham, North Carolina police seemingly went in order to stitch him up? Sitting through this twisting, turning documenting about the trial of Michael Peterson – charged with the murder in 2003 of his wife – the viewer may find themselves alternately empathising with and recoiling from the accused. It’s a feat of bravura factual filmmaking from French documentarian Jean-Xavier de Lestrade, which comes to Netflix with a recently shot three-part coda catching up with the (very weird) Peterson clan a decade on. Stranger Things: the Euro-Gloom years. Netflix’s first German-language production is a pulp romp that thinks it’s a Wagner opera. In a remote town surrounded by a creepy forest locals fear the disappearance of a teenager may be linked to other missing persons cases from decades earlier. The timelines get twisted and it’s obvious that something wicked is emanating from a tunnel leading to a nearby nuclear power plant. Yet if the story sometimes trips itself up the Goonies-meets-Götterdämmerung ambiance keeps you hooked. 625 A Series of Unfortunate EventsThe wry and bleak Lemony Snickett children novels finally get the ghastly adaptation they deserve (let’s all pretend the dreadful 2004 Jim Carrey movie never happened). Neil Patrick Harris gobbles up the scenery as the vain and wicked Count Olaf, desperate to separate the Baudelaire orphans from their considerable inheritance. The look is Tim Burton by way of Wes Anderson, and the dark wit of the books is replicated perfectly (Snickett, aka Daniel Handler, is co-producer). If you’re curious as to how Cary Fukunaga will handle the Bond franchise, his limited series, starring Emma Stone and Jonah Hill, drops some delicious hints. It’s a mind-bending sci-fi story set in an alternative United States where computers still look like Commodore 64s and in which you pay for goods by having a “travel buddy” sit down and read you adverts. The Breaking Bad prequel is starting to outgrow the show that spawned it. Where Breaking Bad delivered a master-class in scorched earth storytelling Saul is gentler and more humane. Years before the rise of Walter White, the future meth overlord’s sleazy lawyer, Saul Goodman, is still plain old Jimmy McGill, a striving every-dude trying to catch a break. But how far will he go to make his name and escape the shadow of his superstar attorney brother Chuck (Michael McKean)? Don’t tell Channel 4 but Charlie Brooker’s dystopian anthology series has arguably got even better since making the jump from British terrestrial TV to the realm of megabucks American streaming. Bigger budgets have given creators Brooker and Annabel Jones license to let their imaginations off the leash – yielding unsurpassable episodes such as virtual reality love story San Junipero and Star Trek parody USS Callister, which has bagged a bunch of Emmys. David Fincher produces this serial killer drama based on the writings of a real-life FBI psychological profiler. It’s the post-Watergate Seventies and two maverick G-Men (Jonathan Groff and Holt McCallany) are going out on a limb by utilising the latest psychological research to get inside the heads of a motley assembly of real-life sociopathic murders – including the notorious “Co-Ed” butcher Ed Kemper, brought chillingly to live in an Emmy-nominated performance by Cameron Britton. A right royal blockbuster from dramatist Peter Morgan (The Queen, Frost  Nixon). Tracing the reign of Elizabeth II from her days as a wide-eyed young woman propelled to the throne after the surprise early death of her father, The Crown humanises the royals even as it paints their private lives as a bodice-ripping soap. Matt Smith is charmingly roguish as Prince Philip and Vanessa Kirby has ascended the Hollywood ranks on the back of her turn as the flawed yet sympathetic Princess Margaret. This drug trafficking caper spells out exactly what kind of series it is with an early scene in which two gangsters zip around a multi-level carpark on a motorbike firing a machine gun. Narcos, in other words, is for people who consider Pacino’s Scarface a touch too understated. Series one and two feature a mesmerising performance by Wagner Moura as Columbian cocaine kingpin Pablo Escobar, while season three focuses on the notorious Cali cartel. Reported to be one of Netflix’s biggest hits – the company doesn’t release audience figures – the fourth season turns its attention to Mexico’s interminable drugs wars. A cloud hangs over Aziz Ansari’s future after he was embroiled in the #MeToo scandal. But whatever happens, he has left us with a humane and riveting sitcom about an Ansari-proximate character looking for love and trying to establish himself professionally in contemporary New York. One of Netflix’s early blockbusters, the sprawling soap opera updates Dallas to modern day southern Florida. Against the edge-of-civilisation backdrop of the Florida Keys, Kyle Chandler plays the local detective and favourite son of a well-to-do family. Their idyllic lives are thrown into chaos with the return of the clan’s black sheep (an unnervingly intense Ben Mendelsohn). The story is spectacularly hokey but searing performances by Chandler and Mendelsohn, and by Sissy Spacek and the late Sam Shepard as their imperious parents, make Bloodline compelling – a guilty pleasure that, actually, you shouldn’t feel all that guilty about. You can almost smell the shoddy sanitation and horse-manure in this lavish murder-mystery set in 19th New York. We’re firmly in Martin Scorsese\u0027s Gangs of New York territory, with a serial killer bumping off boy prostitutes across Manhattan. Enter pioneering criminal psychologist Dr Laszlo Kreisler (Daniel Brühl), aided by newspaper man John Moore (Luke Evans) and feisty lady detective Sara Howard (Dakota Fanning). Judd Apatow bring his signature gross-out comedy to the small screen. Love, which Apatow produced, is a masterclass in restraint compared to 40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up etc. Paul Rust is Gus, a nerdish movie set tutor, whose develops a crush on Gillian Jacobs’s too-cool-for-school radio producer Mickey. Romance, of a sort, blossoms – but Love’s triumph is to acknowledge the complications of real life and to disabuse its characters of the idea that there’s such a thing as a straightforward happy ending. Hipster LA provides the bustling setting. Who says reality TV has to be nasty and manipulative? This updating of the early 2000s hit Queer Eye for the Straight Guy has five stereotype-challenging gay men sharing lifestyle tips and fashion advice with an engaging cast of All American schlubs (the first two seasons are shot mostly in the state of Georgia). There are laughs – but serious moment too, such as when one of the crew refuses to enter a church because of the still unhealed scars of his strict Christian upbringing. A high-gloss revamping of the traditional TV food show. Each episode profiles a high wattage international chef across its three seasons, the series has featured gastronomic superstars from the US, Argentina, India and Korea. A disastrous group interview in which actor Jason Bateman “mansplained” away the bullying co-star Jessica Walter had suffered at the hands of fellow cast-member Jeffrey Tambor meant season five of Arrested Development was fatally compromised before it even landed. Yet Netflix’s return to the dysfunctional world of the Bluth family stands on its merits and is a worthy addition to the surreal humour of seasons one through three (series four, which had to work around the busy schedules of the cast, is disposable by comparison). Netflix does Bladerunner with this sumptuous adaptation of the cult Richard Morgan novel. The setting is a neon-splashed cyberpunk future in which the super-wealthy live forever by uploading the consciousness into new “skins”. Enter rebel-turned-detective Takeshi Kovacs (Joel Kinnaman), hired to find out who killed a (since resurrected) zillionaire industrialist while dealing with fallout from his own troubled past. Rumoured to be one of Netflix’s most expensive projects yet, for its second run, Anthony Mackie (aka Marvel’s Falcon) replaced Kinnaman as the shape-shifting Kovacs.2125 Rick and MortyDan Harmon, creator of cult sitcom Community (also on Netflix), finds the perfect outlet for zany fanboy imagination with this crazed animated comedy about a Marty McFlyDoc Brown-esque duo of time travellers. Every genre imaginable is parodied with the manic energy and zinging dialogue we have come to expect from Harmon.Mad Men’s Alison Brie is our entry point into this comedy-drama inspired by a real life all-female wrestling league in the Eighties. Ruth Wilder (Brie) is a down-on-her luck actor who, out of desperation, signs up a wrestling competition willed into being by Sam Sylvia (podcast king Marc Maron). Britrock singer Kate Nash is one of her her fellow troupe members: the larger than life Rhonda “Britannica” Richardson.Deadpan animated satire about an idiot super spy with shaken and stirred mother issues. One of the most ambitious modern comedies, animated or otherwise, Archer tries on different varieties of humour for size and even occasionally tugs at the heart strings.Breaking Bad for those with short attention s. The saga of Walter White took years to track the iconic anti-hero’s rise from mild mannered everyman to dead-eyed criminal. Ozark gets there in the first half hour as nebbish Chicago accountant Marty Byrde (Jason Bateman) agrees to serve as lieutenant for the Mexican mob in the hillbilly heartlands of Ozark, Missouri (in return they thoughtfully spare his life). Bateman, usually seen in comedy roles, is a revelation as is Laura Linney as his nasty wife Wendy. There is also a break-out performance by Julia Garner playing the scion of a local redneck crime family.A heavenly comedy with a twist. Eleanor Shellstrop (Kristen Bell) is a cynical schlub waved through the Pearly Gates by mistake after dying in a bizarre supermarket accident. There she must remain above the suspicions of seemingly well-meaning but disorganised angel Michael (Ted Danson) whilst also negotiating fractious relationships with do-gooder Chidi (William Jackson Harper), spoiled princess Tahani (former T4 presenter Jameela Jamil) and ex-drug dealer Jason (Manny Jacinto).A cartoon about a talking horse, starring the goofy older brother from Arrested Development… on paper little about BoJack Horseman screams “must watch”. Yet the series almost immediately transcended its format to deliver a moving and very funny rumination on depression and middle-age malaise. Will Arnett plays BoJack – one time star of Nineties hit sitcom Horsin’ Around – as a lost soul whose turbo-charged narcissism prevents him getting his life together. A valentine to the Spielberg school of Eighties blockbuster, with Winona Ryder as a small town mom whose son is abducted by a transdimensional monster. ET, Goonies, Close Encounters, Alien and everything Stephen King wrote between 1975 and 1990 are all tossed into the blender by Millennial writer-creators the Duffer brothers. It was clear Stranger Things was going to be a mega-smash when Barb – the “best friend” character eaten in the second episode – went viral the weekend it dropped. Netflix’s Marvel shows tend towards the overlong and turgid. An exception is the high-kicking Daredevil, with Charlie Cox’s blind lawyercrimefighter banishing all memory of Ben Affleck\u0027s turn donning the red jumpsuit in 2003. With New York’s Hell’s Kitchen neighbourhood as backdrop, Daredevil is caked in street-level grit and features a searing series one performance by Vincent D\u0027Onofrio as the villainous Kingpin. The perfect antidote to the deafening bombast of the big screen Marvel movies. Did he do it? Does it matter considering the lengths the Durham, North Carolina police seemingly went in order to stitch him up? Sitting through this twisting, turning documenting about the trial of Michael Peterson – charged with the murder in 2003 of his wife – the viewer may find themselves alternately empathising with and recoiling from the accused. It’s a feat of bravura factual filmmaking from French documentarian Jean-Xavier de Lestrade, which comes to Netflix with a recently shot three-part coda catching up with the (very weird) Peterson clan a decade on. Stranger Things: the Euro-Gloom years. Netflix’s first German-language production is a pulp romp that thinks it’s a Wagner opera. In a remote town surrounded by a creepy forest locals fear the disappearance of a teenager may be linked to other missing persons cases from decades earlier. The timelines get twisted and it’s obvious that something wicked is emanating from a tunnel leading to a nearby nuclear power plant. Yet if the story sometimes trips itself up the Goonies-meets-Götterdämmerung ambiance keeps you hooked. 625 A Series of Unfortunate EventsThe wry and bleak Lemony Snickett children novels finally get the ghastly adaptation they deserve (let’s all pretend the dreadful 2004 Jim Carrey movie never happened). Neil Patrick Harris gobbles up the scenery as the vain and wicked Count Olaf, desperate to separate the Baudelaire orphans from their considerable inheritance. The look is Tim Burton by way of Wes Anderson, and the dark wit of the books is replicated perfectly (Snickett, aka Daniel Handler, is co-producer). If you’re curious as to how Cary Fukunaga will handle the Bond franchise, his limited series, starring Emma Stone and Jonah Hill, drops some delicious hints. It’s a mind-bending sci-fi story set in an alternative United States where computers still look like Commodore 64s and in which you pay for goods by having a “travel buddy” sit down and read you adverts. The Breaking Bad prequel is starting to outgrow the show that spawned it. Where Breaking Bad delivered a master-class in scorched earth storytelling Saul is gentler and more humane. Years before the rise of Walter White, the future meth overlord’s sleazy lawyer, Saul Goodman, is still plain old Jimmy McGill, a striving every-dude trying to catch a break. But how far will he go to make his name and escape the shadow of his superstar attorney brother Chuck (Michael McKean)? Don’t tell Channel 4 but Charlie Brooker’s dystopian anthology series has arguably got even better since making the jump from British terrestrial TV to the realm of megabucks American streaming. Bigger budgets have given creators Brooker and Annabel Jones license to let their imaginations off the leash – yielding unsurpassable episodes such as virtual reality love story San Junipero and Star Trek parody USS Callister, which has bagged a bunch of Emmys. David Fincher produces this serial killer drama based on the writings of a real-life FBI psychological profiler. It’s the post-Watergate Seventies and two maverick G-Men (Jonathan Groff and Holt McCallany) are going out on a limb by utilising the latest psychological research to get inside the heads of a motley assembly of real-life sociopathic murders – including the notorious “Co-Ed” butcher Ed Kemper, brought chillingly to live in an Emmy-nominated performance by Cameron Britton.

Normally these kinds of structures are known at lower redshifts, which means when the Universe has had much more time to evolve and construct such huge things. It was a surprise to see something this evolved when the Universe was relatively young!The structure, which is known by scientists as Hyperion, was spotted by a team of scientists who used the European Southern Observatory\u0027s Very Large Telescope to peer into the early universe and look for galaxies forming. It was then they spotted Hyperion, a colossal mass that is more than a million billion times that of the Sun.Vast cosmic explosions could be flinging gold across the universeIt is not only huge but very complex. Hyperion is made up of at least seven high-density regions, which are strung together by threads of galaxies. That structure is different to the kind of superclusters we usually see closer to us, even though the size is similar.Superclusters closer to Earth tend to a much more concentrated distribution of mass with clear structural features, explains Brian Lemaux, an astronomer from University of California, Davis and LAM, and a member of the team behind this result. But in Hyperion, the mass is distributed much more uniformly in a series of connected blobs, populated by loose associations of galaxies.The difference is probably a consequence of the fact that the closer by superclusters have had billions of years of being pushed into denser regions by galaxies. Hyperion, which is much younger, has been subject to that process much less.Eventually, Hyperion will probably evolve into something similar to those structures: the kind that make up the Sloan Great Wall, or the Virgo Supercluster in which our own galaxy sits. Understanding how that process happens could allow us to peer into the past of our own galaxy and understand how it might have formed.Understanding Hyperion and how it compares to similar recent structures can give insights into how the Universe developed in the past and will evolve into the future, and allows us the opportunity to challenge some models of supercluster formation, said\u0026nbspCucciati. Unearthing this cosmic titan helps uncover the history of these large-scale structures.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Smaller craft have previously employed ion thrusters to reach asteroids and the moon.The ion drive will be used not to accelerate the spacecraft but to act as a brake as it falls into the grip of the sun\u0027s powerful gravity.A complex series of fly-bys past the Earth, Venus and Mercury will further reduce its velocity.Even so, BepiColumbo will reach a top speed of 60 kilometres (37 miles) per second.The European Space Agency\u0027s Mercury Planet Orbiter (MPO), which will survey the planet\u0027s surface and probe its chemistry, was built by satellite company Airbus Defence and Space in Stevenage.Airbus also constructed the power unit carrying the orbiters, the Mercury Transfer Module (MTM), in the UK. The ion thrusters were supplied by British defence technology company QinetiQ.One of the European orbiter\u0027s 11 instruments, the Mercury Imaging X-ray Spectrometer (Mixs) was designed and built at the University of Leicester.The Japanese space agency Jaxa\u0027s Mercury Magnetosphere Orbiter (MMO) will study the planet\u0027s internal structure and enveloping magnetic field.A major challenge for mission planners was ensuring the spacecraft could withstand searing temperatures of more than 350C so close to the sun.Protective measures include a heat shield, novel ceramic and titanium insulation, ammonia-filled heat pipes, and in the case of the Japanese orbiter, spinning.Dr Graham Turnock, chief executive of the UK Space Agency, said: UK scientists, engineers and technicians have played a vital role in developing BepiColombo and the incredibly sophisticated set of scientific instruments on board.The international collaboration involved in this mission shows how our leading role in the European Space Agency is ensuring the UK thrives in the new space age, bringing real benefits to UK companies and scientists.Only two spacecraft have previously visited Mercury. Nasa\u0027s Mariner 10 flew past the planet three times in 1974-75 and the American space agency\u0027s Messenger probe orbited Mercury from 2011 to 2015, taking photos of the surface.Dr Jerry Bolter, project manager at Airbus Defence and Space in Stevenage, said: The scientists describe Messenger as the hors d\u0027oeuvre and Bepi asThe spacecraft was named after the late Guiseppe Bepi Colombo, an Italian scientist and engineer who played a leading role in the 1974 Mariner 10 mission to Mercury.Paolo Ferri, head of missions at the European Space Operations Centre (ESOC) in Darmstadt, Germany, said: Mercury is a planet of extremes, and getting there requires some equally extreme techniques, navigation solutions and operations expertise.Additional reporting by Press AssociationShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

I didn’t find the letter to be rude, but I was surprised at the outcome, and the fact that there’s no right of appeal. If I could have requested a review of the decision I think they would have reconsidered.”The Bosnian national said she was also concerned the refusal could make it difficult to get a UK visa in the future, saying: “I feel that after you’ve been refused once, it’s very easy for immigration officers to use this against you. I just hope this doesn’t happen.”Immigration barrister Jan Doerfel\u0026nbspsaid the refusal of the visa for Ms Dzinalija was entirely irrational.“Nadza is a first year masters student in a two-year programme at one of the most prestigious universities in the Netherlands,” he said.“For the Home Office refuse her visa on the basis of an assumption that she would abandon her studies in the Netherlands and use an academic exchange with the University of Glasgow as a pretext to enter the UK unlawfully and live here in the hostile environment is not only unlawful but also deeply insulting to Nadza’s integrity.“It furthermore portrays a feeling of superiority and arrogance not only towards applicants’ actual life choices but also towards our European neighbours as well as an insensitivity towards needs of academic institutions in this country which\u0026nbspaim to keep the UK attractive and at the cutting edge of scientific research.”Niamh Stack, Psychology Professor at Glasgow University, who organised the conference, said her first response to hearing about the denied visa\u0026nbspwas utter disbelief.\u0026nbsp“These students are already on a highly regarded master’s programme at an excellent institution in the Netherlands, she said. They provided clear evidence of their intent to return and their financial stability.“The idea that they would abandon these career paths and established lives in the Netherlands where they have visas to live and study just to stay in the UK was nonsensical.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Former politan Police commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe who has called for an urgent review of the evidence around legislation of cannabis.

We will take responsibility and sort out this mess with a people’s vote.”Speaking to The Independent beforehand, she said many Tory MPs were privately supportive of a second referendum amid bitter isions in the party.Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran said the sheer scale of the event showed that “confidence is growing” in the fight for a fresh vote.To huge cheers, London mayor Sadiq Khan said the march marked a\u0026nbsp“historic moment in our democracy”.Over 700,000 protesters’ call for second Brexit referendumTheresa May told she’s ‘heading for dead end’ in Brexit talksThe collective spreading cheer to Brexit-weary BritsEx-cabinet secretaries condemn Tory Brexiteers for undermining MayFinal Say: Meet some of the people marching a fresh Brexit vote He told protestors: “We’ve heard some complain that a public vote would be undemocratic and unpatriotic. But the opposite is true.“There’s nothing more democratic – nothing more British – than trusting the people to have the final say on our future.”MPs from across the political spectrum addressed the rally, including Green MP Caroline Lucas, Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable, Labour’s Chuka Umunna and Tory MP Dr Sarah Wollaston, who drew huge cheers when she compared\u0026nbspBrexit to a botched operation.Christian Broughton, editor of The Independent,\u0026nbsptold the crowds: “Theresa May says that the Final Say referendum will be a politicians’ vote, not a people’s vote, but we can all remember what some politicians told us in 2016.“We, the people, can all now see what’s really coming. And from where I’m standing it looks like a people’s vote to me.”He revealed that The Independent’s petition for a Final Say had achieved more than 940,000 signatures, adding: “We have to keep on showing up and signing up.”People did show up in their thousands for the march, which was extremely cheerful, except for a handful of Ukip protestors who screamed\u0026nbsp“Losers”\u0026nbspat passers-by from outside Downing Street.An army of students, college pupils and young activists led the march in a sign of the impact of the Brexit vote on the younger generation, some 1.4 million of whom have become eligible to vote since the referendum.Femi Oluwole, from the youth group Our Future Our Choice, told The Independent: “What we are trying to do is bring people together, as nobody has any confidence in what the government is doing.”He said young people were going to be hit hardest by Brexit, both economically and in the opportunities to live and work abroad.Among the crowds was Piero Passet, a 71-year-old restaurant owner from Turin, said he was marching because he was concerned for the future of the younger generation.Created with Sketch.Brexit march for a final say - in pictures Show all 26Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in LondonDemonstrators pass Trafalgar Square as they take part in a march calling for a People\u0027s Vote on the final Brexit deal, in central London on October 20, 2018. - Britons dreading life outside Europe gathered from all corners of the UK to London on Saturday to try to stop their country\u0027s looming breakup with the EU.Demonstrators wave Union and European flags and hold up placards as they pass Trafalgar Square, taking part in a march calling for a People\u0027s Vote on the final Brexit deal, in central London on October 20, 2018. - Britons dreading life outside Europe gathered from all corners of the UK to London on Saturday to try to stop their country\u0027s looming breakup with the EU.

The application process is a three-page form.Last week a law put before the French senate warned that without action “British nationals who enjoy the right of free movement and free establishment throughout the European Union” would face a “requirement to present a visa to enter the French territory and to justify a residence permit to stay there”.The new bill sought to give the French government powers to address emergency issues that a no-deal Brexit might raise.If a Brexit deal is signed, the UK will enter a 21-month transition period, during which free movement will continue until 2021. After that point how British citizens are treated will depend on what future relationship deal has been signed.People\u0027s Vote route as over 100,000 people call for second pollTheresa May told she\u0027s \u0027heading for dead end\u0027 in Brexit talksEx-cabinet secretaries condemn Tory Brexiteers for undermining MayThe EU is generally generous with visa exemptions: granting them to countries ranging from Venezuela, through the United Arab Emirates, to Ukraine. It is however not clear whether there would be scope or political will to grant one to the UK in the event of a no-deal leading up to March 2019, however.Even if the UK does get a visa exemption, British travellers will ultimately face more bureaucracy.When EU’s new ETIAS (European Travel Information and Authorisation System) system comes in, all UK travellers will have to apply in advance and pay a fee to have their journey authorised.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Brexit so far: in pictures Show all 31Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Boris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

The DUP is set to back amendments tabled by Tory Brexiteers that would prevent any new regulatory checks between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK after Brexit.\u0026nbspIt means the amendments, which are backed by around 40 Tory MPs, are likely to pass on Wednesday - and will bind Theresa May\u0027s hands in negotiations with Brussels.\u0026nbspThe EU is insisting on a backstop option that would keep Northern Ireland, but not the rest of the UK, in the customs union - these amendments, if passed,would make that illegal...Here is the\u0026nbsplist of written and oral ministerial statements due to be made in the House of Commons today:- At around 1530 Tory MP John Redwood will ask an Urgent Question on the cost of staying in the EU Customs Union and the cost of the draft Withdrawal Agreement.- At around 1615 Tory MP Dominic Grieve will ask an Urgent Question on the amendability of any motion on the meaningful vote.- At around 1700 the Prime Minister is to make an oral statement on the European Council.- At around 1745, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt is to make an oral statement on the Jamal Khashoggi case.Theresa May has hit back at the language used about her in her opponents’ briefings to the media, writes\u0026nbspThe Independent’s\u0026nbsppolitical editor Joe Watts.Talk of May being in the “killing zone”, of bringing a “noose” to a meeting of Tory MPs later in the week and the really over the top, “the moment is coming when the knife gets heated, stuck in her front and twisted. She\u0027ll be dead soon”, punctuated the weekend’s news.May has been a critic of the kind of aggressive vitriol targeted at MPs on social media in the past.The PM’s spokesman said: “I didn’t intend to dignify those specific anonymous comments with a response.”But he went on: “The prime minister has always been very clear that we must set a tone in public discourse that is neither dehumanising or derogatory.Personal vitriol has no place in our politics.It sets the scene for what will be a difficult session in the House of Commons later as Ms May seeks to persuade rebels on both the Leave and Remain sides of her party not to derail her Brexit proposals.Then she heads into cabinet on Tuesday morning with the 1922 Committee of backbenchers meeting Wednesday to discuss her future.Asked how Theresa May viewed the use of violent language in comments about her position attributed to Conservative MPs, the Prime Minister\u0027s official spokesman said: I don\u0027t intend to dignify those specific anonymous comments with a response.The PM\u0026nbsphas always been very clear that we must set a tone in public discourse that is neither dehumanising nor derogatory.Personal vitriol has no place in our\u0026nbsppolitics.This is from the Press Association on a letter sent by Commons staff in the wake of a damning report, detailing bullying and harassment on the parliamentary estate.MPs should be barred from determining the outcome of bullying or sexual harassment claims made against their Commons colleagues, Westminster officials have said.In an unprecedented letter, dozens of serving and former clerks and other officials - along with several MPs - called for the recommendations of an inquiry into Westminster\u0027s bullying culture to be adopted in full.The officials said that, as well as MPs being stripped of a role in determining allegations about colleagues, the complaints procedures should also be amended so historic claims can be investigated.The letter comes after High Court judge Dame Laura Cox lifted the lid on a toxic environment in Westminster, which included staff having their bottoms and breasts touched in an atmosphere fuelled by ready access to alcohol.Her report found that a culture of deference, subservience, acquiescence and silence had allowed the mistreatment of staff in the House of Commons to thrive.The report heaped pressure on Commons Speaker John Bercow, who has himself been the subject of bullying allegations, which he denies.In their letter to the ruling House of Commons Commission, the former officials said we have personally experienced, or seen first-hand, bullying or harassment by Members of Parliament left to go unchallenged.Dame Laura Cox\u0027s report has exposed Westminster\u0027s open secret - a minority of parliamentarians have been allowed to get away with this behaviour for years.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

For all these reasons, and because we are not intimidated, we would be honoured if you could put our names on your list of denunciations.”Merkel coalition shaken as allies suffer poll humiliation in BavariaGerman AfD party recruits children to expose left-wing teachersGerman politician quits far-right party role after converting to IslamGermany’s far-right AfD says it will fight an ‘invasion of foreigners’Angela Merkel says she will listen to far-right AfD voters concernsThe GEW union encouraged other faculties to send similar letters, posting on social media: “Imitators welcome!”Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) says that its informant website, called “Neutral Schools Online”, is an essential tool to prevent indoctrination in classrooms and protect freedom of speech. It says it is designed to help parents stop their children being manipulated by left-wing teachers.Examples of supposed offences outlined by the AfD range from encouraging pupils to take part in anti-AfD protests to “crude criticism of the AfD” or “incorrect and subjective learning materials”.Critics say the party’s approach recalls that of Nazi Germany and the East German Stasi, which made use of child informants to shut down dissent.When the scheme was launched in Hamburg earlier this month Katarina Barley, the country’s social democrat justice minister, criticised the measure, saying it was “a method of dictators”. She warned that it would cultivate a culture of unease and suspicion. The country’s Christian democrat education minister Susanne Eisenmann also said that the idea was “completely wrong and harmful”.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Australia\u0027s Prime Minister Scott Morrison (C) delivers a national apology to child sex abuse victims in the House of Representatives in Parliament House in Canberra on October 22, 2018. - Morrison on October 22 issued an emotive apology to children who suffered sexual abuse, saying the state had failed to protect them from evil dark crimes committed over decadesA derailed train in Yian, eastern Taiwan.

It was those paid-for photos that led to him having “health problems” and failing to walk his daughter down the aisle.After appearing on every TV and radio outlet that would pay for her bile-fuelled rants, Samantha recently tried to gain entrance to Buckingham Palace to meet Meghan.She was, quite rightly, told by grim-faced security staff to bog off.None of Samantha’s vitriol has stuck and most of the world has fallen almost as head-over-heels in love with Meghan as her besotted husband — especially since the news broke that they are expecting.Given that no one is interested in Samantha’s hysterical attacks on her sister, she wants to bury the hatchet.She has apologised for any past tensions and exclaimed that she’s jumping with joy at the baby news.It’s too little too late, and I’m sure Meghan would agree.Samantha has crossed the line too many times to be forgiven now.If she had shown any loyalty she might have been invited to the ­wedding and welcomed into the royal fold. But instead of acting as a peace-maker, Samantha stirred bad feeling between Meghan and her estranged father.A loving sister would have tried to build bridges, unite family ­factions and show solidarity with Meghan.I’m sure the new Duchess of Sussex would have ­welcomed having family members around her as she adjusted to le in the royal goldfish bowl.In the end, Meghan had only ONE close relative at her wedding, her mum Doria.Along with the absence of the late Princess Diana, it was the day’s only sad note.Samantha could have had a starring role as a loyal sister helping Meghan adjust from successful actress to worldwide megastar.The media would have fallen over themselves to talk to her for insights into her famous sister, but not any more. We are all very tired of Samantha’s negativity and venom.No one has any time for her any more, and for such an attention-seeker that has got to hurt.If she had been kind to Meghan, Samantha would still be relevant. TV stations, magazines and newspapers would be asking her about the mum-to-be and she would be at the heart of all the pregnancy coverage.Instead of being a loyal, loving and supportive source of information about Meghan, Samantha is now ­dismissed as jealous, irrelevant and malicious. No one cares about her opinion any more.Meanwhile, Meghan has won over Australia with a charm offensive that shows no sign of flagging. She and Harry are a true partnership.Unlike the tension between his parents Princess Diana and Prince Charles, Harry is genuinely delighted to see the enthusiasm and love for his we during this tour.Charles would famously get the hump because everyone wanted to meet Diana on royal walkabouts.In contrast, Harry and Meghan are relaxed, spontaneous and genuinely adore each other. It has been good to see them having fun and giving hugs and smiles to the crowds.While Meghan grows in confidence and the public’s affection, Samantha is now an irrelevance.It’s her own fault and she has to live with it. She will always have her nose pressed against the window pane of whatever palace her little sister is in at the time.Still, Sam, there’s always panto, eh ONE of the great joys of my le was watching Disney movies with my daughter when she was growing up.We watched my childhood favourites Dumbo, Bambi and Snow White, then I sat through Beauty And The Beast and The Little Mermaid about two thousand and ten times.So I was bemused to hear that Keira Knightley has banned her three-year-old daughter from ­watching some Disney movies such as Cinderella because the characters are “rescued” by men.This is rather joyless.Cinders might have been wooed by a man dumb enough not to recognise the love of his le until her foot fitted inside a glass slipper, but Belle from Beauty And The Beast is a book-loving, independent girl who tells the handsome but horrible Gaston to sling his hook and falls for the Beast because of the man he is inside. Pocahontas, Tiana, Merida, Rapunzel and especially Mulan are all kick-ass, feisty females.Disney remade Cinderella in  and she was a very dferent character.Keira doesn’t have to let her daughter watch Cinderella when there are so many alternatives available, but she also doesn’t need to be so blinking sanctimonious about it.So Joanna in The Cry is actually in court accused of murdering her sleazebag of a husband after they faked the kidnapping of their dead baby.It’s the last episode tomorrow, when we will find out what the heck has been going on.ButJoanna, played by Jenna Coleman, left, really did kill husband Alistair, I reckon it’s justiable homicide.The ghastly toad sat with his eyemask on and earplugs in, leaving her to deal with a screeching baby all through that epic flight to Australia.Surely on those grounds alone no court would convict her.I ADORED Freddie Mercury and would have gladly given a year of my le to be a fly on the wall at one of his notoriously extravagant and outrageous parties.He was a complete one-off, so I was always rather sceptical and a bit concerned about any film that would try to depict his extraordinary le and capture his sheer showmanship.Thankfully, the makers of new film Bohemian Rhapsody found the ridiculously talented American actor Rami Malek.He doesn’t so much play the part of Freddie but rather inhabits his body and brings him back to le.It’s an Oscar-worthy performance that is both funny and deeply moving and Rami is backed up by the perfectly cast three other members of Queen.Gwilym Lee as Brian May is so uncannily like the ace guitarist that his we Anita Dobson thought she had actually gone back in time, as he’s the spitting image of Brian when the two of them met.The Live Aid sequence, recreating the moment when Freddie and the band blew everyone away with their barnstorming performance, gave me goosebumps.I blubbed a lot during this movie, as well as laughing out loud.It also had me rushing to download all the original Queen albums and rediscovering tracks like Keep Yourself Alive and Doing All Right, as well as the classics such as Killer Queen and We Are The Champions.It’s a cracking film and a love letter to one of the greatest entertainers and most charismatic rock stars of all time. WELL, what a shock and surprise that Girls Aloud’s Nadine Coyle and Cheryl were never best pals. . . said no one ever.It was clear that these two, below in , never really hit it off right from the start when the girls won TV talent show Popstars: The Rivals in  against boyband One True Voice.Back then Nadine was very much the star and lead vocalist, which led to tensions in the group.The girls split into two factions – Nadine and Sarah Harding on one side and Cheryl, Nicola Roberts and ­Kimberley Walsh on the other.Tellingly, Nadine said the girls have never had a big fall-out because they were never really friends in the first place.This is what tends to happen when boy and girl bands are thrown together in a reality show and don’t have a shared history. Cracks appear and there are resentments over who is ­perceived as being ­centre stage.A notable exception are the hugely ­likeable Little Mix, who put all their energies into their music and also to ensuring they give out positive messages about self-esteem and body confidence to their legions of fans.These girls have become genuinely good friends who have each other’s backs and who know that they are stronger together than they would bethey had to stand alone.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In other words, will it give the UK a genuine opportunity to leave.Just putting the word temporary in front of the phrase ­”customs union” — a solution favoured by some at the heart of Government — won’t be enough for these Secretaries of State.One tells me that it has “got to be legally binding and enforceable. Something that is vague and not enforceable won’t get through Parliament”. All of this makes the newest face at the Cabinet table, the Attorney General Geoffrey Cox, absolutely crucial.Cox is a Brexiteer and one of the finest dozen legal brains in the country. Ministers will defer to him on whether this escape clause is worth the paper it’s written on.As one of those helping to ­coordinate the Brexiteers in government tells me, Cox values his reputation too much to try to spin ministers a line. They are confident he will give them an honest assessment of the escape clause’s worth.“Anything will have to go through the AG,” I’m told by one Government source.Cox’s influence will run throughout this process. I understand that the bulk of the Pizza Club of Cabinet ministers who met on Monday night have agreed not to back the final Brexit deal until they have seen the legal advice.I am told that Michael Gove made clear at Cabinet this week that he couldn’t back any Northern Irish backstop until he had been shown “clear, ­written legal advice” on it.This insistence on seeing the legal advice is meant to prevent a repeat of what happened last December when No gave Brexiteer Cabinet ­ministers assurances about what the backstop meant which were not borne out by events.So, the question becomes: Will the EU be prepared to engage with the UK or will Michel Barnier simply say “non, non” Well, there is a cautious ­optimism in No that the political will to do a deal is beginning to be there on the European side. There is a realisation thatthe EU rejects everything May proposes, there will be no agreement reached — and that will mean a hard border in Ireland, which is what everyone is trying to avoid.Interestingly, there is also a sense thatagreement can be reached on the backstop, then the deal has a better chance of passing through Parliament thanOne of those who has read the draft political declaration tells me that the UK EU future relationship is more to the taste of Tory Brexiteers than expected.May must find a way to get the EU to accept an escape clause, for without that she’ll lose more Cabinet Ministers and her position will be even more vulnerable.GAVIN BARWELL, the Prime Minister’s chief of staff, had the Government’s junior ministers in on Tuesday. He wanted to talk them through Theresa May’s domestic agenda as outlined in her conference speech.He wanted to emphasise that the Government would prioritise its domestic agenda as soon as the meaningful vote on Brexit was through the Commons.Barwell’s comments fit with an expectation in Cabinet that Mrs May will attempt to relaunch her premiership with a domestic focus as soon as the Commons has voted on her Brexit deal.The aim is to create a rationale for keeping May on as Prime Minister after Brexit day. Influential Cabinet ministers are also expecting Mrs May to reshuffle her Cabinet at that point.The thinking is that a freshened-up Cabinet would give the Government a new, post-Brexit feel without a need to replace the Prime Minister. But the chances of Mrs May staying on long after Brexit day in March  have lowered signicantly in the past few days.Before this week, some Tory MPs argued that Mrs May should stay until the Brexit transition was done in December . They said this would mean that a new leader would be able to come in as a fresh face after Brexit and in time for the next General Election.However, the news that the transition could be extended cuts against that argument, as the transition could take you to months away from the next election.Privately, Tories from the Cabinet down acknowledge thatthe transition can be extended, then the case for keeping Mrs May until the end of it is weaker.Rather, it would be better to get a new leader soon after March  to give them a chance to make an impact on both Brexit and domestic policy before the  General Election.THE European Union likes to say that an Irish backstop is needed to protect the Good Friday agreement.But what that ignores is that by changing the nature of Northern Ireland’s relationship with the rest of the UK without consent, the backstop risks being in breach of that agreement.THERESA MAY’S declaration in her party conference speech that austerity is over has raised expectations of big pay rises across the public sector.At Cabinet this week, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Liz Truss, was keen to hose down this idea. She emphasised that public sector pay deals should be based on retention – eg. how many staff were leaving because the pay isn’t good enough, geographic factors and helping the lowest paid most.I’m told that Mrs Truss told the Cabinet that: “Some pay review bodies have ignored affordability requirements.”I understand Mrs May agreed the Government should get away from the idea of a single figure for public sector pay. Meanwhile, preparations for the Budget continue.This is meant to be a small Budget yet one ­Government source warns it is going to be “bloody contentious”.  Why  Because it will set the baseline for departmental spending ahead of next year’s spending review.THE biggest risk of a leadership challenge to Theresa May comes from cock-up, not conspiracy.The danger for her is not that Brexit ultras organise  letters and send them in simultaneously, forcing a confidence vote in her, but that enough despairing ToryMPs send in their letters and the party stumbles into a vote on Mrs May’s future. One of those involved in discussions about whether to try to remove Mrs May tells me the Brexit ultras “are not as organised as you might think”.If there was a confidence vote, Mrs May would probably survive it. But after this week, it would be closer than it would have been before.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She had a very late night last night.A Kensington Palace spokesman added: After a busy programme, The Duke and Duchess have decided to cut back The Duchesss schedule slightly for the next couple of days, ahead of the final week and a half of the tour.But after a restful morning, Meghan reappeared at lunch, appearing well-rested and glowing as she took to the waves with Prince Harry to watch a sailing race.The couple were affectionate as ever during the day of engagements - just one of  over  days, with the future dad keeping a close eye on Meghan.The pair are on day six of the tour of Australia, New Zealand and Fiji - and last nights Invictus Games ceremony ran over its scheduled time due to thunder storms.It was another packed day as the pair met athletes and children, went sailing, lunched with the PM and Harry even found time to squeeze into some budgie smuggler trunks.They later took to the waves on boat, sharing loving glances as they got a better vantage point for the sailing races.And Harry was even asked to sign a pair of budgie smuggler Speedos by the cheekie chappies on the Australian team.They will later visit Fraser Island - a heritage site and the largest sand island in the world.But Meghan will wait and see how she feels before deciding whether to join the planned trek - with the islands terrain notoriously hard to navigate.Meghan is still due to fly to Fiji and Tonga but it is expected to readjust her schedule.The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have been inundated with well-wishes during their trip so far, which has seen them visit Bondi Beach in Sydney, visit school children in Dubbo and meet koalas at Taronga zoo.One of the first gts the couple received for their baby was a toy kangaroo and its joy.But the couple seem to be trying to keep grounded when it comes to their babys future.The royal pair want their first child to have what Harry has described as “a relatively normal le”, according to a source close to the couple.The unnamed source, who spoke to The Times, added: “That word ‘normal’ looms very large for Harry and Meghan when it comes to their child’s future.”The baby will be seventh in line to the throne but will not have a royal title, unless the Queen intervenes.The couple first started to tell family members they were expecting at Princess Eugenies wedding at St Georges Chapel in Windsor on Friday.It is understood Meghan has already undergone her -week scan."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NINTCHDBPICT000443407259-e1540154610211.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"make this budget philips last","story":"Next Monday, on the eve of Halloween, Phil Hammond will raise the curtain on his latest tax-hiking non-Tory Budget.If there’s any justice, it will be his last.If Theresa May’s Downing Street days are numbered, so should those be of her Death Watch Chancellor.Together, they are the unrivalled stars of Tory MP Johnny Mercer’s glorious Whitehall farce, “The Sh*t Show”.Excitable critics say Mrs May is entering a “killing zone”.Rivals jockey for position while party chiefs try to streamline the timetable for picking her successor.This Prime Minister’s Number Ten tenancy is almost up. So is Hammond’s next door.Whoever takes over — Boris, David Davis or Jeremy Hunt — needs an emergency clear-out.The big guns of the Treasury need to be pointed at the “enemy” not its own side.After two long, wasted years, Britain is engaged in an unexpectedly desperate fight, not just to salvage Brexit but to save British democracy.Weekend crowds demanding a second referendum seem oblivious to the threat such a crazy re-run would pose to this nation’s centuries-old stability, ironically the envy of Europe.We cannot reverse the  referendum without turning Brexit into a perpetual running sore. And Britain can never rejoin the EU except on its knees.The only way to put this corrosive issue to bed is for Brexit to succeed — as it will, despite treacherous Tony Blair and Facebook hypocrite Nick Clegg.To succeed as we must we need a new chancellor as well as a new prime minister.Diehard Remainer Phil Hammond should be first out the door.It was Spreadsheet Phil who vetoed vital preparations for No Deal — now a better-than - prospect with time rapidly running out.And it was Hammond who surrendered the one negotiating weapon Brussels fears most — a thriving, low-tax Britain competing with the EU on its doorstep.Our economic fate is entirely in our hands. We can make taxes and tarfs as competitive as we like.Better investment incentives and lower corporation tax rates would trigger a flood of foreign investment in UK plc — and ensure car makers like Nissan and Toyota never leave our shores.Yet the British Chancellor of the Exchequer has ruled them out.“Phil is like those Harry Potter Dementor creatures,” says a top Tory. “He sucks the le out of any room he happens to be in.”Hammond is easily replaced. Michael Gove, an ex-future PM but a formidable Cabinet minister, has the drive and imagination to take on the Treasury “Blob”.There is no shortage of Brexit talent on the Tory benches.Just compare thundering Attorney General Geoffrey Cox QC with prissy dried-stick predecessor Dominic Grieve.Grieve is busy sabotaging Brexit. Cox finds ways to make it work.He is now “marking Number Ten’s homework” on Mrs May’s wretched Northern Ireland “backstop”.Some even tip him as a dark horse in the leadership stakes.There is one other big change needed at the heart of Britain’s Brexit team.Our next PM must have a new EU negotiator.Nobody could be worse than Olly Robbins, already reportedly eyeing up a £m-a-year golden parachute into a top City job.Lelong Europhile Robbins has led Mrs May into so many disastrous EU traps — especially her humiliation in Salzburg — he is often cast as an EU “double agent”.It was Robbins who told EU negotiator Michel Barnier that Britain might stay indefinitely in “transition” while the fantasy Northern Ireland backstop was sorted out.And pay £bn more on top of the £bn ransom for the privilege.The idea that Robbins is the “EU’s man in Whitehall” is not such a stretch when you consider his Jeremy Corbyn-style applause for Communist Russia.Kremlin leaders, he told fellow Oxford students in , “changed Russia from a backward peasant autocracy, despised by the West, into a technological giant at whom the world cowered in fear for half a century.”Everyone is entitled to youthful naivety.But can anyone imagine Olly Robbins fighting our corner for EU democracy and accountability, let alone the referendum verdict of .m Brexit-voting Brits SAUDI Arabia’s rulers must be really annoyed with dissident Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.This elderly trouble maker walked alone into his country’s Turkish consulate knowing he might never emerge alive.He was clearly looking for trouble.Once inside, using his bare hands, he attacked a gang of  innocent Saudi torturers who had just flown in for a couple of hours’ holiday armed only with a bone saw and a hypodermic syringe.Then, to the embarrassment of kindly Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, he went and hid his own body.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We should be breaking down mental health stigmas, not mocking sufferers.Imagine the outcryVote Leave had been so wickedly vulgar.Alastair Campbell, who has bravely spoken before about his mental health battles, changed his tune about protests this weekend.The former Labour spin doctor dismissed the Iraq War demonstrators in  as “full of self-righteousness”.How strange, then, that he now believes Saturday’s protest should influence government policy.What Campbell and the anti-Brexit brigade conveniently ignore is that there was a people’s vote in which .million people voted Leave in .Meanwhile, Theresa May faces a potentially bruising week as speculation mounts over a leadership challenge.In today’s Sun, however, she defiantly calls on her party to back her, saying “the finish line is in sight”.Good to hear you say it, PM. It is vital that the Tories support her. There is no coronation candidate to replace her.She adds she will get a Brexit deal that works for our country.Britain will not be fooled, PM. We WILL hold you to it.Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey was last night reported to have told her in a conference call she was “devastated” at the transition period extension offer.Home Secretary Sajid Javid is believed to have askedshe had “explicitly threatened the EU with No Deal”.It also emerged last night that as many as  Tory MPs may back a bid by ex-Brexit Minister Steve Baker to make it illegal for Northern Ireland to have dferent regulations after Brexit.Mrs May also faces one of her toughest weeks yet, with a grilling in the Commons today, over her chaotic EU summit performance, a rocky Cabinet meeting tomorrow, and a demand to appear in front of the Tories  Committee of all MPs on Wednesday.One MP also last night told The Sun that he and two more others would be submitting letters calling for a no confidence vote in the Tory leader when theyto Westminster today.A total of  needed to trigger one.The MP said: “Things cannot continue as they are. This is about the future of the nation, and May cannot go on”.But other MPs last night claimed Mrs May’s moment of maximum danger is the moment any Brexit deal with the EU is struck – with the most likely moment for that being mid-November.A senior Brexiteer MP last night told The Sun that acting to oust Mrs May is “really stupid until the deal, whatever it is, is visible.The MP added: “Them we decide. Not before”.Brexit Minister Suella Braverman, a prominent Eurosceptic campaigner, also alarmed No yesterday by refusing three times to say she would support Mrs May in a no confidence vote when grilled on Radio  Live’s Pienaar’s Politics.But her boss, Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, insisted on the opposite, telling BBC’s Andrew Marr Show: “‘Now is the time to play for the team.“I think that’s the way we get the best deal from the EU and I also think that’s what the country expects from us.”In a development that may end up boosting the PM, there was an angry backlash last night against a series of vicious attacks on her with violent language.A renegade Brexiteer Tory MP was blamed for saying Mrs May is entering “the killing zone” this week, and should “bring her own noose” to the  Committee showdown.A furious former Tory minister lashed out at the MP to call him “a very small man, in every respect”.Even Mrs May’s opponents defended her against against the hate language. Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: “Few disagree with her more than I do, but language like this debases politics. Get a grip, Tories”.Brexit campaigner and former Cabinet minister Theresa Villiers also gave the PM her backing, saying: “I don’t think a leadership election at this stage would really be helpful. This speculation has to stop”.Another senior Tory also predicted a huge amount of Tory MPs would stand in the party’s next leadership contest, whenever it comes.Ex-education minister Rob Halfon said the contest would be akin to the legendary Hollwyood movie Ben Hur, “with a cast of thousands”.Has it been a good day or a bad day for me  Am I up or down “How are YOU doing Prime Minister ” one journalist asked me recently. I didn’t reply at the time but I’m going to give Sun readers the answer now – and it’s very simple.None of this is about me. It’s all about you.That’s why, when I’m confronted with tough choices during the Brexit negotiations, I don’t think about what the implications are for me. Instead, I ask myself what it means for you, for your family and for the whole of the United Kingdom.Am I bringing back control of your money, your borders and your laws Am I protecting your jobs and making sure nothing gets in the way of our brilliant entrepreneurs and small businesses Am I protecting the integrity of the United Kingdom And, above all, am I delivering the Brexit that the people of this country so clearly voted for I need to be able to answer “Yes” to every one of these questions.Andthat means there are some dficult days in Brussels, well that’s just something I have to deal with.Because the Brexit talks are not about me or my personal fortunes. They’re about the national interest – and that means making the right choices, not the easy ones.Inevitably, that will take time. Brexit is the UK’s biggest constitutional change for generations. Unpicking more than  years of treaties, agreements and laws would be a challenge under any circumstances and, as no country has ever left the EU before, it’s not asthere’s an instruction manual for those either side of the negotiating table to follow.I know it can seem like the talks are never-ending, and that many of you have been frustrated by the endless back and forth on technical points – I certainly feel that way sometimes too.But with five months to go until we leave the EU, we have already reached agreement on the vast majority of our exit deal.What became clear at last week’s meeting in Brussels is that the very last stages of the talks are going to be the hardest of all. This includes dealing with the so-called “backstop”: making sure that, no matter what our new relationship with Europe looks like, there will be no hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland.I’ve been very clear that this must be achieved without creating any kind of border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK – doing so would undermine our precious Union and put at risk the hard-won peace. So I am working closely with my counterparts in Europe to explore every possible solution to the border issue.Does that mean I think this negotiation will get tougher before we reach our goal  Yes.Do I have some long and dficult days ahead  I’m sure I do.But what I’m thinking about is not how hard it all is today. I’m thinking about the prize that lies before us tomorrow about the great opportunities the Government will help open up for you once we clear the last few hurdles.As we enter the final, crucial phase of the talks there will undoubtedly be some unexpected challenges to which we must rise.But the finish line is in sight. And I am more determined than ever that we will get there together, with a Brexit deal that’s right for you, right for your family and right for our country.Theresa May, Prime MinisterOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They’re about the national interest – and that means making the right choices, not the easy ones.Inevitably, that will take time. Brexit is the UK’s biggest constitutional change for generations. Unpicking more than  years of treaties, agreements and laws would be a challenge under any circumstances and, as no country has ever left the EU before, it’s not asthere’s an instruction manual for those either side of the negotiating table to follow.I know it can seem like the talks are never-ending, and that many of you have been frustrated by the endless back and forth on technical points – I certainly feel that way sometimes too.But with five months to go until we leave the EU, we have already reached agreement on the vast majority of our exit deal.What became clear at last week’s meeting in Brussels is that the very last stages of the talks are going to be the hardest of all.This includes dealing with the so-called “backstop”: making sure that, no matter what our new relationship with Europe looks like, there will be no hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland.I’ve been very clear that this must be achieved without creating any kind of border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK – doing so would undermine our precious Union and put at risk the hard-won peace.So I am working closely with my counterparts in Europe to explore every possible solution to the border issue.Does that mean I think this negotiation will get tougher before we reach our goal  YesDo I have some long and dficult days ahead  I’m sure I do.But what I’m thinking about is not how hard it all is today.I’m thinking about the prize that lies before us tomorrow about the great opportunities the Government will help open up for you once we clear the last few hurdles.As we enter the final, crucial phase of the talks there will undoubtedly be some unexpected challenges to which we must rise.But the finish line is in sight. And I am more determined than ever that we will get there together, with a Brexit deal that’s right for you, right for your family and right for our country.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Smoking tobacco is bad news.But vaping is dferent.You heat up a solution called an e-liquid, which typically contains nicotine, a propellant called propylene glycol and or vegetable glycerin and flavourings.What you don’t do is burn tobacco or produce tar or carbon monoxide — two of the most harmful elements of all in tobacco smoke.Sure, some vapes may contain a fraction of some of the harmful chemicals found in cigarette smoke, but they are present at much lower levels,detectable at all.So are they safe  According to all the international medically-reviewed evidence from such expert organisations as Public Health England, the Royal Colleges of Physicians and General Practitioners, the British Medical Association and Cancer Research UK, e-cigarettes are at least  per cent safer than traditional cigarettes.The American Cancer Society and the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine both agree with them.Yes, the nicotine, of course, is addictive. But so what  So is caffeine, even eating.Contrary to popular belief, nicotine does not give you cancer and it is relatively harmless generally.Apparently only  per cent of the population know this.Happily, there is no evidence of harm to other people from vaping and,used instead of nicotine replacement gum or patches, may even help expectant mums remain smoke-free in the long term.As a doctor I don’t want any young person or non-nicotine user to try vaping. Ever. Period.As it happens, regular use of e-cigs among “never” smokers is still very rare at just . per cent.But look at what they’ve done to help tobacco smokers quit.In the UK, .million vapers have quit smoking completely and more than , have given up both smoking and vaping.In fact, this is Britain’s most popular method of quitting with two-thirds stopping successfully when used alongside professional stop-smoking NHS support.In this country we have some of the strictest regulations in the world.E-cigs are subject to minimum standards of quality and safety as well as clear packaging and labelling requirements.All ingredients have to be notied, advertising is prohibited in media such as television, newspapers and magazines, it is illegal to sell them to under s and to adults intending to pass them on to under s.That is responsible regulation whichever way you look at it.This month’s national Stoptober campaign recommends using e- cigarettes as a stop-smoking aid andit helps some of the million smokers in the UK kick the habit for good then perhaps doctors like me will see fewer people in our surgeries struggling to breath or devastated by a cancer diagnosis.AndI see any ex-smoking patients of mine having a quiet vape outside my surgery door, I shall give them a heartfelt pat on the back and cherish the fact that there will be one less nasty fag end polluting the street.NICOTINE contained in e-liquids is a highly addictive substance that raises blood pressure and spikes your adrenalin, increasing the chances of having a heart attack.This is particularly worrying as we see a number of iniduals who are constantly vaping, especially as it is seen as more convenient and cost-effective than lighting up a cigarette, as well as being considered more socially acceptable to vape indoors.While vaping appears to be safer than cigarettes, the truth is that it hasn’t been around long enough for us to know the potential damage it can cause to our health.The long-term effects of the chemicals contained in e-liquids haven’t been examined.However, I have looked into ious research that has been carried out on certain e-liquids that were found to contain substances that can cause damage to the immune system and are linked to other health conditions such as cancer.Vaping isn’t great for your oral health either.It’s common for vaping to cause a dry mouth, and I’ve met a number of iniduals who have developed oral thrush, most likely caused by vaping.Although nicotine does not have a colour, it becomes yellow when combined with oxygen which could lead to tooth discolouration.As nicotine is a vasocon-strictor, it limits blood flow in oral tissue, which can cause gum disease and bad breath.As time goes on, I am reading new research which proves vaping has a negative effect on health.To what extent, only time will tell.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So the porkies and the sick poundmillion NHS fib gave a narrow referendum win two years ago for the plastic patriots and Right-wing nationalists orchestrating a dishonest campaign. “There’s a lot of pain for zero gain since we were lured into the fantasy option that is Brexit,” a prominent Minister in Theresa May’s crumbling Government grumbled to me.

The Prime Minister will claim her deal is % settled in a Commons address to MPs after weekend-long talk of toppling her.Vicious briefings including violent language emerged over the weekend after the PM said she was poised to extend the Brexit transition period and put no end date on her Northern Ireland backstop.The PM led two terse Cabinet conference calls over the weekend.She was reportedly confronted by ministers in one -minute chat, where Sajid Javid said there must be a time limit on the backstop and Esther McVey said she was devastated. Theresa May is battling to save her premiership following last week’s EU summit, at which she agreed to consider delaying Brexit in a bid to unlock stalled talks. The Prime Minister is considering extending the transition period for Brexit beyond December . She is also refusing to set an end date for her backstop plan that would temporarily keep EU customs rules across the whole of the UK, avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland. Both plans have enraged Brexiteers.  Cabinet minister Chris Grayling admitted: “We’re not a set of clones, we don’t always agree on absolutely everything.” Around  Tory MPs are threatening to pass amendments to the Northern Ireland Bill on Wednesday that would throw a spanner in the works. A source suggester the amendments would force any plans for a backstop to have the approval of the Northern Ireland Assembly. Downing Street has commissioned urgent legal advice to calculate whether the PM can afford to bow to the threat, the Times reports. But Mrs May puts on a brave face today as she launches a fightback - saying Brexit talks are “not about me or my personal fortunes - they’re about the national interest. In a newspaper article she says: Turn on the TV most days and you’ll find someone speculating about what the Brexit talks mean for Theresa May .Has it been a good day or a bad day for me  Am I up or down  ‘How are YOU doing Prime Minister ’ one journalist asked me recently.... None of this is about me. It’s all about you.” And in an address to Parliament she will say: % of the Withdrawal Agreement and its protocols are now settled.” Cabinet minister Mr Grayling - a staunch Brexiteer - re-stated he was only willing to accept a short bridge backstopBrexit talks fail. Im perfectly happy to contemplate a short bridge between the end of the implementation period and the start of the future economic partnershipit is necessary, he told the BBC.  I dont think it needs to be necessary, I dont want it to be necessary, because what it cant do, it absolutely cant do, is trap us in limbo indefinitely, and Cabinet is completely united about that. Today Mrs May will tell MPs: The original backstop proposal from the EU was one we could not accept, as it would mean creating a customs border down the Irish Sea and breaking up the integrity of the UK.I do not believe that any UK Prime Minister could ever accept this.And I certainly will not. Anonymous MPs claimed over the weekend that their leader was in the killing zone and should bring her own noose to a meeting with angry Brexiteers this Wednesday. But the briefings backfired as supportive Tories demanded police investigate the threats. Tory MP Paul Masterson fumed: If I was told to bring my own noose to my next surgery, that Id be knived, or assassinated, my staff would report it to the police. I dont really see why comments made by snivelling cowards on the back benches towards the Prime Minister should be treated dferently. Yvette Cooper, chair of the Commons Home Affairs Committee, urged Tory whips to unmask MPs behind the vile and dehumanising language.The former minister warned the words were normalising violence in public debate barely a year after Labour MP Jo Cox was murdered. It comes after London played host to a vast march against Brexit calling for a second referendum - a Peoples Vote. Organisers claim , people attended, making Saturdays march the biggest in the UK since protests against the Iraq War.  Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry defended her decision, along with the rest of Labours front bench, not to attend the march. She told the BBC she had instead been in Crawley in West Sussex, where % of the population voted to leave, talking to activists and businesses. She said this morning: I want to have a peoples vote, but I want to have a big and proper peoples vote, which is a general election. If a government cant govern, there should be another government. Although Theresa May says today she has got % of the agreement done with the European Union, I dont knowthats really the right number. But I can tell you what - the bit she has got to agree yet is extremely dficult. Labour MP Owen Smith of the anti-Brexit Best For Britain group said: This claim that Brexit is % done is clearly utter nonsense.

What made these latest outbursts dferent was the brutality of the language and the growing sense that this time they may actually deliver on their threats. Some of the vocabulary from the anonymous briefers - “bring your own noose”, “killing zone,” “she’ll be dead” - was especially unpleasant and showed not only the extent of their cowardice and misogyny but that their hatred has become so deep they do not even have the decency to remember the memory of Jo Cox. Even when the stakes are so high there is no excuse for politicians to stoop so low.The Prime Minister’s primary task when she makes her statement this afternoon on last week’s EU summit is survival. At her press conference in Brussels on Thursday she came across as someone drained of confidence and short of fresh ideas on how to break the deadlock. If that uncertainty is on display again today then it could hasten her departure. Though we should remember her obituary has been written so often in the last  months that she surpasses Mark Twain in her ability to outlive her own death notices. And the sheer nastiness of the language used over the weekend may have played to her favour. Her second task is to try to offer some clarity on exactly what the UK is proposing to secure a withdrawal agreement . Thereports the PM yesterday held an hour-and-a-half conference call with Cabinet ministers last night to try to shore up support for her Brexit plan. Mrs May will tell MPs that at a deal is % done .

She had to be escorted out of the hospital by security officers, it is claimed, after doctors said she had no serious issues.

Amy Roberts, , has been living in a city in the Nevada desert with her American husband and two-year-old daughter Audrey for the past couple of years. Amy, from Nottingham, says they are marooned in the US because they do not earn enough money tohome. UK immigration rules state that Amy must find a job in the UK that pays pound, so that her husband, Andrus Hernandez, can be granted a visa. Alternatively, they need pound, in their bank account - a sum of money that is currently beyond their means, reports Nottinghamshire Live  Amy said: Ive got a young family and I just want to come home. I cant tell you how much I miss my family. I also miss the pubs, the high street, the NHS, even the rain. Its beautul here but its not home. I want my daughter to know her cousins not just as someone at the end of a video screen. My husband is at his wits end because I have been so homesick for so long. I understand the UK cant take everyone in but I want people to see the human costs behind these rules - it has torn my family apart. More than half the UK population do not earn pound,, its unfair. Im not asking for much, I just want to raise my family in the same place I grew up. Born in the QMC and raised in Beeston, Amy went to Bramcote Hills and Bilborough College and after graduating from the University of Manchester worked for  years in the UK. In  she met Andrus, , a tour guide, while on an adventure holiday in the US and they fell in love, marrying in . They have spent years apart since but finally managed to get her a green card two and a half years ago and move to Reno together, although she said it was a very hard decision. Shortly afterwards she gave birth to Audrey, who is a joint citizen. She has only been able to afford the flight home three times since. In  then Home Secretary Theresa May introduced new tougher immigration rules. Before this, you only needed to earn pound, a year to bring your partner to the country. But now to bring Andrus over Amy must either have a ridiculous pound, of savings in her account for six months or have a job lined up which pays at least pound, a year. She could move back on her own or with just her daughter but after so much dficulty she is determined to make a home with her husband.  Mary Atkinson, campaigns officer for The Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, said theirs is not a unique case and thousands of families are being wrenched apart, simply because they do not meet an arbitrary income requirement What Amy and her family are going through is absolutely absurd, she added. The fact that the government is seemingly happy to exile its own citizens and deny grandparents the joy of seeing their grandchildren grow up is surely a sign of how wrong our immigration policy has gone. The Home Secretary can and must act immediately to end this policy, and bring Amy and her family back home to Nottingham where they belong.  A Home Office spokeswoman defended the rules, saying they make sure families coming here can support themselves. She argued the pound, was the point where you stop getting income-related benefits meaning you are not a burden on the taxpayer.

The threshold has been challenged in the Supreme Court. The countrys most senior judges upheld it in principle but acknowledged it caused hardship for thousands of families. The spokeswoman said: The Supreme Court has endorsed our approach in setting an income requirement for family migration that prevents burdens on the taxpayer and ensures migrant families can integrate into our communities.

Katie Allan, , was serving time behind bars for leaving Michael Keenan, , bleeding and unconscious in the middle of the road after hitting him with her car while over the legal drink drive limit. But although the teenager, who made a full recovery, and his family pleaded with a judge not to jail her, she was sentenced to two years behind bars.A social enquiry report had also recommended Katie, who was studying geography at Glasgow University and wanted to be a chef, should not be jailed.  In Polmont Prison in Falkirk, Katie was met with a barrage of torment from her inmates - and the stress led to her losing her hair.She was also forced to parade naked in front of prison staff as as part of a jail training exercise, according to the Daily Record.After her death in June, five months after her sentence  month sentence began, a pal described her as being a sheep in a wolfs den. She was scared of one particular bully who would force her to hand over her tobacco, according to The Sun.  A friend said: She was definitely getting bullied. That and the prison environment directly contributed to her ending her le. She should never have been in there. “One woman was making her give her tobacco, handing over her stamps, posting her letters for her. She had her scared s**tless.

He had to take two weeks off school and had to get around on crutches.  Katies parents, Linda and Stuart, are now campaigning for justice for their daughter. While they fully accept she committed a serious offence and deserved to be punished, they have raised serious questions over her legal representation and the court case which convicted her. They are furious that Sherf David Pender told the court it was “impossible” to give her a non-custodial sentence. They have cited similar cases in which offenders were spared prison. Linda said: “Katie had been bullied and berated and was in clear distress. She had lost her hair.  “On my last visit to see her with her brother, we knew something was wrong. She looked exhausted and hadn’t slept because she was being terrorised and bullied. “We flagged this up with two of the prison officers and we now know that, just before she died, they had told her she might be moved to the adult prison. Katie would have been terried.” Linda and Stuart will now begin a campaign calling for serious reform of the criminal justice system They have been backed by the family of the boy injured in the incident, Rev Stuart McQuarrie, the chaplain of Glasgow University, and the university’s rector, human rights lawyer Aamer Anwar.  Margaret Keenan, the mother of road accident victim Michael, said: “Katie was given a sentence we didn’t want and we were all devastated when we read that she had died. “Katie had written to us again from prison to apologise for a second time and reiterated that she didn’t know she had hit Michael. “The whole thing has been a tragedy for her family.”If you are affected by any issues raised in this story, contact The Samaritans for confidential support on  ."},{"url":null,"title":"embarrassed prince harry blushes after","story":"NewsEmbarrassed Prince Harry blushes after -year-old shouts cheeky comment in silent crowdEveryone heard the comment in the quiet clearing - and Harry was reportedly lost for wordsShareCommentsByNicola OakleyHead of Audience:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT NewsPrince Harry, Duke of Sussex, smiles during a presentation \"Get Royal Family updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Prince Harry visited picturesque Fraser Island on Monday, the seventh day of his first overseas royal tour with we Meghan Markle .The -year-old Duke was there to unveil a plaque dedicating forest to the Queens Commonwealth Canopy conservation project.

As the Duke was on a walkabout shaking hands with the public, Intern Pete - real name Peter Deppeler - shouted out: Hey Harry, Harry, the floor is lava!! ............ Not quite knowing what was going on at first, Harry eventually laughed, looked at the woman to his right and gestured towards Intern Pete in a way that suggested he found the whole thing ridiculous. He doesnt get the joke! Pete can be heard shouting in a video of the exchange. Pete was reunited with Harry on the first day of the royal tour , where he also met Meghan, but the prankster might have pushed it too far when he followed the couple to Bondi Beach on Friday, where they took part in a good vibes circle.He had stood with members of the public to try to speak to the Duke and Duchess. When Prince Harry walked past, shaking hands with fans who had waited to catch a glimpse of him, Pete shouted: “Harry! Harry! It’s Intern Pete again! Its Intern Pete again! The Duke looked as though he was trying his best to ignore the irritating radio personality, but eventually shook his head disappointedly and said You shouldnt be here! with a smile.  Radio hosts Kyle and Jackie O released a video of themselves watching the footage - and looking suitably mortied - along with a phonecall they had with Pete after the exchange. He told them: After Harry told me off and then after Meghan, some other security guards came over and said why are you here again  This is for the public, not the media. Theyve clocked me now, Ive got to hide around the corner.

Robert Sharkey, , appeared at Belfast Crown Court for  offences, including preventing the lawful burial of a corpse, theft and fraud by  representation. He has been sentenced to a year behind bars for stealing cash and credit cards belonging to his neighbour, -year-old Marie Conlon.The remains of Ms Conlon were in extreme state of decomposition when they were discovered in West Belfast in October . Sharkey - who had lived in the flat above Ms Conlon for around five years - used the stolen cards fraudulently online for a period of two years, Belfast Live reported . Sharkey ordered the same nine-inch pepperoni and anchovy pizza and two tins of juice for delivery from Dominos Pizza every day between pm and pm for two years - earning him the nickname ‘the fish guy’ from staff at the eatery. Handing Sharkey a two-year sentence, which will be ided into  months in custody following by  months on licence upon his release, Judge Piers Grant told Sharkey: “You denied the deceased and her family the opportunity to have a decent burial and I have no doubt that all right-thinking people will be outraged by what you did. “You were aware that this decent lady had died, and all would expect that the first reaction would be to contact her family or report her death to those in a position to contact her family. “You did not do that but saw it as an opportunity for you to benefit by stealing a signicant amount of money from the deceased.” Branding Sharkey’s offending as “premeditated to a signicant degree and planned”, Judge Grant told him: “You had many opportunities to stop what you were doing and disclose her death to the authorities. “Every time, on a daily basis, that you ordered pizzas or other items using her credit card, you must have been aware of and considered her circumstances, and the fact that she was lying in an ever-worsening state of decomposition in the flat next door to where you lived.” Sharkey - who now has an address in Gray’s Hill in Bangor - spoke to confirm his name, date of birth and address. Throughout the rest of the hearing, he largely kept his head bowed.  It emerged in today’s hearing that a cheque for pound, from Sharkey was handed to the court and will be paid to Ms Conlon’s estate. In total, Sharkey defrauded in excess of pound, from her estate over a period from October  until October . Due to the sell-by date on food found in Ms Conlon’s home, and the last time her bank card was used legally, police believe the pensioner passed away in January . The court heard first Sharkey kicked Ms Conlon’s door in around October  after noticing her post was piling up, and found her dead in bed. At this point, Sharkey stole pound from her handbag. The authorities were not alerted about her death, and he ed to her flat when he needed lightbulbs, which he stole along with batteries, a cup and a screwdriver. Sharkey also went through her post, found her new bank card, and began to use it fraudulently. His offending began to emerge on Friday October  last year, when Ms Conlon’s remains were discovered by police following concerns for her safety raised by her family. Her relatives told police she was an extremely private person who kept to herself and made little attempt to maintain contact with them. Police were admitted to the apartment complex by Sharkey, who told them Marie was out and wouldn’t be back until that evening When asked by officers when he had last seen his neighbour, Sharkey said not for a few weeks, but he had heard someone coming and going below him. This, Judge Grant told Sharkey, was a “clear and deliberate strategy ... to mislead the police and ert their attention from your unlawful activities”. Checks were then made into Ms Conlon’s bank account, which showed a lawful withdrawal had been made on her bank card on January , . Her weekly pension was still being paid into her account, which was otherwise dormant until October  when purchases were made on her card to Domino’s Pizza. The total amount of the daily deliveries from Domino’s came to pound,. over a two-year period. Other payments made from her account over the same period included purchases totalling pound,. to Sainsbury’s, as well payments of pound, to O and pound to Power NI.  When he was arrested on October , , Sharkey’s apartment was filled with empty Domino’s pizza boxes. During police interview, he admitted using Ms Conlon’s bank details, and also confessed he was careful to pay her rates bill in a bid to evade detection. When asked about finding Ms Conlon’s body, he said: “I was worried about ringing the police, but it was also a time when I was struggling with money. I had no money at all and she had her handbag in her bed beside her, and her purse was open and there was money in it and I took it. I left the apartment and closed the door and pretended that nothing had happened.” During today’s sentencing, Judge Grant said he had read a report from Sharkey’s employer in his capacity as a personal assistant, and had also considered a psychiatric report which cited “long-standing” alcohol abuse, a poor family history and behavioural dficulties. Judge Grant told Sharkey: “You express remorse and it is clear that you fully understand the wickedness of the offences that you have committed.” Handing Sharkey a two-year sentence, Judge Grant said: “You displayed a callous disregard and lack of respect for a vulnerable, decent woman. What you did affronts the sensibilities of all right-thinking people. “Whether people be religious or not, everyone has immense sympathy for the death of any inidual and their families, and everyone recognises the importance, in terms of assuaging the grief of such families in the deceased person being treated with respect and afforded a decent burial.” Judge Grant also noted the “considerable hurt and upset” caused to Ms Conlon’s family by her neighbour’s actions. Sharkey was jailed for  offences, including preventing the lawful burial of a corpse, theft and fraud by  representation.

The Duchess of Sussex delighted fans as she joined her husband for a walkabout on Fraser Island after skipping the mornings engagements to rest. Meghan, who is expecting her first child in spring, was encouraged by Harry to take it easy after an exhausting start to the visit Down Under. But the royals have confirmed the -year-old willto a full programme of events tomorrow after a brief break.  Meghan was seen arriving at Kingfisher Bay by boat earlier on Monday while Harry conducted engagements solo. But after a rest and an outfit change, the duchess made a welcome appearance later in the afternoon.  Earlier on Monday, Harry found himself attracting compliments from ladies as he attended his first royal tour engagement on Fraser Island without his we. The Duke of Sussex laughed as a well-wisher told him he was better looking in person after arriving for a whistlestop visit to the pristine paradise island of Fraser Island.  Harry joked that being skilled at unveiling plaques runs in the family as he dedicated the Forests of KGari to the Queens Commonwealth Canopy. Before Harry began speaking, local Marilyn Clarke called out: You are better looking in person! - to which he replied: I will take that as a compliment. Harry said it is our duty to protect rainforests as they “essential part of our existence, and will continue to be for our children and their children’s children”.  He was welcomed to Pile Valley with a traditional smoking ceremony to ward off evil spirits by members of the Butchulla People, the traditional owners of the land, which they call K’gari - meaning paradise. Aaron Henderson and Darren Blake wafted smoke from a bucket of burning Paper Bark and Blue Gum leaves towards him, while songman Fred Bulanyu Leone called out to their ancestors and tapped out a rhythm with a pair of bar gan - “killer boomerangs” - traditionally used for hunting.  The Duke was there to mark the forest’s dedication to the Queen’s Commonwealth Canopy initiative, a growing area of protected forests across the organisation’s  member states. He gazed up in awe at the , year old Satinay trees as they led him into the forest to a clearing around a sacred Spirit Tree. Butchulla Land and Sea Ranger Conway Burns explained: “When we die, we go through an initiation.  “Our spirit goes through our body and through our sacred lakes and up to the sky. It s to our people in these trees. “It’s great to be standing here, where our people stood hundreds of years ago.” “This is the best way to see these trees,” said the Duke, “standing tall and not logged and chopped.”  The Duke then unveiled a plaque for the dedication of the Forests of K’Gari to the Queen’s Commonwealth Canopy before travelling to meet local elders and national park rangers. The father-to-be, said: “K’gari means ‘paradise’, and that is certainly what we’ve experienced today surrounded by the towering Kauri pines,  year-old satinay trees and ancient giant ferns. “It is up to us now to protect this paradise together – not just because it looks beautul - but because it is an essential part of our existence, and will continue to be for our children and their children’s children.”  Harry also joked that the plaque he was to unveil, marking the dedication, had already been unveiled by his father in Bundaberg during his tour of Australia in April. He said: “Luckily we are both skilled at unveiling plaques - it runs in the family.” Fraser is the world’s largest sand island, boasting , acres of protected forest. It became a UNESCO World Heritage site in  and earlier this year, the Prince of Wales announced its dedication to the Queen’s Commonwealth Canopy. Some  million trees are now being planted across Australia as part of the programme. Satinay trees are known for their hardiness in water and were used to build the London docks in the s.

That was the first time time I became interested in the idea of men dressed up as women for entertainment. Everything grew out of that, he said.  When I started cross-dressing two years ago, I started experimenting with that sort of dame makeup style, and then became more natural looking. Lots of drag queens have drag mothers when they start out who teach them about makeup, but I didnt have that. I had to learn from tutorials on YouTube. I am helping other people who are starting to experiment now though. Putting on Dixies hair, makeup and outfit typically takes Kieran, from Cleethorpes , between two and a half and three hours. He began performing in July and was soon crowned Miss Black Country Pride  - however walking down the street in drag can still be a challenge. The odd people always make comments. Some people have blamed my parents for me doing this so young, which is hurtful. Ive also been spat on at pm on the tube in London, which shows that even more accepting places have intolerant people, he said. I have had amazing responses - people have told me Im an inspiration and they look up to me - but you get the people who dont agree with it and have no shame in showing you that. When I came out as gay, I was called every name under the sun and got a lot of hurtful messages. Theyre easy to dismiss on social media, but less so in person.  Kieran says that Grimsby has next to no drag scene and the attitudes of local residents can be dficult. Its a shame there isnt a Pride event in Grimsby , as quite a few people here do identy as LGBT. Were looking at starting a Rainbow Night at the Moon on the Water soon to be a safe space for people like us, he said. Ill be performing at the opening night but Im always a little bit on edge putting on a show Grimsby because of the comments you can get. Kieran has been booked at both straight and gay venues around the country. Besides lip syncing to the likes of Cher and Abba, he has a twist to his act which gives him an edge. The drag scene in places like London and Manchester can be very competitive, so I decided I needed something to stand out. I was interested in magic when I was younger, and my grandma encouraged me to make it part of my act, he said.  In my next show, I will be sawing one of my friends in half - I have a big persona, so I need big stage illusions to go with it! I would never have done this before I became a drag queen - I wouldnt have been brave enough, but I use the costume as a mask to give me confidence. His advice to anyone in a similar situation is to take their time. He said: It was such a massive weight off my shoulders when I came out as gay, but everyone comes out at their own pace. Dont feel pressured to come out, just do it when you are ready. There will be a lot more people who love and accept you for who you are than you would originally think.

Environment Secretary Michael Gove has launched a consultation on the Governments plan to ban the items, which he said can devastate the worlds oceans and wildle. The ban could be put in place at some stage between October next year and October , the Department for Environment Food  Rural Affairs said. The consultation will consider exemptions to make sure people who need plastics to deal with medical conditions or accessibility issues are not affected. Under Government plans, pharmacies would still be able to sell plastic straws and restaurants, pubs and bars could stock the items to be used on request.  It is estimated that . billion plastic straws,  million plastic stirrers and . billion plastic-stemmed cotton buds are used each year in England. Mr Gove said the ban would be a boost to efforts to turn the tide on plastic pollution. He said: Our precious oceans and the wildle within need urgent protection from the devastation throw-away plastic items can cause. In England we are taking world-leading action with our ban on microbeads, and thanks to the publics support have taken over  billion plastic bags out of circulation with our p charge. I commend retailers, bars and restaurants that have already committed to removing plastic straws and stirrers. But we recognise we need to do more. Today we step-up our efforts to turn the tide on plastic pollution and ensure we leave our environment in a better state than we inherited it.  Around % of cotton buds are flushed down toilets, often ending up in waterways and oceans, the Government said. It is hoped millions of pounds could be saved annually on clean-up efforts of used plastics, which can take years to break down. Greenpeace UKs political adviser Sam Chetan Welsh commended ministers for doing the sensible thing, but urged big companies to do more by cutting down on plastic packaging. He said: Our societys addiction to throwaway plastic is fuelling a global environmental crisis that must be tackled. Ministers are doing the sensible thing by looking to ban single-use plastic items that can be easily replaced with better alternatives or that we can simply do without. But this should be just the start. If we are to protect our oceans from the scourge of plastic, the flow of waste needs to be cut off at the tap. And that means the companies producing and selling all this packaging must take responsibility for it and cut down the amount of plastic ending up in our shopping baskets.  Kate Nicholls, CEO of UKHospitality, welcomed the consultation, saying many restaurants and hotels have already begun taking action to cut down on plastics. She said: We wholeheartedly welcome this consultation on an issue of vital importance and one which hospitality has already taken signicant action. Since UKHospitalitys Unpack the Future of Hospitality summit in the spring, thousands of pubs clubs, restaurants and hotels across the UK have changed their straws and stirrers to biodegradables, or adopted policies that cut or eliminate their use in their venues. The Government is seeking views on how we can cut plastic waste and we look forward to continued engagement to play a part in achieving that goal.

Kristina Khamrayeva had been missing for two months when police put Kirill Volsky through a lie detector test and discovered the truth, officials say. In August, the teenager lied to his mother, saying he was staying with a school friend and his grandmother, it was reported. He then used his savings to fly , miles across Russia from Khabarovsk to Moscow to meet the girl who he had befriended online on anime social media groups.  He told Kristina he had flown to the Russian capital with his mother to attend the wedding of a family friend. They met up several times but he was “jealous” she did not spend all her time with him, and still hung out with her female friends. His mother Olga later said he told the girl he wanted to marry her and have children after completing his military service. But she had spurned his advances. He killed her with a kne in a Moscow flat he had rented, according to reports citing law enforcement. Then he dismembered her body and disposed of the parts in rubbing bins and sewage drains.  A massive search was launched for Kristina who was last seen on August  wearing black jeans, black sneakers, a white T-shirt with strawberries on it, and carrying a pink backpack. Investigators quizzed the boy who denied any wrongdoing. But then he stopped taking calls from detectives. Investigators flew from Moscow to question him and he was put through a lie detector. During the interview he confessed to killing the girl and explained where he had disposed of her remains. None of her body parts were found. He now faces trial.

She was taking her son to the dentist and can be heard panicking on camera.  It continued taxing before finally grinding to a halt a few minutes later, as people in the cars around the plane watched on in horror. As Keris car drives past the plane, the two people inside look a little shaken up but understandably relieved at their smooth landing.Major props to these two dudes for landing without any problems, she wrote on Facebook after the incident.Calornia Highway Patrol say the incident occurred at .am on Friday.  Travis Garrow, a Calornia Highway Patrol Officer, said: According to the pilot, they started having a loss of power and some engine travels. They were on course to land at the airport but knew they werent going to make that. He was able to make that emergency landing. Im not sure how he missed traffic, theres a lot going on out here. Its a miracle. Theres power lines behind me, overhead signs behind me, so the fact that he was successful is a pretty good achievement. Miraculously, nobody was hurt and the plane was not damaged.  The aircraft, being steered by a student pilot alongside and instructor, had been experiencing engine trouble. The instructor took over the controls of the Piper propeller aircraft to land safely. Two lanes remained shut down as an investigation was launched at the scene.

China has completed a gigantic new bridge linking Hong Kong to the mainland of the country. The terrying bn structure will be the worlds longest sea-crossing bridge when it officially opens later this week. Drivers will need to be able to stomach the winding -kilometerspan that connects Hong Kong to Macau via the major Chinese city of Zhuhai. The enormous bridge crossing will also see cars descend into a .-kilometersubmerged tunnel that was built to allow shipping containers to pass overhead.  Chinese President Xi Jinping will attend the opening ceremony in Zhuhai on Thursday, bringing an end to the ambitious construction project which has taken nine years to complete. The bridge is part of plans for the Greater Bay Area which covers , square kilometers and incorporates  millions people in  dferent cities.  With the bridge, the traveling time between Hong Kong and the Western Pearl River Delta region will be shortened signicantly, thereby bringing the Western Pearl River Delta region within three hours drive from Hong Kong,one official said in a statement. The bridge will allow tourists visiting Hong Kong to travel freely to the rest of China. The journey time to Macau, a city popular for its shopping and large casinos, has now been cut from three hours to just  minutes.  However, private car owners will not be able to cross the bridge without a special permit and most drivers will be forced to ditch their vehicle and take a shuttle bus or hire car to complete the journey. Shuttle buses cost - for a single trip. Hong Kong has seen a massive surge in tourist numbers in recent years, with many visitors coming from mainland China. The former British territory was swamped with . million tourist arrivals in , compared with . million for the entirety of the UK.  Hong Kong residents have expressed serious concerns over the costly new bridge, and say it will not benefit the city which has seen a massive rise in housing costs and homelessness in recent years. It links Hong Kong to China almost like an umbilical cord. You see it, and you know youre linked up to the motherland, one source told CNN.

scoring in the - win at Hamilton – Dundee’s only league win of the season.And the Irish centre-back insists he wants to maintain those good displays under Macca as they look to rise from the foot of

going to be in on Wednesday morning and had games to prepare for.“From Tuesday when Neil McCann left there was no real indication the turnaround was going to be so quick but it was training as

positive result from.”And the Dee will be hoping they can pick up some points as it doesn’t get any easier with current league leaders Hearts coming to Dens Park on Tuesday night.Although they’ve not had much of a chance to train as a group under Jim and have been out of the swing of regular matches because of the international break, Boyle feels they’ll be ready for the challenge of playing two games in four days.Boyle said: “As players you want to play as many games as possible.“You’d rather play games than train and the Saturday-Tuesday is a chance to get maximum points on the board and that’s the way we’ve got to look at it now.“It’s important now to get results and try to climb the table.“We’ve picked up of late and we have the confidence going into today that we’re more than

take to Indigo and show just how much this issue means to people in Dundee and the surrounding areas.“The PFI contract runs until , and the Scottish Government says the cost of buying it out would be too much, meaning you’ll have to keep paying to park at Ninewells for at least another decade.“While that is unacceptable, it’s clear that there is little prospect of the contract itself being scrapped.“Butwe can at least freeze the fees, it will give people some respite and ensure Indigo is not making big profits at your expense.”The contract between Indigo and NHS Tayside allows the fees to be reviewed in line with the retail price index.But the private firm, which made a profit of more than £ million last year, has refused to provide a detailed explanation of its decision to raise the charges next month.PETITION: Sign to support the Tele#s campaign to Freeze the Fees at Ninewells Hospital\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp

What’s more, eventhey don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in , a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now,  years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 37","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Sir,It is always a delight when a letter awakens a landowner.James F Lithgow#s insult about ‘blow-ins’ is a typical trait. I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

Cara Taven, from Coylton, set up a Facebook page called ‘Girls Against Spiking’to bring to light the effects of spiking on nights out and to, hopefully, eradicate it. The Facebook page, which has gained a following of over  people in one week, hopes to attract the attention of nightclubs and bars and is aiming for lids to be put on all drinks served at their bars as part of a drive to stop people having their drinks spiked.  Cara, , told the Post about her campaign. She said: “I have heard a lot about people getting spiked recently, in my local area and in the Glasgow region, and I know that a lot of people in Ayr do go out in Glasgow. “It tends to be younger girls about my age that get affected by spiking and that was something I have really started to think about. “This is something that could happen to anyone. “I’m a law student and the reason why I wanted to study law was to represent people who maybe don’t have the confidence to represent themselves and to make a dference that way and I think that is where getting the idea to make the page has come from. “I honestly thought it would be a page where the girls at my work could like – I am surprised by the response. “I remember saying to someone at work ‘If you like the page it’ll take me to  likes’ – then when I woke up in the morning and it was . “I haven’t been affected by spiking – it’s not really about me or anyone that I know. It is about the community of girls my age. “ I just felt like the answer was there and no one has done anything about it until now.” The Post reported how Cleo Smillie, , from Ayr, was on a night out in Madrid with her friend, Marc Davies, when she blacked out after one sip of her pink gin and lemonade. It was later learned that she had a high level of GHB in her blood – the date-rape drug. Strathclyde Union is among the nightclubs and bars that were prompted by the campaign and have gone on to order  lids on a trial basis as they work on ways to keep students as safe as possible on nights out.

An astute, respected and independent body, its remit would be to act for the long term greater good of the Ayrshire coast and its stakeholders - and issue unorm guidelines to prevent North, East and South Ayrshire councils peppering our seascapes with all kinds of piecemeal shoreline developments. Sadly, such a badly-needed supervisory power is still only a figment of my imagination. But had it existed – it would have poured over builder McCarthy and Stone’s ‘Legoland’ plans for the former Malcolm Sargent House site at Prestwick . . . before hobbing them into the nearest bin! As it is, neighbouring Prestwick Golf Club have taken the legal ‘ last resort’ and petitioned for a judicial review of South Ayrshire Council’s decision to grant planning approval. Successfully overturning SAC’s November  decision is the legal equivalent of holing a  footer on Prestwick’s th green. Only six per cent of inidual judicial reviews succeed. But they can take comfort in the classic  judicial review when planning permission for wind turbines was challenged because they were in the flight path of ospreys nesting hundreds of miles away! Lord Hope ruled that while no inidual with land interests had objected to the turbines, the “natural environment” is everyone’s interest. He memorably pronounced: “The osprey has no means of protecting itself. If its interests are to be protected, someone needs speak on its behalf”. Prestwick’s Golf Club’s members are scattered across the county, the country and the world. Not a single one of them has inidual land interests affected by the proposed development. But the  Tom Morris designed links - its fairways, dunes, greens, unique location, backcloth, traditions and history - cannot protect itself. In the spirit of Lord Hope’s ruling, its members are “speaking on its behalf”. And I say good luck to them. As I also said, their chances on paper are slim. Butit hits the Court of Session, and the man in the big seat has a Royal and Ancient tie under his robe – or bits of Muirfield on the golf shoes in the boot of his Jag - well . . . you just never know! Prestwick’s members are no fools either – they hope their legal move will get everyone back around the table for complete rethink on the scale of McCarthy and Stone’s plans. The builder will no doubt deny any adverse reflection on Prestwick – but you can bet the proximity of the historic links will be in the first paragraph in any of their sales brochures! McCarthy and Stone made a pound million profit in . Their average UK apartment price is almost pound, - and they’re planning  of them at Prestwick . . . that’s pound. million. With those numbers at stake – McCarthy and Stone will be putting all kinds of pressure on South Ayrshire Council not to cave in. Prestwick Golf Club doesn’t have a problem with the site being developed – but rightly ask that any development be appropriate in design and scale to its noble and historic surroundings. And that’s something McCarthy and Stone can easily afford. Prestwick Golf Club is a legendary place for winners. And there will be legendary amounts of Kummel quaffed in the clubhousethey win this one!Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilEnvironmentPrestwickAirAsiaAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"chief inspector makes return south","story":"NewsChief inspector makes ato South AyrshireChief Inspector Derek Frew takes over the reigns from Gary I’Anson.ShareByPippa Smith:,  OCT NewsChief Inspector Derek Frew \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe new chief inspector in South Ayrshire has vowed to put the community at the heart of policing.

This is when you learn your people skills. I was there for three and a half years - you involve yourself with the community - it was just amazing. “It was a highlight for personal reasons, for family reasons, for friends you make for le and for the grounding it gives you in getting to know people. “I came back to Ayr in  as an operational police officer then I left the Division and worked in national security for a while which was really interesting. “It got to  and I wanted to come back to operational policing so I ed to Ayr as an operational inspector. “For the third time in my career, I’m back.

It’s the tipple sought after and enjoyed by millions across the globe but made closer to home than you think – in the heart of Girvan. And it’s at the newly developed multi-million pound Hendrick’s Gin Palace where the magic and wonder begins. The most signicant development since launch in , Hendrick’s Gin has been impressively expanded to meet the global demand for the ever popular drink. William Grant  Sons, the family owned independent global spirts company, has invested pound million in the glorious expansion, adding six new distillers to work under Hendrick’s Master Distiller, Lesley Gracie’s watchful eye. Innovation has always been in the brand’s DNA, echoing the ethos of Lewis Carroll who cried “curiouser and curiouser”. And it’s this spirit of invention and Alice in Wonderland-esque manner that carries through to the custom-designed complex which is encased in an enchanted walled garden, leading to a magnicent “Victorian inspired” palm house.  Surrounded by two botanical hot houses, the palm house is used to “cultivate unusual botanicals and flora from around the world”. An inner sanctum that is Lesley’s laboratory features a “curious flavour library, a lecture theatre that encourages scholarly learnings and a suitably stylish bar”. And, of course, there are two stunning new still houses. The Hendrick’s family of stills now stands at a proud six – four Bennett stills including the original antique copper pot from  and three precise replicas. The Bennett stills were handcrafted by local manufacturers Carrick Engineering and construction of the distillery was all done by local contractors and builders helping to capture the home of Hendrick’s gin right down to the foundations. The three replica stills are guarded and overlooked by a stunning stained glass ceiling – perhaps spied by Alice herself as she keeked through the looking glass. Master distiller Lesley continues that sense of wonder with every drop she makes.  Lesley said: “I’ve been distilling Hendrick’s for almost  years and during that time, my team and I have had the opportunity to explore and experiment on a small scale. “However, I’m thrilled and excited to take full advantage of our wonderful new distillery and begin working on a line of experimental liquids, some of which will hopefully blossom into future releases and potential new expressions of Hendrick’s.” Pamela Selby, the Global Brand Director for Hendrick’s added: “The Hendrick’s Gin Palace in its design and experience, is intended to inspire curiosity, open minds and serve as a  for invention. “It pulls back the curtain on the wondrous production method and showcases the many layers of Hendrick’s that it has become celebrated for, some humorous, others curiously intellectual, detailed and deeply meaningful. “It represents the confidence we have in the brand that helped to kick-start the ginaissance and leading role it has played ever since.” And with no end in sight for the beloved ginaissance – long may it live. At Alice in Wonderland’s top table it’s time for tea, but at the glorious Hendrick’s Palace it’s always gin o’clock.

This is hard for me as I am disabled and struggle to take it in and out when I use the shower.At my former address the replacement bags were thrown into the garden at collection time. This was fine as the garden was fenced in and evenit was windy the bags would blow about the garden but not blow away.Where I currently live the front door is right on the pavement which is only about  inches wide.You would think it would be easy just to put the bags through the letterbox, but no, despite asking and even pleading with workers, to put them through the letterbox, they continuously throw them on the ground and I do not get the bags as they blow away.The last time my recycling was collected two weeks ago I was watching for the workers coming so I could get the bags handed to me.It was early and as the bags were outside I took a shower. Unfortunately, as I exited the shower, the van approached.I rushed as much as I am able but by the time I reached the door they had gone and left just one fresh bag.I had put out three full of recycling. I shouted to the man who was a vit further down the street but he did not appear to hear.In one of the first storms of the autumn, wearing just a T shirt, trousers and slippers with wet hair I followed them down the street, shouting at him to wait.Eventually half-way along the street he stopped and turned.I was dumbfounded when he said: #I heard you the first time you shouted. If you had said excuse me, I would have stopped, but I do not stop when someone shouts.#I was totally exhausted in the high wind and rain and felt asI was going to collapse. I came back in and just sat and cried.I have had enough, even to get them to leave the number of replacement bags is a struggle but it is a lot worse having to chase them down the street.This ignorant man should be doing behind the scenes work and not mixing with the public.I will not be recycling any more the struggle is just too much.Name and address supplied."},{"url":null,"title":"mach dunes golfing greats honoured","story":"General manager Andy Hogan welcomed a large number of golfers gathered for the occasion, last Saturday night, before introducing green-keeper Simon Freeman who made the presentations.Mr Freeman said: #I would like to thank David Southworth, for continuing to fund this enterprise for all of our benefits and Greg Sherwood for taking such an active lead in ensuring that standards of service are constantly being raised.#It has not been an easy year to be a green-keeper for a number of reasons and it definitely helps us to remain motivated when we know everyone is on our side.#I would like to thank each of you, and all the other members and regular players for their support and encouragement in .#This is the end of the season for us but the winter series will be a stableford and winter medals will be played as well.#The Shepherd#s Cross Trophy is to be re-named the David Irwin Memorial Trophy and will be played next weekend.#Andy Hogan added: #I would also like to think Lorna and Peter at the clubhouse, the drivers who take everybody out from Campbeltown, they do such a good job and also all the people who are working behind the scenes tonight.#Awards were as follows: Medal winners: November : Iain Logan, : January: Crawford Kilpatrick, February: Robert Paterson, March: Crawford Kilpatrick, April: Iain Logan, May: Stewart Litster, June: Andrew Wallace, July: Keith Blair, August and September: Craig Ramsay.

RoundThe Pupils never really got going in this cup-tie, ending the game as second best to a moderately talented visiting side.Kinross were fortunate to be confronted by a uncharacteristically tame performance from the McFadyen sponsored home favourites.Lacking the key elements of drive, determination and quick controlled possession, the home side, playing with a threadbare squad due to injury and call-offs  used the long ball far too often in the first half.During the first twenty minutes the Pupils had territorial advantage, but were never able to string enough passes together to make a telling impact on the game.With the visitors hardly an attacking force, the home crowd was shocked when Kinross unexpectedly grabbed the lead shortly before half time.It’s ironic given that the Pupils back four seemed to be on top of their game, that one mistake should prove so costly.There seemed little danger, but the ball was lost in a crucial area and turned across goal for the incoming forward to score with the visitor’s only shot of the whole first half.The second half began disastrously for the home side, a through ball exposing the last line of defence whose first real action was to pick the ball out of the net.Given what went before, it was unimaginable that the Pupils were two goals behind at this stage the visitor’s ‘smash and grab’ tactics a complete contradiction to their earlier failure to attack.With the confidence of an unexpected but comfortable two goal cushion, the Fe League side turned the screw by controlling possession from the back.Mistakes had cost the home side dear, and, for the first time in the match the visitors looked like a team heading for the next round of the Scottish Cup!The home side tried desperately to retrieve the situation, but gaps appeared at the back as they threw caution to the wind.The keeper, young Alastair Ferguson, saved the day by fisting clear inside the six yard box, a timely intervention which kept the Pupils in the game at a crucial stage.Almost immediately, the home side were awarded a penalty kick on the back of a wild challenge in the box, and Gary Grumoli drove the ball into the net.Sensing blood, the Pupils powered forward at last using the ball to good effect with some fine possession football.However, it proved a  dawn and only a prequel to another defensive mistake which resulted in the visitor’s restoring their two goal cushion via a poacher’s finish from point blank range.In a breathtaking finish, the Pupils gained a second penalty with minutes remaining however, resisting the urge to change the kicker, Gary Grumoli placed his second effort to the keeper’s opposite side, only to see his kick saved dramatically.It was the final act of an uninspiring, but ultimately exciting game.The Pupils will try to put the cup disappointment behind them when they travel to play old foes, Hillington, in a league fixture tomorrow.Ellis Robertson played a solid game in the centre. _cpupilsvkinrossRyan

My wee daughter wanted to have an ldquoapple shower and so we stood under the trees. The mere touch of a branch resulted in a cascade of fruit. It was a wonderful ritual of autumn and I loved my kidsrsquo joy in it all, but within me there was a nagging feeling. As Irsquove got older, the oncoming of winter has had a depressive effect on me.Is it a process that affects us more as we get older, with each autumn marking the slow closing of yet another year To be sure, autumn is a beautul time of year and many people tell me it is their favourite season. I can understand that. The woods are magical, the sunsets seem more spectacular than at other times and itrsquos a time of harvest and forage. Our house is full of conkers, apples and colourful leaves collected on walks.Another part of the magic is the migrating birds. I heard the geese above me the other day, honking and flying in formation as they headed for Aberlady. They arrive at this time of year with winter on their tails. The assembly of pink-footed geese there at this time of year is a truly spectacular sight and sound. Tens of thousands of them gather at Aberlady Bay during their migration south.It almost has the atmosphere of an airport countless numbers of honking birds arriving from Iceland and Greenland, joining an already crowded bay. There are thousands of excited geese mingling together, sharing flight stories and looking forward to the next stage of their journey. Many feed in nearby fields before taking off once again to venture further south.As they fly over us their honking sounds like cackling witches. I often hear them when in the woods, as I did the other day. I looked up to see them through the branches of balding autumn trees, flying in their characteristic V flight formations. It seemed their honking was warning me of something: ldquoWinter is cominghellipwinter is coming.Some people of course follow the example of the geese and head for a kinder climate as winter approaches. But for most of us itrsquos a case of ritual and preparation. Hallowersquoen, really a later development of the Celtic Samhain festival, is one such ritual.But for me now, despite my love of autumnrsquos display, it cloaks my senses with a sense of melancholy which I find increasingly dficult to throw off.I spend as much time outdoors as possible in the other seasons but the darkness of winter forces me to retreat into my home. Hence we will soon be decorating our wee house with cosy and colourful lights to ward off winterrsquos dark blanket. But this dark blanket can cover our emotions as well, not so easily warded off.Many people I know likewise dread winter because of its depressive effect on their mental health. They wish that, like the geese, they could find a way of escaping the worst of it. I have often wished I was a bear who could hibernate away the winter months.But we are not bears or geese, and in my own battles with the oncoming of winter I have come to understand more than ever the importance of social connections and preparing for them. The truth is winter can be a time of flowering and rebirth, just like spring but in a dferent way ndash the flowering of friendship and rebirth of social connections perhaps lost or waned in the flurry of summer activities.In the past it was so self-evident. People huddled in each otherrsquos homes around the fire, keeping each other company. Like so many things these traditions have now been commercialised, yet the simple antidote of social connection in the approaching dark times remains as powerful as it ever was for us.It should be a time for visiting and getting together making time for friends and coming together in defiance of the darkness. And thinking especially of those for whom the cold and dark becomes an enforcer of confinement because of age or vulnerability.Winter should be a time of visiting and welcoming. This, I think, is an antidote to that depressive winter effect. Maybe thatrsquos why the geese honk so much.

Not even film crew or directors, screen writers or location experts.No, the answer ndash as it has been for decades ndash is film studios: several sturdy, capacious, weather-resistant, flexible film studios, ideal for both visiting Hollywood blockbusters, for making long-form dramas for online streaming s, for crafting indigenous movies or recording TV dramas.As one prominent MSP, culture committee convener Joan McAlpine, lamented earlier this year, the call for a film studio for Scotland has been made, and not answered, since the s.Scotland, at present, needs not just one, but several. Nearly all industry experts agree, with one lobbying group saying it is now ldquomore urgent than ever. The screen industries, boosted by tax cuts, are a proven boon for the UK economy, and Scotland too.The British Film Institutesaid last week that the UK film and TV industry generated a record pound. billion in , helped by Government tax reliefs.In comparison, Wales now has several studios, including a Pinewood extension that could have been in Scotland, as has Northern Ireland.Yorkshire has a studio, and last week the need for Scotland to compete with other parts of the UK was underlined when Steven Knight, the Birmingham-born screenwriter, film director and creator of Peaky Blinders, revealed plans to open a six-stage TV and film studio complex in the Midlands city.The -acre site, called Mercian Studios, will be located near Birmingham airport and include six sound stages.Scotland, by contrast, seems to have, when faced with the prospect of building film studios ndash Wardpark aside ndash been gripped by a case of soundstage-fright. Various plans, from prospective studios in the Highlands to plans for the outskirts of Edinburgh, have risen and fallen like apparitions.But is this situation about to change  It could be. It is understood the outline of a public-private solution could be unveiled before Christmas.The Herald on Sunday has learned that Creative Scotland, which has a new screen body, Screen Scotland, is shortly to put a private-public studio proposition, with a specic site in mind, to tender to interested companies.This will be a dferent proposition from , when the body and Scottish Enterprise put several suggested business cases out to tender, with little success.The plan received an ldquoapproval in principle from Fiona Hyslop, the Cabinet Secretary for Culture, on July , and a ldquoprospective landlord is in commercial discussions.Now Screen Scotland is to recruit a project manager to ldquodrive the next steps in the plan.Where this studio might be is not known, but the  EKOS consultancys report into the potential for film studio in Scotland, for Scottish Enterprise, suggested a site in the central belt with good transport links.Iain Munro, the interim chief executive of Creative Scotland, says that the new studio plan ndash still largely under wraps ndash could be a ldquostep change for the screen industry north of the border, and boost the already pound million the screen industries bring to the country.He says that, in combination with the new Screen Scotland unit, ldquopermanent, sustainable studio facilities are a particular focus. Munro said: ldquoThere is already studio provision in Scotland, but Screen Scotland recognises, in order to deliver that ambition, and the step change for growth in the sector, a studio remains a central proposition.ldquoWe shouldnrsquot overlook that there are other facilities in play, but this central proposition is the fact wersquove been working on a technical business case ... in order to deliver this central priority.ldquoWe are doing our due diligence ndash the important thing is that we are at an advanced stage, and are about to embark on the next stage.The next stage is putting the idea out to tender, and Munro said ldquowe understand that for some time, therersquos been a real desire for Scotland to take up this opportunity, and the potential for this sector is huge, and there is so much more than we can do.He added: ldquoOnce we go to tender, that will be about securing an operator for a facility, and that is quite an exciting new stage.He added: ldquoWe have Outlander here, production growth is up, but this signicant studio is a game-changing element that will be key to that development in the next five years.ldquoItrsquos a real priority, I cannot impress that enough.Producers, film-makers and location experts all agree a large-scale studio complex is needed in Scotland.At present, big productions come to Scotland for its natural beauty, its castles and mountains and beaches, its urban elegance and city-scape toughness, but rarely stay for their whole shoot: there is no ready-made studio space to hold them and keep them for long periods.Game Of Thrones, the hugely successful television fantasy drama, famously considered Scotland as a home, but was lured to Belfast by its Titanic Studios, one of Europersquos largest film studios.So although Glasgow, last year, benefited from poundm in film and TV shoots, and Edinburgh had a bumper year of pound.m, largely due to Avengers: Infinity War shooting some scenes in the city, the economic benefits of the movie, and, increasingly, televisions dramas driven by streaming services Netflix and Amazon, are nowhere near as high as they could be, experts say.It said: ldquoFor decades, Scottish film-makers have had a nomadic existence using buildings that have been discarded by other industries.ldquoTen years ago, Scotland had the largest screen industry outside the home counties, it is now far behind Northern Ireland, Wales and the English regions.ldquoThe screen sector is a multi-billion-pound global industry on the ascendancy, and the Scottish Government needs the will to encourage the local Scottish industry.The AFPTS, which includes directors, producers and technical crews, also notes: ldquoThere is dference between a studio and a stage: a stage is a big shed where you shoot the production. A studio has a lot more ndash it includes production offices, dressing rooms, prop storage, prop making, construction workshops, special effects, costume making, lighting companies, sound companies, camera hire companies, post-production, casting companies ndash and the list goes on.The Scottish Hollywood producer Iain Smith, whose films include Mad Max: Fury Road, The Fountain and Children Of Men, expresses a certain weariness over the lack of studio ndash he has seen many plans and schemes appear and evaporate over the years.He sees an opportunity for Scotland in the seemingly inexorable rise of streaming s.Smith said: ldquoIt is not just Birmingham, we are seeing initiatives all over the nations and regions, because people are beginning to get the picture ndash and yet Scotland seems somehow stuck.ldquoIrsquove personally been on two of these [Parliament] committees with MSPs, and they seem positive at the time, but nothing transpires, and I quite donrsquot know why.ldquoIt doesnrsquot have to be a massive spend, in fact I would argue it mustnrsquot be massive spend, it is about using facilities, amending and adjusting them so they are fit for purpose.Rosie Ellison is the head of film at Film Edinburgh. It is her job to draw movies, TV shows, documentaries and adverts to Edinburgh and the surrounding area.She was deeply involved with recent shoots such as Avengers: Infinity War in the city.Part of Avengers: Infinity War, when it was shooting in the capital, was filmed in a makesht studio in the Pelamis Building in Leith.The producers were able to erect a set there for some of the shooting in . However, once the location shoot in Edinburgh was done, including much filming around Cockburn Street, the Royal Mile, St Giles Cathedral and Waverley Station, the production ed to its base in Atlanta, Georgia.Ellison believes Scotland needs two major factors to make a studio happen: a private developer with the will to make it happen, and a collective ldquobelief.The lack of a large, permanent, film studio makes her job harder ndashproductions want to shoot in the capital, and its surrounds, but they also need facilities indoors.Scotland loses films, or can only be home for parts of them, because of the lack of capacity for indoor shoots, Ellison says. If there was a studio, it would create a virtuous circle. More productions would come for both locations and studios, more crew would move to, or stay in Scotland, and businesses connected to movies would also gather and grow.She said: ldquoWhat we find is that they really like the locations we have, and then they ask where are we going to build sets, and we need crew  We have stunning locations, but itrsquos very dficult to land productions without the studios.ldquoI think about [the forthcoming] Mary, Queen of Scots film, and how they came to shoot for a few weeks, to capture the Scottish landscapes and establish its Scottish nature, butwe had a studio, then thatrsquos the kind of productions which could have come to Scotland, lock, stock and barrel.ldquoA film studio would be an absolute game-changer for Scotland and it is essential Scotland keeps up with the rest of the UK.ldquoWe need the people to back it and the belief that we can do it.One hurdle, the Scottish Government and Scottish Enterprise have said, is the EUrsquos rules on state aid ndash that is, its strict rules against states distorting the free market by pumping public money into private business.A film studio in Spain backed by public money, Ciudad de la Luz in Alicante, had to close after legal challenges from commercial rivals.But after Brexit, will this hurdle be removed  Not likely, it seems.This week, a spokesman for the Brexit Department at the UK Government said the state aid strictures are likely to continue after next March. He noted: ldquoThe UKrsquos proposals for the future UK-EU relationship include committing to a common rulebook on state aid, to be enforced and supervised in the UK by the Competition and Markets Authority and ldquothe UK has been a leading advocate of the development of the EU state aid and competition regime, and has much to gain from maintaining disciplines on subsidies and anti-competitive practices.Two purely private efforts have led the way in recent years in Scotland ndashthe well-documented Pentlands Film Studios, which wants to build on the outskirts of Edinburgh, and the little less-known Guardhouse plan, which, its chief executive Surya Iacono, maintains, is still on track.Both have, in recent weeks and months, hit obstacles.The Pentlands plan, to build on land at Straiton, took a blow legally. The Scottish Land Court ruled a tenant farmer could not be evicted from his land which the developers want to use for the studio.PSL Land, which wishes to build the poundm film studio on the land, said it respected, but is disappointed by, the decision and is now considering its options ndash although it is not clear what these are.Guardhouse had initially wanted to build a studio on land owned by Heriot-Watt University but now it is looking where, near Edinburgh and in Fe. However, a statement from Guardhouse says it is waiting to see how the potentially calamitous Brexit process unfolds.It said: ldquoWhile these plans are very far advanced, a decision on the final scope of our investment into Scotland will very much depend on how Brexit unfolds and in particular on how the decision to exit the European Union will impact on the financial viability of our studio business models.ldquoIssues include the continuation of the UKrsquos successful incentive programme, the financial implications of any new tarf regime on the high-tech equipment imported to establish the studio, and our ability to seamlessly move management and production staff and crew between our Italian studio and our Edinburgh operations as required.BREAK OUT: The studio rivals to Scotland around the UK.Wales:Pinewood Studios, Wales.In Cardf Bay, the studio is part of the major Pinewood company and has , square feet of shooting space, and the same amount of production space.Also in Wales: the BBCs Roath Lock studio, Dragon International Film Studios, near Bridgend: Merlin and film Ironclad have been filmed there.Enfys in Cardf also has two studios, Bay Studios in Swansea is another facility, and Bad Wolf Studios is one of the largest studios in the country.Northern Ireland:Belfast Harbour Studios, has two , square feet sound stages.Titanic Studios, which includes three major sound stages.The Britvic facility has three sound stages, close to central Belfast.The Linen Mill, half an hour from Belfast, has a total of , square feet.Yorkshire:Church Fenton Studios, based in Selby District, is managed and developed by Screen Yorkshire.It as three stages, and Stage One, , square feet, was used for shooting ITVs Victoria.London:The centre of film making in the UK, with Pinewood Studios, Shepperton Studios, Twickenham Studios, and numerous others.Scotland:Wardpark Studios in Cumbernauld: currently home to the Outlander series.BREAK OUTThe Scottish Hollywood producer Iain Smith on the potential of streaming drama for the Scottish film and TV industry.\"There is Netflix, there is Amazon [streaming video] coming up fast, and there is Disney, coming up fast - they are preparing their own streaming channel.\"It is all moving to streaming, or SVOD as we call it, Subscription Video on Demand.

Yet, Scottish Tory MPs have privately admitted it would be highly unlikely the EU would agree to this.Some of them have already warned the party whips that they could not accept a transition extension without the fishing exemption and they would be prepared to vote against the Government, even possibly voting down the Chancellorrsquos Budget, such is the strength of feeling.Having initially told the fishing industry - most of which is north of the border - the UK would take back control of its waters on Brexit Day, this was pushed back to the end of the transition period in December  any further extension to December , more than five years after the referendum vote would smack of betrayal, some Scottish Tory MPs believe.Douglas Ross, the Tory MP for Moray, told the BBCs Sunday Politics Scotland programme: \"I could not support a deal that would include staying in the Common Fisheries Policy beyond December .\"He added: ldquoWhats important is that we send out a very strong signal to everyone who is negotiating on behalf of the UK that this is an issue that is extremely important for our Scottish communities that we represent.\"My view is it will not come to that [a hard Brexit rather than staying in the CFP]. They[the UK Government] will see that there is a very clear, distinct message from the Scottish Conservatives, and indeed Scotland, that we cannot have the CFP.\"With Mrs May facing growing unease among her backbenchers with one saying she is ldquodrinking in the last chance saloon, Mr Raab urged unity and that Tory MPs should pull together and ldquoplay for the team.Labourrsquos Keir Starmer observed: ldquoI donrsquot think anybody thinks this -year civil war in the Tory Party is going to end before Christmas.ldquoWhat wersquore going to see is eventherersquos a deal, the Tory Party will try to rip it up next year. Some of them are already saying theyrsquore going to do that.The Shadow Brexit Secretary added: ldquoSo this idea of an historic moment before Christmas in the national interest isnrsquot going to happen. They will not stop fighting about this.Meanwhile, Mr Blackford also told Sunday Politics Scotland that following the failure of the PM to end the deadlock at last weekrsquos EU summit it was now vital that MPs were afforded the time to properly scrutinise the current state of Brexit negotiations.ldquoWe are more than two years on from the referendum and we find ourselves in the extraordinary position whereby the EU, the devolved governments, opposition parties and businesses are still none the wiser over what the Tory Governmentrsquos plans are to resolve some of the biggest challenges in these negotiations.ldquoThe Prime Minister can no longer duck and e parliamentary scrutiny and following the chaotic conclusion of the EU summit and her failure to end the deadlock it is vital that Theresa May does not just solely deliver a statement but schedules a full day debate in Westminster tomorrow so that MPs are afforded the time to scrutinise the current state of the Brexit talks.The Highland MP added: ldquoThese are deeply worrying times, our future relationship with the EU is being worked out against a backdrop of a Tory civil war with little regard to the detrimental impact on jobs and prosperity.

We cannot have the CFP.\"Mr Raab called for goodwill and \"a bit of oomph on both sides\" to get the exit deal over the line.He went on to say that any backstop arrangement to keep the Irish border open could not be permanent, yet he did not mention there would have to be a specic end date written into an agreement.ldquoI probably wouldnrsquot call it an ejector seat but there needs to be something which allows us to control how long we are there for to avoid any sense that we are left indefinitely in a sort of customs union limbo. That wouldnrsquot be acceptable.Mr Raab also stressed that any further delay in getting a deal beyond the end of November could lead to ldquopractical implications at Westminster for getting any agreed deal through the parliamentary process.He explained: ldquoIf it went any distance beyond that, we would have a problem with implementing a deal and it would almost be the worst-case scenario ndash we had a deal but we couldnrsquot implement it in time.Today, the Prime Minister is due to face more angry voices when she makes a Commons statement on last weekrsquos EU summit, which was supposed to be the ldquomoment of truth for the Brexit deal but ended up making no real progress.She will make clear ldquothe shape of the deal across the vast majority of the Withdrawal Agreement is now clear\".Some ldquo per cent\" of the Withdrawal Agreement and its protocols is settled, including agreements on Gibraltar and the military bases in Cyprus that were concluded in the last three weeks.On the Irish border issue, Mrs May will say: ldquoThe commitment to avoiding a hard border is one that this House emphatically endorsed and enshrined in law in the Withdrawal Act earlier this year.ldquoAs I set out last week, the original backstop proposal from the EU was one we could not accept, as it would mean creating a customs border down the Irish Sea and breaking up the integrity of the UK.\"I do not believe that any UK Prime Minister could ever accept this. And I certainly will not.Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, demanded that Mrs May set aside Commons business today to hold a full dayrsquos debate on Brexit, saying she could ldquono longer duck and e parliamentary scrutiny."},{"url":null,"title":"mark-smith-a-peoples-vote-is-the-right-thing-to-do-but-we-need-to-make-referendums-harder-to-hold-and-to-win","story":"However, whatever happens next ndash and the UK Government says there will be no second referendum even as the momentum for one builds ndash I do hope we take this chance to think about referendums in general and what wersquove learned from the fact that the last two decades have been filled with them. Before  there was not a single national referendum in the UK, and yet in the years since therersquos been a grand total of ten and the rate seems to be speeding up. Itrsquos asa country thatrsquos based, wisely, on the principle of representative democracy has developed, worryingly, a fetish for direct democracy through popular votes on single issues.The reason we should be worried by this trend is obvious: politicians. Referendums are sold as a way to resolve important public issues, but what theyrsquore usually really about is petty private disputes. Harold Wilson held the first national referendum in  not because he particularly cared about Europe but because Labour was ided and he needed to see off a rebellion by the hard-left Eurosceptic Tony Benn. And it worked: had Bennrsquos side won the referendum, he might well have gone on to take the Labour leadership.The same applies to pretty much every other referendum held since, particularly the ones ordered by one of their greatest fans, David Cameron. In , he ordered a poll on the voting system not because he wanted to discuss reform, but because he needed to keep Nick Clegg on side. Then, in , there was a vote on Scottish independence not because Mr Cameron wanted to encourage a constitutional debate, but because he wanted to arrest a rise in support for the SNP. And finally, in , Mr Cameron ordered a vote on Europe not because he was worried about the status quo, but because his party was ided. He did it all because he thought it would be good for his career and because he thought he would win.This is basically how every referendum has always worked, whether itrsquos in the UK or where: a politician has a problem they need to fix, or an enemy they want to undermine, or they want to attract support for a decision they have already made and so they order a referendum. Not even referendums that are seemingly uncontroversial are immune, such as the  vote on Scottish devolution. Do you really think Labour promised the referendum for any other reason than to avoid the Tories being able to say that a vote for Labour in the  election was a vote to break up the Union There are plenty of other questions we should be asking ourselves about how referendums work. For instance,they are supposed to be festivals of democracy, how come they often end up being about one or two iniduals or hinging on what a handful of politicians say in the newspapers, or write on the side of a bus  In what way, exactly, is it democratic to give disproportionate power to a small elite of pushy alpha males, often pushing the same dubious points  And how is it a good idea to reduce complicated questions to yes or no  And why do referendums that are apparently designed to solve problems so often create new ones For those who support continued membership of the EU, the truth of all of this can be seen in the  referendum and its chaotic aftermath Unionists can see it too in the constant constitutional agitating of the SNP ever since the  vote. Part of the explanation is the relatively close results ndash Leavers attracted . per cent of the vote in  and Unionists . per cent in  which means itrsquos been hard to portray the results of the referendums as the end of the matter. Instead, referendums just beget more referendums.The obvious answer would be to require bigger majorities. In the US, constitutional change needs support from two-thirds of the Senate and the House of Representatives ndash so why not consider something similar for the UK  Certainly, requiring two-thirds support at Westminster and Holyrood would avoid the situation in which the SNP can claim to have a mandate for a referendum on independence on the basis of a slim majority at Holyrood even though there is little support for it in the general population.And a super-majority in parliament is not the only reform we should consider. The  referendum on Scottish devolution is notorious for being set up to fail with a requirement that  per cent of the eligible electorate had to vote for change and I donrsquot think anyone would ever suggest a repeat of that. But therersquos a strong argument for a referendum option to require support from two-thirds of those who vote. That way, the result can properly be seen as reflecting the popular will and avoids the kind of close outcome that only leads to more trouble.Obviously, all of these problems would apply to the so-called peoplersquos vote that the protesters were calling for in London, but until we can properly reform the process, it looks like one of the few possible routes to a rethink. The concept of a second referendum is also another of the reforms that should be considered for the future. Ideally, referendums would only be heldthere were detailed plans or legislation on the proposed changes, andno such plan exists, there would need to be a further referendum later. That would mean we could avoid a repeat of  when we all voted yes or no to a plan that didnrsquot exist. However, the bad news for Scottish nationalists is that it would also mean that , one day, there is an indyref, there would have to be an indyref as well."},{"url":null,"title":"tories-demand-secret-snp-government-files-on-indyref2","story":"The Scottish Toriesdemandedthe material, produced by officials since, bepublishedafter discovering its existence through a freedom ofinformationrequest.The party said the files, some covering legal advice, showed a referendum was ldquonever off the SNPrsquos table, and have now lodged an appeal with Scotlandrsquos information tsar.However the depth and precise subject matter within the documents remains unclear.The Tories made their FoI request on August , asking the Scottish Government for ldquodetails of any briefings by civil servants or documents provided to ministers in  or  on the topic of a second independence referendum.Ministers replied in late September, refusing to disclose material on the grounds it would prejudice the conduct of public affairs to reveal sensitive government material.The government also said some material was exempt because it involved ldquolegal advice.The only material released a single letter from then finance and constitution secretary Derek Mackay to a Holyrood committee about the government publishing an analysis of responses to its draft referendum bill consultation in June last year.Following a challenge to the decision, the government has now revealed more information.It said that, in addition to the previous letter, it could ldquoconfirm that  other documents were identied as being within scope of [the] request.ldquoThese were provided from civil servants to Ministers as part of their normal duties supporting Ministers.

Yet, in the years afterwards, civil servants were still churning out briefings for ministers so they could continue banging the drum for separation in front of the cameras. That is irresponsible government.ldquoInstead, the nationalists should have been putting all their efforts into improving schools, hospitals, infrastructure and the economy.ldquoThe SNP government clearly deemed it necessary for taxpayer-funded civil servants to produce these highly-political briefings.ldquoAs such, they should now be published, as part of the SNPrsquos so-called commitment to open and transparent government.The Scottish Government has been asked for comment."},{"url":null,"title":"celebrities donate items for online auction","story":"Oscar winning actor Eddie Redmayne has donated a signed copy of his original script from The Theory of Everything, the biopic of Professor Stephen Hawking, who lived with MND for most of his adult le.Eddie, who was awarded the Academy Award for Best Actor for his portrayal of Professor Hawking said of the donation: ldquoIt seemed a fitting tribute to the memory of Stephen, to donate my signed script from The Theory of Everything to Sue Ryder.

It is a neurological disease which results in changes in animals# mental state, abnormalities of posture and movement and of sensation. The clinical disease usually lasts for several weeks and it is characteristically progressive and fatal.According to The World Organisation for Animal Health statistics very few cases of BSE — fewer than  each year since  — are reported in the UK.Rural Economy Secretary Fergus Ewing said: “Following confirmation of a case of classical BSE in Aberdeenshire, I have activated the Scottish Government’s response plan to protect our valuable farming industry, including establishing a precautionary movement ban being placed on the farm.“While it is important to stress that this is standard procedure until we have a clear understanding of the disease#s origin, this is further proof that our surveillance system for detecting this type of disease is working. Be assured that the Scottish Government and its partners stand ready to respond to any further confirmed cases of the disease in Scotland.”Chief Veterinary Officer Sheila Voas said: “While it is too early to tell where the disease came from in this case, its detection is proof that our surveillance system is doing its job. We are working closely with the Animal and Plant Health Agency to answer this question, and in the meantime, I would urge any farmer who has concerns to immediately seek veterinary advice.Ian McWatt, Director of Operations in Food Standards Scotland said: “There are strict controls in place to protect consumers from the risk of BSE, including controls on animal feed, and removal of the parts of cattle most likely to carry BSE infectivity.“Consumers can be reassured that these important protection measures remain in place and that Food Standards Scotland Official Veterinarians and Meat Hygiene Inspectors working in all abattoirs in Scotland will continue to ensure that in respect of BSE controls, the safety of consumers remains a priority.

Veterans, army and sea cadets and other groups will muster at the Royal British Legion, setting off shortly afterwards to form up on Broad Street.A short service led by the Salvation Army captain will lead to a two-minute silence at am, before a special Armistice Service takes place in the cathedral.In the afternoon, volunteers will begin to create a large-scale portrait in the sand at Scapa Beach, of an Orcadian soldier killed during WWI as part of Danny Boyle’s - NOW commission, Pages of the Sea. It was previously reported in last week’s The Orcadian that the event would take place at Waulkmill Bay, but this location has since changed to Scapa Beach.The artwork — one of  across the UK and the Republic of Ireland — will signy both the departure of the soldier from the county to serve in the war and, as the tide washes their image away, the loss of their le and those of many others.At pm, Orkney’s young people join forces with Orkney Rocks! Choir and others to remember those lost, and the impact the war had on those left behind, in a special concert at the Orkney Arts Theatre.Admission will be free and there will be an opportunity to make a contribution to the charity, Help for Heroes. Tickets for the concert will be released on Monday, October , and will be available at the council’s customer services points in School Place, Kirkwall, and Warehouse Buildings, Stromness.At .pm, a lone bugler at St Magnus Cathedral will join , inidual buglers from across the UK and oversees territories in sounding the historic ‘Last Post’.This will be followed by the lighting of a beacon on the St Magnus Cathedral kirk green at pm as part of the national Beacons of Light event which will see beacons lit across the country, symbolising an end to the darkness of war andto the light of peace.St Magnus Cathedral will remain the focus as, at .pm, the bells will ring alongside , others across the nation and beyond.Between pm and pm, the short film specially commissioned by the Kirkwall Townscape Heritage Initiative for the centenary of the armistice will be projected onto the cathedral for the last time.The convener of Orkney Islands Council, Harvey Johnston, said: “We are grateful to everyone who has worked with us so far to ensure we have a fitting programme of events here in Orkney for people to mark this momentous occasion and pay their respects to forbears who suffered so much. I hope people will involve and immerse themselves in these events as much as they can.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The report explicitly rejects austerity, the report recommends that an independent Scotland should have real terms growth in spending rather than the cuts we’ve seen.”: Theresa May accuses Nicola Sturgeon of betraying ScotlandAt one stage, Shephard waved a piece of paper at Ms Sturgeon and claimed he was reading directly from the report.In their written ruling, Ofcom said: “Mr Shephard was referring to a summary, written by the GMB production team, of a critique of the Commission Report produced by the Institute of Financial Studies. We therefore considered the statement was clearly inaccurate.“We recognised that Ms Sturgeon sought to correct the inaccuracy on a number of occasions during the interview. However, in each case, her correction was either dismissed or ignored by the presenters.“For example, as described above, Mr Shephard responded to Ms Sturgeon’s initial correction by reiterating the original inaccuracy.“Later, when Ms Sturgeon said “the report does not say what you said”, Ms Garraway interrupted and told her to ‘answer my question’.“We considered that the inaccuracy in this case had a signicant impact on the remainder of the interview. This was because viewers would have not known whether Mr Shephard or Ms Sturgeon was accurately reflecting the findings of Commission Report.“This potentially left viewers with an erroneous impression that Ms Sturgeon was either unclear about the contents of the report or deliberately misrepresenting its findings.”ITV said the error “was entirely unintentional and made in the heat of a live broadcast interview”.They added Shephard was reading from briefing notes which had been prepared by the programme’s editorial team which were “insufficiently clearly written”.The broadcaster was also found in breach of guidelines by Ofcom for failing to make the on air apology until four weeks after the interview was broadcast.Their apology read: “On  June we interviewed Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, during which we suggested to her that the SNP’s Sustainable Growth Commission Report had said austerity measures would be required in the event of Scottish independence.“In fact, the quote that we put to the First Minister was a summary of a critique of the Commission Report made by the Institute of Fiscal Studies, and not a quote from the Commission Report itself.

The EU is making it dficult. No-deal is now our only option. The Prime Minister isn’t going to get a deal that parliament will accept. The Irish Border issue is impossible.At the same time, I was tormented by the thought that all the Prime Minister has to do is compromise – agree to stay in the Customs Union and there is no problem with the Irish border, or Gibraltar for that matter.But would that be what people want  Is any of this debacle what anyone wanted  And what about the EU  Do they now just want to see the back of us Then I listened to Rob Jetten.He is a -year-old member of the Dutch Parliament who has just been elected as the leader of one of the Lib Dems’ sister liberal parties in the Netherlands, the D.This second youngest political leader in Dutch history was in Westminster to speak to a group of MPs and Peers.: Police ‘prepared for potential disorder’ sparked by food shortages post-BrexitListening to him reminded me of why I have always cherished what some dismiss as the ‘European Project’ as he likened our relationship with the EU to the biblical tale of the Prodigal Son.Although I’m not religious, I do remember the story from school. A wrestless son demands his inheritance to leave his family and make his own way in the world.I wondered at firstthis was to be a warning. That, like the son, we would find ourselves falling on hard times, our wealth squandered, and then come back, our proverbial tail between our legs. But I was wrong.What Jetten used it to illustrate was the strength of familial feeling towards us on the continent, and the hope that we will yet again exhibit our traditional ability to grasp success from failure.In the midst of the current disputes, some might question that feeling, but Jetten was insistent.We have, he reminded us, been an integral part of that EU family for  years, a relationship built on international pain and British resolution.Yes, the Dutch too pin the need for the EU on our joint experiences in the first half of the th century and especially: “... Britain’s heroic stand in  and .”“It was,” he said, “in Britain that our Government and resistance movement sought and found refuge. There are few Dutch cities and towns which do not enshrine memories of British bravery.”And, talking about more recent times, he described “Britain’s cultural magnetism” as collapsing an already minimal distance between our countries.There is also a recognition on the continent that the EU has to move forward. Reform itself. Improve.: Nicola Sturgeon: Brexit makes Scottish independence ‘inevitable’All of that is why, according to Jetten, there is apparently, a widespread hope in EU capitals that we will somehow grasp the opportunity to escape Brexit and , somehow, to our family.It’s a hope that was reflected this weekend in the descent of countless thousands of Britons on London to call for a People’s Vote, a chance to say whether the product of this Tory-induced debacle is what anyone, both remain or leave supporter, actually wants.I’m as aware as anyone that we still do not know what that final end product will look like. Ridiculous isn’t it  We are more than two years on from the vote, already passed the point at which we had been told it would all be settled and signed, but still completely in the darkness about our nation’s, our children’s, our own future.It’s time for ministers to knuckle down and get some answers.But whatever happens,a deal is reached or not, they must remember that democracy did not end on  June . And increasingly, as the weekend showed, the public are the ones shouting loudest for that final say. A vote on the deal itself.But how does that fit with Jetten’s recounting of the tale of the Prodigal Son In the story, we are told of a man with two sons. One day the younger son suddenly demands his share of the estate, walks away from home and squanders his wealth in wild living. After a while, dejected by the failure of his adventure, he decides tohome.His father is beside himself with joy and prepares a feast. The other brother, who had stayed behind loyally working the fields, turns angry.

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time.

The - scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.Molloy’s introduction  minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubtanyone  in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.But the damage had been done in the first half – at - down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.Some have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.I felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.Two years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a - defeat in Kirkwall.There is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s th birthday.It’s just a pity we have to wait a whole  months until a chance of revenge.: : : : : : : :A couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.There are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.A score of - was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.The Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.A few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.I would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.: : : : : : : :Orkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening#s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John CouttsThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over  guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.Unfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.The speeches which followed,anyone could hear what was being said, were on the y side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.It was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.Sinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous  game when he hit the back of the net five times in the - victory.: : : : : : : :And finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.On Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.Helped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.Robert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did -odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.The others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.The final score was a - win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate - football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"big turnout to welcome the eighth serene to whalsay ","story":"The latest Serene arrives at the pier at Symbister.

Given these turbines will be placed on high ground, to suggest they will dominate the landscape is an understatement # just what the tourists come to Shetland to see.As long as they#re not in Bressay or Sandness.Only one and a half times the size of big ben# just little things# pfffffff.Absolutely ridiculous!I’ve seen wind turbines with these extra large blades between Stirling and Edinburgh. They are enormous and look awful.Worth recalling that the perceived size of the blade sweepincreases as the square of the radiuse.g. increasing the bladeby . times doubles the perceived size of the blade sweep, or, increasing bladeby % increases perceived size by %John, the longer blades will increase the electrical power that each turbine can generate, giving VE more revenue.That’s as may be, but revenue does not equal profit, and by the time the unsustainable level of subsidy has been removed, the SCT have been suckered in to paying for the export cable, and SSE have ensured their pound of flesh is as great as they can get away with,Shetland will never see its money back.More of nothing is still only nothing.If they are increasing the height of the turbines,does this mean that they would need to increase the size and depth of the anchor points at what extra cost and who will pay Presumably, these are the latest models with towers and foundations redesigned, accordingly The changes should improve cost-effectiveness and presumably, VE’s intention is to improve competitiveness for the auction, which requires cutting costs to the bone and squeezing every last drop of revenue from the project to keep it viable.Given that the last round of auctions produced winning ‘strike prices’ of £. MWh, exactly half what VE insisted they needed for viability , it makes you wonder, would winning an auction capture their fabled “pot of gold at Rainbow’s End” or would it be merely a poisoned chalice that provides little or no# or worse# William, the size and cost of the foundations must be increased to accommodate more powerful wind turbines.Larger Turbines require loads more concrete poured into the blanket bog all previous calculations EIA are out the window.If turbine technology has #advanced considerably# why can#t they make them smaller, considerably The “technology advance” is to produce turbines with increased electrical capacity, requiring longer blades and larger fondations. The thought is that one MW turbine will cost less to install, own, and maintain than two MW turbines.Mr Innes, Project Director for Viking Energy, is quoted where as saying #Viking is now competing against a new generation of wind farms, including those offshore, where tip heights of m or more are now available.#In that case why doesn#t he just put these turbines offshore as well.Kay. Just a thought.Aircraft technology has advanced too and ‘planes get bigger and bigger. I suspect that miniaturisation , so beloved of the Japanese, whose watches, cameras , radios and a host of other products lead one to believe that for items to improve in performance , they need to get smaller. True in many instances but not all. That said, Japanese wind driven turbines might solve a few problems.A point of interest regarding Japan andCO free energy . Japan is planning on using nuclear, not wind power, as a major source of electricity production. One may understand that Japan has greater first-hand knowledge of nuclear atomic contamination than any other country on Earth having being subjected two atomic bombs and the Fukushima accident. Using that real information on real nuclear contamination, not the Green lunacy crank disinformation, so prevalent in Scotland. Japan has a knowledge-led, intelligent energy policy. As ofMay , there are  operable reactors in Japan. Of these, nine reactors in  power plants Additionally, five reactors have been approved for a start, and further  have start applications under review. It never ceases to amaze me how ignorance and fear shape energy policy. Japan is fully aware of the risks of nuclear I reference “the Liberal Democratic Party cabinet in April , calls nuclear power #the country#s most important power source#.[Japan is now aiming for #a realistic and balanced energy structure#. The Japanese Government targets for wind power deployment are set at only .% of electricity production by  . That is a total figure, onshore and offshore.What a huge shame The Scottish Government is unwilling to do the same, it would save our countryside from so much uglly devastation. Why #..Well you don`t need a rocket scientist to figure that one out.Ifthis horrendous project does go ahead it`ll be past its sell by the time it is finished and will be made obsolete by newer, more efficient and cleaner technology.When is the plug going to be pulled on this nonsense before any more money is lost to it If Viking want to increase the turbine size, it is not unreasonable to anticipate that the other windfarm developers will do the same.The floodgates are being opened and, instead of being a world-class destination for wildle  scenery, Shetland will become a world-class example of crass development without regard to the obvious damage to environment, health and wellbeing, not to mention income from tourism.Renewable energy should be pursued, but in Shetland’s case the cost of the VE project has already been far higher – in every sense – than the imagined benefits.I maybe wrong, but wind farm technology appears to be the cheapest form of producing electricityin regard to other alternative sources of producing electricity.I am pretty sure wave and tidal energy could also be tapped into within Shetland, but economics seem to be based on the cheapest alternative compared to wave or tidal resources being the better, possibly, and signicantly less intrusive than the massive wind turbines scaring the Shetland landscape and more than likely tourists remembering the islands not for its beauty but#.well, it is self explanatory.The potential economic damage caused by the wind turbines I am pretty sure would outweigh any positive contribution the islands may have in regard to tourism or other positive attributes the islands may have.Time, no doubt, will be the final answer#.. watch this space, as they say.David. Just to be a bit more optimistic about wind farms , there is every likelihood that visitors to Shetland will already be familiar with rotating blades .It is a fast growing energy generation procedure so would not come as a shock.The other thing is ,such equipment would almost certainly not be visible from all corners of Shetland.People would get used to them just as they are used to the island hopping planes.It’s a bit unfortunate that severe condemnation is a reactionto newish ideas and inventions.I take onboard your points, Haydn, but I think what is putting people off the VEP, is the shear cost of what it could possibly be. I have heard a figure not far short of kicking on the door of £. Billion, and possibly more, and how many decades would this take to bring VEP into the black in terms of revenue One should also look into the potential running and maintenance costs per year for such a project  Would the revenue created be enough to off-set such costs or would VE require more funding from the SCT, to balance its books It seems very evident, the more information people in Shetland know about VEP, the more people are put off the whole idea in terms of economics and what little benefit the islands may reap from it  I have heard a figure of around £ million a year###.poor investmentthe projected costs are to be believed. Aof around. of % does not bode well.I have to take issue with you here Haydn, The proposed VE turbines will now be meres high and constructed on hills. The high point some meters plus above sea level. That would be the line of sight from sea level of about  miles. Precious little of Shetland would not see the VE turbines!! I note you claim #that severe condemnation is a reactionto newish ideas and inventions#. I would respectfully point out wind turbines are hardly a new idea! Many consider them at the point of being an obsolete technologyNow for cutting-edge ideas, look to tidal generation and modular nuclear reactors. The latter , I believe you are openly condemning, something about us all glowing in the dark was your comment!!! Now that was Scaremongering nonsense. Rosatom,Russias vehicle for nuclear expansion,has about % of new nuclear plant contracts in the bag,mainly in emerging and third world countries .If Chernobyl is anything to go by and what Russia the culprit did in rectyingthe mess,novichok is going to be a piddle in the ocean in comparison.Read an article this morning.Wish I could remember which paper that said Germany#s  year old wind turbines are coming to the end of their usefulness and no longer qualy for subsidies. No recycling as the blades are made from fibre glass.Their plan is to dump them on third world nations so creating more waste rather than cleaning the mess up themselves. Viking energy should sit up and take not it but will have cloth ears when it comes to profit. Remember, as you sow,so shall ye reap.Germany, by nature of its fragmented political system with government by weak coalitions only resulted in the Green Partyexercising much influence beyond their electoral mandate. Nuclear power was cut back as a political gesture to the Greens, that had nothing to do with the science of the matter. The result was a massive increase in coal-fired electrical generation and also the importation of Natural Gas. Germany is now the worlds largest importer of Natural Gas! and the German motor industries disingenuous diesel emission data is almost legendary!!!.Deaths from atmospheric pollution in Germany are massive and this year the EU is taking Germany to court for breaking all EU guidelines. It is indeed very ironic that the Scotish Government does so much to praise the use of Wind power and exploit all its rural communities to that end while it does all in its ability to expandGas Exportation from the North Sea,. It likewise imports Gasto Grangemouth and at all times try and use North Sea oil revenue to promote Nationalist agendas. The logic escapes me, perhaps you could explain Grahm,!!!Billy , I understand where you are coming from when stating that  year old turbines in Germany are coming to the end of their lives , but is this surprising   Since technological advances in vast areas of activity are so rapid it would be most unlikely for things to suddenly stand still.Try selling a  year old car , TV. washing machine ,vacuum cleaner , racing bike etc etc. Virtually worthless . Fighter ‘planes cost £millions EACH so should we have stuck with the Tiger Moth to save money   Times change continuously.No doubt some would like the world to stop to enable them to get off so that they could abandon their mortgage and live in a cave in a cosy corner of the Moon. All very whimsical but I’m sure you get the drt.Interesting comment Haydn. I am unable to find any substantive advance in Wind Turbines as technology over the last  years. They are larger yes, but no less polluting and even more damaging to the environment. The most recent research would indicate that disturbance in airflow patterns and friction around the rotating blades not only creates more noise pollution but results in substantive heat creation. That heat creation in itself would and does contribute to global warming new research has shown. Reference #Hard University’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences# would indicate wind power in theU.S. with wind alone would warm the planet a quarter-degree Celsius! If this research is proved correct, we will be decommissioning and scrapping wind turbines far sooner than the protagonist advocate. There are already far better ways of generating clean electricity than  meter high turbines, sadly too many have staked their reputations on the wind myth and will resist accepting they have been wrongFair enough Ian. I must confess that I was unaware of the likely height of the proposed turbine blades.I’m not so sure about Japan and others having a reducing intention to set up more turbines though. As for the comment I made about nuclear radiation causing people to glow in the dark —— you surely cannot be serious !!!!That was no more than a figure of speech.I hope you are merely poking fun at such a prospect.I know that glow worms emit light as do other creatures in the sea but it’s silly to think that the effects on iniduals who have been subjected to radiation for medical reasons would then walk about looking like Beacons.Give me a break Ian!Ian.—- Your comments on October th at -.Plenty of food for thought in your missive .Thanks.It is a balance between providing energy safely and economically, but our conventional methods of using fossil fuels has brought to the fore due to the impact such energy has had on the environment.However, whilst we are being side-tracked about the impact of fossil fuels, nobody has every mentioned the impact on the planet caused by agriculture. Agriculture, I believe, causes  times more green house gases than all of transportation put together Not only does agriculture produce more green houses gases than transportation, it is the greatest cause of environmental destruction than any other industry. As our population grows, this will become more evident, as we see species upon species being put on the # endangered species list # or # become extinct #. This man-made catastrophe will impact on other species and it will eventually impact the very existence of humans on the planet as nature takes revenge through disease, drought and other natural impacts.Progress in providing alternative energy may be a positive start, but at what price will this be to the planet and le,this progress is purely based on the man-made concept of monetary value and this of profit David Spence, the single most signicant threats to humanity are overpopulation and our leaders, scientic, religious and political leader#s, utter cowardice to dare to mention such an undeniable fact. World population is set to double in  years. Energy needs, food supply, pollution are all driven by human population density. It makes no odds how many windmills we build whatever their size! Atmospheric pollution, global warming or starvation awaits and will kill all our children#s children as long as human overbreeding continues. It is hard to take the Greens cranks, politicians and doom-mongers of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change seriously when their reports fail to state, or take into account the blindingly obvious.David. Your warning shots make me feel that I should grabfew bottles of whisky 🥃 go back to bed and snooze my way through the day even though there’s a hot Indian summer outside.!!Seriously , weare facing a dire situation which will impact on my grandsons far more than on me —— or you. When you say ‘Agriculture’ I’m assuming that you are including livestock.The greenhouse gas emissions from the planet’s animal le must be enormous and that’s whether or not they are raised for their meat .Also, to take your point, such vast amounts of money are tied into food production , it’s hard to seeany measures at all, however well intentioned, , will enable us to eradicate the decline of le in its widest sense.Time to grab that whisky bottle I think 🤔. Cheers.Is there going to be a remake of #Dad#s Army#  Only, a number of contributors seem to be vying for the part of Private Fraser: #Wur do-oO-MM-ED!# LOL 🙂# You stupid Boy, Pike##.sorry, John # lolI take your points Haydn and Ian, but according to predicted human population expansion, it is estimated the global population will be around  billion by the year  Other dynamics affecting population growth, as you know, is requiring more land not only for agriculture but for accommodation and expanded space for for other amenities related.Not doubt, I think, there may come a critical point where demand for the expansion of the population, not including technological advancement, will determine how we live and finding a balance between our own demands to this of the natural world and other le The driving force for this expansion is predominantly based on economics and technological advances, and as long as this is the precedent, this could bring into conflict what we want and what nature will will allow In the food chain, I suspect we will become more use to # processed food # as technological progress will find better ways of growing alternative foods, whether biologically or chemically, as an answer to keep a balance between our demands and this of a coexisting relationship with the natural laws which govern le itself, including humans.You are quite right John, there are people who seem to be dominating these columns and I fear that I am a guilty one —— as well as the others.Perhaps I should take a break and ease off.The trouble is, there are interesting and important problems out there which should be aired rather than be allowed to fester.Maybe a bit more humour would help to make the rough stuff a little more palatable.So, step forward anyone of a Dad’s Army disposition !! How about you John  Sadly my sense of humour is a little lacking here! £ million plus SCT funds gone.  meter high windmills on s of tons of concrete bases all over Shetland. All of this for what  The delusional idea that such a project will save the planet. VE is and always has been a money making project under the guise of the #Green Idyle#. The advocates being the usual shetland suspects, utterly unqualied in scientic justication and reason, highly qualied in political posturing and self-interest. No, there is nothing here of humour. I do believe we are rapidly destroying our planet bitthe findings of# The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change# are valid, windmills on Shetland are an irrelevancy, which will only increase our problems. Their construction will release vast quantities of CO their verywill warm the air around them. It goes a bit beyond Dad,s Army humour, about as funny as Donald Trump#s program of clean coal, Scotland importing fracked gas from the USA and Shetland shipping in wood for burning by deforesting Canada and Eastern Europe!!! It is long past a laughing matter. It is just Green idiocy at its most typical.Ian,I assume you mean “s of tonnes of concrete” per turbine base  Given that a single, typical .MW turbine needs over a thousand tonnes of steel-reinforced concrete , then VE turbines, whose blades will sweep  times the area , at . times the height, must surely need bases several times bigger than that # perhaps, - tonnes, each The accompanying destruction of the land these machines are sited on is also alarming # here is a quote from the link, again, for the small, .MW machine: Given the limited cerebral ability of most politicians this obviously did not prove too dficult LOL!Humour is a coping mechanism.If you can laugh 😆 in the face of adversity you become bullet proof. Only the brave and stoical can achieve that. Dwelling on negatives perpetuates negativity. Goodness knows, there are ample supplies of that in these columns.£ million plus SCT funds have not “gone” Ian. Money does not simply disappear. Whatever the total sum, a decent chunk will of course have found its way into the pay packet pockets of some of those with most to gain from the project. However, so long as the cash gets into the hands of the worthist members of the local community, deserving entrepreneurs intent on bettering their community, who could possibly disagree  Try to be more charitable Ian.If there was anything whfy about all this Tavish Scott would have long since ensured it was properly addressed. Just look how fearlessly he locked horns with the powerful vested interests south who were forever conspiring to keep Shetland in its box. Tavish has already clearly stated he is in favour of democratic reform of SCT, just notit requires him to stand up against anyone local.You`re right there Peter, the money hasn`t just gone it`s been squandered!Squandered or plundered John  Aren’t the controls on the access to Shetland’s charitable funds so weak that any dedicated self serving group with a plausible plan could arrange over time to help themselves  Viking by name#We’ve got to get away from the notion that the funds exist to secure Shetland’s economic future. They exist to ameliorate social disruption resulting from the oil era. Vast infrastructure projects in remote rural communities bring almost random redistributions in wealth and opportunity, drug dependency and a iety of other associated complex social issues and harms. Where is Shetland’s voluntary sector represented on SCT  It ain’t, and it runs scared of complaining.These unguarded funds have weakened and distracted local politics in Shetland. No one group is sufficiently powerful to say enough is enough. Where is the voice of those at the margins  Who speaks up for those in greatest need  The oil industry has washed it’s hands long since.

The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"whalsays new research arrives in lerwick for first time ","story":"The Research leaves Symbister with bunting flying as she heads for Lerwick on Saturday.

A lot of visitor experiences are going to be marred.\"Adam Gough, CairnGorm Mountain representative, who had told of the need for the slopes aimed at beginners and intermediates, was clearly stunned by the rejection.Asked immediately after the decisionan appeal was likely, he said that a statement would be issued later.CNPA head planner Gavin Miles had stressed from the outset the application had to be determined on planning issues ndash landscaping impacts in particular ndash and not on its commercial merits, which had generated much argument.He said the business case was a matter for Natural Retreats.Mr Miles told the committee the articial slope would not extend the ski area in any signicant way but the footprint of obvious development would increase.He commented: \"Initially the team were very concerned about the landscaping but as more information was given to us by the applicants it was considered that in the long term planting would mitigate against that.

This site was the most sheltered for the ski slope and close to other facilities without impacting on other slopes, he said. It could also be used for tubing and other activities.Mr Gough acknowledged the clamour for better ski uplt at CairnGorm which has been overtaken as Scotlands most popular ski resort.He said: \"We would like nothing more than to be able to upgrade ski infrastructure to improve the snowsports experience for everyone but this has to be a long term process built on solid commercial foundations.\"He said the slope could be in operation for  per cent of the year outwith winter and ice would not be a problem as it was easy practice to break it up.ABA secretary Alan Brattey said history showed articial slopes at Scottish resorts including the Lecht, Glenshee and Glencoe had not worked.He also said a bright green Snowflex slope would stand out like a sore thumb and no consideration had been given by the operator to an alternative by market leader, Neveplast, which could be camouflaged.He said that of just over  votes on Facebook on the application,  per cent were against it.Tessa Jones, of the Badenoch and Strathspey Conservation Group, asked the committee: \"What are you going to say to the world about this peatland destruction \"Committee member Dave Fallows moved the application be refused and he was seconded by Carolyn Caddick.He said he appreciated the efforts to mitigate against the ski slope but said: \"It cant possibly soften in the long term the impact that this makes on the area.\"Mrs Caddick said: \"We are going to see it for miles and miles around.\"Peter Argyle had moved in favour of the application saying he had faith in the planning officers conditions but was not supported.Mr Brattey said after the vote: \"This was very much the right decision and wed like to congratulate the planning committee for deciding to reject this planning application against the advice of their planning officials.\"We very much hope that common sense will now prevail and that the plans for the Ptarmigan Building will be dropped.\"We are left to wonder just exactly why HIE allowed their tenant to take such a madcap plan all the way to the CNPAs planning committee who were very decisive in their rejection of it.\"He said HIE should ert the pound million to new uplt. \"The hill business requires to be funicular proofed as soon as possible,\" said Mr Brattey.Monday  Oct  : PM"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118063.jpg","title":"Green light for Dalwhinnie quarry work","story":"Gavin MusgroveA quarry operator has said that measures are in place to allay concerns that their excavation plans could lead to a surge in speeding lorries in a Badenoch village.Leithshas been given the green light by the Cairngorms National Park Authorityrsquos planning committee to recommence operations at the site at Carn Dhomhnuill Bhain on the doorstep of Dalwhinnie.The company has said that it is not contingent on winning a contract to supply aggregate to the dualling of the A but that the produce will be used for housebuilding and other local construction projects.The firm was granted temporary permission for  yearsatthe CNPArsquoslatest planning committee meeting at Boat of Garten Community Hall.Production will be stepped up dramatically at the quarry around one mile north of Dalwhinnie by the A.It was previously in operation up to .But now Leiths has permission to extend the site from two to  hectares.

Mr Howell said that Transport Scotland and Transport Minister Michael Matheson are considering this.A spokesman for Transport Scotland said Scotrail are looking at the proposal, which will have to be approved by the Mr Matheson. to facilitate the essential works on the Council’s A road.“We appreciate that, notwithstanding this cooperation, there is disruption for road uses during the passage of the normal train service. We have asked colleagues in the ScotRail Alliance to considerthere are any practical options further to minimise disruption to road users during the road works whilst still maintaining services upon which rail passengers depend.”Skye and Lochalsh MP Ian Blackford supported the introduction to the buses from Strathcarron.He added: “Network Rail seem to be sticking their fingers in their ears over this. A number of mistakes from both the rail company and Highland Council have led to the situation that we are in now and have been for some time.”“Network Rail must stop some of the trains coming from Inverness at Strathcarron and then arrange a bus service going onto Stromeferry. That would alleviate the ridiculous waiting times that passengers travelling by road are experiencing.”“The current way of working has caused no end of problems. We have kids being stranded on buses for hours and cues over  cars deep in both directions. To be fair the council at least seem willing to listen. We now need to get all parties round the table and hammer out a plan on this as quickly as possible, the current situation cannot continue.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/p1-2423-cropped.jpg","title":"raasay shop offers delivery service amid stormy","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineA local store on Raasay is offering to deliver essentials to those who can#t access the shop due to weather conditions on the island.Following the . am crossing to Sconser on Friday morning , CalMac announced that it had suspended all sailings between Raasay and Skye due to the conditions.

Importantly that means that visitors will be travelling through the Sleat peninsula, where communities have worked long and hard to build up a viable industry.“In the midst of the important debates about ferries and not least the importance of the MV Coruisk to the Armadale-Mallaig crossing, it’s important to celebrate the huge contribution that RET has made to the island economies.”If CalMac#s league tables of ferry route usage tell us anything, it is that moving the MV #Coruisk# from its purpose-built harbours on the busiest crossing in the north-west remains inexplicable.If the two tables of passengers and coaches highlight anything , it is that CalMac badly needs its two new ferries from the Clyde to be delivered according to their revised schedule and not experience a third delay.It is a mild surprise, as Kate Forbes MSP says, to discover that more people sail between Mallaig and Armadale in Skye than between Stornoway and Ullapool and that more coaches cross the Sound of Sleat than make any other journey on CalMac#s itinerary.It is good news not only for Sleat but for the whole of the island. It is good news which is tempered by the fact that this busy, bustling route is now served only by whatever ships CalMac can spare, when the tide permits them, while its purpose-built vessel, the MV #Coruisk#, which can dock at Armadale in all tidal conditions, is ploughing between Mull and Oban  nautical miles away.If CalMac had the ships, Mallaig Armadale would be dependable and therefore even busier, Mull would have a vessel of its own and almost everybody would be happy.CalMac do not have the ships in large part because two new deep-sea vessels which were commissioned in  from Ferguson Marine Engineering at Port Glasgow show no sign of turning up for duty.One of them is due to operate on CalMac#s busiest passenger route between Ardrossan and Arran. The other is to work between Uig, Tarbert and Lochmaddy, which last year carried almost , people.The delivery date for those two ships has been put back twice. On each occasion, the £ million contract to Ferguson Marine — which is the property of one of the Scottish Government#s friends, advisors and allies, the billionaire tax exile Jim McColl — was topped up by a multi-million-pound handout from the public purse.If all was on schedule at least one of those ships would now be in service, and CalMac would have substantially more leeway in manoeuvring its fleet from one part of the west coast to another. They might even be able to keep the #Coruisk# on the Sound of Sleat.They are very far from on schedule. The new Ardrossan Arran ferry is now supposed to be delivered next summer, and the new Uig Tarbert Lochmaddy ship in spring .Will they be delivered  Or will we experience a third delay, which would certainly plunge CalMac into even greater chaos as its ageing fleet breaks down or requires routine maintenance somewhere in the Baltic Those are important questions. As we reported last week, the chief executive of Outer Hebrides Tourism, Rob MacKinnon, has criticised the Scottish Government for a lack of any #tangible action# to address the islands# ferry problems.The Scottish transport ministry, said Mr MacKinnon, must #pursue all feasible options to increase ferry capacity in both the long and the short term for the benefit of both visitors and islanders#.As we report this week, Labour#s Western Isles# candidate Alison MacCorquodale has added her voice to the many demanding to know the precise terms of the private finance initiative deal which has bound the Scottish Government into using just one ferry for all passengers and freight between Ullapool and Stornoway, with unacceptable consequences.Ullapool Stornoway may not yet carry as many tourists as Mallaig Armadale. But it is the definition of a leline service, with , passengers last year, many of whom found themselves unable to squeeze onto an overbooked #Loch Seaforth#.We should be told how and why one of our biggest and most important ferries came to be owned by Lloyds Bank.We should be toldJim McColl is going to deliver two badly-needed ships at the third time of asking.It is not enough to say, as does transport minister Michael Matheson, that building CalMac#s ferries is #providing vital support to our shipbuilding industry#The way things are going, building and rebuilding CalMac#s ferries will keep Scottish shipbuilding alive well into the next decade. Their higher purpose, and Mr Matheson#s job is to provide vital support to the Hebridean ferry service.

Published by LilliputPress, Dublin. Price hardback €. Like Fenianism itself, this book hadmodest beginnings but grew to cover all of Ireland, a good part ofthe globe and half a century. Eva Ó Cathaoir began a study ofFenians in Tipperary which has evolved into one of the mostcomprehensive and important scholarly works on the Irish RepublicanBrotherhood yet published. If the film ‘Black ’ is a storyof revenge set during the Great Hunger, the phenomenon of Fenianismarose to a great extent as a political response to that colossalcrime against the Irish people by the landlord system and the Britishregime. But there was far more involved than simple vengeance.Fenianism was a democratic movement, consciously in the tradition ofthe United Irish leaders of the s, and rejecting privilege andclass distinction. In  the IRB staged the funeral of TerenceBellew McManus and brought many thousands of people onto the streets.The working-class character of the movement was clear from thisdemonstration and the author quotes the following from the haughtysnobs of the ‘KilkennyModerator’, lamenting the absence of the‘great and the good’ from the procession:“When we look back to the O’Connellgatherings or even the Young Ireland ‘Confederation’ assemblies,and remember the array of names, of borough magistrates, professionalmen and traders, accustomed to put forward as representing Kilkennyon such occasions, we cannot but view in the most ludicrous light,this miserable farce of an ‘imposing demonstration.’” The recent visit of the Pope reviveddebate among Irish republicans about the role of the Roman CatholicChurch in Irish politics. This book shows again that, with very fewexceptions, the hierarchy abhorred the IRB for its democratic andrepublican principles and the ‘princes of the Church’ fearedFenian inculcation of their ‘flocks’ with a sense ofindependence, no longer reliant on clerical and aristocratic leadersto guide them. Such guidance had led to catastrophe during the GreatHunger as the passivity preached by Daniel O’Connell and thebishops facilitated the peaceful passage of food out of a starvingcountry.Students of Irish history will befamiliar with the story of the Fenian leadership on both sides of theAtlantic, abortive rebellion and invasion, the internecine disputesand personality clashes. This book recounts all that but it goes muchdeeper. For example it tells of the Fenian women, whose storiessurely need to be rediscovered. They were treated as subordinates bymost of their male comrades but many played important roles. It was atime of deep chauvinism with even otherwise progressive Fenians suchas John Boyle O’Reilly opposing votes for women. The book covers all aspects ofFenianism and a great part of its value is in its first Appendix‘Biographies of Munster and Kilkenny Fenians’ which providesbrief profiles of , rank and file Fenians. I have never beforeseen any ‘Roll of Honour’ of the IRB but this is now providedwith a list of ‘Fenian Casualties -’ while the book closes,appropriately, with a list of Fenian monuments in Ireland andManchester. This is a beautully produced book anda credit to the publishers Lilliput Press and of course to theauthor.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27481  ","story":"• Mícheál Mac Donncha and Robert Ballagh Mícheál Mac Donnchaby Robert Ballagh published by Head of Zeus. back in the late s. For anartist of his stature this was courageous, dependent as he was, tosome extent, on commissions from people who, to say the least, wouldnot be subscribers to our paper. But this was an artist who went hisown way in art and who acted as a citizen with a conscience in anIreland where State-imposed censorship distorted not only politicaldebate but also national self-image. For Robert Ballaghcreative work and active citizenship have gone hand in hand all hisle. This is depicted in his double self-portrait ‘Upstairs No.’,one of the many illustrations of his work in this superbly writtenand beautully presented book. It is not a standard autobiographywith chapters set out in chronological order beginning with genealogyand ending with this week’s news. As you would expect from Ballagh,he takes a dferent approach, starting towards the later years andcircling through his days in no particular order before coming backto the present. More than that, he weaves narrative, anecdote andreflection together seamlessly and conversationally showing a skillwith words akin to his skill with brushes. He has a story to tell ofa very ied le, from his unusual family background to his time asa showband guitar player, through his unorthodox beginning as apainter and his development as an artist and an activist. Withfrankness and clarity he tells us how he learned and matured as anartist and his brief commentaries on many of his works areilluminating both of how they were made and the concepts behind them.It makes the reader want to look again and more intensely at thepictures. The Prologue isessentially a dedication to Robert’s late we Betty, his lelonginspiration, mentor and most important critic. The first chaptertells the harrowing story of how Betty, in her serious illness, wasdisgracefully let down by a healthcare system which basically allowedher to die through neglect, as was admitted in legal proceedings. Butthis does not cast a shadow over the book, as her positive presenceis felt throughout, and is celebrated by the author. These days I rarely getthat urge immediately to re-read a book when I reach the end, but Idid with this one. Thankfully the chapters are so well defined thatthey can be read as stand-alone essays or stories. Take just twoexamples: ‘Who Fears to Speak ofEaster Week’ recounts the tremendous people’s commemoration ofthe  Centenary in which Robert played a central part, aculmination of his activism which has included campaigning againstapartheid, for the Birmingham Six, for artists’ rights, with theIrish National Congress opening border roads, in solidarity withPalestine and as an enthusiastic participant in Féile an Pobail inWest Belfast from its commencement.‘Dining at McDonald’s’is a brilliant critique of the dominant and stultying modernistideology and practise in art and an appeal for an opening up. Ballaghattacks “the notion that the artists’ choice imbues a givenobject with special properties which are tantamount to a metaphysicaltransformation of the object that it ceases to be a pedestrianartefactand becomes,by virtue of the artist’s choice, art”. This ideology leads tothe absurdity of much of the ‘installation’ stuff in galleriesthat baffles all but elitist insiders and, as Ballagh recounts, theclaim by loyalist killer Michael Stone that his attack on Stormontwas a piece of performance art. He argues that the bureaucracies mustset aside this ideology and make galleries more open and democratic .For these views and forhis artistic method and, among some I suspect, for his politics,Ballagh has been frowned upon by certain elites. One prominent figurein the Irish art world said of him with dripping condescension thathe is “not a real artist, he is a mere illustrator”. Typically,Ballagh responded with humour and defiance in a self-portrait wearinga t-shirt saying ‘Fuck the Begrudgers’. I cannot recommend thisbook highly enough. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27482  ","story":"Pearse Doherty: The Interview  Ruairí Doyle“Society is organised in the wrong way - we should not have a housing crisis - what is happening with our children in emergency accommodation is immoral. It is a scandal that we will look back at in twenty years with shame.” - Pearse Doherty TDSinn Féin TD and Finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty has spoken of his origins, his le and how they influence and inform both his political ideology in an extended online interview. He also outlined his vison for a New Ireland that provides achance for people to live, to work and to raise their families without thechronic levels of deprivation and inequality facing so many today. Speaking ahead of Sinn Féin’s Alternative Budget launch nextweek Deputy Doherty laid out his party’s vision “for a new economy for a NewIreland”.The Donegal TD was born in Glasgow and lived with hisparents and five siblings in a one-bedroom flat in Ibrox before the familyed home to Gweedore in Donegal in the ’s. This informed his belief that no matter when someone leftIreland, evenit were  or  years ago, they still have a great sense ofbelonging, of that tangible bond with home “that’s home - you know - Níl aontinteán mar do thinteán féin - that’s their home”, commented Teachta Doherty.Pearse, who has been a TD since , talked about his drivehome when the Dáil wraps up at the week’s end, crossing the border twice on hisway up the winding road to Donegal to his we and four boys. He also gave aninsight into the dficulty of the balance between work and home le, and theunique challenges of being a public representative. The Gaoth Dobhair resident added that it is not solely challengesthat come with being a Teachta Dala. He said: “It is what shapes you and your values. It’s yourexperience - it’s your past experience - it’s your family experience and it’swhat shapes you in Irish society, the people that are around you. The peoplewho influence you and that help shape you and that’s the values that I bring tomy job today as Finance spokesperson for the lead opposition party. It’s thevalues I will bring to the job as Minister for Finance,I am in thatposition.”Sinn Féin regularly faces accusations of employing “fairy-taleeconomics” or “economic illiteracy”.Pearse dismisses these comments as cheap throw-away remarks,designed to stunt political debate. This is a debate that Pearse opines that the establishmentparties do not want because “any fair minded person would see clearly thatthere is a need to build houses, to bring our children out of emergencyaccommodation instead of cutting taxes for the wealthiest in society.”He continued: “Where despite the fact that the three main banks aremaking €. billion in profits every year, they don’t pay any Corporation Taxand some of them won’t pay for the next twenty years.  That’s the debate they don’t want to have.”As Pearse puts it, the Budget is not just about numbers -it’s about our values and ensuring we create a new economy with strong publicservices and shared prosperity where no one is left behind and no child goeswithout.Deputy Doherty said: “Society is organised in the wrong way. We shouldnot have a housing crisis. What is happening with our children in emergencyaccommodation is immoral and it is a scandal that we will look back at intwenty years with shame.  “What is happening in our hospitals is outrageous, in a country thathas the wealth that it does.  “It is just not shared properly and it is not allocated properly andthat isn’t the fault of citizens. That is fault of politicians that decided onBudget day that the resources created by the Irish people are going to beallocated in this way.”Touching on the spectre of Brexit, as a TD for a borderconstituency, Pearse argues that the North of Ireland remaining in the EU andgiven a Special Designated status is the only way to protect people on bothsides, particularly Donegal which is isolated from the rest of the  Counties.Pearse also remarks that “the debate about Irish Unity needs to go toanother level”. He continued: “We are moving, in my view, to a position where we willhave a border poll. Where a majority of people will vote for Irish unity.  “And that will come about because of demographic changes. It will comeabout because Sinn Féin is agitating for it, and other people are recognisingthat it is in their interests that we have an end to the Irish border.”Sinn Féin is not interested in maintaining the status quoand not content to merely “tinker along the edges - where you might get anincrease in public services, an extra few gardaí, an extra few public sectorworkers, a little tax cut here” Pearse Doherty said. This Budget, and every Sinn Féin Budget, would be about our vision fora new Ireland and that vision of an equal and fair society.

However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.- Mary Lou McDonaldDUP Leader Arlene Foster has called for fundamental changeto the Good Friday Agreement to facilitate Brexit. In other words an agreement endorsed by the majority of people north and south must make way for Brexit, a proposition rejected by a majority in the north. The latest position of the DUP leader lays bare the root of thecrisis in the north. Remember, the DUP opposed the Good Friday Agreement, campaigned for a No vote in that historic referendum and they continue to oppose the Agreement. An Agreement that has underpinned peace for over two decades.They oppose the all Ireland nature of the Agreement, they oppose the rights and safeguards of the agreement and they oppose power-sharing.   to be in them.” The institutions in the north could no-longer bear the weight of this contradiction and collapsed. This was brought to ahead by the continual refusal to implement agreements, opposition to marriage equality, rights to an inquest, an Irish language Act and the financial scandal that is the RHI Cash for Ash scheme.Add to the mix a British Government that has no understanding of Ireland, our economy or our agreements. The Tories are at war with themselves over Brexit and seem intent to bring their own country down with them. This same Tory Government entered into a toxic deal with the DUP to stay in power. That is why there are no institutions in the north, and why the DUP leadership walked away from the deal they had made with Sinn Féin in February this year to get the Assembly up and running.These latest comments by Arlene Foster are a desperate throw of the dice by an increasingly marginalised Unionist leadership. The deal with the Tories will end. Its only legacy will be Brexit. Meanwhile Ireland north and south is changing and a New Ireland is emerging. The joyous revolution of Marriage Equality and Repeal of the Eighth has resonated with a new generation in the north. The largest political demonstration in Belfast is Pride. A magnicent event that celebrates the ersity of identities that make up our communities.Similarly there is a growing demand for access to abortion services. As a placard proudly announced in Dublin Castle when the Repeal result came through, “The North is Next”.Brexit has also unied those who voted to remain within the EU. Brexit will be a disaster for the economy in the north, particularly for agriculture. A community that values prosperity and access to the EU is looking beyond Brexit and Westminster and instead towards Irish Unity. We are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.As for Arlene Foster and the DUP - the game is up. If their leadership want the institutions in the north up and working then they must support real power sharing, respect, equality and the rights of others. When this happens Sinn Féin will be a willing partner. Now is the time for political courage, to look forward in the interests of all communities. Meanwhile the debate on Irish unity and a unity referendum grows. I am confident that we can build a New United Ireland, a home for all that share this island. That is the big challenge for our generation. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27484  ","story":"• RUC unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons Mícheál Mac DonnchaCivil Rights campaigners in Derry had been pressing for a march in their city which had long been a byword for unionist sectarianism and discrimination.Using gerrymandered electoral boundaries and a corrupt voting system which allowed wealthier citizens to have multiple votes in local elections, the unionists maintained a majority of members on the council in a city with a nationalist majority.Nationalists lived in very poor housing conditions and were affected disproportionately by the % unemployment rate in the city.Unionists had long regarded the old walled town as a citadel that could never be surrendered and their dominance was symbolised by the walls towering over the crumbling th century terraced streets of the nationalist Bogside. The last time nationalists had attempted to hold a parade inside the walls was on St Patrick’s Day  – when they were batoned by the RUC.Housing was a massive issue in Derry and the Derry Housing Action Committeeprovided the focus for leadership as the Civil Rights campaign took off. The DHAC had organised a James Connolly commemoration in the city in July  which was banned by the unionist government.The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Associationagreed to hold a march in Derry on  October. The loyalist Apprentice Boys organisation immediately announced a counter-demonstration with the purpose of forcing the unionist government’s hand to ban the Civil Rights march. But the regime at Stormont did not require forcing because the Home Affairs Minister was ultra-unionist William Craig, who promptly imposed the ban.NICRA held an emergency meeting with the DHAC. Many on the NICRA Executive and some Derry nationalist figures, including John Hume, wanted to cancel the march, but the majority of Derry activists were determined to defy the ban. They won out and the march was to proceed as planned.It was a relatively small march, beginning on Craigavon Bridge with several hundred people. The objective was the Diamond in the city centre.The march was stopped in Duke Street by the RUC. A meeting was held with speakers including Gerry Fitt, Betty Sinclair, Eddie McAteer, Ivan Cooper, Austin Currie and Eamonn McCann. Three Westminster Labour MPs were also present.After the meeting, the marchers found themselves hemmed in on all sides by the RUC. They could not disperse and after a tense stand-off the RUC, oblivious to the presence of TV cameras and photographers, unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons, boots and fists. Water cannons were then used.Bernadette Devlin McAliskey, then a young People’s Democracy activist, recalled:“Quite deliberately, they hosed in the upstairs windows and shopfronts, and they went right across Craigavon Bridge, hosing all the onlookers. The police just went mad.”The RUC attack in Duke Street brought the Civil Rights struggle in Ireland to a world audience for the first time. It was a complete eye-opener to many people in the  Counties and in Britain. But most profound was its effect on young nationalists.Derry man Mickey Devine , the last of the ten Hunger Strikers to die in the H-Blocks of Long Kesh in , recalled:“Like every young person in Derry, my whole way of thinking was tossed upside down by the events of  October . I didn’t even know there was a Civil Rights march I saw it on television.“But that night I was down the town smashing shop windows and stoning the RUC. I developed an intense hatred of the RUC. As a child I had always known not to talk to them or to have anything to do with them, but this was dferent.The RUC attacked the Civil Rights march in Duke Street, Derry, on  October .test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27485  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering and pain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contested narratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.- Declan KearneyThis week the NIO consultation on dealing with the legacy of thepast in the north of Ireland closed.It will inform a legislative process and bringforward future legacy legislation.Failure to deal with the past remains one of the most signicantimpediments to political progress here.It is a barrier to the development of a comprehensivereconciliation and healing process in this society.British state policy has been the primary factor in preventinglegacy issues from being addressed or resolved.Powerful sections of the British military and intelligence systemhave never embraced the peace process. They remain psychologically andpolitically locked into a conflict mind-set even twenty years after the GoodFriday Agreement was signed.The role of British State forces and their agents, a refusal toacknowledge and be accountable for their actions, combined with a disregard forsuccessive binding court rulings, has defined the British state’s approach tolegacy matters.That has been reinforced in recent times by a cynical and narrative, including interventions by the British Prime Minister Theresa May,and British Secretary of State in the north, Karen Bradley, to suggest thatonly state forces were being made subject to legacy investigations.These statements are offensive and wrong, and are an egregiousdemonstration of the partisan nature of British policy towards dealing with thepast.They are consistent with the British practice of denying wrongdoing, concealing the truth, and preventing accountability.This poses a major challenge to ensuring that a robust,independent, and impartial facilitation of the legislative process will emergefrom this consultation on addressing the legacy of the past.All sides suffered, and caused suffering to each other during theconflict.There are multiple narratives regarding our tragic past. There isno single narrative despite the attempts of the British state and politicalunionism to assert otherwise.The past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering andpain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contestednarratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.The Stormont House Agreement, , , set out an agreedframework of legacy mechanisms which provided an unprecedented opportunity tocomprehensively deal with the past in all its aspects.Subsequent draft legislation reneged on the British government’sobligations under the SHA by introducing a national security veto, which hadthe effect of blocking a way forward on the issue of legacy.Full implementation of the SHA on a human rights compliant basispresents the best opportunity to deal with the legacy of our past and guaranteea framework which is victim centred.Facilitation of any future legislative process will require thatthe British government must ensure all victims are treated with equality,respect and dignity that the legislation reflects the policy intent of theAgreement and, that the legacy architecture is fully independent, human rightscompliant, and properly resourced and funded.The following key principles should be central to the operation offuture legacy legislation and mechanisms.-          Allprocesses should be victim centred-          Allprocesses must secure the co-operation of all relevant parties to ensuresuccess-          Allprocesses should be based upon equality, respect, and dignity-          Allprocesses must be free from political interference and be absolutelyindependent-         Acknowledgement should be central to the operation of the legacy framework-          The aim ofthat framework should be to enable reconciliation and healing within widersocietyIf there is to be a collective and comprehensive engagement withthe past in a human rights compliant manner, there can be no hierarchy ofvictimhood or humanity.There must be no change to the definition of a victim.High-quality services should be provided to all victims at thepoint of need.This should extend to the immediate provision of a pension for allseriously and psychologically injured during the conflict.The British Government should also immediately release therequired funding to resource the Lord Chief Justice’s inquest plan, as aseparate distinct process from any new legacy mechanisms.The Office of the Police Ombudsman should be adequately andimmediately resourced.Any attempt by the British state to introduce a statute oflimitations to protect its forces and agents would be a violation of the SHA and must be opposed.Full participation and unfettered disclosure by British stateforces and its agents with the legacy mechanisms will be essential to achievefull public confidence in their ability to deliver on behalf of all society.Periodic reviews should be carried out to inform the extent offunding requirements and necessary timeframe, for all legacy mechanisms.Legacy processes should not be limited or impeded by closedmaterial proceedings. In addition, for future legacy mechanisms toasintended, it is essential families are given full access to legal aid.The legacy legislation which ultimately emerges from theconsultation must comply with the policy intent of the SHA by:-          Promotingreconciliation-          Upholdingthe rule of law-         Acknowledging and addressing the suffering of all victims and survivors-         Facilitating the pursuit of justice and information recovery-          Beinghuman rights compliant-          Beingbalanced, proportionate, transparent, accountable, fair, and equalThe full implementation of that Agreement representsthe best potential and opportunity to address the legacy of our politicalconflict and the suffering experienced by everyone during the conflict inIreland, Britain and beyond. So, it is now time to finally deal with the past.  It is time tobuild for the future. It is time to lay the foundations for reconciliation andhealing, and to open up a new phase of the peace process. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27486  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National Chairperson“The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office”Ive been wondering lately whether anyone in Democratic Unionist Partyleadership circles actually try to reflect upon what republicans, nationalists, and other progressive minded citizens think about the current political situation.Do they even care what others think The evidence suggests not.Several days ago the DUP leader pronounced that her party could and would change the Good Friday Agreementat a whim. There was no hint of irony in her claim – the DUP has spent the last  years opposing the GFA, ever since it was signed.In another extraordinary, but not untypical, outburst she declared her blood red line position on Brexit and, that in the same week as the consultation on dealing with the past was concluding!Of course the DUP leader, and other key figures have form in making offensive and provocative political interventions.Her dehumanising description of republicans as \"crocodiles\" in  comes to mind.Notably, she previously called republican and nationalist Ministers in a ing Executive ‘rogues and renegades.Only the DUP knows whether this leader is naturally predisposed to being rhetorically gaffe prone, or is being deliberately offensive.Perhaps some figures in the DUP do think about wider opinion: the DUP is not a monolith after all.But, those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power sharing.  They oppose equality and rights, and reject reconciliation.Instead they have chosen to join forces with the extremists in the British Tory party to help steer the Brexit train wreck.The DUP leadership is living in a delusional bubble.Meanwhile, the party brand has become indistinguishable from the financial scandals of recent years such as Red Sky, NAMA, Brexit dark money, and financial relationships with Sri Lanka.The ongoing RHI inquiry exposé of how the DUP behaved in government makes a complete mockery of its purported adherence to good governance’.The party MPs have become power drunk through their pact with the Tories, and a serious misconception that they are king makers in Westminster.  Edward Carsons cautionary words have clearly been forgotten or disregarded.  He warnedWhat a fool I was.  I was only a puppet, and so was Ulster… in the political game that was to get the Conservative party into power.’ The DUP has a tactical approach towards everything including maintaining the status quo on its own terms, slowing down and frustrating progressive societal change, and maintaining sectarian dominance within the unionist constituency.The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office.  Its inability and refusal to embrace dference or celebrate ersity is reflected in an institutionalised bigotry against, and intolerance towards the Irish national identity and cultural traditions, and LGBT rights.The partys contempt and sharp practice in government has destroyed wider public confidence in the political institutions, and led to the decisive tipping point of RHI and withdrawal of the Líofa grant scheme in the winter of .As a result of its ingrained arrogance and lack of political humility the DUP leadership is constantly in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarianism, homophobia, and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists, and many others, including sections of civic unionism, do not believe the DUP is serious about restoring genuine power sharing. These citizens want the institutions to be restored, but not at the risk of allowing the DUP to continue practicing discrimination, disrespect, intimidation, bigotry, and sharp practice. They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power on that basis.  And, neither will Sinn Féin.The DUPs behaviour, and the onslaught of Brexit have together brought back graphically into focus the denial of rights which resulted in the Civil Rights Movement fty years ago.A generational realignment has occurred within northern nationalism.Acht Gaeilge, marriage equality, womens reproductive health rights, legacy justice rights, and the demand for a Bill of Rights are the modern day acid test equivalents of one person, one vote.  The current crisis in the north of Ireland is the visceral culmination of  years of DUP push back against the GFA.Intoxicated with its imaginary power at Westminster, the DUP leadership has finally over played its hand. The political institutions could have been re-established by the th February last, but the DUP leaders walked out of negotiations.Instead of selling the deal which they negotiated in February with Sinn Féin, the DUP leader, deputy leader, party chief executive, and its senior talks team bottled out.Since then the party has been convulsed with the resultant internal fall out.  There has been no meaningful contact with Sinn Féin, and absolutely no willingness demonstrated to resume negotiations.Any advocacy of blood red lines is a total anathema to democracy.The wider nationalist constituency is fed up to the back teeth with the subversion of the political process by the DUP, the British Tory government and others in political unionism.It is more impatient than ever for equality, rights and parity of esteem.  The history of  is being replayed. Thousands marching from Duke Street in Derry city on Saturday th October to mark the iconic civil rights march  years before is the latest example of that.  An exciting momentum for change is taking place across Ireland, north and south.  Old orthodoxies are being eclipsed by discussions about new, modern, all-Ireland constitutional and political arrangements. The permanent unionist electoral majority is gone and demographic changes are irreversible.All of this puts the onus back upon both governments to act decisively to address the denial of rights.The Irish government needs to take the lead because for now the DUP has this British government over a barrel.  But thats a short-term situation.  A British general election in the immediate to mid term cannot be ruled out.A new political discourse has begun about the future. All sections of society need to be involved in this and the unionist is critical in all of this.Brexit, the GFA, citizens rights, and an Irish unity referendum are central to that. Progressives should explore common ground and alliances for change.Republicans and unionists need to start to face the same way.  We have to begin looking at each other through eyes of the future.The benchmarks of a rights-based society guaranteeing civil and religious liberties and equality for all, are set.  These are not negotiable.So, whoever is actually in charge of the DUP for the time being has a lot of serious thinking to do...Who now leads the DUP  Do they have the authority to negotiate and stick to an agreement Are they committed to a shared future with republicans, nationalists, and others in the north Unless, and until the DUP can clearly answer these questions for the rest of society, it will remain exactly where it is now – out of power, and facing the inevitable fate about which Carson warned: getting dumped by the British Tories.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27487  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe Liberal Party was in government in Britain and had introduced the Home Rule Bill with the support of the Irish nationalist MPs in Westminster. They had abolished the veto of the House of Lords and Home Rule was due to be implemented in . The Tories seized on the issue of Home Rule as the most effective weapon to bring down the Liberals. Leading members of the British landed aristocracy, capitalists and senior military figures jumped on the bandwagon and backed up Unionist leader Edward Carson with threats of civil warHome Rule was brought in.Amidst the political frenzy there were very few Protestants in Ulster who were prepared to oppose Carsonism. But there were some and among them was the Reverend J.B. Armour of Ballymoney, County Antrim. A minister of the Presbyterian Church, Armour stood out from most of his co-religionists in advocating self-government for Ireland. In , he opposed a resolution at the Presbyterian General Assembly condemning Gladstone’s second Home Rule Bill. He was also a strong critic of landlordism.In , he again opposed a resolution against Home Rule at the Presbyterian General Assembly.Calling for freedom of conscience for Protestants to support or oppose Home Rule, Armour slammed the intolerance of Carsonism when he told the assembly:“If you deny the right of private judgment and of free speech, how much do you have of Protestantism worth keeping  Nothing at all.”Armour organised a public meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney to support Home Rule and oppose Carsonism. Banners in the hall proclaimed “No provisional or provincial government for us” and “Ulster for Ireland and Ireland for us”.The resolution stated that the meeting of Protestants of Ballymoney and the protests in The Route“against the claim of Sir Edward Carson and the self-constituted Provisional Government of Ulster to represent the Protestant community of north-east Ulster” and “disputes the narrow claim that dferences of creed necessarily separate Irishmen and women into hostile camps”. Among the speakers at the Ballymoney meeting were JB Armour himself, historian Alice Stopford Green, Jack White, son of a British Army general and later a leading figure in the Irish Citizen Army, and Roger Casement, who was executed in . This was Casement’s first appearance on a political . With his Antrim family background, Casement regarded the occasion as hugely signicant and in his speech he denounced any notion of partitioning Ireland. The meeting was a once-off and failed to turn the tide of Carsonism but it did show that a signicant minority of Protestants in the North-East were still prepared to stand up for Irish unity and self-government. The meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney in support of Irish self-government was held on  October ,  years ago this week. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27489  ","story":" Michael McMonagleThirty years ago today the British government, fearful of the growth of Sinn Féin, introduced the broadcasting ban to stop Sinn Féin representatives being heard on television and radio. The ban was introduced by the British governments Home Secretary, Douglas Hurd on October , . The ban was brought in an attempt to halt the growth of Sinn Féin in the north and to prevent a wider audience hearing a republican analysis of the ongoing conflict at the time. It prevented Sinn Féin representatives from appearing on television and radio interviews. When it was first introduced many broadcasters were unsure of how it should be implemented and effectively blocked all republicans from the broadcast media, even those who were not members of Sinn Féin. Broadcasters and journalists unions disliked the ban because of the disruption it caused and some sought ways to get around it, the most well known being the actors voice compromise where actors were brought in to speak the words of Sinn Féin representatives. This led to the bizarre situation where viewers could see Sinn Féin representatives on their screens but could not hear their voices. Several actors who went on to have successful stage and screen careers started out by providing the voices for Gerry Adams, Martin McGuinness and others. Of course, this was not the first time Sinn Féin representatives had been banned from the airwaves the Irish government used a similar tactic  years earlier. Section  of the Broadcasting Act, introduced in , banned Sinn Féin representatives from the media. RTÉ went further and extended the ban to all expressions of republican opinion, including popular ballads. As the peace process progressed the ban appeared more and more ludicrous, forcing the British government to abandon it in . Following the lting of the ban, Raymond McCartney became the first Sinn Féin representative to have his own voice heard in a  television interview. test"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1093314.jpg--.jpg?1539853794000\n","title":"is kilrea road sliding away","story":"Concerns have been raised about a section of the Kilrea Road where subsidence has caused the footpath to crack. TUV Councillor Timothy Gaston was contacted by local residents about the problem as they feared the footpath and road were not structurally safe.Councillor Gaston fears that the problem is now getting worse and is urging the Roads Department to act. Speaking to the , Councillor Gaston said: “I was contacted by local residents bout the footpath, and as the time has gone on, the problem has just got worse. “I got in contact with the Roads Department and they have been carrying out work to find the source of the problem.“The issue has now been flagged to the structural department from the maintenance department, and tests were carried out on the footpath and road just last week.” The heart of the problem lies with a tree that is growing through a wall at the edge of the footpath. However, there is also some natural subsidence that also needs to be addressed.Councillor Gaston wishes to give some reassurance to the public about the current safety of the footpath and boundary wall.He said: “The Department have said the wall is in no immediate danger of collapsing, but obviously there is a danger of this in the future, so I am eagerly and actively pushing that a solution be reached, before the problem gets any worse.” Many residents have expressed a fear thatthe situation persists, the road may have to be closed indefinitely, which is something Councillor Gaston is also keen to avoid. “There is a fear that part of the road might actually come away, so I am urging officials to act quickly to get a plan in place and be proactive about a solution so as work can be carried out in a controlled way, and the road will only have to be closed for necessary work, not indefinitely.”No plan for the road has been made to date, however officials are currently assessing the wall, footpath and road, and work on devising a plan is underway.

Frank’s story is one of a number which has been put together for the release of a tribute book of testimonies from family members and friends of Thomas and Gerard which is to be launched this weekend in Sailortown.Frank, who is now -years-old worked for Casey’s for over twenty years, recalls that day when fate determined who was in the yard that morning when the gunmen arrived.“My main job in Casey’s was to drive the old Bedford TK lorry, making deliveries to pubs, clubs and off licences. I always had one of the young lads on board as a helper,” explained Frank.“Every Wednesday for thirteen years I delivered to Casey’s off licences in Derry and Coleraine. They would ring in their orders on Monday. We would load up the old reliable Bedford on Tuesday and drive up to them on Wednesday morning.“On the day of the shooting that routine was changed which was fortunate for me and whoever was to go with me in the lorry that day. “The off licence in Derry, was due to be sold that Wednesday. If the sale went through, it meant that we would not be delivering to Derry, only Coleraine.It wasn’t until mid-afternoon that word came through that the sale went ahead. Frances Donnelly asked meI wanted to go on up to Coleraine that afternoon. As it was getting a bit late, I knew that we would not get back to the yard until after seven, so I told her that Thursday would be better. Frances gave me a choice that day and the choice that I made, saved my le.“On the Thursday morning we done a bit of tidying up around the yard and got ready to leave with the drink order.I didn’t know who was coming with me, it could have been any of the three lads, Thomas, another lad called Paul McDonald, and of course Gerard .“The owner, Sam Casey needed some pallets fixed, so that meant that Thomas was not going to go with me, because he was the best man for repairing pallets. That left two of lads to pick from, Paul and Gerard.“For some reason none of them wanted to go out that day and to settle matters Paul tossed a coin to see who had first choice, Gerard won the toss and he chose to stay in the yard. “It wasn’t really a big deal for Paul, he went into the store, got his jacket and that was us, we got into the lorry and left the yard, heading for Coleraine.”Frank and Paul headed off for Coleraine but little did they know what was to happen back in Belfast.“We found out later that we had only left the yard shortly before the gunmen arrived. For me, it was just another normal day. We were oblivious to the fact that while we were happily cruising along the motorway that gunmen had slaughtered our work colleagues and friends, back in Casey’s.“About an hour and a half after leaving Belfast I went into the off licence to speak to the manager. I took a phone call – ‘Frank, they are all dead’. I didn’t catch on what he meant, but it soon became clear and he asked who was with me. I told him that Paul was with me. “That confirmed to Vincent  that it was Thomas and Gerard who had been shot. Vincent was married to Marie, one of Sam Casey’s daughters, who worked in the upstairs office along with her sister Frances. Vincent happened to go in to the yard, unaware of what had happened, he saw one of his workers lying dead and when he went upstairs to the office he was met with an absolute blood bath. His we and her sister had been brutally murdered. “I drove back to Belfast in the lorry along with Paul, but I have absolutely no memory of the journey or the conversation between us, but I do remember going to the yard and getting the gates opened so I could drive the lorry in. “When I got into the yard there was blood everywhere, even on the fork lt. There was no one about, but I had no sooner got the lorry parked up, when newspaper reporters started to arrive outside, looking for interviews.“Thomas was seriously wounded and after treatment in hospital, was released after about two weeks. I know that Sam Casey was elated at the fact that Thomas had survived and was on the mend. Sam’s elation soon turned to deep sadness, Thomas died from his wounds exactly three weeks after he was shot.“The gunmen who went into the yard that day and shot my friends down like dogs have to bear the absolute responsibility, but fate played a role, as to who was in the yard when the murderers arrived.“The destiny of at least nine people was decided that day. The survival of the workers who would normally have been in the yard every single Thursday and the slaughter of those who happened to be there, was a matter of “s and buts” and for Gerard it was the outcome of a simple toss of a coin. “Yes, the outcome of the toss of a coin sealed Gerard’s fate, but saved the le of another worker. For Thomas, it was his skills at repairing wooden pallets that meant that he was working in the yard that morning.“I also think of the salesman who had been in the yard on business that morning and left just as we were driving out the gate. “Sam Casey, whose two daughters were murdered, would also have been in the yard that morning had he not have been in the Mater Hospital where he was recovering from a minor operation.”The tribute book will be launched this Sundayin the Mission to Seafarers Centre in Sailortown, soon after a plaque unveiling at pm at St Joseph’s Church in Sailortown."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"sailortown tribute","story":"A TRIBUTE afternoon is to take place in Sailortown this weekend to remember two men who died in a UVF sectarian shooting,  years ago.Gerard ‘Coke’ Grogan,  and Thomas ‘Tucker’ Osborne,  were killed in the shooting at their workplace, Casey’s Bottling Plant in Millfield on October , . Marie McGrattanand Frances Donnelly , daughters of the owner Sam Casey, were also murdered in the incident.On Sunday afternoon, a commemorative plaque will be erected at St Joseph’s Church in Sailortown at pm in memory of Gerard and Thomas who grew up in the area.A tribute book of testimonies from family members and friends will then be launched in the Mission to Seafarers Centre.The book, entitled ‘Ifs and Buts and the Toss of a Coin’ is a collection of humble and human stories about Thomas and Gerard as told by their friends and heartbroken family members.Brian Quinn, who has helped organised the event with the Docksiders Senior Men’s Group and friends of Thomas and Gerard, is hoping Sunday will be a fitting tribute.“It will be a nice day. We are pleased that  years after their brutal murders they will be publicly recognised in a respectful way.“Thomas and Gerard’s friends were all around the same age, lived a few streets apart, schooled together, worked together and in a special childhood bond, both were baptised in St Joseph’s Church.“We never got the chance to grow old with Thomas and Gerard. The least we can do now is to pay proper respect and where better to site the tribute than St Joseph’s in Sailortown.”The book also includes a tribute story to StephenBegley who is widely regarded as the fth victim of the Casey’s atrocity. On the day Gerard was laid to rest, his friend Mitch decided to hop on the back of a lorry after the funeral which was heading back into town. As the lorry approached Millfield, Mitch lost his balance and fell from the lorry and was killed.The public are asked to assemble at St Joseph’s Church on Princes Dock Street on Sundayat pm."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"two hundred jobs created at springfield factory in two years","story":"THE Innovation Factory in West Belfast is celebrating the creation of more than  jobs on its second anniversary.The business hub on the Springfield Road opened in October  with the aim of encouraging entrepren-eurship, innovation, and helping new high-tech businesses to grow.The  businesses located at Innovation Factory are some of the most ground-breaking, innovative companies in the north dealing in areas such as G technology, software development, film production and digital applications.Majella Barkley, Innovation Director, said: “The key to the success of Innovation Factory has been flexibility and support modern businesses need to be able to change and adapt their environment rapidly.

A number of openings in the glasshouses were also repaired with broken panes replaced.Consultants have been appointed to conduct a series of studies at the forest park and in addition to the Arboretum and Annesley Garden, have been focusing on the parkrsquos bioersity and built heritage, traffic and car parking as part of the funding application process.Earlier this year, a study highlighted a wider entrance to the sprawling forest park and the development of an interpretative centre beside the Walled Garden.Council officials say that while they recognise the parkrsquos undoubted heritage signicance, parts of it require investment to preserve and help promote an area which has ldquoexceptional tourism and recreational potential.Initial restoration work will focus on the -acre walled garden which is at the centre of the acclaimed arboretum, Bothy Yard and pathways which wind their way through the Rhododendron Wood..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Beaches among top with bathing water in Europe  ","story":"FOUR local beaches continue to enjoy some of the best bathing water quality in Europe, it has been revealed.Kilclief, Ballyhornan, Tyrella and Murlough are among a group of  beaches which have come top of the excellent water quality class, but it is a case of must do better for Newcastle beach where the water quality is labelled ldquosufficient.Tyrella and Murlough already hold the prestigious blue flag awards for the quality of their beaches with those who live along the Lecale coastline mdash who have been working to improve both Kilclief and Ballyhornan mdash delighted the beaches were identied for inspection for the first time, with the water quality included in the excellent category alongside beaches like Castlerock, Benone, Portballintrae and Portstewart.The districtrsquos beaches provide an excellent opportunity for people to get out and explore the arearsquos unique geological heritage and enjoy a wide range of activities which are available.Blue flag status assures visitors that the beaches have excellent water quality, are clean and that the environment is safe and accessible.The latest water quality figures published by the Department of the Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairsshow that the local beaches rank alongside some of the Provincersquos best, in particular, those along the North Coast and North Downrsquos so-called gold coast.A total of  bathing waters around the Provincersquos coastline have met strict European standards for quality, with  of these classied as excellent, which is the prerequisite for the coveted blue flag award.A further six beaches met the lsquogoodrsquo standards and the rest mdash including Newcastle mdash were placed in the lsquosufficientrsquo standard category alongside Crawfordsburn, Carnlough and Cloughey.David Small, head of DAERArsquos Environment, Marine and Fisheries Group, has welcomed the publication of the latest water quality results.He said: ldquoThis is a superb result for our beaches, especially given the changeable weather our coastline is often subject to. But, more importantly, itrsquos good news for our holidaymakers and bathers who can confidently enjoy our fabulous beaches.ldquoWe take great pride in these results and know that maintaining them will take a sustained effort. We will continue to work to reduce water pollution to keep our bathing waters clean and safe.Mr Small added: ldquoOur beaches are a priceless resource to tourism and to the health and well-being of our local communities and visitors alike. It is imperative that we continue to strive for the very highest of standards.NI Water has also welcomed confirmation that all  beaches tested have met European standards for bathing water quality.Angela Halpenny, head of environmental regulation, said protecting the environment was an important part of NI Waterrsquos business.She said NI Water was delighted to hear that all  designated bathing waters have met European standards but warned against complacency, highlighting the need to push forward with further investment to ensure continued improvements are made.The beach water quality results were announced by the Better Beaches Forum whose members include DAERA, NI Water, coastal local authorities, Keep Northern Ireland Beautul, the National Trust, Surfers Against Sewage and some coastal community groups.Mournes councillor, Willie Clarke said he delighted that Kilclief, Ballyhornan, Tyrella and Murlough beaches have recognised as having excellent water, but expressed disappointment that Newcastle was only placed in the ldquosufficient standard, despite major investment by NI Water in the resortrsquos sewage treatment works.He said there was an onus on Newry Mourne and Down Council to work with its statutory partners to improve the water quality, suggesting this yearrsquos warm bathing season should have helped prevent pollutants from being flushed down rivers and out to sea.ldquoWe need to establish what were the reasons for Newcastlersquos water quality to have only secured a sufficient water quality standard, Cllr Clarke continued.ldquoThe tourism industry relies on its beaches and water quality and more needs to be done to ensure this is as good as it can and should be.

The newly-formed Ballynahinch United played in a local summer league which involved teams such as Montalto, Drumaness Mills, Plessey, Saintfield, Magheradroll and another called the Bachelors, who apparently had an Italian playing for them.The club made their competitive debut in Division  of the Newcastle and District League in September  when they travelled to Ballykinlar Army Camp to take on the Light Infantry.This fixture would prove to be quite an ordeal in many ways with the team being beaten - as player and car owner Ted McKibbin had to make double journeys to ferry players to and from Ballykinlar.Not a single league victory was recorded that season, although they won a number of friendly games.Although the   season started more optimistically with a - draw away to Down Olympic, it was a further seven games until they defeated the RAF at Bishopscourt -. During the summer of  the team won all eight games to win the Kilmore and District Summer League.Things improved signicantly in the   season as they were promoted as runners-up in Division  and also won the Enterprise Cup, which was played on a league basis, beating Saintfield AYC ndash in the replay after a - draw in the first match.The Swts were formed for the   season and they played in the Willowfield League recording their first win against Saintfield United on October , .Having been promoted to Division  of the Newcastle  District League, they won it at the first attempt and with the Swts moving to the Newcastle League for the   season, both teams performed a unique double by winning Divisions  and  while United reached and lost the Harry Clarke Cup final.United went to the Northern Amateur Football League for the   season and were promoted from Division B and they also reached the Irish Junior Cup only to lose to Moyola Park. They won the Division A title in  In the   season they lost the Irish Junior Cup final to st Bangor Old Boys while the Swts were probably the first reserve team to reach the Harry Clarke Cup Final which they lost after a replay to Downshire Hospital.Consecutive Cochrane Corry Cup finals were lost in   and  , as well as a second County Antrim Junior Shield final in .Manager Billy Hamilton, who had guided the team through the s so successfully, stood down at the end of the   season and then went on to become secretary of the County Antrim Football Association for a number of years. The playing strength within the club led to the formation of the Albion, in .In the mid s Ballynahinch Recreation folded. United took over the Millbridge playing fields and undertook signicant development work which led to it being admitted to Division C of the Northern Amateur Football League.Under the management of Bobbie Reid, they played their first games at intermediate level in the   season while the Swts switched to the NAFL reserve section, However the Albion remained in the Newcastle League.Success came quickly when Brian McKibbenrsquos team won the Border Regiment Cup in the   season after extra-time and penalties. Brian stood down as manager in  and through the efforts of Gerry McCormick and Cyril Lennon mid-table league positions were achieved.Under the leadership of club chairman Campbell Allen, great strides were being made with improvements to the drainage of the pitch, erection of tubular steel fencing around the pitch, construction of new dugouts and the erection of floodlighting to the training pitch with the clubhouse being substantially refurbished.For the   season Noel Dean was recruited as manager and he steered the team to their first and only promotion at intermediate level when they moved from Division B to A as runners-up to Dromara Village.The following season a mid-table position was achieved together with a memorable midweek Irish Cup replay defeat of Harland  Wolff Welders at Millbridge.Dean stepped down during the season and he was replaced by Michael Savage, who led the team to the final of the Clarence Cup which they were awarded as a result of Knockbreda Parish fielding an ineligible player.That same season the Swts, under manager Geoffrey Smith, lost the Purdy Cup final while Davy Teggartyrsquos Albion won the Bignian Cup and were also promoted to Division  as runners-up. Sadly, this team broke up and there followed a decade of struggle during which managers Eamon Wilson, Norman McCullough, Davy Teggarty and Alan Brown worked tirelessly to halt the downward trend.The occasional bit of encouragement came along with the Albion reaching two successive Shimna Cup finals in   and   only to lose out in penalty shoot-outs while in   the Albion won the Donard Dairy Shield defeating Castlewellan IIIs ndash.Campbell Allen stepped down due to business commitments and the current chairman Gilbert Cromie took over.In May  the club were awarded the honour of hosting the Britton Rosebowl International between the NAFL and the Scottish Amateur League at Millbridge.Nigel Neale managed the team for the   season, but resigned with ten matches remaining. Experienced first teamer Alan Stevens took over, assisted by John Jones, and they led the team to one of their highest finishes in years.Former manager Cyril Lennon came in for the   season and United enjoyed their highest league position for years. Stuart Buchanan came in as manager of the Swts and led them to the Newcastle  District League Division A title.The following season United again narrowly missed out on promotion, as well as reaching the quarter-finals of the Intermediate Cup when they were defeated by Harland  Wolff Welders at Millbridge. The Swts re-entered the Northern Amateur League and were promoted as runners-up in Division E to Bangor Rangers.Much to everyonersquos disappointment, Cyril Lennon stepped down and Steven Bell took over along with John Jones and they led the team to a very respectable fourth place in Division B. United were awarded the North East Referees Association Merit Award for Fair Play at the AGM of the NAFL.The Swts continued their good form to finish runners-up to Downpatrick IIs in NAFL D, but manager Stuart Buchanan stepped down due to study commitments.In the summer of  the club celebrated its th anniversary which a special former playersrsquo night and a friendly match against Irish Premier League side Lisburn Distillery. The Albion managed by Johnny Reid won Division  of the Newcastle  District League.In   the club was awarded a % grant from the IFA to undertake an upgrading of its facilities to meet new Intermediate regulations.Steven Bell stood down in January . A new management team of Colin Murray and John Jones took over the role and they guided the first team to a fourth place finish on goal dference. Much to the clubrsquos disappointment the Albion had to be withdrawn from the Newcastle League due to a reduction in the clubrsquos player pool.In the   season the club embarked on its usual Irish Cup campaign little knowing that it would reach the fth round for the first time and be drawn against Premier Division side Coleraine. This brought about a wonderful adventure during which the club was able to garner a massive support which necessitated the ordering of two double decker buses for supporters as well as a bus for the team.Everything was done as professionally as possible and despite a heavy defeat, although the score was - at half time, the players and their management gained enormous respect.In more recent times the team has been managed by Keith Hamilton, Scott Brashaw and Ross Hayes as caretaker managers, Alan Davis and Paul Allison. In the current season, former player Glynn Robinson and Dale Davidson have taken on the role and have made a promising start with good results in both league and cup competition.Over the last  years the club has been involved in a number of proposed amalgamation initiatives involving Ballynahinch Recreation, Ballynahinch Olympic and Temple Rangers, but none materialised.One amalgamation that did happen was with Ballynahinch Youth Football Club, which now means that the club includes male and female from age six years forward and a ladiesrsquo senior team. This fits in superbly with the clubrsquos ethos of being inclusive to all within the local community which has been something that is reflected in its history from day one.It also brought to the club an outstanding group of coaches and administrators which has invigorated the club.No club could everwithout committed iniduals being involved in its organisation and the club has had a cadre of them over five decades.The passing of the clubrsquos elder statesman, Billy Hamilton senior, in December  brought to an end outstanding service not only within the club as a player and administrator, but also within the leagues and governing bodies.Billy was no stranger to working hard on the ground, putting up nets and marking the pitch both at Feersquos Field in Dromara and Millbridge, aided and abetted by club president Winston Brown, who works away in the background and has done so for  years.Jimmy Brown has toiled tirelessly and selflessly for well over  years, keeping Millbridge well-manicured as well as using his building, plumbing and plastering skills to maximum effect.In addition to Billy senior, the Hamilton family have made an outstanding contribution with Billy junior managing for over a decade. Graham scored hundreds of goals over those early years while Wilson mdash better known to all as Chico mdash played for all three teams and continues to serve as a committee member to the present day.We can never forget the contribution that Sally Hamilton has made as she continues to attend the home matches and has made the sandwiches served to visiting teams at the Millbridge for decades. In addition to managing the team and being involved administratively with the club, Bobbie Reid has served as the clubrsquos Newcastle League representative for many years. Last, but not least, there is Davy Teggarty, who has fulfilled every role possible.While all of these iniduals and others have helped over the years we are most fortunate to have a new generation who have stepped forward and will see the club move forward for which we are extremely thankful..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Peace lantern walk marking WWI end 100th anniversary  ","story":"A UNIQUE peace lantern walk is to be held in Killyleagh to mark the th anniversary of the end of the First World War.The lantern will be carried in a relay chain from Shrigley to Killyleagh, and through its main streets, before a flame from it is used to light a gas beacon at the front of Killyleagh Castle on Remembrance night.A Killyleagh veteran, who is one of Northern Irelandrsquos last RAF survivors from the Second World War, has been given the honour of carrying the lantern on the final relay before the Beacon of Light is lit.Martin lsquoTinarsquo Charters, who is aged  and who survived more than  bombing missions as a rear gunner in Halax and Lancaster bombers in the Second World War, will light the beacon to mark the moment the guns finally fell silent in  after four years of the world at war.The Bomber Command veteran who still walks up to six miles a day and is one of Killyleaghrsquos most instantly recognisable residents, will be joined in the final relay of the cross-community walk by local schoolchildren and  unsung heroes from the local community.The Killyleagh Beacon of Light will be among the first of around  bonfires and beacons to be lit across Northern Ireland at pm at the end of Remembrance Sunday, as part of the Battlersquos Over commemorations on Sunday, November .Chris Hagan, the chairman of the Killyleagh Remembers the Great War project, revealed that an original candle and lantern, used on the th anniversary of the start of the war, will be used as part of a chain to light the beacon.ldquoWe extinguished a candle lantern in August  to mark  years from the beginning of the war, he said. ldquoIn remembrance of the end of the war and the millions who were killed or came home dreadfully wounded, the lantern will be lit again.ldquoThere were two bonfires lit in Killyleagh on the night the war ended at the Castle Square and at the Cross.

Armagh were largely at full strength with influential number  Neil Faloon passed fit.Armagh took an early lead with a penalty from promising young out-half Cormac Fox.The game then became entrenched around the halfway line with both sides either unwilling or unable to put any width on the ball due to the conditions.Armagh edged the possession and territory, but with defences well drilled on both sides it looked like only a mistake would provide any try-scoring opportunity on either side.There were a few fumbles from speculative kicks on both sides but defences were able to scramble into place and snuff out any chances relatively comfortably to leave the half-time score at -.The second half brought more of the same. Ballynahinch had to withstand a period of sustained Armagh possession, but did so without any major alarms.However, they were unable to stamp any real authority of their own on proceedings and as the match drted into its later stages it seemed that Armagh had done enough to escape with a famous win.Former Armagh man Richard Reaney had other ideas and he converted a penalty in the final minute to earn the home side a draw.Armagh will be happier with the result, but the Ballynahinch players and coaches will take the two points and move on to the tricky trip to Old Belvedere next week.The final round of the Celtic Cup took place last weekend, freeing up Ulster squad members for club rugby, but it remains to be seen how soon they become available. The depth of the club squad will continue to be tested over the coming weeks.Ballynahinch City of Armagh ALL-IRELAND LEAGUE DIVISON B.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Red Bull Racing bringing Formula 1 car to City of Merchants Festival  ","story":"A TOP Formula  racing team is coming to Newry as part of the forthcoming City of Merchants Festival.Aston Martin Red Bull Racing will be bringing one of its famous F cars to Marcus Square on Sunday, November , between pm and pm.The eagerly awaited visit has been organised by Newry, Mourne and Down Council in conjunction with First Derivatives and Newry Business Improvement District.Council chairman Mark Murnin said: ldquoThis is a great high-octane addition to an already action-packed City of Merchants weekend.ldquoUnleashing the spectacle of F for fans across the district is fantastic, and we are thrilled that Newry is one of its pit stop destinations during its travels around Northern Ireland.Louise Cunningham, Vice-President of Marketing at First Derivatives said: ldquoWe are delighted to welcome Aston Martin Red Bull Racing to our hometown of Newry.Over the last year, we have been building upon our partnership and supporting the team with data analysis for off track projects helping the development of its  cars.

A bomb had damaged Enniskillen Townhall, and for a while the Council moved out to the Ardhowen.Pardon the pun, but there were times when Council meetings were ldquoas good as a play, as my granny used to say. Reporting the meetings for the paper was enjoyable, and I remember on one occasion two Councillors had a, er, lively exchange of views and we all held our breath as John Joe McCusker marched down the chamber to confront Jim Lunny.Of course it all ended amicably. The two men, both Nationalists and both with a mischievous sense of humour, were very dferent characters ndash genuine characters and not the fictional types which would tread the boards later at the same venue. I got to know them both and enjoyed their company.Jim Lunny was a great campaigner for retaining townland names, and John Joe fought his corner for his area. I recall them both having a sense of community, and not only would they do their best for Fermanagh in their day, both were also conscious of the need to pass things on to future generations.So they were very supportive of the then Chief Executive, Gerry Burns, a public servant with real vision, when he was the driving force to transform the Ardhowen into the beautul ldquoTheatre by the Lakes. And the architecture-award winning building became the envy of many places at home and abroad.Pardon the clicheacute, but the ldquojewel in the crown was an apt description, but more than just being a beautul building in a beautul setting, the Ardhowen under the dedicated and expert guidance of people like Eamonn Bradley and others, gave a real boost to the arts and entertainment.Enniskillen, and indeed Fermanagh generally, has a fine tradition in amateur drama and itrsquos gratying to see the likes of Adrian Dunbar and Ciaran McMenamin go on to have distinguished careers. About four years ago, I had the pleasure of chairing the Xchange summer school at the Ardhowen when Adrian spoke of his passion for the arts and as a regular visitor to his home town he still boosts the arts here. As does Ciaran, who engaged locals at such events as the film club. The range of activities at the Ardhowen is ied and we are, indeed, fortunate to have such a venue.Itrsquos starting to show its age, though. Even so, I cannot imagine that the people who got the theatre project up and running  years ago would have expected that already the Council is undertaking an exercise to look at the future of the theatre. Some of the options include an upgrade or extension, but worryingly another option is to build another theatre on another site.All this has been well reported by Colm Bradley in this newspaper.The situation has led to a number of people expressing doubts about the future of the Ardhowen, and Fermanagh Film Clubrsquos Jules Caithness wrote about ldquograve concern at the fog of uncertainty over the theatre which he said had been ldquohorribly neglected.The Council attempted to downplay this by saying they have ldquono plans to sell the Ardhowen site.No plans  Whatthey go for the option of a new theatre on a new site  What happens to the Ardhowen site then  Irsquod have preferred a straightforward, no wersquore not selling it. Itrsquos a uniquely beautul site and wersquod be mad to sell it.Irsquom told a meeting was held in August of ldquostakeholders which unsettled some of those present, and that no Councillors were present.Irsquom wondering how the succeeding Councils over the years allowed the building to get into such a state of repair, to the point where they now need to spend a large sum of money.So much money, in fact, that it exceeds the threshold that an ldquoeconomic appraisal is required.Irsquom sure some bean counter will weigh it all up but how do you place on a balance sheet the richness of cultural experience which the Ardhowen has brought to Fermanagh over three decades, and the reputation our centre of excellence has across Ireland In the current climate, I think the way we are governed isnrsquot as ldquoopen and accountable as it should be. There is certainly a massive disconnect between the people and those in authority at Stormont, though one would expect thatany public body would have the ear of the public it would be the local Council.Some decisions have implications for years to come. I still get annoyed when I walk past the old ldquostreets area opposite the police station in Enniskillen and see a lot of public sector buildingswhere once stood a thriving community of people living in homes on the island.OK, housing conditions were awful, but homes should have been built there instead of what the planners did with the area.So, please members of Fermanagh and Omagh District Council, consider carefully what you do with the Ardhowen. Itrsquos not really yours, and itrsquos not totally a matter of money.Part of the problem, apparently, is a lack of car parking. Aside from the fact that this would suggest itrsquos a popular venue, surely itrsquos not beyond the Council to sort that one out There are other problems, of course, and I fully accept that these are stringent times.Butyoursquore looking for feedback, Councillors, mine is that you should recognise what a magnicent asset you have on your hands. Pluck the jewel out of the crown and abandon it at your peril. In fact, find the money, go the whole hog and turn the ldquotheatre by the lakes into an even greater asset which will build on what has already been achieved and be lauded for years to come.Your predecessors, McCusker, Lunny and Burns among other, had the foresight to do that.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was a conflict in which his uncle, Charlie Dunbar had been persuaded to volunteer for ldquoto fight for his religion.But the experience of what Charlie saw left a deep scar and changed him forever.Adrian was the focus of the ldquoWho Do You Think You Are  on RTE on Sunday evening, and it was a fascinating watch.As we all get a little older, many of us seem to have an increasing interest in our own past, especially our own family history. In Ireland, family is still a powerfully symbolic and emotive part of our DNA, and the programme often reveals some interesting context for inidual celebrities.As Adrian said: ldquoAll of us are interested in our backgrounds where we come from and what yoursquore born into. Those things shape who you are.Therersquos no doubt that we will have been particularly interested in Dunbarrsquos journey into his background after all hersquos one of our own.But the interest in the programme went much deeper and much more meaningful. With several little vignettes showing the complexity of identity in Ireland.A word used frequently these days in all sorts of context is binary, meaning only two parts or ision into two groups. Itrsquos particularly apt to the world view of Northern Ireland. Protestant equals Unionist British, Catholic equals Nationalist Irish, would be the perception.It isnrsquot the case, of course, and shouldnrsquot be. But the troubled th century in Ireland, particularly the last quarter of it, saw both groups driven further into a silo mentality.Irsquove always felt that there was a certain irony in the fact that a violent Republican campaign to achieve Irish unity did, actually, create more ision.Now, the current circumstance of changing demographics in the north combined with the Brexit crisis are focusing on identity as we go forward.Adrian Dunbar is a clever inidual and, indeed, a perceptive one and the story of his family background in the programme was punctuated with comments which should evoke some thought about the past, present and future.Adrian was brought up in Enniskillen in a mainly Nationalist area, though for a few years the family moved to Portadown, Garvaghey Road in fact, where he recalls loyalist paramilitaries parading close by in a show of strength to people in Nationalist areas to know their place. The memory of two communities living apart is eloquently described by Adrian as ldquosocial engineering to suit sectarianism. While Enniskillen was much less hostile, the time, the place and the neighbourhood environment where he and his siblings grew up were far from ideal recruiting ground for the British military.And yet, on his mother Pauline Camplingrsquos side, there is an incredibly strong link and a history of service going back three generations.Adrian visited St. Michaelrsquos Church where Frankie Roofe was able to give him intriguing detail of his great-great-grandfather coming to Enniskillen as a soldier from England and converting from Church of England to Catholicism.Recounting some of the history of the Inniskilling Fusiliers, when the regiment ldquoheld the line for Wellington at Waterloo about half of the  men were killed, Adrian himself pointed out that about a third of the men spoke only in Irish. Itrsquos a quirk of how history develops that hundreds of years later the native tongue of men who died serving the British Army is somehow portrayed controversially as anti-British.Adrianrsquos grandfather, Walter Campling served in the Inniskillings, and three of his sonshad distinguished service in the British military in world war.The programme shows Adrian coming home to Enniskillen to discuss this with his brother Liam.Interestingly, though, Liam said that because they were brought up in Nationalist areas they didnrsquot go round talking about their ancestorsrsquo British military service. And Adrian himself said that the idea that he and his siblings would have followed the tradition of their three previous generations had gone.Such service to the British military by Catholic Nationalist families was common, as a look at the names of both communities on the Enniskillen War Memorial show.Yet, it was a feature not talked about in recent history and illustrates the complexities of identity that weave their way through our communities.Conversely, of course, the perception suggests that all Protestants consider themselves ldquoas British as Finchley and thatrsquos just as much an oversimplication. Surely the two identities donrsquot slot handily into their own homogeneous monolith There were a couple of telling moments, I thought, in the Dunbar programme.His uncle Charlie, whom Adrian remembers fondly dishing out sixpences, had been convinced in the late s to join the Irish brigade fighting for the fascist Franco in the Spanish Civil War under the guise of fighting to preserve the Catholic religion against the evils of Communism.On hearing some of the shocking atrocities that his uncle witnessed, Adrian reflected: ldquoPeople do a lot of things in the name of religion, donrsquot they  Sadly, as we know only too well in the north.And he added: ldquoThe combination of religion and politics is not a good one.And there was another line which struck me. Adrian was shown a photo of Queen Victoriarsquos state visit to Dublin in  when the city was still under British rule.He was shown the regimental band, including his grandfather, and considering the protest and fight for independence in Ireland which was about to change everything, Adrian referred to his grandfather and other comrades as being ldquoon the wrong side of history.A century on from that Royal visit, the country saw a war of independence, a civil war, decades of conflict in this part of the island and more recently more Royal visits by the current Queen both north and south of the Border.And now itrsquos a pertinent question to ask what side of history the ious identities are on now.The confusion and uncertainty over future membership of the European Union has thrown the subject of identity to the forefront, and there is the suggestionthat the issue of Irish unity is firmly on the agenda.To be honest, I donrsquot think evena Border poll was held that it would result in unity just now.But herersquos a thing. On Sky News last week, journalist Adam Boulton was interviewing Scottish Deputy First Minister, John Swiney and his opening question was: ldquoWhat do you think is more likely to happen first, a united Ireland or an independent Scotland The fact that he asked it seriously is telling, as is Swineyrsquos serious reply which began, ldquoItrsquos a close run thinghellip.In the current political climate, the DUP say they are engaged in a ldquobattle for the Union. Aside from the fact that all politics here seems to boil down to that, in this case the DUP may well be right.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I have been moved to tears by so many honest and heart-wrenching accounts.I canrsquot even begin to imagine the pain of losing a child at any stage of le it is inconceivable for those who have never suffered such a loss. But sadly, itrsquos more common that we imagine.It is estimated that one in four pregnancies in the UK ends in miscarriage, defined as a loss of pregnancy up to a gestation of  weeks and  days. A loss after that is considered stillbirth and in  there were , stillbirths ndash thatrsquos nine babies stillborn every day ndash and , neonatal deaths.As part of baby loss awareness week, bereaved parents, along with their families and friends have been coming together, joining with others across the world, to commemorate their babiesrsquo lives.The campaign was started  years ago and yet the fact remains that in our society, it is really only in the last couple of years that we have started to talk openly about baby loss.Indeed it remains a subject that few of us feel completely comfortable navigating. I will admit that before I became a mother three years ago, I had conversations with women who lost their baby during pregnancy and I know I didnrsquot handle those conversations very well.Maybe there isnrsquot a right thing to say, but I recognise now that that I, like so many of us do, shied away from much,any, conversation. Despite knowing that the phrase ldquoIrsquom so sorry was lacking, I refrained from empathising any further or asking questions because I felt I didnrsquot have the right words, I was afraid of saying too much, of saying the wrong thing, of being insensitive, and most of all I was afraid of upsetting that mother.But what I have learned since is that many women ndash and men ndash who have said goodbye to a child in pregnancy or during birth, want to talk about the loss. They donrsquot want you to cross the street to avoid them. Many want you to askthat baby had a name, or when his or her birthday would have been. Of course, itrsquos hard to know any of this unless we have the opportunity to have open and transparent conversations about such a sensitive and dficult issue.Talking about the subject of death is still quite taboo in our society, particularly when it is the death of a baby. But we shouldnrsquot underestimate the importance of talking about baby loss. Not only does it help those who are grieving, helping them to process what has happened, to stop blaming themselves and feel less alone in what can be an emotional and physical rollercoaster, it also gives us all the opportunity to develop the tools and language to discuss this emotive subject with greater understanding, helping to normalise something that is common - and indeed normal - but not talked about enough.Itrsquos ironic and perhaps a cruel reality of social norms that women are encouraged not to tell people about pregnancy until after the first trimester when sickness abates and the risk of miscarriage is greatly reduced. Surely the early stage is when pregnant women need compassion and understanding. The expectation to remain silent during the first  weeks of pregnancy means many couples faced with loss are left to grieve without the support that they need. After all, it doesnrsquot matter whether the loss of a baby is at eight weeks gestation or  weeks, the trauma felt by those who loved and wanted each child are the same. They had imagined their new family they had probably considered whether that baby was a boy or a girl and all sorts of other exciting plans.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This campaign is aided and supported by a number of the Prime Ministerrsquos own Conservative Party members.Sadly, what we are witnessing from many sections is an anti-British position rather than a debate based on any sound principles as to why there are not more pragmatic positions on providing a good deal for everyone involved.As someone who voted to remain within the EU I am extremely disturbed at the antagonistic stance being displayed by the European Union towards the democratic wish of the majority of the citizens of the United KingdomThis has brought me to thinking thatthis is their attitude in general to the UK, then we are better out of this vastly over regulated group. What is even more surprising is the attitude of the Irish Government. They are our near neighbours and have signicant trade with the UK, but are certainly making no attempt to have a conciliatory attitude to finding a positive deal.Given the potential economic loss to the Republic of Ireland, Irsquom curious as to why they are not attempting to use their influence, by their public utterances and in discussions with other EU members, to provide a more assuaging attitude to the situation. This I feel would be more conducive to sustaining beneficial trading relations between the two nations post Brexit.Thankfully the United Kingdom has a strong economy which has supported and assisted many smaller nations, including the Republic of Ireland in the EU for many years.It is hugely positive that Northern Ireland is part of the UK, the fth largest economy in the world. Moreover the UK is a signicant influencer throughout the world and a society that is a leader in freedom of democracy.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The paper was founded a year earlier, in September  but all the earliest papers are lost:LONDON, Sept.  and . \u2028There are private Letters in Town which are filled with Accounts of the gallant Behaviour of the Right Hon. the Earl of Crawford, a Voluntierin the Russian Army, commanded by Count Munich all these Letters mention his Lordship having sustained an important Part in every Action that Army was engaged in, but are so far from saying any thing of his Lordship’s being killed, as was reported, that they assure us, that he has had the good Fortune to escape unwounded.[A war was raging between Russia and the Turks. The previous day’s paper had reported that the earl had been killed by a cannon ball, but news moved slowly in the s and was uncertain. This is an early example of the record being corrected in a bid to convey accurate news]FRANCE. Paris Oct . Last week a very old Man, who had , Livres in ready Money by him, wished to see himself possess of , before he died, for which Purpose he prevailed upon his Son to borrow  Livres for him as soon as he got that Sum, he shut himself up in his Closet in order to join it to his own Stock but while he was busy in telling over his Money in his Chest, the Lid of it fell upon his Head, and he was found dead the next Day. The Reward of CovetousnessBELFAST. Last Tuesday the Right Honourable the Lord Viscount Hillsborough waited on the Rev. Presbytery of Bangor,in Order to have a dissenting Minister, whom his Lordship recommended to the Presbytery, settled at Hillsborough: It is not doubted but that the Presbytery will do what they reasonably can to graty his Lordship.[Trevor Hill, who was the first Viscount Hillsborough, died within four years of this report, while still only aged in his s. His son and heir Wills Hill later became a key British statesman as Secretary of State for the Colonies shortly before the July , American Declaration of Independence, which was reported on the front page of the News Letter in August of that year. A man who would become a founding father of the United States, Benjamin Franklin, visited Lord Hillsborough at Hillsborough Castle in . Later suggestions that the pair did not get on, helping precipitaterupture between Britain and the colonies, are disputed, and Franklin is said to have recorded that he was warmly treated by his host] The first two surviving News Letters from October  are the only early copies between September  and December .

Many moons ago I did diddle off and leave a dining room wall a third painted and the job to someone  to finish because I got bored and this has turned in to, ldquoWell, you see, Alison, you donrsquot do DIY. Well, fasten my tool belt and hand me a power drill because I now do do DIY.I unscrewed and moved a shelf just yesterday as it needed doing and no one  was doing it anytime soon. Shelf is now in itsrsquo new position, with books on it and it hasnrsquot gone wonky or fallen off over night, so unless it is the shelf-master of delayed action, I am assuming in situ it will stay and a good DIY job I have done.I was recently approached about a new writing project in a field and a genre I had never thought to write and my initial thought was, ldquoOh, Irsquom not sure I can. I agonised about whether I would do a good job and whether I would do the brilliant project idea, justice. But after urging from close friends and my children, I said yes.It is now well underway and feed-back is great and I love it. I am immeasurably proud and it is turning in to something that I am beyond giddy to be involved with.With lsquoback to schoolrsquo upon us and that feeling in September forever associated with change, next steps and new challenges, it got me thinking about all the children set to start St. Cyres and Stanwell, primary schools, Universities, colleges and the like and how many times we are all guilty of telling ourselves that we canrsquot, we shouldnrsquot andwe do, we wonrsquot be any good.This is my appeal to all students, be they tiny tots taking first steps in to Reception, tweenagers embarking on lsquobig schoolrsquo or those with a bit more experience, but often no fewer anxieties heading to further and higher education - go for it, try it take advantage of the chance to learn and the opportunities it opens up.Le is short and it is certainly too short to listen to voices that limit you or put you down. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Knowing this, John gave up his teaching course and took a full time job at the boatyardhellipand the rest is history.Mr Freemantle moved from Penarth and started his own boat building workshop in South Clive Street in  with British Road Services ndash now National Freight Consortium.In , the business was expanded and relocated to a greenfield site within Cardf Marina, which is now the exact location of Bayscape.The boat yard at the time stored around - boats. Long before the Cardf Bay Barrage was built, the water was tidal and boats moored in the middle of the river.As there was no road to the marina, Mr Freemantlebuilt a track to enable him to get to and from the boat yard. In  he put pontoons for the boats and laid the first cement for the slipway which was all created by Mr Freemantles own hands.In  the Freemantlesset their sights on retiring and sold the boat yard - which had grown to storing more than  boats - to a family friend of their business partner who used to visit the boat yard as a child. And so Bayscape began.One day the couple were walking along the waterrsquos edge and looked across to see the unique development taking shape in the exact spot of Mr Freemantles beloved boat yard, where  years previously they brought in the original electrics, telephone line and water. The couple decided to move back to where they had spent many happy years.Mrs Freemantlesaid: ldquoWe love living here, it feels really safe and therersquos a great sense of community.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here.

It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

He knew myself and my friends and was a really friendly man.\"He always used to know what ice lollies we would each have, see us crossing over and put them on the counter ready.\"Mr Pontis suffered a stroke after falling in his garden in spring , and later had three small heart attacks and three bouts of pneumonia.He pulled through each time, but caught pneumonia for a fourth time and died on Friday September .His funeral was held at St Peterrsquos Church in Cardf on Tuesday October , before he was buried at Thornhill Cemetery.Ms Sakke called the service was ldquolovely.ldquoThe priest who led the service had lived in Rome and so did some of it in Italian, she added. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business speaks to Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI and some of those burgeoning firms it has developed strong relationships with over the decades Long-term support is very much at the heart of the decades of partnership between Bank of Ireland and its business customers.And whether it’s offering a wide range of financial assistance, growth support or general advice, the bank has formed le-long partnerships with companies from right across the sectors, and from the large to the very small.It’s been there for three of its longest-running customers – with a combined almost -year history – from the start, and played a key role as a partner in each of their own growth stories.Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI at Bank of Ireland UK, told Ulster Business:“We base our business on a relationship management model – we spend a lot of time with the businesses, we know the owners and their management teams, their growth objectives and ambitions and understand the businesses.“That enables us to provide the right suite of products – challenging business plans, providing funding and help. There’s also the chance to introduce them to potential customers, signpost to expert advice, and become a partner to that customer, rather than just be a funder. It’s very much a partnership approach.“We provide lending facilities to business from the very small micro firm, right through their le-cycle, their growth phase, and scaling up to small and medium-sized businesses.”And for Gavin, it’s all about offering a range of services and assistance “under one roof”.“We have the ability to lend up to £m for business customers. There is the consistency to our approach, and that’s really important in the Northern Ireland market.”Partnership is a phrase that continues to raise its head in Bank of Ireland, regarding both its relationships with business customers, and the longevity and generational nature of the companies it’s developed long-term relationships with.“We would have many instances where a mother and father have built a business, and now the second generation is taking on the management,” Gavin said. “We are involved across both generations, and we are very privileged to be part of that family and business development.”“It’s in our interest that the company continues to grow and thrive and we have been very important in that role.”Nowhere is that more evident than with the hugely successful family-owned McKeever Hotel Group.What started out as a family restaurant business in Randalstown, Co Antrim back in , has blossomed into a burgeoning food and hospitality business boasting five hotels across Northern Ireland and Donegal.And the McKeever Hotel Group is still very much a family affair. In the last  years, the breadth of the business has grown to include Corrs Corner in Newtownabbey, the Dunsilly Hotel in Antrim, Ballymena’s the Adair Arms, Dillons in Letterkenny, and its latest hotel, the Dunadry in Antrim.Today, Eugene McKeever, along with his we Catherine, daughter Bridgene and son Eddie, run the thriving hotel empire which employs around  part-time and full-time staff.“The family business started in  when my parents opened the first restaurant in Randalstown – my dad was a chef and mum was teaching,” Bridgene, who is marketing director, said.“They then bought Corrs Corner. That’s when Bank of Ireland really become involved in the company and helped us out.“We have been supported by Bank of Ireland in a number of ways.”That includes the multi-million pound funding for the refurbishment of the Dunadry Hotel, in addition to funding support provided for the acquisition in .“Bank of Ireland has been with the company during its entire history. In , with the Adair Arms, we were one of the few people back then who were buying, due to the recession,” she said.“There has always been trust and the faith with the bank. My dad has always said – speak to your bank manager, and be honest with them.”The McKeever Hotel Group’s single biggest investment has been with the -bedroom Dunadry.Gavin says that one of Bank of Ireland’s core objectives is to help “customers to thrive”.“In doing that, it covers a lot of dferent things, and it’s not just about being profitable,” he said.“We specically tailor our packages to the customer needs. Their success, is our success and we are very privileged to be part of that growth story.”Eamon McCay started his cooking oil business at a small Strabane premises. He’s now grown Frylite from a small family operation to an Ireland-wide firm with more than  staff, boasting a turnover of £m.And he’s been helped along the way by Bank of Ireland amid ongoing expansion and growth. It’s a relationship which has so far lasted more than  years, and shows no signs of slowing down.“I started Frylite in , delivering fresh oil and collecting used oil. I combined all of the areas in one,” Eamon says.And that initial  sq ft building has grown to five depots across Ireland, with a further site on the cards for yet more expansion. “We supply our vegetable oils to hotels, fast food outlets, commercial businesses, bakeries, industrial food service sector… it’s been gradual growth.”A depot in Galway in  was followed by another two years later in Dublin, with Coleraine and Cork following a short time later. And its Strabane base is now a , sq ft building on a four-acre site.Since , Bank of Ireland has provided facilities to the business including invoice discounting, asset finance and term and cash flow ending, and also previously used stockline facility.Speaking about his strong relationship with Bank of Ireland, Eamon says a commercial finance package ensured the businesses growth.“The bank have gotten to know the business. I felt like I have had a partner, which is invested in the business. Building good relationships is one of the values,” he said.But it’s not just about providing help and finance to customers. Bank of Ireland is sponsor of Catalyst Inc’s Invent competition and is also working with organisations such as the NI Chamber and CBI to showcase and help companies improve skills, digital prowess and scale exports.Another business with a more than two-decade relationship with Bank of Ireland is Pinnacle.And just some of the Sage Platinum Reseller’s top customers include everyone from the Irish Football Associationand Ulster Rugby to Titanic Belfast and Mash Direct.The software partner, which was set up in Belfast in , now boasts a team of more than  experienced providers of Sage business management software solutions, IT services and support.“Going from humble beginnings, the company has grown into a £m business,” Fran McKee, Pinnacle’s marketing director said.The firm, which is headed by founder Ken Montgomery, has been supported by Bank of Ireland through its stages of growth, which has included organic expansion and acquisition. “We have a solid partnership with Bank of Ireland, which has nurtured our business since its inception in .”The firm offers businesses solutions from simple to more complex business needs with Sage. It now has  offices across the UK and Ireland, but according to Fran, there is “massive growth on the agenda”.“We want to be a £m business within the next few years and as well as growing our Sage ision we want to also grow our IT services offering and with the bank’s support we’ll achieve our growth ambitions.  You can come to us as a one-stop-shop for IT and software requirements.“Customers today are very focused on providing a good service as well as achieving their growth ambitions, so they want to have the software in place to help them make decisions and run their businesses effectively.”And Gavin says the key message is that Bank of Ireland is a “proven and consistent funding partner for businesses over a long period of time.”“We work hard to build a great rapport and great trust with our clients and these long term relationships are testament to that. It is exciting to share the journey of young and small businesses to growth and expansion and we’re keen to help the next generation seize new opportunities for their businesses.” ■View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Premier.jpg","title":"premier inn looking at two new ni hotels","story":"Posted on Wednesday October  by John Mulgrew Premier Inn is eyeing up opening new hotels in Newry and Enniskillen as it seeks to expand across Northern Ireland, Ulster Business can reveal.The hotel chain, which has seven hotels here, is seeking developer opportunities in the two new locations, alongside growth in Dublin.The company, owned by Whitbread, has said it secured  new hotels in the UK during the last financial year, and has the same aspirations this year.It also says it is looking for “property partners and freehold development sites in Dublin and other major cities” as it seeks to grow Premier Inn across Ireland.Meanwhile, a new report from PwC says hotel prices in Belfast are rising five times faster than the UK average.In June , the average cost of an overnight stay in Belfast was £. but has now grown to £..Belfast is now the fourth most expensive city to stay in the UK, outside London.PwC Northern Ireland partner, Martin Cowie, said: “The influx of high-quality rooms to the market have driven and continue to support improved RevPAR and ADR for the city. “Though the full impact hasn’t been realised with easyHotel and the George Best Hotel yet to open as well as Signature Living’s new hotel at the Crumlin Road courthouse which just received planning permission, demand continues to be driven by inbound tourism, domestic holidays and events.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Pete-2.jpg","title":"in focus peter hannan on beef brexit and business","story":"Posted on Thursday October  by Ulster Business Peter Hannan tells John Mulgrew about turning away the big retailers, growing trade by % and that he doesn’t believe Brexit will happen once people see what’s at the edge of the clf Like many in his industry, Peter Hannan is no fan of Brexit.But the top-end beef and red meat supplier also doesn’t think it’s going to happen, given how disastrous the post-Brexit landscape is painted, now that it’s been starkly laid out in front of everyone.The Kildare-born businessman runs Hannan Meats, based in Moira. He’s become something of a star of the Northern Ireland food scene in the last decade – buoyed on by dry-aged beef and an array of the UK’s best and brightest using his produce.He’s aged beef for , days – yes, more than three years – although purely experimental, boosted turnover by around % in the last two or three years, picked up more three-star awards from the Great Taste Awards than almost any other food firm, and now plans to expand into Dublin as his next venture, by the end of the year. Anyone who’s met the Meat Merchant – the moniker given to his retail business in Moira – will know that the -year-old is a personable, larger-than-le character, whose own personality contributes as much to his business and brand, as does his meat.“Our main areas of growth in the last three years have been into the UK, Republic of Ireland and the continent. We haven’t been looking at doing more at home here, because we have a presence, and we think it’s very adequate. We don’t push that, or cold call. We think the clients that we have in Northern Ireland are the best, and we aren’t looking to expand on that.”France is also becoming a growing market for the company, and Pete says business there is growing “very rapidly”.He’s also recently signed a deal to supply all of the Hastings Hotels’ spots.“We have approaches from all sortsover the years,” Pete says. “We are primarily a food service company, so dealing with any of the multiples – doing it a lot more, or not doing it as well has never been on our radar. We’ve had them drive in to the yard here – four suits getting out of a black-windowed car. You are watching on the camera and say ‘oh, that’s somebody’.“Everyone has dferent ideas. We just don’t believe they are the type of partner that we would want. We don’t want to do  tonnes a week of commercial product.”But a few years ago, he did the highest-profile grocer of its kind in the UK – arguably the world.“Five years ago we started to deal with Fortnum  Mason, and they are truly magnicent to deal with,” he said. “That was a turning point because, regardless of what anybody says, the best front window for food in the world is Fortnum  Mason.”According to Pete, business in the five years since the relationship began has increased by ,% – or around  times.What started as a meat wholesale business, blossomed thanks to the success of Hannan Meats’ Himalayan salt-aged Glenarm beef, and has grown into a business with a wide-iety of products – many of which have been done for the first time in NI.Aside from selling lesser-known cuts of beef, such as hanger and rump cap, Pete’s business has ersied into dry-aging lamb, and curing both pork and beef in a sugar-pit – producing hugely flavoured bacon and cured-beef.It doesn’t take long for Pete to start naming some of the greatest chefs which call Hannan Meats their beef supplier. That includes Angela Harrnett and Mark Hix. He was one of the first UK restaurateurs to exclusively use Peter’s dry-aged beef across all of his restaurants – it all started when Pete met Mark outside one of his eateries and gave him an honest retort to whether he had enjoyed his meal. The beef wasn’t up to scratch.But it’s not all just awards, top chefs, suppliers, restaurants and celebrity-backing. Pete says turnover is up around % in the last two to three years – sitting at around £m.“We have lots of other things going on in the background. Taking our next step forward is something we have been considering. We are at a crossroads as to where we take the business next. We are now at a point, do we go forward with the likes of our Meat Merchant , do we take that to a city  Dublin would be next on the radar.”On Brexit, he doesn’t think it’s going to happen – given a clearer image of what le outside the EU could look like.“No doubt, all of us in business have been reluctant to make decisions because there is no clarity,” he said. “Personally, I don’t think we will Brexit. We need to go and apologise, and say ‘as we were’ and just get on. It was a hell of a bad idea. It was sold based on rubbish information, and that’s why people made a rubbish decision.“Now that we have a bit of clarity – Theresa May is bringing us to the clf edge, and saying ‘that’s how far down it is – have a look,you tell me to jump, I’ll jump… but we don’t have to’.“This whole thing about immigration. The thing about bringing , people into this country every year needed to be explained to take that issue off the table. If you want your fruit picked,you want doctors and nurses in the NHS, for example...you want any of those things, then let’s put up the barriers. Unless we take those people in, we don’t have have those things done.“… we shouldn’t be in this position, and I don’t think we will be for much longer. Once Theresa May brings these things to the clf, no one will say that they want to jump.“I think there is a huge head of steam. People will say ‘we won’t take that deal’.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"pinnacle marks  years with huge bash in portugal","story":"Posted on Thursday October  by Ulster Business Belfast firm Pinnacle – a leading provider of Sage software and IT solutions – has celebrated  years in business by taking more than  of its staff to Portugal for an an all-expenses paid trip.The company, which has branches throughout the UK and Republic of Ireland, flew its workers to a five-star resort in Vilamoura, to mark the occasion.The five-star celebrations included welcome lunch overlooking the Vilamoura Marina, followed by spa treatments and water sports.

I grew up in an era where comedians actually had the benefit of free speech and you simply switched off or walked outyou didn’t find them funny. Common sense used to prevail and adults were able to admonish children as part of their development process. Today the world is dferent, everyone’s opinion matters evenit is illogical, ill-conceived and does not stand the scrutiny of even the most cursory of cross examinations. Politicians have always manipulated the message to try and persuade the electorate that the policy they are peddling today is for our benefit. Once elected they then change tack, claim they never supported the policy that they were elected for and blame the opposition. One of my clients’ recently told me to stop wasting my time writing about Brexit because nobody cares and the subject is now boring. I tend to agree that the subject has been over discussed but sadly it appears to have been under considered by almost all associated with our path to European exit. Local, national and European politicians have patently no clue as to how to deliver a workable and practical orce with both sides predicting a range of dire consequences for the UK economy whether we stay or go. As ever the true position will never be visible to the vast majority of voters and, therefore, we will probably never have the chance to understand our exit deal, whether or not we get the chance to vote on it. Never has the duplicitous nature of politicians been more evident than this shambles we are now watching. Businesses do not have the luxury of endlessly debating a myriad of options, we need to make decisions and act upon them. If we don’t then jobs are lost and families suffer. Locally we are pathetically represented by a group of politicians who appear not to want to undertake the jobs they were elected to do. Maybe I am just cynical but it appears to me that they are hiding in the shadows hoping that someone comes up with a plan for which they have no actual responsibility. That way,it works they can quietly move forward asthey were a part of it,it fails then it was not their fault. Do we not deserve better than this  I read an article in another publication recently, penned by one of my competitors, in which he invoked property professionals to be more optimistic and sell the positives of the NI market. I have spent my entire  year career trying to sell the positives of investing in NI. I have stayed here, built a business, paid taxes, employed many people and hopefully delivered pleasing results for our clients. It would be really nicefor once our politicians could simply deliver us a viable business oriented solution that made le easier rather than the constant uncertainty we face. Imagine business owners delightthe punchline to the gag was “went to the pub and agreed a workable plan”. Now that would make me smile.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Rocket.jpg","title":"how to make a business rocket","story":"Posted on Wednesday  October  by Ulster Business How does a growing company help its expansion plans really take off  John Mulgrew takes a look at the options available to SMEs here when it comes to fundingWhat does a burgeoning small business do when it’s time to scale up There a numerous options for companies right across the business spectrum – and the options across the traditional banking world are plentul.But there’s additional assistance that can be garnered from less traditional sources, with feedback and support also coming from outside the conventional sphere.David Nelson, partner at KPMG private enterprise, a global professional services firm, says it “works with companies of all sizes and at every stage of their development -  from start-ups to established family businesses.”.“Our people understand what it takes for companies to be successful at every stage of development – from idea to exit – and will help them make the right decisions at every step of the way,” he said.“So the support we give to our clients ranges from business planning and raising capital through to help with expanding internationally, MA, tax advice, RD incentives, technical accounting matters and complying with regulatory requirements.”According to First Trust Bank’s head of business banking, Seamus McGuckin, there are “ious funding options available to assist SMEs as they grow”.“… be that asset finance, invoice discounting, revolving working capital, loan financing or overdraft facilities.“First and foremost, however the more important support we can offer our clients is our expertise and commitment to understanding their needs and then delivering a service to match. It’s through getting to know our clients and their business that we can best share our knowledge and advice around the type of financial support they need.“At First Trust Bank, having listened to what our customers wanted, we invested in six new business centres across Northern Ireland to support fast, local decision making. We also established a Small Business Centre to meet the needs of our smaller customers. Now firmly embedded in their respective communities, these centres – coupled with our expert sectoral advisors – are on hand to help business owners identy opportunity and risks and how best to mitigate or capitalise upon them.”Richard Donnan, head of Northern Ireland at Ulster Bank, says it “is strongly committed to supporting businesses of all sizes, from micro firms right through to large corporates”.“Our latest results show a % in small business drawdowns, and we continue to work hard through initiatives such as our Boost initiative and our Entrepreneur Accelerator to build mutually beneficial relationships with firms across Northern Ireland. “A key focus for the bank is the development of digital services that make it simpler, easier and safer for customers to bank with us. “Our digitally active customer base grew by % year-on-year and we are continuing to respond to that change, for example, by introducing our Business Growth Enablers and through the development of our digital s such as our mobile app.”But it’s not all bank financing. The Growth Loan Fund offers assistance to Northern Ireland-based companies who demonstrate growth, and tend to work within the manufacturing, engineering or tradable services sectors. “Loans will be typically unsecured and personal guarantees will not be sought. The loans provided are expected to be complementary to existing sources of finance, including banks, trade finance sources and equity investors.”Some of the companies availing of the finance include Belfast-based BLK BOX Fitness, which secured £, to grow its online  and boost exports, along with Fermanagh gin-maker Boatyard Distillery.Meanwhile, the BGF was set up in  with £.bn and has since backed close to  companies. Last year, BGF was the UK’s top institutional investor and ranked the seventh most active private investor in the world by number of investments. Upstream is a Belfast-based alternative finance company specialising in SME funding, and has also now introduced a trade finance option for clients. The market-first solution unlocks the ability for businesses to finance their working capital needs end to end, from supplier to buyer.Niall Harkin is director of customer journeys at Danske Bank. He says “personal engagement is still really important” when dealing with small and medium-sized firms looking at expansion.“That’s why last year we introduced a team of  dedicated small business advisers back in to key branches across Northern Ireland, giving customers access to expertise in their local area to discuss business plans and explore funding options,” he said.“Meanwhile, teams of experienced relationship managers supported by specialists in areas such as cash management, markets and trade finance, support our larger SME customers.“At the same time, we’re investing heavily in our digital offering, and recently added the capability for SMEs to get lending decisions in a matter of minutes in ious situations. ‘future financing’ makes the whole credit process much easier for our customers. For an overdraft, we’ve seen approvals in four minutes and access to money well within  hours. “In the future, customers should be able to go online and request an overdraft increase on a smartphone at home.”But aside from the financial support, businesses here can also turn to the support from hubs. That includes Ormeau Baths’s Barclays Eagle Labs – which is located at the south Belfast listed building – and the Ignite NI Propel Pre-Accelerator. The options are out there and available for companies wishing to take that next step, whether traditional banking or alternative streams are the way to go.

The Northern Ireland Hotels Federation said a \"shudder\" was going through the industry, which comprises  hotels and , bedrooms. In Belfast, , rooms were added over the past year, thanks to new construction of six new venues, including the Hampton by Hilton and the Grand Central, and extensions to two existing hotels. The federation said the market was going through a \"stutter\" with occupancy and room rates going down. \"It is important to note that demand for hotel rooms has grown over the last year, but it hasnt kept pace with the increase in supply,\" it added. A separate report by PwC put the cost of an overnight stay in a Belfast hotel at £. The federation predicted a signicant fall in demand next year and , with demand unlikely to catch up with supply until . On day two of industry event Hospitality Exchange, federation chief executive Janice Gault said: \"Market snapshots indicate a stormy  with volatility in the market. Overall analysis shows a reduction in occupancy levels and a decline in rate.\" She said Northern Ireland needed a new tourism selling point - suggesting something like Failte Irelands Wild Atlantic Way promotion, but for the north west and west coast. \"Demand is growing, but this needs to be accelerated with a number of interventions, including increased promotion, a bigger marketing budget and a proposition of scale for Northern Ireland along the lines of the Wild Atlantic Way,\" she added. \"Measures like this will allow the market to adapt to and absorb new supply. There has been a seismic change and a response of equal measure is required to create new business.\" Ms Gault said challenges for the sector included skills and staff, as well as Brexit, which had led to \"considerable uncertainty\". \"Added to this are the issues around tax, in particular VAT, access constraints and capacity at key attractions,\" she said. \"You can see why the market is experiencing a shudder as we come to the end of an era of exceptional trading.\" And while  would be quiet in comparison to the flurry of openings in , it was \"far from dormant\", the federation said. There are to be new openings in Londonderry and Newry and Mourne, while ventures on the north coast are now \"dependent on what has become a protracted planning process\". But Ms Gault said that despite some problems, the hotel sector \"has strong prospects\". However, drawing in more visitors was paramount. \"We need to increase the size of the tourism cake to ensure that each hotel gets a good slice of business,\" she said. \"Having spent in the region of £m, the hotel sector is keen to see aon this investment and a realisation of the industrys potential.\" A full briefing on the forecast takes place this morning at a business breakfast at Hospitality Exchange, which is taking place at the Crowne Plaza, Belfast. Industry STR Global figures for June revealed that occupancy rates in Belfast were down by around % after , new rooms were added.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
