In 2019, when the LRB celebrated its 40th anniversary, she was dubbed “Britain’s most influential editor” by the New York Times.Wilmers will continue at the paper as consulting editor, with the LRB’s deputy editor Jean McNicol and senior editor Alice Spawls succeeding her. McNicol has been at the magazine since 1987, when she joined as an editorial assistant, while Spawls joined the LRB as an editorial intern in 2011.“The succession has been long in the planning and I’m very proud to be handing over the editorship to two such talented women,” said Wilmers, who is 82. “I’ll be continuing to do my bit as consulting editor.”Wilmers’ home life was documented in Love, Nina, the bestselling memoir by her former nanny, the author Nina Stibbe. In the 2016 BBC adaptation, Wilmers was portrayed by actor Helena Bonham Carter.“A) Oh, no, it’s the end of an era. B) I hope people aren’t going to annoy her by saying ‘end of an era’ and going on about it,” Stibbe said. “People have said the LRB is her life. It isn’t. It’s her job, and she’s very thorough.”Stibbe, who has remained friends with Wilmers since first meeting her in 1982, said she tried to provide ideas for the LRB while nannying: “I might begin on Virginia Woolf and she might say, ‘Sorry, I’m about to watch Match of the Day’. One time I raved about The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole by new writer, Sue Townsend. And she said, ‘If you like it that much, review it for the paper?’ I declined, thinking, ‘Do your own homework!’”In 2014, the Observer said that under Wilmers, the LRB, which had a circulation of more than 78,000 in 2019, had become “a highly regarded publication with an influence that extends far beyond the rarefied world of small-circulation literary magazines”.Published twice a month, the LRB has included among its contributors names including Christopher Hitchens, Seamus Heaney, Angela Carter and Hilary Mantel. Wilmers has said in the past that she sees “the paper”, as she calls it – a mix of book reviews, arts criticism and long-form essays – as an antidote to the sameness seen elsewhere in the media.“Newspapers say the same thing over and over again and we’re all horrified and collectively up in arms and there’s normally more than one side to something,” she told the Observer in 2014. “So if you hear somebody saying something coherent and intelligent that’s not totally out of order, it’s interesting to read it.”Last year, she explained that the LRB had endured “because we have a sense of humour that you can see without it necessarily being declared. We’re not po-faced, as it were.”Andrew O’Hagan, a longtime contributor to the magazine and a close friend of Wilmers, called it “a huge moment”.“Mary-Kay has been the best literary editor of her generation,” he said. “She’s an international treasure, not only because she has kept the British essay alive and growing, but because she has driven reportage and memoir-writing into the digital age. Very quietly, for decades, she has been a guiding light in the literary life of this country, and one of the hardest-working people I’ve ever known … she’s always been great to write for – more of a dance than a solo flight, less of a task than an education.”In a statement, Spawls and McNicol said: “The LRB is the best paper in the world, thanks to Mary-Kay, and we intend to keep it that way. We’ve never wanted to work anywhere else, and, indeed, neither of us ever has.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/df44fdcc6396754df6e06f26b9bf15a4ccda492d/0_686_5935_3561/master/5935.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=ac2987002d3f08a6f5dfcbff62a7ebf6","title":"the week in wildlife in pictures","story":"The best of the week’s wildlife pictures from around the world, including a Eurasian lynx and rescued caymans"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d9386c441b7742ef116e4855300add4739cfdb0a/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=b70eb6063327a79f9562469835d64fbd","title":"amazing grace haute couture ss21 in pictures","story":"White horses, tarot cards, a rave and a hat trick of debuts… How high-fashion in the covid era went for magical fantasy at the audience-free shows"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1303dd2e04cab5ef67e819b6fd204bf9df7829b/92_139_1864_1117/master/1864.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=b4fd95a97b97defe01fb68d8eed07cf0","title":"caffeine dehydrates you and other common hydration myths busted","story":"We all know that a healthy intake of water is crucial for our health, but there is still a lack of clarity around how we give our body the fluid it needsLack of hydration is often the culprit when it comes to fine lines and dullness, as well as other skincare concerns. London-based dermatology registrar Dr Cristina Psomadakis says skin hydration is absolutely paramount to maintaining a healthy skin barrier and ensuring that skin cells shed at a normal pace. Adequate hydration is one of the key elements of a fresh-faced glow and minimises the appearance of cracks, flakes or wrinkles in the skin.This is true for all skin types and all skin tones, which is why hydration is so important. Oily skin and dry skin can both be dehydrated. Drier skin types are usually classified by having fewer oil-producing glands compared with oily or combination skin. However, dry skin can be thirsty with a lack of water as well as oil. By the same rule, oily skin types can also be dehydrated with a lack of water and not oil.But drinking eight glasses of water isn’t the only way to get hydrated. You should also aim to consume water through food too. Eating foods rich in water helps the body to absorb the water more slowly, which means the water we get from foods such as cucumbers, watermelon, bell peppers, strawberries, celery and iceberg lettuce keeps us hydrated as well as giving the body a boost of minerals, vitamins and fibre.There is also a myth that caffeine excessively dehydrates you. It is true that caffeine can act as a mild diuretic, but according to a study by the University of Birmingham, where 50 men habitually consumed three to six cups of coffee a day, there was no evidence to show that they were more dehydrated than those who drank water alone.But when it comes to drinking water, you can get too much of a good thing. Overhydration – or hyponatremia – is a condition where sodium and electrolyte levels can become dangerously low due to drinking too much water. This can cause headaches, nausea, muscle weakness and can even be fatal in extreme cases. So finding the right balance is key.Stress, pollution, blue light from devices, exposure to UV and a lack of sleep can all affect the skin and its ability to retain water and stay plump. Staying hydrated is great for the body and helps to regulate mood. As our brain is mostly made up of water, drinking the right amount of it helps keep headaches at bay. Water is also great for helping us stay more focused. But how can the skin also get a drink of water to help boost its function?Hyaluronic acid – due to the “acid” in its name – might sound a bit scary, but it’s known as a souped-up skincare wonder ingredient for its hydrating properties. ”Hyaluronic acid is a sugary substance that we make naturally in our body – it is found in the skin, eyes, joints, even the umbilical cord,” says Psomadakis. “Hyaluronic acid is classed as a humectant, which basically means it’s a hydration magnet – it helps draw moisture from the environment and surface of your skin.”Whether it’s upping your water intake by drinking it, consuming food with high water content, or slathering on great skincare to help boost hydration, water is definitely key for bouncy, radiant and plump skin."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/19b616cbd50e4d69d434649fd135693336e1ad19/0_20_1731_1039/master/1731.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2d8b6e0e39fbe0132fe230e98ab26292","title":"dry patches tightness and redness signs your skin is dehydrated and how to fix it","story":"Dehydration can leave your skin looking dull and lifeless – but luckily it’s totally fixable. Here’s expert advice on how to get glowing skin no matter what time of year it isWhen skin suddenly feels tight and looks dull, with fine lines and wrinkles more apparent than ever, it’s easy to panic. But, while it might be easy to assume that the stress of the past year has irredeemably accelerated the ageing process, it’s far more likely that such skin issues are simply down to dehydration. And while that’s not ideal, the good news is that it can be put right.Unlike dry skin, which tends to be a long-term issue caused by your skin not producing enough oil, dehydrated skin is down to lack of water and is usually temporary.“Skin hydration is absolutely paramount to maintaining a healthy skin barrier and ensuring that skin cells shed at a normal pace,” says Dr Cristina Psomadakis, a London-based dermatology registrar. “Adequate hydration is one of the key elements of a fresh-faced glow and minimises the appearances of cracks, flakes or wrinkles in the skin.” In other words, hydration is key to maintaining skin is in tiptop condition. So what causes dehydration in skin?We lose about half a litre of water through our skin on a daily basis. But that varies greatly with climate and exercise. And while it stands to reason that if you’re getting your sweat on, you’re losing water, cold weather – and the sort of lifestyle that goes with it – can be just as much of an issue as hot weather, when it comes to drying out your skin.“Cold weather, indoor heating and hot showers can all wreak havoc on our skin and cause it to lose moisture and become dry and flaky,” says Psomadakis.“It is really important to be proactive and try to protect our skin before it suffers from seasonal assaults. This usually means swapping to a richer moisturiser – or moisturising more frequently.”The top layer of the skin – known as the skin barrier – is the body’s defence against everything the outside world has to throw at it. It not only stops stuff getting in, but it’s also the layer responsible for protecting your skin and holding in moisture, and it has to put up with a lot of abuse in daily life.Stress, pollution, blue light from devices and infrared radiation can also compromise our skin barrier. When the barrier is damaged, the mechanisms that usually help keep skin hydrated and plump don’t work as effectively, resulting in dry patches, tightness, redness and dull skin tone.And it’s worth remembering that skin health doesn’t just work from the outside in. What you eat and drink can also have an impact – as you’ll know if you’ve ever felt desiccated after a big night out. Alcohol – and caffeine too – can take moisture out of your body, and that will show on your skin too.Psomadakis recommends swapping to a richer moisturiser (or using moisturiser more frequently), making sure to wear sunscreen even on cold days and limiting the amount of active or exfoliating ingredients and swapping them for gentler ones instead.Drinking a few more glasses of the stuff isn’t going to do anyone any harm, but there’s no guarantee that all of the H2O you drink is going to make it to your skin. So what’s the answer? Putting water on the skin doesn’t seem to make much sense, either, given how tight skin can feel without body lotion after even a lukewarm shower.Crucially, Vichy Minéral 89 pairs this mineral-rich water with hyaluronic acid, which is increasingly being viewed as the secret ingredient when it comes to radiant, hydrated skin.“Hyaluronic acid is a sugary substance that we make naturally in our body – it is found in the skin, eyes, joints, even the umbilical cord,” says Psomadakis. “As people grow older, they lose some of the hyaluronic acid found on the epidermis, the upper layer of our skin.”Hyaluronic acid, which is a very safe ingredient for all skin types, can be natural, or synthetic, and comes in different sizes. While smaller molecules with lower molecular weights can penetrate the skin, higher molecular weight hyaluronic acid is a larger molecule that sits on the surface drawing water to it, helping to smooth and plump the skin.The hyaluronic acid in Minéral 89 is of natural origin, and is a larger molecule, perfect for counteracting the sort of winter dehydration that your skin is likely to be suffering from. As such, Minéral 89 is the only serum to get the British Skin Foundation stamp of approval, which means the foundation has checked over its research and agrees that it stands up. No wonder beauty editor Funmi Fetto described the easy-to-use serum as being “like a glass of water for your skin”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/94e5c5b14b518c644178e963b0bc9ff38ea3349c/0_0_1733_1040/master/1733.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a498d586dc5ff29d892ecfdccfa63b34","title":"me and my water bottle my journey to drinking eight glasses a day","story":"Drinking the recommended amount may seem like an easy target, but many of us find ourselves consuming less water than we should. Writer Anna Fielding describes how she met her hydration goalsThis is by no means a heroic journey, I’m aware of that. Hydration shouldn’t be hard: eight glasses of water a day – sounds pretty simple, right? It comes out of the tap, ready to drink, right there in your kitchen. You don’t even have to leave the house for it.It should feel miraculous, if you think about it in a historical and global context – all this available water, but its abundance works against it. After all, when choosing what to drink, the taste of water doesn’t quite compare with the bite of a short, sharp coffee, or the sugary funk of pineapple juice.Don’t get me wrong, I’m not against water – that would be ridiculous, like being against land or air. I love to mix it with rose oil and bathe in it. I swim in it. I get mesmerised by fountains. I even enjoy drinking it most of the time.Water, when I have enough of it, makes me feel more fluid. My thoughts flow. My skin is plumped up and glows. My eyes are less tired. My online yoga class is easier and, without sounding like a yoghurt advert evangelist, digesting food is easier too. And this personal experience is backed up by medical advice: staying hydrated improves everything from concentration to kidney function. We’re better, all around, with water and we all know that.The problem I have is that I’m easily distracted, which leads to me not drinking enough water throughout the day. Every time I make the conscious effort to hydrate myself, something gets in the way. It might sound ridiculous to you, but it’s true. Even working from home, a measly 15 steps from the kitchen sink, I get caught up in something else – the news, social media, a message from a friend, something interesting on the radio. In non-Covid times, the distractions were even greater.So I finally made the decision that in order to drink more, I’d have to make a very conscious effort to make drinking a part of my daily routine. I started putting a pint glass on the kitchen counter before going to bed. In the morning, I fill it up and drink it while waiting for the kettle to boil. One pint down without even thinking about it – win! I also keep my water bottle in my bicycle basket now. Even if I’m not cycling, the size of my flat means my bike functions as a hallway table and the bottle sits by my keys, purse and gloves. It’s no longer a kitchen object, it’s a leaving-the-house object.There are times, however, when I still need more – and my skin is the first to tell me. As I get older, hangovers increasingly leave me looking like a dried apricot. Coming in from a cold, windy walk to the central heating pinches my face. Some years ago, I discovered hyaluronic acid. It’s a substance we produce in our bodies, found mostly in our skin, eyes and connective tissues, and its main function is to draw and hold water. It’s a key ingredient in Vichy’s Minéral 89 Serum and designed for daily use. But the Minéral 89 Serum also works wonders for when the skin needs an extra boost: when you’ve spent too long in the sun, or when you’re red-faced post-exercise. When my body needs more hydration than I’ve given it, this serum means that at least it won’t show on my skin.One of the main issues I have with drinking the recommended amount is the fact that I have been told so often to drink more water – usually by a strangely serene person on Instagram or a magazine page – and that it has turned into a chore. There’s something to be said about approaching water drinking in the same way as changing the duvet cover or filing a tax return: not bad once you start and you feel better when it’s done.Adding a mild element of fun to the equation can help too, as I’ve discovered. I now fill a blue glass jug to keep on my desk, with ice and some mint in the summer. For colder days, I fill an old teapot with herbal tea, or slices of ginger to flavour my water. We take our pleasures where we can these days, so using my grandmother’s china or the glass I bought in Venice does give a small lift and certainly makes me drink more.We all want easy fixes – and luckily they are available: apply the product, get the good china out, put things where you can see them, and marvel at how quickly you can drink it all in."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/008fde4de742d95b8ac40136d6fa89751880d6a6/0_190_5123_3074/master/5123.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e0834da4def5a06979e43c4e93780c76","title":"prioritise beauty sleep five tips to help boost skin hydration","story":"Even mild dehydration can leave skin looking dry and lacklustre, energy levels depleted and our mood low.

Official advice recommends we drink six to eight glasses (around two litres) of water a day, sipping on small amounts often. You can take it one step further by opting for electrolyte-infused drinks such as coconut water or watermelon juice, which are natural sources of minerals including sodium, calcium, potassium and magnesium.Helping to regulate the fluid balance in your body, electrolytes are essential for sparking healthy cell function and are thought to help speed up recovery after exercising too, particularly if you’ve gone all-out during a sweaty session.Look to smart skincareJust as certain foods deliver key hydration from the inside, smart skincare powered by ingredients that draw in moisture and protect your skin’s natural moisture barrier can work wonders on the outside. “Skin hydration is absolutely paramount to maintaining a healthy skin barrier and ensuring that skin cells shed at a normal pace. Adequate hydration is one of the key elements of a fresh-faced glow and minimises the appearances of cracks, flakes or wrinkles in the skin,” says Psomadakis. “Key ingredients to look for are glycerin and hyaluronic acid.”Vichy Minéral 89 Hyaluronic Acid Hydration Booster, aptly described by beauty editor Funmi Fetto as “a glass of water for your skin”, combines both of these hydrators with the brand’s signature mineralising water to plump up tired skin and protect its barrier function.Calm your mindOur state of mind can have wide-reaching effects on the body, and during bouts of stress or anxiety our skin – the body’s largest organ – can bear the brunt of it. Hormones such as cortisol, which increase in the body when we’re stressed, can lead to inflammation, and flare conditions such as acne, eczema and psoriasis. They have also been shown to impair our skin barrier and increase transepidermal water loss (when moisture is lost through our skin). Daily mindfulness and meditation can help to break the cycle if you’re feeling overwhelmed. Try it with the meditation experts at Headspace, who are currently offering three months of free membership with every Vichy Minéral 89 purchase made on lookfantastic*. “With as little as three minutes practice a day, people can experience the benefits of science-backed meditation, helping the mind to be calmer, clearer, kinder, and more resilient,” says Eve Lewis, director of meditation at Headspace.Prioritise beauty sleepDuring sleep the body repairs itself and replenishes moisture levels in the skin. But studies show that about a third of us don’t get the recommended seven hours of sleep each night. “There is actually some scientific basis to the concept of beauty sleep,” says Psomadakis. “Sleep deprivation leads to increased production of stress hormones and decreased production of antioxidants. This imbalance impairs our skin’s natural defences against external aggressors. This can contribute to loss of hydration, also known as transepidermal water loss, making moisturising all the more essential.”Creating a relaxing bedtime routine can help your mind to switch off before sleep, making good quality rest easier to come by. Try avoiding electronic devices for an hour before bedtime, enjoy an evening meditation to clear your mind, or incorporate a few minutes of relaxing massage into your skincare routine with a hydrating serum to replenish tired skin."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a6794480fda9b2c4e15dbd0ebcfb096656b952ba/0_330_960_576/master/960.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=afa0828d47df6a9c5c2bd42e66b53737","title":"behind closed doors filipina workers trapped by the pandemic","story":"Journalist Corinne Redfern discusses the impact the pandemic has had on the Filipino women trapped overseas, including Mimi (not her real name) who works for a wealthy family in London for just £5 an hour. Mimi was asked to keep working through the first lockdown with the family coaching her on what to say if the police stopped her. In her spare time, Mimi helps other overseas workers escape situations where they are being abusedAnushka Asthana talks to the journalist Corinne Redfern from The Fuller Project about the impact the pandemic has had on the thousands of Filipino women who are stranded overseas. The Philippine government says that approximately one third of its 10 million citizens overseas are women working in “elementary” jobs – a term widely interpreted as referring to domestic workers who are paid low wages to clean homes, cook meals and care for wealthy families, often under horrendous conditions. Human Rights Watch has long described migrant domestic workers, thousands of miles away from home and hidden out of sight in strangers’ houses, as one of the world’s most vulnerable demographics.  The UK issues approximately 23,000 visas to foreign domestic workers every year, half of whom come from the Philippines, according to reports. In the first two months of the coronavirus outbreak, more than half of the Filipino migrant workers surveyed in the UK had lost their jobs, according to a report compiled in June by Dr Ella Parry-Davies and the Kanlungan Filipino Consortium – a London-based consortium of grassroots organisations advocating for Filipino migrants’ rights. Corinne tells Anushka about Mimi (not her real name), a Filipino woman who works for a wealthy family in London who pay her just £5 an hour and asked her to continue to work during the first lockdown, which was illegal. Corinne also tells Anushka about Rowena, who is trapped in Bahrain by an employer who has sexually harassed her. Her boss has promised to pay for her flight home, but he hasn’t told her when, and so Rowena is currently unable to return to her daughter and her grandson in the Philippines.

Thanks very much for following along, commenting and writing in. The Isle of Man will come out of its circuit-breaker lockdown on Monday, chief minister Howard Quayle has said. Schools and businesses will reopen with residents no longer asked to stay at home and precautions such as social distancing and face coverings will be a matter of personal choice. Today is the 17th day where we have seen no unexplained community cases. This is a remarkable achievement and a cause of real optimism. It is clear we are heading in the right direction.I must thank the great Manx public for making the right decisions even though at times I know it was tough.” The Isle of Man entered its second lockdown on January 7 after a rise in Covid-19 cases. Border controls restricting travel to the island remain in place, PA Media reports. Some hospital patients in north Cumbria will be discharged to a hotel due to pressures caused by Covid-19, the county council has said. About 10 people are initially expected to be discharged to temporary care accommodation at the Station hotel in Carlisle, with space available for more, a spokesman for the authority said. He said the arrangements had been made in response to the “unprecedented pressure on health and care services in north Cumbria as a result of Covid-19”, PA reports.John Readman, executive director at Cumbria county council, said: This is a positive new development which means medically-fit people can be discharged from hospital in comfort even if they can’t yet return home because of their circumstances. This is better for the inidual and will help relieve some of the pressure on our hospitals and our care homes, and ensure that medical beds are available for those who need treatment. Northern Ireland’s first minister, Arlene Foster, said the Covid vaccine producer AstraZeneca had raised concerns with her around the potential impact of the NI Protocol on the supply of medicines to the region. There is a grace period of a year over checks on medicines moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland under the post-Brexit arrangements. Arlene Foster said AstraZeneca raised the matter in a meeting with her on Friday. She said it needs clarity before the end of the year “so there is not a cliff edge” in terms of supply. “We need to listen very carefully to their concerns about the end of the year and make sure we take those to Michael Gove and others in the UK government,” she said. Foster said she had a “very useful and constructive” remote meeting with AstraZeneca. The EU will use a “vaccine export transparency mechanism” until the end of March to control vaccine shipments to non-EU countries and to ensure that any exporting company based in the EU first submits its plans to national authorities. This from PA Media:European commission executive vice-president Valdis Dombrovskis told a Brussels press conference: “Today the commission has adopted an implementing regulation making the export of certain products subject to an export authorisation. This regulation concerns the transparency and export of Covid-19 vaccines.” The UK was not named among countries exempted from the new measures.The EU commission has tweeted a 15-minute video from the press conference where the new control mechanism was announced on Friday.“This is a race against the clock, we cannot lose time because of vaccines not being delivered on agreed scale,” EU trade commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis said.Government data up to 28 January shows of the 8,369,438 jabs given in the UK so far, 7,891,184 were first doses - a rise of 443,985 on the previous day’s figures. Some 478,254 were second doses, an increase of 1,956 on figures released the previous day. The seven-day rolling average of first doses given in the UK is now 358,297. Based on the latest figures, an average of 418,166 first doses of vaccine would be needed each day in order to meet the government’s target of 15 million first doses by 15 February, PA reports. The UK reported 29,079 new infections on Friday, slightly up from Thursday’s 28,680.Cases have been rising daily since 26 January, when the daily number of new cases stood at 20,088.The government said the daily number of deaths reported within 28 days of a positive test as of Friday would be delayed due to “issues with processing the data”. Separate figures published by the UK’s statistics agencies for deaths where Covid-19 has been mentioned on the death certificate, together with additional data on deaths that have occurred in recent days, show there have now been 121,000 deaths involving Covid-19 in the UK. The number of rough sleepers known to be living on London’s streets has risen by almost a quarter in three months, figures show. There were 412 rough sleepers deemed to be permanently on the streets between October and December 2020, according to data published by the Greater London Authority. These are people who have been spotted by outreach teams at least five times over a period of at least three weeks. But there were higher numbers of rough sleepers observed who were not seen regularly enough to be deemed as living on the streets. The data, collated by multi-agency database the Combined Homelessness And Information Network (Chain), shows 1,360 people were seen rough sleeping in the period. At the start of the coronavirus crisis, the government asked local authorities to house all rough sleepers and those in hostels and night shelters within days as part of the “Everyone In” campaign. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said the number of people still sleeping rough is a “national disgrace” and must be a wake-up call for the government. He said: “City Hall and London boroughs have helped thousands of rough sleepers into emergency hotel accommodation, many of whom have since been supported into longer-term housing. “However, we cannot ignore the huge number of Londoners who find themselves sleeping on the streets due to the effects of the pandemic. “Teams across the capital are working tirelessly with homelessness charities to help people into accommodation. “Ministers must now redouble their efforts to give all those who are sleeping rough a settled home, including those without recourse to public funds whom the government are making it hardest to help.” It’s a tribute to the ingenuity of the human spirit that the UK and the EU can still come up with new sources of bitter dispute, writes  columnist Marina Hyde. How are you enjoying the vaccine wars? The EU’s meltdown at the UK is one of those rows that turns you into the grimace-face emoji. I’ve now held that expression for three straight days, presumably along with the other 500 million-odd citizens who just want to get home but whose parents are fighting on the pub floor. Guys … please? PLEASE.There is a true coach-crash quality to the EU’s reaction to being outfoxed by the UK on vaccine procurement. The commission’s pram has been dramatically emptied of all its toys. It’s like watching an endlessly patient and mild-mannered social studies teacher finally lose it and head-butt a pupil for beating him in a quiz. Oh, sir … I appreciate you’ve had to deal with some awful behaviour from this particular inidual over the past few years, but I’m afraid … this is not acceptable. Time to put your corduroy jacket, your peace lily and your idealism in a cardboard box and make the final journey out of the staff car park. Right after the policeman has held your head down so you don’t bang it while being helped into the back seat.Europe’s medicines regulator has recommended approving AstraZeneca and Oxford University’s Covid-19 vaccine for people over the age of 18.It is the third Covid-19 vaccine the EMA has recommended for authorisation.“With this third positive opinion, we have further expanded the arsenal of vaccines available to EU and EEA member states to combat the pandemic and protect their citizens,” said Emer Cooke, executive director of EMA.There were not yet enough results for people over the age of 55 to determine how well the vaccine would work for this group, EMA said. However, it said protection was expected and the vaccine can be given to older people.Concerns over its value for the elderly were raised on Thursday when Germany’s vaccine committee said it should be given only to people aged between 18 and 64, due to a lack of data about how effective it is in older people.The latest coronavirus laws are coming into force as part of tougher measures to crack down on illegal gatherings during the pandemic. Fines of £800 for people caught at house parties will become law at 5pm.The penalty will apply for groups of over 15 people and will double after each offence up to a maximum of £6,400 for repeat offenders, the home secretary, Priti Patel, said last week when she announced the plans. This supersedes current rules where the fines stand at £200. But the £10,000 penalties for unlawful groups of more than 30 people will still only apply to the organiser. According to the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (All Tiers and Self-Isolation) (England) (Amendment) Regulations 2021, the £800 fine is cut to £400 if paid within 14 days. As well as those in private dwellings, the rule also applies to similar gatherings in “educational accommodation”, the documents setting out the new law said. I’m now handing over to my colleague Jessica Murray.A total of 7,263,317 Covid-19 vaccinations had taken place in England  between 8 December and 28 January, according to provisional NHS England data, including first and second doses, which is a rise of 344,464 on the previous day’s figures. Of this number, 6,816,945 were the first dose of the vaccine, a rise of 343,193 on the previous day’s figures, while 446,372 were the second dose, an increase of 1,271. Boris Johnson just tweeted this:Public Health Scotland said 515,855 people in the country had received the first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine by 8.30am on Friday 29 January, an increase of 24,197 from the previous day. It added that 7,095 people have received the second dose, an increase of 312. The agency said 70 more patients who tested positive for the virus have died, taking Scotland’s total death toll to 6,040.More than three-quarters of all major hospital trusts in England are currently reporting fewer Covid-19 patients than at their second-wave peak, new analysis shows. In some regions, such as eastern and south-east England, all but one trust has dropped below the level seen at the peak of the second wave of the virus. The proportion of trusts still reporting a record number of Covid-19 patients is slightly higher in north-east and north-west England, however. Examples include: - Mid \u0026amp South Essex NHS Foundation Trust, which reported 676 patients on 26 January, down from a second-wave peak of 920 on 8 January. - Barking, Havering \u0026amp Redbridge University Hospitals NHS Trust, with 357 patients on 26 January, down from a second-wave peak of 518 on 11 January. - East Kent Hospitals University NHS Foundation Trust, which had 297 patients on 26 January, down from 460 on 4 January. - United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust, with 148 patients on 26 January, down from 253 on 4 December."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3cb2a844c85aefcb5ae61a91782f478a1d6a3cd0/1053_0_5084_3054/master/5084.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=d00d5b296fc2bede6e01979ed43dd66b","title":"how effective novavax covid vaccine variants","story":"Everything you need to know about the trial results for the two new coronavirus vaccinesNovavax, made by a US company but trialled in the UK, published its results on Thursday night and, within hours, Johnson \u0026amp Johnson unveiled the final data from trials across the world of the single-dose vaccine made by its Belgian subsidiary Janssen.Heath said the Novavax vaccine had not been tested against the Brazil variant, but said the technology behind the vaccine was very adaptable.About a third of the trial participants were over 60, and the results showed they were just as well protected as the younger groups, which is important because older people are most at risk. There were also no differences between people from different ethnic groups.Participants received two doses, 21 days apart. However, Heath said further information on the efficacy of one dose, or a longer interval, was expected. “With a standard vaccine like this, I would have very little concern about extending the interval between doses, because we know that works with these types of vaccines and indeed potentially it may even be better if there is a longer gap between two doses,” he said.Subject to regulatory approval, the UK has 60m doses of the Novavax vaccine on order, to be manufactured on Teesside at a plant that is expected to be up and running in March or April, with rollout hoped for in the second half of the year. Doses can be kept in a normal fridge rather than at ultra-low temperatures.In December the EU concluded exploratory talks over a contract that would cover 100m initial doses with another 100m to follow, but that deal has not yet been signed. The US awarded Novavax $1.6bn as part of its Warp Speed programme in July with the aim of securing 100m doses by January or February.The Novavax vaccine is different from the OxfordAstraZeneca and the PfizerBioNTech vaccines. It contains spike proteins, produced by moth cells infected with a genetically modified virus, together with a substance called an adjuvant, which boosts the immune response. GlaxoSmithKline and its French partner, Sanofi, also produced a Covid vaccine based on spike proteins and an adjuvant, but trials showed it failed to produce a strong immune response in older people. Heath said it was unclear why the GSKSanofi was less successful than Novavax, but suggested one possibility was that the vaccines used different adjuvants.This is the first single-dose vaccine. There are trials, including one of 15,000 people in the UK, to see whether a second dose increases the efficacy or makes it last longer, but it is considered likely that it will be mostly given as a single dose.The company said it would manufacture 1bn doses this year. Because of a shortage of vaccine factories around the world, it has been heavily investing in new ones and said it could meet that target. Because it is a single-dose vaccine, that quantity could protect 1 billion people. The vaccine, which also can be kept in a normal fridge at 2-8C and easily transported, is especially important for lower-income countries – J\u0026ampJ has promised 500m doses to Covax, the UN initiative to get vaccines to low- and middle-income nations. The US, which helped fund the vaccine through Operation Warp Speed, has bought 100m doses with options for more, while the UK has bought 30m doses and the EU 200m doses. J\u0026ampJ would not be drawn on how soon any would get their supplies.This vaccine is made with a similar technology to the Oxford UniversityAstraZeneca vaccine. It is a protein from the spike of the coronavirus, delivered to train the immune system to respond via a common cold virus. In this case, that delivery adenovirus is from humans, not chimps as with the Oxford version."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/679e6bcf3328a625c2cbdd9100b7fc9a03731e7a/0_270_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=a4ee607c3484b753a98cc98505b19ce7","title":"we had to go it alone how the uk got ahead in the covid vaccine race","story":"Early partnership between Oxford and AstraZeneca, plus upfront funding, proved vital headstartWhen it became clear the China coronavirus outbreak might lead to a global pandemic, Oxford University’s life scientists convened a crisis meeting. It took place on Thursday 30 January last year, and if the rest of the world hadn’t yet realised the potential consequences of what was unfolding in Wuhan, they had.Around the table in the Nuffield Department of Medicine were experts from in and around the university, gathered for a moment they had feared would one day come.It was there that Prof Sarah Gilbert, a vaccine researcher, told her colleagues something remarkable she had devised a likely vaccine, repurposing technology used by her team to develop vaccines against Ebola and Mers.But she also said she badly needed to take the next step.So began the international race to develop, manufacture and deliver drugs to tame a virus that has now killed more than 2 million people, and devastated the lives of many more. A race that this week has become bitter and angry.Back then, Gilbert’s first suggestion was to start working with an Italian manufacturer, Advent, to produce initial stocks for trials and she wanted £1m of university money to underwrite the work.“We just told her to go for it and spend what she needed,” said Prof Richard Cornall, the head of the Nuffield Department of Medicine. “Each of us had to do whatever we could. We were not happy about it, but in a way this was the moment we had all been preparing for.”By the time it became clear to Downing Street that Covid would be the most serious national emergency since the war, the scientists at Oxford and elsewhere were already on their way.In a country not known for thinking strategically about industrial policy, the UK actually had an advantage. Gilbert’s Jenner Institute, for example, was founded in 1998, when Peter Mandelson was industry secretary, and funded at first by the UK drug company GlaxoSmithKline. It was critical in ensuring the UK got ahead.The Oxford scientists began meeting weekly, and by late March, Oxford scientists realised they needed a pharmaceutical giant to manufacture the vast quantities of vaccine required. The initial choice of partner was the US company Merck.However, the prospective deal collapsed. The UK was desperate to secure enough supply for its own citizens – and at the time, ministers including the health secretary, Matt Hancock, were concerned. Not about the EU – but about the behaviour of the then-US president, Donald Trump.“We were worried about vaccine nationalism – but the person we feared was Trump, that he would be able to pressurise a US company, and perhaps buy up the drug stocks,” said a former adviser at the Department of Health. “We never expected there would be a row with the EU.”The British government wanted written guarantees of supply from Merck, but the company was only prepared to give verbal one , the adviser said. The deal fell through.Enter the Anglo-Swedish firm, AstraZeneca, whose French chief executive, Pascal Soriot, was a trusted figure in political circles.At the time, AstraZeneca was not considered a vaccine specialist, but Soriot was prepared to give written undertakings the UK wanted, and was prepared to sell the vaccine at no profit during the pandemic, at $2-5 a dose globally, which was what Oxford’s scientists wanted to hear.AstraZeneca was signed as Oxford’s partner on 30 April and signed a deal to supply 100m doses to the UK a fortnight later. Ministers were prepared to pay a few hundred million upfront, allowing the company to build its first virus manufacturing process, and the UK government to demand its citizens be vaccinated first.“That underpinned all of it,” an industry insider said.Building on relationships established by the Oxford scientists, the vaccine for the UK market is cultivated at sites in Oxford and at Keele, near Stoke. It is then sent to Wrexham, where it is bottled into vials before being dispatched for final tests by UK regulators and sent on to the NHS.AstraZeneca says the headstart it had was vital.The vaccine brewing process – as it described by the company – takes three months and the yield it produces is uncertain. There were yield shortfalls in the UK, but as Soriot said in an interview earlier this week, “we have had an extra three months to fix all the glitches we experienced” before the vaccine was approved at the end of December.With Brexit looming, the UK drew huge criticism for declining to join EU schemes to purchase PPE and ventilators. There was also growing pressure to join a joint EU procurement plan for vaccines, and to put aside the Brexit rhetoric.But Brussels’ demands were eye-watering: the UK, unlike EU member states, would not be able to take part in the governance of the scheme, including the steering group or the negotiating team.Britain would have no say in what vaccines to procure, at what price or in what quantity, and for what delivery schedule. There would be no side-deals possible.British officials were not convinced. “We had to go it alone,” said a UK source. “There was nothing there for us.” By the time a special UK vaccine taskforce was created in April, the seeds of a successful strategy had been sown.Run from May by the venture capitalist Kate Bingham, a no-nonsense operator, it directed government money up and down the vaccine supply chain, and helped ensure that two other vaccine candidates were manufactured in the UK – an interventionist policy not seen since before the days of Margaret Thatcher.Meanwhile, over the Channel, Brussels’ faltering efforts soon convinced Downing Street that it had done the right thing.There had been concerns from the beginning of the crisis in key EU capitals that others – the US in particular – would steal a march in the hunt for a successful vaccine. But despite the anxiety, the process of organising and purchasing prospective vaccines had been slow.There was an early initiative by the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, to steal away CureVac, a biotech company working on a coronavirus vaccine, from Donald Trump, with whom it was in talks. The EU offered the company €80m in financial backing. “I hope that with this support, we can have a vaccine on the market, perhaps before autumn,” Von der Leyen said at the time. CureVac is still yet to come good. The governments of Germany, Italy, France and the Netherlands had privately decided they could not wait on Brussels finding common agreement among the 27 on a strategy – and they spotted the potential in AstraZeneca from the start.The so-called “inclusive alliance” group drafted a one-page set of terms for a deal for between 300m and 400m doses of the OxfordAstraZeneca jab. But other EU member states were getting restive, concerned that they were being left out.The four governments passed on the negotiation to the commission “for the common good”, recalled Prof Walter Ricciardi, an adviser to the Italian government on its coronavirus strategy.“We opened the door for the commission to take over but even then it took time, even when we tried to speed up the process,” Ricciardi said. “There were some countries fully aware of the importance of the vaccine but there were others that were reluctant to put money into this without guarantees of the result. That took time and the best possible energy of the commission. They did recruit the best possible officers to do that but it was a long process”.It was another three months before the commission finally signed the deal, behind the UK, with some serious ramifications to come. Authorisation of any vaccines would be done through the European medicines agency, rather than national regulators, to ensure that the rollout was done across the EU in tandem. But that also proved a fateful decision.The slower authorisation by the EMA ensured that liability for the vaccine – should it prove dangerous – could potentially be pinned on the pharmaceutical companies during contract negotiations.But if they were maintaining solidarity and perhaps even earning some extra public confidence, they were giving up speed.The fast-track mechanisms available to national regulators, including the UK’s medicines and healthcare regulatory authority, gave Britain another potential advantage.Nevertheless, with the announcement in early November that the German startup BioNTech had made a breakthrough in the development of a new type of vaccine to combat Covid-19, hopes remained high that the bloc was on the right path.“It is Europe’s moment”, Von der Leyen tweeted in mid-December as she announced that between 27 and 29 December, people across the EU’s 27 member states would be vaccinated. “We protect our citizens together,” she said. But her confidence was misplaced. There were hidden frailties.Rasmus Hansen, the chief executive of Airfinity, a data analytics company working in the life sciences sector, said the EU had failed to invest as it should have in scaling-up production plants.The EU had spent just €1.78bn in “risk money”, cash handed to pharmaceutical companies without any guarantee of a return, compared to €1.9bn by the UK and €9bn by the US, he said. There were consequences.The first hit to the EU strategy was the announcement by PfizerBioNTech, one of only two vaccine producers authorised for use in the EU at this stage – along with Moderna, with whom only a smaller order has been made – that they needed to slow down production in order to upgrade a facility in Belgium and boost output in late February.This did not unduly upset officials initially. They had AstraZeneca, and its total of 400m doses, coming down the line. “I am not sure why this debate is there because the numbers are there, the production is ramping up,” Sandra Gallina, the commission’s chief negotiator, told MEPs on 12 January.Shortages have been reported across Europe, with programmes suspended in Madrid and Paris, and the loss of the OxfordAstraZeneca offered little hope of a pick-up in momentum.Officials angrily pointed to the success of the British end of AstraZeneca’s vaccine production. “If the UK plants are working better, are we expecting the UK plants to deliver doses to us? Yes. Yes. Yes. They are part of our contract,” argued an official.Gallina, shaken by the move, ed into the customs records to find evidence that AstraZeneca had shipped EU-produced doses to the UK – but without success.AstraZeneca’s chief executive gave an interview with a group of European newspapers. “The UK agreement was reached in June, three months before the European one,” Soriot said.“As you could imagine, the UK government said the supply coming out of the UK supply chain would go to the UK first. Basically, that’s how it is.”The commission has accused AstraZeneca of a breach of contract. It has given its member states the power to block exports of vaccines, raising the spectre of Pfizer doses not being delivered to the UK. But at a meeting of EU ambassadors with commission officials earlier this week, the message was that the capitals were unimpressed.“The commission was told to change the terms of the debate – we just want vaccines,” said one diplomatic source. “That’s all we want”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c89a8b79d02923f1f12598c8f98c1cf8a6907f43/0_128_3145_1886/master/3145.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTMucG5n\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=286344e47dd39b003d537b6ffcb41e09","title":"rspb big garden birdwatch a photo essay lockdown birdwatching","story":"The UK’s largest citizen science project runs from 29-31 January with more people than ever expected to take part thanks to birdwatching’s lockdown boomFor much of the past 12 months, while we haven’t been able to venture further than the local park or the end of our garden path, many of us have taken vicarious pleasure in following the flight paths of migrating birds, which are still free to spread their wings. The Arctic tern, for example, makes a UK stopover on its annual migration as it chases the sun between the Arctic and Antarctic summers.Birdsong floating through our windows and into our homes has been one of the most joyful and uplifting sounds of 2020. And from Friday, the RSPB is asking us to stay tuned and join it for the Big Garden Birdwatch (BGBW), the largest citizen science project in the UK.“There has been unprecedented interest in the BGBW this year,” says Beccy Speight, chief executive of the RSPB. Since its inception in 1979, the BGBW has asked as many people as possible to record the number of birds of any species they see in their garden at any one time over a one-hour period. “Last year, more than half a million people took part from their gardens or balconies, and we are hopeful for even more this year,” says Speight. “We offer a really good bird ID chart, which you can get hold of on the website, so don’t think, ‘I don’t know anything about birds therefore I can’t do it’. You can use it as a way to start learning how to identify them.”The success of the Self-Isolating Bird Club, “a virtual space for wildlife watchers and enthusiasts to share pictures and videos” created by Chris Packham the day before the first lockdown last March, suggests there will be more hawk-eyes and craned necks than ever before. Packham says “more than 10 million people” have engaged with the club online, and such a “profound response” has been uplifting.“We wanted to draw attention to the fact that even humble everyday species could offer enormous interest, respite, joy, if you just took a second look at them. Or you stopped to listen to them rather than just hearing them. It was about getting people to take a further step of engagement, when it comes to the wildlife that surrounds them.”The RSPB has a history of connecting people to birds, native and from far-flung shores. The society was founded in 1889 by philanthropist Emily Williamson in response to the trade in plumage for women’s fashion. Initially called the Plumage League, the all-women’s society cost 2d (1p in new money) to join, and forbade the wearing of any bird not killed for food – except ostriches.Speight says: “It was the height of fashion to have exotic bird feathers and even whole dead birds on hats. These women were really concerned about that, and in particular about birds like the egret and the bird of paradise that were being threatened by this trade. They started the society to fight that.”As a result of their pioneering work, the society gained its Royal Charter in 1904. In 1921, the Importation of Plumage (Prohibition) Act was passed, forbidding the shipment of feathers to Britain.The RSPB is now the largest nature conservation charity in Europe, with more than a million members, and manages 160,000 hectares for the preservation of nature. “We want to see a worldricher in nature, where people thrive as well,” says Speight.In between lockdowns, the society’s 170 nature reserves were popular day-trip destinations, and during lockdown they have served as peaceful places for local people to exercise. Though many of us are now unable to visit these bird sanctuaries, we continue to look to the skies for comfort. “We’ve seen huge surges in terms of visits to our website, particularly around bird identification,” adds Speight.Packham says: “It’s free, it’s cheap, it’s a walk in the park, it’s listening to birdsong, it’s putting up a window box, putting up a nesting box, it’s feeding those birds. It’s really simple things that everyone can do, and they have recognised that that can be such an asset to their lives.”Matt Wainhouse and Amy Trotter say that as a result of being regularly taken walking through Eastville park in Bristol, their 15-month-old son Kitt is now a budding ornithologist. Kingfishers are the most famous residents of the park but, says Matt, “duck” was actually one of Kitt’s first words. “As soon as we weren’t able to escape the city, we started to explore local places more. We started to find lots of little paths that go off through the woodlands that we didn’t know were there. We’ve seen a lot more bird life.”Roanna Burt, from Bristol, is planning to participate for the first time in the Big Garden Birdwatch alongside her partner Liam O’Connor – and to make use of her Christmas binoculars. She says: “I’ve always been a nature nerd and I need to get outside, particularly if I am having a crap day. The lockdown, though, has highlighted how vital it is. Small things, like spotting a robin or a wren, can make a big difference. I hadn’t seen a wren in years.” The RSPB’s Speight says that watching birds is an accessible way of starting to find out more about nature. She adds that the BGBW gives a massive snapshot of the state of wildlife across the UK: “We ask people to submit their results either online or in hard copy. It all gets analysed and we publish the results in April. That data allows us to spot anything that’s changing in terms of our garden birds.” “You start seeing these patterns, and it tells us where there are species that are in trouble. We can then do the work to find out what might be causing that, and how we can turn it around.” Although many of the changes needed to address this decline are at policy level, the RSPB estimates that the land mass of all the gardens in the UK is more than all of the UK’s nature reserves combined. This means those of us with access to gardens, allotments or just a window can lend a helping hand to the UK’s beleaguered bird life.“Birds use an enormous amount of energy trying to find the food they need to survive. If we can make that a bit easier for them by putting clean feeders out, more will survive the winter,” Speight says. “Water is equally important – making sure there is fresh clean water both for drinking and bathing. Letting your grass grow a little longer, not cutting back all of your trees and shrubs – all of those things help.”As 15-month-old Kitt points with urgency and excitement at the electric-blue flash of a kingfisher, his mother Amy is optimistic about our newfound national interest in birdlife. “I think people have been changed in lots of ways by lockdown, and hopefully this will be one of the positive ways,” she says.Speight says: “When you watch a bird in your garden, that bird is a completely other species carrying on and living its life in a different way, but it’s doing it 10 feet away. I think from the enjoyment you might get watching blue tits on your feeder, you can then open the door to this bigger story about what’s happening to our natural world and how we can all play a part in helping it.”Packham agrees: “People have come to like the fact that they are contributing to something meaningful, which will inform better conservation. It is part and parcel of the whole thing now: when I was a kid you just liked birds now, if you like birds, you’ve got to like looking after them.”• To download a free bird identification pack and find what is needed to participate in the RSPB 2021 Big Garden Bird Watch, 29-31 January, go to rspb.org.uk.

Further afield, the US and Canada are also not included.Those who cannot be targeted with export bans include neighbouring countries, such as Switzerland and Norway. Outside of Europe, countries exempted include Israel, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Palestine, Syria, Tunisia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Israel, Moldova and Ukraine.The mechanism raises fears that doses made by Pfizer for the UK market could be at risk of an export ban if the company continues to have its own production problems. Vaccine suppliers will also have to disclose details of their exports over the last three months.Brussels has pushed for the shortfall to be made good using imports from AstraZeneca’s UK plants. The company recently assured the UK government that it would be able to satisfy its pledge of delivering 2m doses a week.AstraZeneca’s chief executive, Pascal Soriot, has said it is contractually obliged to only export doses from its plants in Oxford and Staffordshire to the EU once it has fulfilled its obligation to the UK. But Brussels believes doses may have been transported from the company’s plants in Belgium and Germany to the UK.On Friday, the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said it was “crystal clear” that AstraZeneca was bound by its contract to deliver coronavirus vaccine doses produced in the UK.As AstraZeneca agreed to publish a redacted version of its contract with the commission, Von der Leyen dismissed Soriot’s argument that his company had committed only to make “best efforts” to supply the EU, given the vagaries of the production process and its other contractual obligations.The commission has paid €336m (£298m) for 400m doses, the first 100m of which were due to be delivered in the first quarter of this year.“There are binding orders and the contract is crystal clear,” Von der Leyen said. “AstraZeneca has also explicitly assured us in this contract that no other obligations would prevent the contract from being fulfilled.”She said the “best effort” clause in the AstraZeneca contract with the EU was supposed to refer to the period during which the company was developing the vaccine. “This is now in the past … Once a vaccine is there, there were very clear rules regarding amounts as well as timeframes – they are in the contract – and there are also locations where the vaccine should be produced.”The UK said it could not publish details of its AstraZeneca supply contract because it would jeopardise national security.The lack of doses in the EU has already forced the Spanish government to announce a temporary pause in its rollout in Madrid, and to warn that Catalonia could follow. The public health agency for Paris and the surrounding region, an area with a population of 12.1 million people, informed hospitals on Thursday that it would suspend its programme from 2 February. Germany’s health minister, Jens Spahn, said on Friday: “We still have some difficult weeks of vaccine shortages ahead of us.”Additional reporting by Kate Connolly and Rupert Neate"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b36430b7589dd3d9ec000865e5f6451dfa7b344a/0_138_4288_2573/master/4288.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=2472e4183cb4fbe3a15ed0b7096f9755","title":"emmanuel macron coronavirus vaccine exports eu controlled","story":"French president bemoans ‘questionable behaviour’ and says deliveries ‘do not honour’ contractual agreementsEmmanuel Macron has said Europe will not block or ban exports of coronavirus vaccines but that they should be “controlled”, accusing AstraZeneca of a lack of transparency after the British-Swedish pharmaceutical company said it could not fulfil the whole of its contract with the EU.In an interview with the  and a small group of other media, the French president insisted it was in everyone’s interest for all countries to have access to vaccines.He also said the AstraZeneca vaccine, given approval by the EU regulator on Friday for use on all adults, appeared to be “quasi-ineffective” on people older than 65, though he acknowledged he had no figures or official information. “And imagine the hypothesis that France, Italy, Germany have a vaccine strategy that is extremely ambitious and rapid. It will quickly fail if our neighbours don’t have the same vaccine strategy because our economies are integrated. France has 500,000 trans-border workers. So all this will only work if we do it together.”Speaking at the Elysée, Macron said: “Vaccine exports should be controlled, not blocked or banned, which would make no sense because we are also dependent on non-European production.“It should be controlled because there is questionable behaviour and we will be receiving fewer deliveries that do not honour the contractual engagements agreed.” He added that Europe’s response to the contractual failure “will be proportional”. “But we cannot have contractual agreements made with laboratories then reviewed because of pressure from one or other countries. The situation with vaccines is unusual, but I believe strongly in the benefits of cooperation.“AstraZeneca is a major laboratory that has its base in the UK, but which is also very present in France and Europe. There is no benefit to having a strategy of non-cooperation.“There has been a lack of transparency in the lack of information given, particularly from AstraZeneca … we have doubts and we want to be sure that if a company is not able to honour its contract, it’s not because it has over-delivered elsewhere. And that’s why cooperation is so important.”The European Medicines Agency authorised the OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine for use in all adult age groups on Friday, after German authorities had earlier recommended that its use be limited to people under 65 due to a lack of a data about efficacy in older groups. The vaccine’s developers and regulators in the UK have strongly defended its efficacy in all groups.Going further than German authorities, who had assessed only that efficacy had not yet been demonstrated for over-65s, Macron suggested the vaccine was less useful in the immediate crisis at hand.“We have to be realistic: the real problem with the AstraZeneca vaccine is that it doesn’t work in the way we expected,” Macron said. “We have very little information … but all the indications today are that it is quasi-ineffective for those over 65 years old.In further critical remarks, Macron added: “AstraZeneca is not a vaccine-producing company. I have a lot of respect for the researchers who have tried to participate in the collective effort, they have done great research at Oxford, but they clearly have problems with the development as we have seen. We hope it can be improved.”Macron said it was not his role to question other countries’ vaccination policies, but did suggest the British government was playing fast and loose with the science by extending the period between Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine doses to 12 weeks.“When you read all the health notices, when even the producers say that for it to work there has to be two injections, which is the case with the Pfizer, when you listen to the scientists … I’m not sure you can say you are vaccinated when you have had the first injection of a vaccine that needs two,” he said.He added: “We have to find a balance. I am not in favour of abandoning all precautions. We have to rely on good science. If we have vaccine programmes that don’t respect the science, that’s a problem for me because it’s putting our citizens in possible danger.”Chris Whitty, the UK’s chief medical officer, has said delaying the second dose was a “public health decision” based on the best advice and balance of risks. But the move has proved controversial: while there is evidence from trials that a 12-week gap does not reduce the efficacy of the OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine, Pfizer has stressed it has no data on whether protection after the first dose is sustained after three weeks.Asked about the cross-Channel blame game over not just vaccines, but Brexit and coronavirus controls, in which he is often personally named, Macron laughed off the personal attacks: “Whenever there’s a problem with the EU, the British just love to detest the French – and me – and say we are responsible. I have accepted this role. Sometimes when there are tensions, I ask ‘Why me’, it is perhaps making me out to be more important than I am!”On a more serious note, he added: “I like your country a lot, but as I have already said, I think Brexit is an error. I respect the sovereignty of the people and the people voted so it had to be done, but I think that vote was based on a lot of lies and now we see it has made things much more difficult in many ways.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a90dc5c7fefe0ffd66975b4ebda58d66d28cfeb5/0_56_2764_1659/master/2764.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7158b07c38521cfff2059777f2a3f582","title":"janssen one dose vaccine shown to work against covid","story":"UK has bought 30m doses of product that could transform world’s immunisation programmesA fifth vaccine, made by the US company Johnson \u0026amp Johnson, has shown efficacy against the coronavirus, giving complete protection against hospitalisation and death, and could transform prospects for protecting both the UK and the rest of the world, because it needs only a single dose.The vaccine, made by the US giant’s subsidiary Janssen, based in Belgium, was trialled with 44,000 people in the US, South Africa and Brazil. The US has ordered 100m doses with an option for more. Further trials involving a second dose are taking place in the UK – and the British government has bought 30m doses. The EU has ordered 400m doses. The company could not say what the timetable for supply would be, assuming regulators approve it.The vaccine is one of six backed by Operation Warp Speed in the US. Dr Anthony Fauci, director for the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Disease and in charge of the US response to Covid under the Biden administration, said it was an “absolutely spectacular result”. Because of the need for only one shot, it would be easier to protect large populations. The way to end the global pandemic was “to vaccinate as many people as quickly as we can to prevent the virus replicating”, he said.The results showed that the protection did not vary across age groups, and was as strong in the over-60s, who are at highest risk from Covid and made up about a third of the participants, as in younger people. It also did not vary between groups of different ethnicities.“We have a vaccine that works in all ages and does the critical function of keeping people out of hospital,” said Operation Warp Speed’s Covid-19 response vaccine lead, Matt Hepburn, at a briefing on the results.“We also have a vaccine where, frankly, small is beautiful.” he said. The vaccine needs only one shot and can be stored and transported at fridge temperatures of 2C to 8C, unlike the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.Janssen has agreed in principle to supply up to 500m doses to Covax, the UN initiative to get vaccines to lower-income countries. It is the second biggest order for Covax after the AstraZeneca vaccine. The company said it had been investing heavily in new factories around the world to have the capacity to manufacture 1bn doses this year.“The potential to significantly reduce the burden of severe disease, by providing an effective and well-tolerated vaccine with just one immunisation, is a critical component of the global public health response,” said Paul Stoffels, chief scientific officer of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson.The vaccine is based on a J\u0026ampJ vaccine successfully used against Ebola. It is similar to the OxfordAstraZeneca design, which has not yet been approved in the US, but delivers a protein from the spike of the coronavirus through a human common cold rather than chimp adenovirus.The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency in the UK have already been looking at the early data. J\u0026ampJ said it would be filing for emergency authorisation in the US, Europe and the UK next week. .The US has an agreement to buy 100m doses of J\u0026ampJ’s vaccine for $1bn (£730m). The company said in a statement the vaccine would be ready immediately upon emergency approval but declined to specify how many doses. The US government also has the option of purchasing an additional 200m doses.Three vaccines have so far been authorised by various regulators around the world: those from PfizerBioNTech, Moderna and OxfordAstraZeneca. The European Medicines Agency approved the Oxford vaccine on Friday. A fourth vaccine, from Novavax, published results from last-stage trials on Thursday and will also now go forward for approval."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/230fce450d54be75ae06ddc30d8ce87f779fb6d3/0_115_4993_2996/master/4993.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=4a36f4ddb191c72dc2c30a6f8186294e","title":"oxford astrazeneca covid vaccine full approval eu regulator","story":"European Medicines Agency approves jab for use in all age groups above 18, despite German doubtsThe European Medicines Agency has authorised the OxfordAstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine for use in all adult age groups after days of doubt.A month after it received approval in the UK, the EU’s regulator declared the vaccine safe for general use across the 27 member states.The shot is the third Covid-19 vaccine given the green light by the EMA, after ones made by Pfizer and Moderna. Both were authorised for all adults.There had been concerns that a lack of data about the effects of the vaccine on older people could put authorisation for those aged over 65 in doubt.On Friday Germany’s independent vaccine advisory committee recommended that the shot only be given to people under 65. The committee, known by its German acronym Stiko said that “there currently isn’t sufficient data to assess the vaccine effectiveness from the age of 65”. The final decision rests with the government, but it is likely to follow this advice.In an interview with la Repubblica on Tuesday, AstraZeneca’s CEO, Pascal Soriot, said his company’s latest studies had shown “very strong antibody production against the virus in the elderly, similar to what we see in younger people”. The British prime minister, Boris Johnson, had also said he had confidence that the vaccine was safe and “produced an immune response in all age groups”.On Friday Soriot welcomed the EMA’s decision. “Today’s recommendation underscores the value of AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine, which is not only effective and well-tolerated, but also easy to administer and, importantly, protects fully against severe disease and hospitalisations,” he said in a statement.The agency cited the immune responses seen and experienced with other vaccines in recommending it for older people. “At least some protection is expected,” Bruno Sepodes from the EMA’s expert committee said at a news briefing. He acknowledged that “the exact level of protection cannot be estimated for the time being”.Many countries on the continent have been struggling to vaccinate people as quickly as Britain, Israel, the US and elsewhere, and it was long hoped that the AstraZeneca shot would help speed things up. On top of the recent news that the drugmaker would supply fewer doses in an initial batch, there were concerns that an age restriction would further hamper Europe’s vaccination program.“With this third positive opinion, we have further expanded the arsenal of vaccines available to EU and EEA member states to combat the pandemic and protect their citizens,” said Emer Cooke, the EMA’s executive director."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d550d7fc44972d6e57cab0a2da06b4a2d7543c9f/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=302fdabcf49fa0823a6a27a794fc064c","title":"tributes to slave traders and colonialists removed across uk","story":"Exclusive: almost 70 memorials renamed or being taken down since last summers Black Lives Matter protestsScores of tributes to slave traders, colonialists and racists have been taken down or will be removed across the UK, a  investigation has found, with hundreds of others under review by local authorities and institutions.In what was described by historians as an “unprecedented” public reckoning with Britain’s slavery and colonial past, an estimated 39 names – including streets, buildings and schools – and 30 statues, plaques and other memorials have been or are undergoing changes or removal since last summer’s Black Lives Matter protests.The movement to remove contentious landmarks has involved a wide section of society, from schools and universities to private landlords, pubs, churches, charitable trusts and councils.They include a statue in the Guildhall of Sir John Cass and William Beckford – both had significant links to the slave trade – announced last week by the City of London, the kneeling black man sundial at Dunham Massey Hall and a statue of the colonial governor Thomas Picton, which is in the process of being removed from Cardiff City Hall.The University of Edinburgh has renamed the David Hume Tower because of the philosopher’s alleged racism Imperial College London has stopped using its Latin motto, which can be translated as “scientific knowledge, the crowning glory and the safeguard of the empire” University of Liverpool renamed its Gladstone Hall building due to the former prime minister’s links to slavery and both London politan University and University of East London renamed schools associated with Cass.Four streets – John Hawkins Square in Plymouth, and in London, Havelock Road, Black Boy Lane and Cassland Road Gardens – are being renamed. Councils across Scotland, England, and Wales are actively consulting on a further 21 streets.Statues have been removed from two schools in England, six have changed their names because of links to slavery and colonialism, while seven others have removed “inappropriate” house names within schools.Other removals of names deemed offensive include five pubs called Black Boy and one named Black’s Head, and two pet graves, including the black labrador dog mascot buried at RAF Scampton, whose name was a racial slur. understands the Bank of England is to remove from display portraits of governors and directors involved in the slave trade.There are also audits and reviews under way into monuments and landmarks across the the country.In November, the Welsh government identified 209 monuments, buildings or street names linked with slavery. The first minister, Mark Drakeford, said the audit was part of “a much bigger piece of work” that would consider how the nation moves forward.Similar reviews have been commissioned by Glasgow city council, which predates the Black Lives Matter protests, and by the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, on the capital’s landmarks, and 130 Labour-led councils across the country, including the cities of Manchester and Birmingham.  data does not yet include the vast majority of iconographies being investigated in these reviews.Hakim Adi, the first person of African heritage to become a professor of history in Britain, and now of Chichester University, said: “It is unprecedented. I can’t think of a similar movement to effect a reckoning with the glorification of slavery, colonialism, empire, human trafficking and crimes against humanity. I don’t think there’s ever been anything on this level nationally.”The removals follow Black Lives Matter protests, which saw more than 260 towns and cities hold anti-racism protests in June and July. The demonstrations, including the toppling of the statue of the slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol, were the largest anti-racism protests in Britain for decades.In some areas, the removals have been fiercely resisted by local residents. The campaign group Save Our Statues said it had helped to gather 195,000 signatures over 40 different petitions that have been debated at council meetings, which helped lead to decisions to keep the statues of Sir Francis Drake in Plymouth and Clive of India in Shrewsbury.Earlier this month, the government announced plans to change the law to protect statues from what Robert Jenrick, the communities secretary, called “baying mobs”.But Adi, who specialises in the history of Africa and the African diaspora, described attempts to remove monuments linked with slavery and racism as democracy in action, and criticised the government’s response.“If the government is really concerned about inequality and racism, they would be the first to say yes, let’s put these statues in a special museum dedicated to crimes against humanity and stop glorifying people publicly.“But they take the opposite view. So then you have to question everything they say about wanting a more just and equal society, a society without racism, because it’s just hypocrisy.”In June, the archbishop of Canterbury announced a “very careful” review of statues at major places of worship. A John Gordon plaque at St Peter’s, Dorchester, that hailed his “bravery” for helping to quell the 1760 uprising by slaves across Jamaica, was covered up and in the process of being removed.Robert Beckford, a professor of black theology at the Queen’s Foundation, welcomed the removal of these iconographies, but warned: “There’s the danger that the statues will go down and plaques will be removed, but the racist structures remain. I’m interested in a holistic response that enables us to keep in balance a recognition of how and why these statues were erected.“And secondly, how we then deem the history in a way that is inclusive and just and providing us with a vision of what it means to be a multicultural, multi-ethnic nation.”Sharon Heal, director of the Museums Association, said museums have a crucial role to play in hosting conversation and debate on these issues and providing historical context. “This isn’t erasure, it’s the deepening and a broadening of our understanding of Britain’s past and from a museum perspective gaining a deeper understanding of the objects and the collections that we hold,” she said.“If you bring in multiple voices, whether that’s from UK communities, academia, or communities outside the UK, then you’re bound to uncover some really exciting, rich, erse histories and stories that we hadn’t previously encountered.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88126755facf41abada1799f021ead32fa37cb7a/390_208_4339_2603/master/4339.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=912b7f03cdea3d1f1f4c201457d91e02","title":"coronavirus live news novavax effective against uk variant but less so against south african one","story":"NI first minister brands move an ‘incredible act of hostility’ Germany bans travellers from UK, Ireland, Brazil, South Africa and PortugalAn international team of World Health Organization experts has visited a hospital in Wuhan, China, that saw some of the first cases of Covid in December 2019, my colleague Emma Graham-Harrison reports. Read the full story here:Spain’s Covid death toll rose by 513 on Friday to 58,319, in one of the highest one-day increases since the first wave of the pandemic, health ministry data indicates.It said 38,118 new infections had also been detected, off last week’s record of 44,357, as pressures on hospitals continue to mount.Reuters report that, in another alarming sign, the Madrid region has reported an outbreak in a nursing home that has caused 11 deaths and infected all its 48 residents, as well as 17 staff. The EU has moved to prevent Northern Ireland (NI) from being used as a back door to funnel Covid vaccines from the bloc into the rest of the UK.Arlene Foster, Northern Ireland’s (NI) first minister, has branded the EU’s triggering of article 16 of Brexit’s NI Protocol to stop the unfettered flow of inoculations from the EU into the region an “incredible act of hostility”. The protocol, which is part of the Brexit withdrawal deal, normally allows for free movement of goods from the EU into NI, PA media reports.Under its terms, goods should be able to move freely between the bloc and NI as the region remains in the single market for goods, operating under EU customs rules.Amid an escalating row over provision of the OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine, the EU has triggered article 16 of the protocol to temporarily place export controls on this movement in respect of vaccines.The move to activate article 16 will frustrate any effort to use NI as a back door to bring vaccines into Great Britain.By triggering article 16 in this manner, the European Union has once again shown it is prepared to use Northern Ireland when it suits their interests but in the most despicable manner – over the provision of a vaccine which is designed to save lives. At the first opportunity, the EU has placed a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland over the supply chain of the coronavirus vaccine.Hello everyone. I’ll be running the live blog for the rest of the evening. As always, feel free to get in touch on Twitter if you have any story tips or coverage suggestions. Wealthy countries must avoid repeating past mistakes of hoarding medicines and vaccines, the World Health Organization has said, warning it would only drag out the pandemic, AFP reports.WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus decried the skirmish in wealthy countries to secure large amounts of various vaccines against the coronavirus while few doses have yet to reach poorer nations.“The pandemic has exposed and exploited the inequalities of our world,” he told journalists, warning that there now was “the real danger that the very tools that could help to end the pandemic - vaccines - may exacerbate those same inequalities.”“Vaccine nationalism might serve short-term political goals. But it’s ultimately short-sighted and self-defeating,” he said.The WHO co-leads the COVAX facility, which is working to procure vaccines and ensure doses are delivered equitably around the world. The facility expects to begin delivering doses within a few weeks, and Tedros said the aim was for vaccination of health workers and older people to be underway in all countries within the first 100 days of 2021.Tedros urged the world avoid repeating past mistakes, pointing to the HIVAIDS crisis, where wealthy countries acquired life-saving medicines nearly a decade before they became affordable in poorer countries.He also pointed to the H1N1 flu pandemic in 2009, when vaccines only reached poorer nations after the outbreak was over. “I don’t think that is a good history. It is bad history,” he said.Africa’s biggest film festival, which had been scheduled to run in Burkina Faso’s capital Ouagadougou from 27 February to 6 March, has been postponed because of the coronavirus pandemic, AFP reports.The Pan-African Festival of Cinema and Television of Ouagadougou, known by its acronym in French of FESPACO, is an eagerly-awaited showcase held every two years.Burkina’s cabinet today “took the decision to postpone the holding of FESPACO to a later date,” government spokesman Ousseni Tamboura told a press conference.Founded in 1969, FESPACO stipulates that films chosen for competition have to be made by Africans and predominantly produced in Africa.Burkina Faso, a landlocked country in the Sahel, has so far recorded 10,423 Covid-19 cases, of which 120 have been fatal, but like other countries in Africa is struggling with a worrying second wave of the virus.“Given the health situation, both nationally and internationally, in relation to the coronavirus pandemic, it will be hard to hold FESPACO at the scheduled time,” Tamboura said. “It won’t be easy for us to decide (a new date) because this is linked to developments in the health situation.”Here are Emmanuel Macron’s remarks which he made to reporters earlier, as cited in the AstraZeneca press conference (see 6.03pm).He has said Europe would not block or ban exports of coronavirus vaccines but that they should be “controlled”, accusing AstraZeneca of a lack of transparency after the British-Swedish pharmaceutical company said it could not fulfil the whole of its contract with the EU.Macron also said the AstraZeneca vaccine, given approval by the EU regulator today for use on all adults, appeared to be “quasi-ineffective” on people older than 65, though he acknowledged he had no figures or official information.And imagine the hypothesis that France, Italy, Germany have a vaccine strategy that is extremely ambitious and rapid. It will quickly fail if our neighbours don’t have the same vaccine strategy because our economies are integrated. France has 500,000 trans-border workers. So all this will only work if we do it together.”Vaccine exports should be controlled, not blocked or banned, which would make no sense because we are also dependent on non-European production.It should be controlled because there is questionable behaviour and we will be receiving fewer deliveries that do not honour the contractual engagements agreed.He added that Europe’s response to the contractual failure “will be proportional”.But we cannot have contractual agreements made with laboratories then reviewed because of pressure from one or other countries. The situation with vaccines is unusual, but I believe strongly in the benefits of cooperation.AstraZeneca is a major laboratory that has its base in the UK, but which is also very present in France and Europe. There is no benefit to having a strategy of non-cooperation.There has been a lack of transparency in the lack of information given, particularly from AstraZeneca … we have doubts and we want to be sure that if a company is not able to honour its contract, it’s not because it has over-delivered elsewhere. And that’s why cooperation is so important.Going further than German authorities, who had assessed only that efficacy had not yet been demonstrated for over-65s, Macron suggested the vaccine was less useful in the immediate crisis at hand.We have to be realistic: the real problem with the AstraZeneca vaccine is that it doesn’t work in the way we expected,” Macron said. “We have very little information … but all the indications today are that it is quasi-ineffective for those over 65 years old.AstraZeneca is not a vaccine-producing company. I have a lot of respect for the researchers who have tried to participate in the collective effort, they have done great research at Oxford, but they clearly have problems with the development as we have seen. We hope it can be improved.Macron said it was not his role to question other countries’ vaccination policies, but did suggest the British government was playing fast and loose with the science by extending the period between Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine doses to 12 weeks.When you read all the health notices, when even the producers say that for it to work there has to be two injections, which is the case with the Pfizer, when you listen to the scientists … I’m not sure you can say you are vaccinated when you have had the first injection of a vaccine that needs two.The Oman Open golf tournament, which was scheduled to take place in March, has been postponed after the nation called an immediate and sweeping halt to all sporting events, AFP reports.The European PGA Tour event was due to take place from 4-7 March at Al Mouj Golf in Muscat. The ruling decreed all gatherings, international functions and sporting events would be stopped in the country with immediate effect.Organisers and hosts are hoping to reschedule the event but no plans or dates have been revealed at this stage.France’s coronavirus death toll has risen above 75,000 as the government reported 820 new deaths, taking the cumulative total to 75,620, Reuters reports.Today’s figure included 355 deaths in hospitals, compared with 344 yesterday, and 465 deaths in retirement homes over the past three days, health ministry data showed. The seven-day moving average of deaths increased to 425 from 400 yesterday.France’s Covid-19 death toll is the seventh highest in the world. The ministry also reported 22,858 new confirmed Covid-19 cases in past 24 hours - down slightly from 23,770 on Thursday and from 23,292 last Friday - taking the total to 3,15 million.The number of people in intensive care with the virus increase by another 19 to 3,130 and has now been above a government target of less than 3,000 for five days. The number of people in hospital with the virus increased by 142 to 27,308.Asked for a response to Emmanuel Macron earlier today saying the AstraZeneca vaccine was “quasi-ineffective” among people over 65, Pollard says there is good evidence on its efficacy but this is “much more limited data in the elderly” - though this doesn’t mean there was a lack of protectionThe press conference now ends.Asked if the company could have informed the European Commission any earlier regarding the slowing yield, Soriot says AstraZeneca made them aware as soon as it was clear there was a significant issue.Soriot says AstraZeneca is now producing 100 million doses of the vaccine per month across the world.Pollard says the immune response in older patients and younger patients were identical among healthy patients during their first trial. In the later phase trials where we have people with many different health condition, we do see slightly lower immune responses ... But those differences are very small and we wouldn’t see it as translating into any problem regarding efficacy.Asked if he would have done anything differently to avoid the rows of this week, Sorior says “we’ve done a lot to make sure we provide the vaccine to the EU”.A reporter then asks why Switzerland has not yet made a decision over the vaccine, to which she is told the country will be assessing it and was perhaps waiting for the EMA.Pollard says it’s likely that the changes to the spike proteins in some of the variants may make the vaccines less effective. If indeed we need to make new vaccines, those can be done within a matter of months, it’s not like the situation we were in a year ago where we had to go through nearly a year of development. We’ll be in a position to respond to the virus if it changes.It’s still possible the vaccines are still adequate to prevent severe disease and hospitalisation.Soriot says, “Unfortunately the yield hasn’t been what we were expecting at some of the sites”.He adds there were “teething issues” and that, the issues varied from site to site. “We believe we have now fixed most of the issues, and productivity should improve rapidly over the next few months. We really are trying to do everything at full speed.”Soriot says AstraZeneca is working “hand in hand” to manufacture the vaccine in the US and should be ready to launch as soon as it is approved.He now comments on the row with the EU over supplies.We’ve said what had to be said as far as the legal aspects of the contract. We’re working 247 to improve the supply we have. We have millions of doses which we are ready to start shipping to the EU ... We have quite a substantial quantity already to ship to the respective countries.On the nature of EU row over the contract, he adds: “It is very unfortunate and concerning actually, but apart from this there’s not much more that we can say.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4471107.1611931345!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"what alternative options are under review for 2021 leaving cert","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe outcome of a legal challenge to last year’s predicted grades – due shortly – may indicate if there is an appetite to press ahead with calculated grades. Photograph: Nick BradshawThe It is the question 60,000 students and their parents all want to know: what’s going to happen with the Leaving Cert?Until recently, Minister for Education Norma Foley said it was the Government’s “firm intention” to press ahead with traditional exams. Now, however, the Department of Education is examining “possible alternative options”.Previously undisclosed records of contingency plans examined last year and interviews with key stakeholders this year throw fresh light on some of the options facing decision-makers. Where do teachers, students and schools stand?An advisory group which includes representatives of second-level students, parents, principals, teacher unions and management bodies has been meeting to consider options for the exams. Teachers’ unions and principals want exams to take place, as do school management bodies it’s also understood to be the preferred option of department officials and key Government Ministers.On the other side are students who want a choice between sitting the exams in June and calculated grades. In the past, the student voice did not carry much weight. But this has changed thanks to an organised Irish Second Level Students’ Union – which has been conducting surveys of its members – and the power of social media. It’s no coincidence that Opposition parties have sided with students in recent days and backed their call for candidates to be given a choice.Can ‘traditional’ exams take place?Most education partners agree that if exams as we know them are to take place – that is orals, practicals and written tests in June – students will need to be back in school soon.The “point of no return” for orals and practicals to take place, say some key stakeholders, will be a return to school no later than after the mid-term break – Monday, February 22nd.Even then, it will be a challenge. Finding teachers for oral exams is a problem in normal years more so in the middle of a pandemic. “The State Examination Commission (SEC) is concerned that it will not be able to secure the services of sufficient numbers of teachers to conduct these tests,” according to an advisory documents prepared for the then minister Joe McHugh in March last year. “Given the uncertainty resulting from the coronavirus situation, the SEC cannot guarantee that these oral and practical exams could be rescheduled . . . ”The idea of conducting orals and practicals online has been floated with education partners, as has holding them during the Easter holidays when schools are off.Last year, the Government ended up cancelling oral and practical exams and awarded full marks for these components, which range between 25 and 50 per cent of students’ exams.While doing the same this year could buy some time, some key education stakeholders believe students will need to be back in school by mid-March at the latest if written exams are to proceed, due to the loss of in-school tuition and inability to hold mock exams.Delaying the written exams is an option, though it would cause logistical problems for the CAO and admission to higher education.What could modified exams look like?A contingency plan drawn up last year involved staging “truncated” exams of about two hours in duration. However, an internal department advisory paper drawn up in April last year noted the SEC’s view that this option would be “difficult to stand over”. It would require sample papers, redesign, translation and printing of new papers. There would also be significant challenges for students with additional needs and those in disadvantaged homes.If there are written exams, some believe giving students even greater choice within a traditional format would be more palatable to make up for lost tuition time.Could calculated grades return?The longer schools remain closed, the more calculated grades loom as an option once again, agree most sources.According to the internal department options paper from last April the advantages are that it “treats all candidates equitably”, removes the “psychological stress and risk to health” for students, as well as giving most an “acceptable CAO offer”.However there would be new challenges this year if calculated grades go ahead, say education partners. For starters, teachers would have less material to draw on when assessing students’ grades. The release of class-ranking data – that showed where each student ranked in a class as judged by teachers – was a key concern for teachers’ unions. There is little appetite to repeat this.Adjustments to the calculated grades system would also be needed to win back the confidence of schools which felt they lost out last year.The outcome of a legal challenge to last year’s predicted grades – due shortly – may also indicate whether there is an appetite to press ahead with calculated grades.A choice of exams or calculated grades?While the idea of giving students a simultaneous choice between exams or calculated grades is attractive on paper, in practice it faces major challenges, say many sources.Last year, students received their calculated grades and (where relevant) CAO offers in early September before deciding whether to sit the postponed Leaving in November.What many students and Opposition parties want this year is to give students a choice between exams and calculated grades in June.Teachers feel this is “impossible” given that some students in a class would be preparing for an exam and others would not.It is also likely that many more students would end up sitting the June exams this year compared to the delayed November exams last year. This, say some, would pose real problems in trying to standardise grades across both calculated grades and exams. A much easier option, they say, is simply settling for one option: calculated grades or exams. Either way, most agree the option of calculated grades seems likely in some form.It is striking in the department’s exam options paper drawn up last year that calculated grades were identified as a “fall back option” in every contingency plan envisaged."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Reductions \u0026lsquodo not negate the need for targeted\u0026rsquo action, says environmental bodiesUS president says climate crisis \u0026lsquoone of the most pressing threats of our time\u0026rsquo"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Michael Viney: Government and its agencies finally taking threats of storms seriously"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4471271.1611942174!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"covid 19 vaccines q a over 65s and the oxford astrazeneca jab","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDespite squabbling over EU vaccine supplies it has been a good week on the vaccines front.Are doubts about the Oxford University-AstraZeneca vaccine’s suitability for older people now resolved? In short, yes. The European Union’s regulator has provided sufficient clarity on suitability and older people should have no major concerns about its suitability for them.The European Medicines Agency (EMA) acknowledged a low number of older people took part in AstraZeneca’s clinic trials. But the balance of evidence supported approval for all age groups over 18, it ruled. “Protection is expected, given that an immune response is seen in this age group and based on experience with other vaccines. As there is reliable information on safety in this population, EMA’s scientific experts considered that the vaccine can be used in older adults. More information is expected from ongoing studies, which include a higher proportion of elderly participants,” it added.What was the problem?In the initial trial just two of 660 participants over the age of 65 got Covid-19 – one in the vaccinated group and one in the control group – far below the number needed to draw firm conclusions. This led to the independent commission advising the German government on vaccination policy to recommend it not be used for over-65s.Its developers admitted there were not enough Covid cases among older adults at the time to explore just how well the vaccine protected them against the disease. A large trial showed the vaccine was 60 per cent effective in preventing people from getting sick from coronavirus, though it is unknown whether the shot stops disease transmission.Older adults were recruited later, yet there has been less time for cases to occur, and, older adults are known to be more cautious in the pandemic, meaning the “attack rate” is lower, they pointed out. AstraZeneca stressed they were recruited later because the team wanted to be sure the vaccine was safe before administering it to older age groups.Is there any risk the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine won’t work in older adults?No, as there is encouraging data for older adults showing similar immune responses to younger people. AstraZeneca noted 100 per cent of older adults generated antibodies towards Covid-19’s spike protein after the second dose.Independent experts say the vaccine is safe and valuable for older adults. What’s more, it brings added convenience. Its ability to be delivered to people in GP surgeries and care homes with easier storage requirements make it a vital component in reducing hospitalisation and deaths. This is especially so among oldermore vulnerable people.What are the vaccine options for older people? The likelihood is older people in Ireland will be offered a vaccine from the first three approved by the EMA: the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines and now the Oxford-AstraZeneca one assuming supply issues are resolved.Despite squabbling over EU vaccine supplies it has been a good week on the vaccines front. Johnson \u0026amp Johnson confirmed its one-dose vaccine is 66 per cent effective in a erse and broad population including 34 per cent (14,672 people) of participants over age 60 in late-stage trials. Efficacy against severe disease increased over time with no cases in vaccinated people reported after day 49.In addition, the Novavax trial had 89 per cent efficacy, with 27 per cent of participants – almost 4,000 people – older than 65. Over time further evidence will emerge confirming which vaccine suits what age cohort best, older people included."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4471365.1611949084!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"eu moves to halt northern ireland being used as vaccine backdoor to britain","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFirst Minister Arlene Foster: ‘The European Union has once again shown it is prepared to use Northern Ireland when it suits their interests but in the most despicable manner — over the provision of a vaccine which is designed to save lives.’ Photograph: Cate McCurryPA WireThe European Union has moved to prevent Northern Ireland from being used as a back door to funnel coronavirus vaccine from Europe into Great Britain. First Minister Arlene Foster branded the EU’s triggering of Article 16 of Brexit’s Northern Ireland Protocol to stop unfettered flow of inoculations from the EU into the region an “incredible act of hostility”.Taoiseach Micheál Martin has spoken directly to European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen over the use of the highly politically sensitive Article 16.A Government source described deep unhappiness in Government Buildings over the move, describing it as “completely unnecessary” with the potential for “explosive political implications”.Ms Foster spoke with British prime minister Boris Johnson and Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove about the issue on Friday evening, and called for a “robust response” from Downing Street.The protocol, with is part of the Brexit withdrawal deal, normally allows for free movement of goods from the EU into Northern Ireland.Under the terms of the protocol, goods should be able to move freely between the EU and Northern Ireland as the region remains in the single market for goods and still operates under EU customs rules.The EU has triggered Article 16 of the protocol to temporarily place export controls on this movement in respect of vaccines.It comes amid a deepening row over the allocation of the OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine after the company announced delays to its EU operations.The move to activate Article 16 will frustrate any effort to use Northern Ireland as a back door to bring vaccines into Great Britain.Despicable Mrs Foster said: “By triggering Article 16 in this manner, the European Union has once again shown it is prepared to use Northern Ireland when it suits their interests but in the most despicable manner — over the provision of a vaccine which is designed to save lives.“At the first opportunity, the EU has placed a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland over the supply chain of the coronavirus vaccine.”The regulation means Northern Ireland will be considered an export territory for the purposes of vaccine sent from the EU, including the Republic of Ireland.Northern Ireland’s vaccines arrive from the rest of the UK at present so those will be unaffected.The DUP leader added: “With the European Union using Article 16 in such an aggressive and most shameful way, it is now time for our Government to step up.“I will be urging the prime minister to act and use robust measures including Article 16 to advance the interests of Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom.”The DUP has previously pressed the British government to invoke the Article 16 mechanism because of disruption to the movement of goods between Britain and Northern Ireland.Mr Gove has told the EU the UK is “carefully considering” the next steps after the bloc triggered an aspect of the Northern Ireland Protocol as part of its export controls on coronavirus vaccines.He spoke to his counterpart on the UK-EU joint committee on Friday, No 10 said.In a statement, a spokesman said: “CDL Michael Gove just spoke to European Commission Vice President Maros Sefcovic to express the UK’s concern over a lack of notification from the EU about its actions in relation to the NI protocol.“CDL said the UK would now be carefully considering next steps.”The European Commission said: “Exports of goods from Northern Ireland to other parts of the United Kingdom cannot be restricted by Union law unless this is strictly required by international obligations of the Union.Embarrassed“Therefore, movements of goods covered by this regulation between the Union and Northern Ireland should be treated as exports.“Whilst quantitative restrictions on exports are prohibited between the Union and Northern Ireland, in accordance with Article 5 (5) of the Protocol on IrelandNorthern Ireland, this is justified as a safeguard measure pursuant to Article 16 of that Protocol in order to avert serious societal difficulties due to a lack of supply threatening to disturb the orderly implementation of the vaccination campaigns in the member states.”SDLP leader Colum Eastwood MP has said the decision by the European Commission undermines progress made to defend the interests of the island. “The disproportionate decision to invoke Article 16 of the Ireland Protocol by the European Commission is a grave error in judgment that undermines the work that has taken place over the last five years to defend the interests of people on this island. “We face a common threat. Our response to this virus, and to the supply of vaccines, should be characterised by our common values.”UUP leader Steve Aiken said Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis should be embarrassed.“The EU is unilaterally invoking Article 16 to protect its own interests and it’s about time the UK Government did the same instead of being lead actors in a ridiculous charade that there is no border in the Irish Sea and that Article 16 can’t be invoked.”Traditional Unionist Voice leader Jim Allister said the EU was showing its “callous” true colours.“This afternoon’s invocation of Article 16 of the protocol to inhibit exports of Covid vaccines from the EU to Northern Ireland is the most telling illustration imaginable that for the EU the protocol is a plaything to be exploited when it suits its selfish interests.“The idea that the EU cares anything for Northern Ireland or its people is exposed as utterly bogus.“The effect of today’s regulation is to disavow the much vaunted free trade from the EU to Northern Ireland as part of its single market and instead to treat deliveries of vaccines from the EU to Northern Ireland as ‘exports’, which they can then restrict, lest such vaccines would make their way to Great Britain.” - PA "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4471354.1611947685!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"hse says it expects fewer than expected covid 19 vaccines from moderna","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t A health care worker fills a syringe with the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine at a drive-through  vaccination site at the Lake County Fairgrounds in Grayslake, Illinois, United States.

Photograph: Dara Mac Dónaill The decision to raise the salary level of the next secretary general of the Department of Health by more than €90,000 “stinks to the high heavens”, a member of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) has claimed. Sinn Féin TD Matt Carthy made the remarks as members of the Dáil’s spending watchdog’s discussed their intention to investigate the processes around how high level public sector salaries are determined.It comes after the Government approved a pay rise of more than €90,000 for the position of secretary general of the Department of Health, advertising the role with a salary of €292,000 per annum. Earlier this month, the secretary general of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (DPER), Robert Watt was appointed as interim secretary general at the Department of Health, pending the competition.Mr Watt would be in line to earn about €81,000 more than his salary at DPER if he secures the role. In his PAC contribution on Friday, Mr Carthy claimed that the job is being “teed up”. Questions have been raised about the process by which the pay level increase for the next Department of Health secretary general was decided upon given the key role of DPER in public pay policy.Independent TD for Waterford Matt Shanahan wrote to the PAC raising concern about the issue. The PAC subsequently sent a series of questions to DPER and a response is expected in the coming days. The Committee on Finance is also examining the matter and Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform Michael McGrath is expected to take questions at its meeting next week.PAC chairman, Sinn Féin TD Brian Stanley, told Friday’s meeting the issue is “very serious”, adding that weeks after it first emerged “we’re no clearer as to who made the decision to bump up the pay”.He asked: “Was it civil servants, was it politicians?... Who was involved?”Mr Carthy welcomed the committee’s intention to investigate the overall issue of remuneration of “high-paid” public servants.“This issue stinks to the high heavens,” he said. “You have a situation where essentially a job is teed up for former secretary general of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform who is now moving into a new department.”Knock-on consequencesHe said there are “many questions regarding the role of DPER in the first instance.”It is a “concern for many” that the decision to increase the salary level would lead to other high level public servants “seeking significant pay increases”, he said. He said the PAC has an obligation to look into matter and questioned whether the salary level increase can be reversed. Social Democrats co-leader Catherine Murphy said the impression has been given from media reports that the PAC and Committee on Finance are at “loggerheads” over which would investigate the issue. “The key issue here is we actually get to the origin of how this decision was made, what the process was, who was involved in it, what the knock-on consequences are likely to be,” the Kildare North TD said. She said the PAC’s remit has been constrained by new rules that effectively mean much of its work is limited to examining historic expenditure. The PAC has sought an extension of its remit from the Committee of Procedure to allow it to look into the overall process of setting higher level pay in the public service.Ms Murphy said while it does not appear that the PAC will be investigating the decision to increase the salary level , its planned work could compliment any inquiry that may be carried out by the Committe on Finance.Mr Stanley said the PAC “won’t get into a gun fight with other committees” but it is important that it pursues the issue. The Department of Health referred a request for comment to the Department of Public Expenditure. It decline to comment."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4471352.1611947454!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"germany imposes effective travel ban on ireland from saturday","story":"Germany has effectively halted private travel to and from Ireland, the UK and South Africa to contain the spread of coronavirus mutations.The new regulation, applicable also to Portugal and Brazil, outlaws travel “except absolute exceptions” and comes into effect from midnight on Friday.“We have to get ahead of the situation that means we have to make preventative decisions so the virus cannot spread further,” said German interior minister Horst Seehofer.The new rules will not affect cargo transport, transit passengers at airports, German citizens or foreign nationals who live permanently in Germany.Otherwise the new regulation will allow arrivals from the five banned countries only on health or “urgent humanitarian grounds”.Germany will review the new regulations on February 17th, along with other restrictions to contain the spread of Covid-19.It is the second time in three weeks that Germany has restricted travel to Ireland with just a few hours’ notice.Berlin officials said the decision was a response to a failure to agree binding restrictions at EU level. A government spokesman insisted Germany was not breaking rank but would continue to engage “intensively” with EU neighbours.“The European negotiations are ongoing but there is a certain wriggle room for national measures,” said Steffen Seibert, spokesman for chancellor Angela Merkel.This week she said allowing a slow spread of virus mutations in Germany – with cases now confirmed from Berlin to Bavaria – had left the country “sitting on a powder keg”.German wanderlustDr Merkel was unusually blunt in her criticism of German wanderlust, reportedly telling party allies in a private briefing she wanted a “tougher border regime”.Ryanair flies six routes from Ireland to Germany, including Berlin, Hamburg and Cologne, but has already thinned out what were once daily flights to twice or three times a week.Aer Lingus operated popular flights to Berlin, Frankfurt and Munich but a spokesman said on Friday evening the airline was no longer operating services to Germany.Germany remains in lockdown until mid-February, with only essential services and shops open. This week infection numbers began a slow decline, pushing the incidence rate below 100 cases per 100,000 for the first time in three months.On Friday, Germany announced 14,022 new cases within 24 hours, 4,000 fewer than a week ago, and 839 deaths within 24 hours.After agreeing non-binding travel recommendations in Brussels, representatives from Belgium, the Netherlands and Finland indicated their countries would follow Germany’s lead and introduce their own measures.A week ago the Dutch government announced a ban on travel from South Africa while, starting on Wednesday, Finland banned all non-essential travellers from entering the country – including from other EU member states.Helsinki said it would consider only work that is significant for the functioning of society to be essential travel.\u0026nbspEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons january 2021","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2020 by clicking here or call 0844 871 1514. To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178HS2 accused of deliberately \u0026#39pumping water\u0026#39 into tunnels dug by protesters near Euston stationGerman politicians and media turn on \u0026#39careless\u0026#39 Ursula von der Leyen over Covid vaccine fiascoStansted 15 have convictions quashed as judge rules \u0026#39there was no case to answer\u0026#39Scaled down... why this tiny lizard is the world\u0026#39s smallest reptileControversy after White House uses sign language interpreter who worked on pro-Trump videosJanssen vaccine results show complete protection against death from Covid after one doseEU medicines regulator approves AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine for anyone over 18WhatsApp’s self-deleting messages could hamper efforts to jail terrorists, ex-MI6 boss warnsCoronavirus latest news: Single-dose Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine 100pc effective at preventing deaths, hospitalisationsWelsh nationalism on the rise as young people back independence Christ Church trustees express \u0026#39anger\u0026#39 after watchdog questions efforts to oust embattled DeanBoris Johnson reverses national security advisor appointment of Lord FrostCovid\u0026#39s economic impact could kill an extra 40,000 people over 50 years, modelling suggestsComment: In the culture wars, Labour MPs must not be muzzled Italy blocks arms sales to Saudi Arabia and the UAE over deadly Yemen warJewish man\u0026#39s bequeaths nearly £2m to French village that sheltered him from the Nazis as a childSir Stephen Lovegrove picked by Boris Johnson to replace Lord David Frost as the next NSAComment: Knock knock.

Pumps and pipes will be required to stop the site from flooding.The excavation will be a public-private partnership involving archaeologists and the Herculaneum Conservation Project, which has helped protect the remains of the Roman town for nearly 20 years.The ancient beach was partially excavated in the 1980s, when archeologists came across the skeletons of around 300 men, women and children.Some of them had tried to shelter from the eruption in boat sheds along the beach but were incinerated by the extreme heat generated by the eruption, which made their skulls explode and their flesh vaporise.Their fate was even more gruesome than that of many other inhabitants of Pompeii and Herculaneum, who died from suffocation by ash and noxious gases.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"country lacking leadership telegraph readers weeks biggest","story":"On Tuesday, it was reported that there had been over 100,000 deaths in Britain as a result of Covid. The grim milestone was announced almost a year to the day since the country recorded its first coronavirus fatality.In further news on Wednesday, Boris Johnson revealed that in late February he will publish his plan for taking the country out of lockdown. As well as this, the prime minister confirmed that schools will remain closed until March 8 at the very earliest.Read on to see what your fellow readers had to say about this week\u0027s biggest news stories and have your say in the comments section below.Get involved in future round-ups by joining the  Community Facebook group.In response to Britain reaching the grim milestone of 100,000 Covid deaths, Allison Pearson called for TV news and the Government to chart a more positive path out of the pandemic. She discussed how remorseless scaremongering was damaging society, and  readers were quick to agree.In previous national crises, the BBC and the media\u0027s key role has been to boost the morale and resolve of the population.In this Covid-19 situation, where the crisis is overwhelmingly affecting those with already limited life expectancy, they all seem determined to demoralise everyone by broadcasting stories of misery and bereavement rather than telling us how many people have been happily discharged from hospital or even putting the numbers of deaths in perspective.They are trying to turn people into snivelling wretches.I certainly agree with your sentiment Allison, never liking to hear defeatist talk myself. There is, however, a balance to be found between the stark realities of our situation and those who bury their heads in the sand, unwilling to temporarily compromise their selfish indulgences to stop the spread of the disease.What this country lacks at present is leadership. When I watch our prime minister bumbling his way through his \u0027briefings\u0027, I see someone who is desperately trying to discuss a subject that he doesn\u0027t truly understand.Is it asking too much that he could be bold and assertive just for once, put journalists in their place, and give the public some confidence that our future is in safe hands? The sight of him apologising for all these deaths was simply sad. The questions he was fielding were outrageous. The whole pantomime left me depressed for our country.By referencing the handling of schools during the pandemic as well as lockdowns, Suzanne Moore joined our readers in emphasising how the country\u0027s children are suffering in silence.We are teaching our children how to fear, isolating them from the world and conditioning them to a bleak and shadowy existence in adulthood if this does not change very, very soon.Overwhelmingly abnormal behaviours and thought processes are becoming \u0027normal\u0027. We owe it to them not to be the last generation who tasted freedom.My 16-year-old grandson was an outgoing, funny and social boy on the cusp of transitioning into adulthood. He had a social circle of friends from school and had met his first girlfriend, the world was his oyster.His parents fear to leave him on his own now as his mental health has deteriorated so much. He has no interest in anything and cries at the drop of a hat.It\u0027s time the children of today were fought for. Give them back their lives.I have no children, but I am horrified at the way children are being sacrificed on the altar of seemingly endless lockdowns here.It\u0027s an absolute scandal that millions of children are being left in limbo by a government too scared of the teaching unions and hysterical press to act with any guts and in the interests of children.Prior to Boris Johnson’s announcement on Wednesday, our readers offered their thoughts on how they believe the country can work its way out of lockdown, as well as expressing their disappointment in the Government’s decisions.I fail to see why the Government and its advisers do not see the need to vaccinate teachers, police, firemen and other necessary workers like supermarket workers and bin collectors as a priority.If they were vaccinated, children could return to school, students to universities and the economy would begin to pick up (subject to the two to three-week period being adhered to).The people who can tolerate lockdown more easily are people who do not rely on their jobs to provide an income so that their children can be fed.If the Government is truly \u0027following the science\u0027, they would be ensuring that all second jabs were completed within the three-week time frame stipulated by the scientists that designed them, therefore making sure that those who have had the jab are properly protected.Data has shown which sectors of the population are most severely affected by Covid. Once we have done all we can do to protect them, the rest of us should be allowed to get on with our lives.No one is forced to take part in society if they don\u0027t want to. Those that are living in fear can still stay at home.Another six months of economic catastrophe to add to 2020. The markets were betting on a V-shaped recovery. That ship sailed in December.We are looking at much more serious damage than even the worst-case scenarios. Many businesses will go to the wall as the Government money runs out. All that has been done is to delay the inevitable. Thus, much higher unemployment, Government debt and a budget deficit.And what about when we get the post-lockdown toll of other deaths from cancer and the like? Add to that the toll on children, on mental health and health in general as well as on rates of poverty. The reckoning for the lockdown madness is yet to be faced. Boris Johnson won’t last long. The Tories will be in serious trouble as well, even after Boris has gone. I doubt they will be re-elected.Chelsea sacked Frank Lampard after 18 months in charge on Monday. Following the announcement, it was also revealed that Thomas Tuchel was first in line to take over the role. While many of our readers felt the decision was harsh, others thought the outcome was inevitable.Look at Ole Gunnar Solskjaer at United. At one stage he was negatively contrasted to Lampard. Now he\u0027s feted. Managers need to be backed with a little patience in what is an impossible job. Even Jürgen Klopp is facing negative stories now that he can\u0027t arrest Liverpool\u0027s blip.Lampard should have stayed at Derby for one or two more years to learn the trade. It was wishful thinking by Chelsea to appoint him, without time having been served.  At least one other game he won this season was a bit lucky to say the least. I feel sorry for him but the bottom line is that he should never have been offered the job.I am genuinely sorry, even as a Liverpool fan and in spite of his touchline rant against Jürgen Klopp. You felt he would get there in the end with his intelligence and knowledge of the game. He ran out of time.Rebecca Reid reflected on Katie Price\u0027s past after her new documentary was aired this week, which recounts the difficulties she and her son face as he enters adulthood. Readers empathised with the heart-breaking decisions that Katie has had to make and shared their own stories of caring for disabled children.I\u0027ve never met Katie but she used to live in the next village. I have nothing but admiration for the way she has cared for her son, and I used to see him with his carers at one of the local toddler groups (my oldest child is a bit younger than Harvey).One of my children has additional needs and I do worry about his future prospects, so anything that draws attention to these problems is to be welcomed. Well done Katie.I\u0027m sure she\u0027s not a saint, who of us are? But when my daughter was young, Ms Price funded a holiday for blind children in Gloucestershire and we\u0027re eternally grateful.We were spared her difficult decision by our daughter\u0027s death, but I feel for her desperately. Any parent\u0027s one thought in that situation has to be, \u0027How do I look after my child when I\u0027m no longer there to care for them?\u0027.As a father of a special needs daughter, I have always empathised since Harvey\u0027s situation became apparent. I wasn\u0027t a fan of Katie Price before, I\u0027ll admit. It is a journey that only the few in similar situations would understand.As I age, I too am left with agonising decisions on the horizon that will have to be made.Find out what stories are getting our readers talking by visiting the  Community Hub.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"greece rolls vaccination programme islands hope summer tourist","story":"The inhabitants of Greece’s islands have begun receiving coronavirus vaccines as the country looks ahead to what it hopes will be a busy summer tourist season.Islanders, particularly the elderly, are anxious to get vaccinated so that they are protected from infection when holidaymakers arrive from around the world.The Greek government has embarked on a plan to send vaccines to islands in the Aegean and Ionian seas, many of them far-flung and hard to reach.“The inoculation of the population on the islands is in progress. It’s a complex scheme due to the distinctive geography of the island regions,” said Vassilis Kontozamanis, the health services minister.From Rhodes and Chios to Santorini and Mykonos, doctors and nurses have been administering the vaccine to islanders of all ages.It is important for our island, it is both symbolic and practical, Sofia Kouvalaki told Reuters, as she had a jab at a medical centre on Kastellorizo, a tiny island in the eastern Mediterranean, about a mile off the coast of Turkey.We did not have cases, so this has to continue so that people here feel safe and so those who will come will be safe.For small islands that have limited health facilities, inoculating people is vital as the country looks ahead to the summer season.Nikolaos Tachtzis, a nurse who administered some of the shots, said: “It\u0027s really important, especially for the small islands that don\u0027t have large hospitals for people to be treated, they have to be (vaccinated) so that they are protected when people come here for tourism.”Greece, which has a population of 10 million, has so far vaccinated more than 208,000 people.Still bruised from a decade of austerity and recession, Greece is hoping that tourists will be able to flock to its islands this summer.Kyriakos Mitsotakis, the prime minister, backs the idea of an EU-wide vaccination certificate or passport to allow those who have had a jab travel more freely.“Ensuring the quickest possible re-establishment of freedom of movement … is, of necessity, a fundamental priority for us all,” he said earlier this month.Thousands of hotels, bars and restaurants in Greece are suffering economically.Aegean Airlines, the country’s main carrier, sustained a net loss of over €187 million  during the first nine months of 2020 as a result of the drastic contraction in visitor numbers.The impact of the pandemic on Greece has been much lower than in other European countries such as Italy and Spain. Greece has registered 155,000 infections and a death toll of 5,700.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"hurrah populist revolt against wall street","story":"It’s a bit like the sneaking sense of pleasure we all get on seeing a Rolls-Royce wheel clamped. Serves ‘em right for being so ostentatiously rich. The story behind the extraordinary rise in the share price of the troubled US video games company GameStop – up nearly 2,000 per cent at one time – is a case in point.Rarely does the often unfathomable world of stock market investment do much to lift the spirits, but a collective cheer went up on seeing the short-selling money bags of Wall Street and the City outmanoeuvred and brought low by a raging mob of angry small time retail investors.Normally it’s the other way around. Or as Calvera puts it in The Magnificent Seven, “If God did not want them sheared, he would not have made them sheep.” Exploited at every turn – from access to information and analysis, to disadvantageous prices, exclusion from the choicest company flotations, and above all unable to manipulate markets in the way the big boys of Wall Street seem effortlessly to get away with – small time speculators have always been like lambs to the slaughter.Well, the much ridiculed “dumb money” of the day trading amateur struck back the sheared became the shearers. Or at least they did, until they were barred from trading in the stock by some amateur trading platforms.To recap. GameStop was one of those companies that looked as if it was going bust. A number of sizable hedge funds took out big short positions in the stock accordingly – in essence, a bet that the company’s share price would decline further. Their analysis may have been broadly right, but it was not the view taken by the company’s voluminous retail fanclub. Fueled by social media and the boredom of lockdown, they collectively determined to take on the big boys at their own game.Eventually there were enough of them to quite literally swamp out the know-it-all hedgies. Turns out that once you’ve got the numbers, it is as easy to manipulate a share price up as down.As with so many other walks of life, social media has allowed these once disconnected and disparate voices to come together and be heard. In the US, the forum of choice is Wall Street Bets on Reddit. Shout loudly enough that the stock is heading for the stratosphere, and eventually others will join the chorus, and mob the stock accordingly.GameStop may be the standout example, but there have been lots of other heavily shorted stocks which have been subjected to the same treatment. The populist militias are growing ever more ambitious in their targets. All of a sudden, professional traders, many of whom don’t think twice about ramping or trashing a stock to suit their position, have found themselves played at their own game.So-called “shorting” – selling shares you don’t own in the expectation that the price will fall, allowing you to buy them back at a big profit – has never enjoyed a favourable press. Many chief executives see the practice as wanton corporate vandalism. Yet though it might look suspect, there is nothing wrong with it as such short selling is merely a bet on the shares going down rather than up, and is therefore a natural part of the Darwinian process by which stock markets sort the wheat from the chaff and allocate capital between companies.Where it becomes more questionable is when the short seller makes his position a self fulfilling prophecy by spreading fake news or publishing unsupported analysis of catastrophe to come. Regrettably, this still happens a lot.Shorting can also be dangerous if you buy a stock, your loss is limited to 100 per cent of the capital invested, since the price cannot fall below zero. But because there is no limit to how high a price can go, the losses on a short position are potentially infinite.The cleverness among the Wall Street Bets militias is that they have spotted and exploited this vulnerability by driving the price higher, the short selling losses eventually rise to a level where the financial pain becomes too much to bear, and the hedge funds’ positions have to be closed by buying the shares in the market. This in turn causes the price to rise higher still. It’s what’s known as a “short squeeze”, and it has been applied to devastating effect with GameStop.The money men of Wall Street and the City were meant to have got their comeuppance in the financial crisis, but instead, they seem only to have become richer still.Far from correcting the sense of a system which is stacked against the common man, the last 10 years have only enhanced it. GameStop provides a rare example of the little guy fighting back. There is a kind of anarchism about it – a determination to bring the establishment down.Yet “rare” may be the operative word here. Today’s new model army of day traders should enjoy their moment in the sun while they can. One of the classic signs of the late, “bubble” stages of a bull market is when the little guy, tempted by the riches seemingly being made by others, pawns the family silver to join the party.

Longing for a time when he can return to the local pub for a pint and a game of snooker with friends, he savours his government walk. He is waiting to resume his life.According to the Government list, he falls into the seventh priority group in line for immunisation. That means he’ll be jabbed relatively soon - thanks to the surprisingly efficient rollout - but for someone who’s been stuck inside for nearly a year, soon just isn’t soon enough. Keir Starmer, however, evidently believes that it’s OK to leave him in limbo even longer. This week, he proposed that teachers like me should be bumped up the priority list to allow for vaccinations in the February half term - delaying the immunisation of millions in categories 5-9, my father included.The logic behind the idea is that vaccinating teachers is the only way to get schools open. But that logic is flawed.As we know, children themselves face little danger from the virus, but because they pass it to each other and then infect relatives, they play a central role in transmission nationwide. That is the threat, especially in communities where multiple generations are more likely to live in the same household.Were we to follow Starmer’s plan -  vaccinating all teachers and returning pupils to school soon after - the virus would simply be taken home to ravage the lives of elderly relatives. In prioritising healthy young teachers like me, we deprioritise the truly vulnerable, whose jabs must necessarily be delayed.We all agree that online learning is vastly inferior to the real thing. Every day outside of the traditional setting for education has tremendous effects on the life outcomes of the nation’s children.  Governments and unions know this, but seem not always consider it a top priority - perhaps neither the next election nor union subscription fees depend on whether little Samantha will be able to read in 10 years’ time.Every lesson counts and every jab counts. Which is precisely why we must allocate our resources with extreme caution. I am a young, healthy and statistically speaking, at low risk of getting seriously ill with Coronavirus. My dad, on the other hand, is rightly concerned for his life. That he goes before me should be a no-brainer.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"two gay men indonesia publicly caned 77 times vigilantes broke","story":"Two men in Indonesia’s conservative Aceh province have been publicly lashed 77 times each after neighbourhood vigilantes burst into their apartment last November and reported them to Islamic religious police for allegedly having sex with each other. The caning is the third time people have been punished for practicing homosexuality since Aceh banned it under Shariah law in 2015. The consumption of alcohol, gambling, tight clothing for women, and extramarital sex have also been outlawed under Shariah ordinances.  The men, aged 27 and 29, were whipped on Thursday with a rattan stick in front of dozens of people by a team of five enforcers wearing long brown robes and hoods. The pair reportedly winced as they were struck and the punishment was briefly halted to allow them to drink water. The mother of one man fainted at the scene.A Shariah court last month sentenced each man to 80 strokes, but they received 77 to compensate for time spent in prison. Morality offenses including gay sex can be punished by up to 100 lashes. On the same day, a woman and man were each given 20 lashes for being caught in close proximity to each other, and two men were given 40 lashes each for drinking alcohol. Islamic sharia enforcement is final, no matter who it is, and even visitors must respect local norms, public order official Heru Triwijanarko told AFP.Aceh is the only one of the Southeast Asian nation’s 34 provinces to adopt Shariah, and did so as a concession made by the government in Jakarta to end a decade-long separatist rebellion.At the time, Acehnese political leaders promised the law would not affect religious minorities and would respect international human rights.Outside of Aceh, homosexuality is not illegal in Indonesia, the world’s most populous Muslim nation, but the country\u0027s low-profile LGBT community has for years been marginalised, targeted by police raids and sometimes violently attacked. In a statement, Human Rights Watch said Thursday’s whipping was recognised as “torture under international law” and said it was part of a “longstanding pattern of targeted abuse by Acehnese authorities” against LBGT people. “The abuse also is part of a five-year anti-LGBT campaign driven by many of Indonesia’s national and local leaders with harmful rhetoric and repeated failure to punish abusers,” it added. “The Indonesian government has made commitments in principle to protect LGBT people. But it seems President Joko \u0027Jokowi\u0027 Widodo’s slogan of unity in ersity does not genuinely extend to protecting everyone – including the two men mercilessly flogged today.”A Foreign Office spokesperson said: “The UK opposes all forms of discrimination and is committed to protecting the rights and freedoms of LGBT people around the world.“We urge Indonesia to ensure that national and local laws are non-discriminatory and celebrate the ersity and tolerance of its people.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"do need permit travel eu","story":"Advertorial\"Do I need a permit to travel to the EU for work \" and  other essential questions for UK businessesHow to keep your business moving as the UK’s new relationship with the EU beginsmirrorShareByWilliam Ramsey:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN AdvertorialMeanders Steve and Jill Henry The UK has now agreed a deal with the EU, and new rules that affect the way your business trades with Europe started on January .Many businesses have been preparing for months for the transition, soyou haven’t done so it’s important you don’t get left behind.

That covered things like movement of people, contracts, logistics and supply chain – which involved writing to each of our  suppliers to find out what their supply chain was, and we suggested that they all did the same to make sure that there was less risk.“We did all the hard work years ago – looking into intellectual property and how that changed, and attending Government training and hundreds of webinars.”Playdale uses a freight forwarder to help export goods to some countries in the EU, which cuts down on paperwork – and the company has taken advice from multiple sources to help things run smoothly.“All the information is out there. You’ve got to do your research and put in the hard yards, but you only have to do it once,” says Barry. “There’s the gov.uk website, but there’s also the DIT the CBI has an excellent website with lots of assistance, as does the IOD, and the local Chambers of Commerce.” Careful preparation has certainly paid off. “I think everything’s going smoother than we expected,” says Barry. “Yes, there’s still a bit of friction around new documentation, but in time I’d like to think we’ll get better at it.”For Jill Henry, from Edinburgh, who runs clothing company Meander Apparel, taking care of the little details was crucial.“Focusing on the small things was a good place to start for us, like making sure that we had our EORI [Economic Operators Registration and Identication] number, which is only a quick thing, but you need ityou’re shipping abroad or to Northern Ireland,” she says.“I would recommend that other businesses get on to the Government websites and have a look on there at industry-specic guidance.

But there is a dispute over the figures, which are not officially published by the government.It’s thought government officials believe the figure has risen to about % from a normal rate of about % - caused by both Brexit and coronavirus.But the Road Haulage Association estimates the normal rate of empty trucks is more like % and put Brexit squarely in the frame. The RHA told the Mirror demand for carrying exports had plunged as some firms find the paperwork unaffordable.In other cases, exports take more time to sign off and hauliers “can’t wait” for them to be ready. Duncan Buchanan of the RHA said: “It’s a range of reasons. “One of the most fundamental is they are unable to process the right paperwork to cross the border in time. “There are insufficient customs agents and not enough capacity, and some HGV drivers can’t wait for firms to be ready. “There is a permanent reduction in trade as well. There are goods that will no longer be able to be exported commercially because you will no longer be able to make a profit given the increased cost of customs processes.” A government source said: We have heard from our French counterparts that on Wednesday the number of empty lorries was around % and we’ll continue to work with them closely on this. It is an entirely normal part of freight flows to have empty lorries on the outbound leg from the UK into the EU.

Pressure from health campaigners has seen Asda and Lidl recently alter their packaging to tackle obesity in children and to make le easier for parents being pestered to buy the wrong things It will scrap colourful creatures like a crocodile on its Rice Snaps, a friendly lion on its Frosted Flakes and a unicorn which appears on the front of Rainbow Hoops. Health campaigners have criticised such packaging as the cartoons are a draw for children and should be scrapped in the fight against obesity. And it follows Lidl which became the first grocery chain to announce it would ditch familiar figures from eight types of its own label cereal in the Spring. Today experts called for other supermarkets and cereal brands to follow suit and remove cartoon characters from the packaging. Tam Fry chairman of the National Obesity Forum said: “There’s a lot of research that shows kids are taken with animals pictured on food wrapping and cartons and pester parents to buy the products but they don’t care what’s inside. “What Asda and Lidl have done is a step in the right direction but more could be done - others need to follow suit and I would also like to see more sugar removed from cereals. “The overall cost of obesity and related illnesses is £ billion a year but the Government is doing nothing about it.”It comes after the Government launched their aposbetter health strategyapos last year, in a bid to help people aposbring their weight downapos and protect the NHS. Checkouts in stores will also no longer display confectionery items, and adverts for foods high in fat, sugar and salt are banned on TV before pm. Deals such as aposbuy one get one freeapos on unhealthy food will also be banned under the plan, which will begin April .

Ryan Farrell was arrested on Tuesday afternoon after finishing his shopping at the supermarket in Birkenhead, Merseyside. The -year-old was leaving the store but stopped at the kiosk to buy tobacco when he was first told to fix his mask. He said the incident then escalated after police repeatedly approached him about it before asking for his details and then arresting him, which resulted in him reportedly being pinned to the floor and handcuffed in front of his partner and young son.Ryan told the Liverpool Echo he was then fined £ and barred from the store but claims he was wearing his mask correctly the entire time and only moved it because his glasses had steamed up.Merseyside Police however claim that Mr Farrell was seen to lower his mask, refused to give his details and then resisted arrest. Dad-of-one Ryan said: I convinced my partner to meet me after work to pick up some shopping and we wore our masks the entire way around the store. As we were leaving I went up to the kiosk to get some tobacco and my mask was steaming my glasses up. I pulled it down slightly to let the steam clear and a police officer who was close to the door gestured over to me and told me to put it back on. I put it right back up my nose, bought my tobacco and went to leave. As I was leaving, the officer said aposIf I have to speak to you about your mask again I will arrest youapos.  So I said aposno worries, I didapos and went to carry on out of the store. Ryan said that it was at this point that the officer grabbed his coat and asked for his details, which he refused to give. The officer then told him he was being arrested. Ryan said: I didnapost want to give my details because I hadnapost done anything wrong and when he grabbed me I tried to pull away. I was startled and I didnapost know what to do so I tried to get him away from me. He then put my hands behind my back and pushed me onto the floor. Ryanaposs partner, who was with him at the time, videoed the incident from this point with the footage showing Ryan on the ground with three officers around him. He is then stood up and taken outside where officers issued him with a £ Covid fine for breaching regulations. A spokesperson for Merseyside Police said: The gentleman was seen by an officer to enter the Asda store in Birkenhead wearing his face mask around his neck.  When asked by the officer to put on the face mask he pulled up the mask and walked away but was then seen to lower it again. He was advised by the officer to put the mask on properly or he would receive a fine. The officer attempted to engage with the gentleman to explain why he had been spoken to about his mask and was asked for his name in order to record the advice, which he refused to give. He was advisedhe refused to give his details he would be arrested. As the officer attempted to arrest him the man resisted arrest and was eventually safely handcuffed on the floor.He was taken out of the front of the store where he was given a fixed penalty notice under  coronavirus regulations and de-arrested.Ryan said that the incident was extremely upsetting for his partner who hadnapost left the house many times over the last year to protect their one-year-old son. He added: My son suffers with respiratory problems and almost died about a year ago, so we are very wary about putting him at risk.

The powers for authorities to slap lockdown flouters with the fines came into force of pm Friday.The latest coronavirus restrictions change comes into force as part of tougher measures to crack down on illegal gatherings during the pandemic.The penalty will apply for groups of more than  people and will double after each offence, up to a maximum of £, for repeat offenders, Home Secretary Priti Patel said last week when she announced the plans. Parties busted by police in recent weeks included a gathering of more than  in a posh Kensington neighbourhood in London. And students were found hiding in a cupboard by police called to the gathering of about  in Birmingham. The new fine replaces the current penalty of £.   But the £, penalties for unlawful groups of more than  people will still only apply to the organiser. According to the legislation, the £ fine is cut to £paid within  days. As well as those in private dwellings, the rule also applies to similar gatherings in educational accommodation, the documents setting out the new law said. The new laws give police powers to access Test and Trace data, the documents also suggest. It also comes as the government plots tougher border controls in a bid to keep new Covid- iants at bay.  Boris Johnson this week announced a aposred listapos had been drawn up of countries, from which people arriving in the UK would be required to quarantine in hotels.Patel also announced plans to to change the rules to ban people from travelling abroad unless they have an aposessentialapos reason. However the launch date for either policy remained unclear. Reports say it is feared the governmentaposs hotel plan could take another three weeks before it is ready.  Human rights barrister Adam Wagner, who studies coronavirus rules and tries to simply them for the public, said the changes to the law that came into force today will make it easier for police to enforce people breaking self-isolation rules. It also was unclear how the government would stop people travelling abroad for aposwork purposes,apos following widespread criticism of Brit influencers who have travelled to Dubai claiming they were working in the UAE. National Police Chiefsapos Council data published on Thursday showed  fines had been issued by forces in England and three in Wales, to people failing to self-isolate after arriving from a country on the Government quarantine list between September  - when the rule came into force - and January .  The latest laws, signed off by Health Secretary Matt Hancock on Thursday, amend self-isolation regulations to correct a number of errors and update how information can be shared with authorities. The broad definition of who the information can be shared with means it could be provided to police or anyone  the Government may enlist to uphold the rules, such as public health officials. Contact details, including a phone number and email address where available, can be sharedsomeone tests positive for coronavirus ora person has come into close contact with a positive case, the laws state.

That is when the defence say murder-accused Pawel Relowicz was at home with his we and two children. Relowicz, , is standing trial accused of the rape and murder of Libby Squire, aged . He denies the charges.  Relowicz, a butcher, claims he was trying to help Libby get home and had consensual sex with her, leaving her on Oak Road in Hull before driving away. The prosecution claim he raped her then murdered her to “silence her screams” before dumping her in a freezing river. The University of Hull studentaposs body was discovered almost seven weeks later in the Humber Estuary. Mr Brewster told Sheffield Crown Court on Friday: “Me and my partner were laid in bed.  “We heard a scream on the morning of the st and we felt it was important to call the police and provide that information. “We had learnt that Libby Squire had gone missing... and that concerns were growing about her welfare. “It was around half past midnight. “Initially I didnapost hear it was my partner who told me to be quiet and listen and it was screams that we heard. “ He said the screams were from a “female” and were intermittent”.

It was coming from Oak Road playing fields behind the property. “After that we spoke about what the sound could be, we suggested it might be children playing around but we came to the conclusion it was an urgent scream.” He said it was his partner, Hannah Durkin, who checked what time it was. Ms Durkin also gave evidence and told the court they had gone to bed around . pm and were “chatting” in bed.  She last checked her phone, she said, at .am. “Out of nowhere I heard a high-pitched female scream,” she told the court. “When I heard the first noise I told Drew to be quiet so I could listen further.

Two of those vaccines - one by Pfizer BioNTech and the other by Oxford University AstraZeneca - have already been injected into the arms of millions of Britons. A third, developed by Moderna, has been approved by the UKaposs medicines regulator and is due to be distributed in the spring. The other four vaccines that have been ordered in the millions were developed by Novavax, Janssen, Valneva and GlaxoSmithKline Sanofi Pasteur, and are at ious stages of ongoing trials. The National Audit Office said last month that the UK will spend up to £. billion on purchasing, manufacturing and rolling out vaccines. What do you think of the UKaposs rollout of Covid- vaccines so far  Join the conversation in the comments section below. More than . million people in the UK have had a least one dose of a vaccine, as of Thursday The Novavax jab was just under  per cent effective in phase  trials in the UK, according to the American firm. It could be approved by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency within weeks. The UK was the first country in the world to give emergency use authorisation to the Pfizer BioNTech jab and the first to use it. It was also the first to use the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine. Margaret Keenan, , was the first person in the UK to be vaccinated against coronavirus. The grandmother received her first dose of the Pfizer BioNtech jab at University Hospital in Coventry from nurse May Parsons on December , followed by a second dose three weeks later. Since then, the Government has extended the gap between the first and second dose from three to  weeks to vaccinate more people, but the practice has drawn criticism. All vaccines are required to undergo rigorous testing and have oversight from experienced regulators. Here is a look at the seven vaccines that the Government has ordered to protect Britons against Covid-. Pfizer and BioNTech  Type: mRNA Doses:  million - enough for  million people The vaccine, from the US firm Pfizer and German bioengineering firm BioNTech, is being rolled out across the UK, having been approved for use on December  last year. The first jabs were given six days later. Analysis from trials shows the vaccine can prevent  per cent of people from getting Covid-, including  per cent in older age groups. Before it was approved for use in the UK, the vaccine was tested on , people in six countries and no safety concerns were raised. The Pfizer BioNTech vaccine is manufactured in Belgium. It is a messenger RNAvaccine, and doses must be stored at ultra-low temperatures. Conventional vaccines are produced using weakened forms of the virus, but mRNAs use only the virus’s genetic code. An mRNA vaccine is injected into the body where it enters cells and tells them to create antigens. These antigens are recognised by the immune system and prepare it to fight coronavirus. No actual virus is needed to create an mRNA vaccine. This means the rate at which it can be produced is dramatically accelerated. As a result, mRNA vaccines have been hailed as potentially offering a rapid solution to new outbreaks of infectious diseases. Oxford and AstraZeneca  Type: Adenovirus Doses:  million - enough for  million people The jab is being administered throughout the UK, after getting the green light from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agencyon December . On January , dialysis patient Brian Pinker, , became the first person in the UK to receive this jab. Phase  trial data showed the jab was . per cent effective on average across two dferent dose regimes and possibly up to  per cent when one half dose is given followed by a further full dose. The retired maintenance manager received the jab from nurse Sam Foster at Oxfordaposs Churchill Hospital.  The vaccine – called ChAdOx nCoV- – uses a harmless, weakened version of a common virus which causes a cold in chimpanzees. Researchers have already used this technology to produce vaccines against a number of pathogens including flu, Zika and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome . The virus is genetically modied so that it is impossible for it to grow in humans. Scientists have transferred the genetic instructions for coronavirus’s specic “spike protein” – which it needs to invade cells – to the vaccine. When the vaccine enters cells inside the body, it uses this genetic code to produce the surface spike protein of the coronavirus. This induces an immune response, priming the immune system to attack coronavirusit infects the body. The majority of the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine is set to be manufactured in the UK, despite initial doses coming from Germany. Moderna  Type: mRNA Doses:  million - enough for . million people The jab from the US biotech firm has been approved for use in the UK, but doses will not be available until the spring. It is the third vaccine to receive approval from the UK medicines regulator. The phase  results suggest vaccine efficacy against the disease was . per cent, and vaccine efficacy against severe Covid- was  per cent. More than , people in the US took part, from a wide range of age groups and ethnic backgrounds. Two doses were given  days apart so researchers could evaluate safety and any reaction to the vaccine. Moderna said the vaccine was generally well tolerated, with no serious safety concerns identied to date. Like the Pfizer BioNTech jab, it is an mRNA vaccine. It must also be stored at ultra-low temperatures. Novavax  Type: Protein adjuvant. Doses: Under the in-principle agreement, the UK has secured  million doses of the Novavax vaccine The UK is providing infrastructure to Novavax in running a phase three clinical trial in the UK, and plans to manufacture its vaccine in the UK with Fujilm Diosynth Biotechnologies. Results from those trials show the vaccine offers  per cent protection against Covid-, but it still requires approval from the MHRA, which could take several weeks. It is the first to show in trials that it is effective against the new and more infectious UK iant of the virus. More than , people in the UK took part in the clinical trial, which was supported by the UK National Institute for Health Research. Some  per cent of those in the UK were over the age of .  Jabs should be available in the second half of . The vaccine will be produced in Stockton-on-Tees in County Durham. The Novavax vaccine works like other vaccines by teaching the immune system to make antibodies to the coronavirus spike protein. Researchers inserted a modied gene into a virus, called a baculovirus, and allowed it to infect insect cells. Spike proteins from these cells were then assembled into nanoparticles which, while they look like coronavirus, cannot replicate or cause Covid-. These nanoparticles are then injected into the body via the vaccine where the immune system mounts an antibody response. If the body encounters coronavirus in the future, the body is primed to fend it off. The vaccine is given as two doses. While the jabs from Pfizer BioNTech and Moderna need to be kept at ultra-low temperatures, the Novavax jab is stable for up to three months in a normal fridge. Janssen Type: Adenovirus Doses: Some  million doses have been secured from Janssen, which is owned by the US company Johnson  Johnson . Johnson  Johnson announced on Friday that its single-shot vaccine was  per cent effective in preventing Covid- in the United States but a lower rate of  per cent was observed globally in the large trial conducted across three continents and against multiple iants. The company plans to seek emergency use authorisation from the US Food and Drug Administration next week. In the trial of nearly , volunteers, the level of protection against moderate and severe Covid- was  per cent in Latin America and just  per cent in South Africa, where a particularly worrying iant of the novel coronavirus is circulating.

He was a long-standing employee at the industrial electronic and automation repair company Kontroltek, based in Bridgend. Andrew, who is Kontroltekaposs managing director, said he will remember Anthony as a kind, loyal and funny friend who was a real character with a unique sense of dress.  Having known Anthony for over  years we have shared many memories, said Andrew. We have laughed together and we have cried together. At Kontroltek he was here for every up and down experienced, usually leading from the front. I am mourning his death greatly – he was more than an employee to me. Anthony was a loyal friend who I could trust and often seek advice in. Iaposm forever grateful for knowing him as Iaposm sure many who have crossed paths with him are too. This tragic loss is only another reminder of how truly evil this virus is.

His eye-opening videos of the step-by-step process have racked up millions of views on TikTok. Fans of the fast-food chain have been left reeling - with many shocked at the gruelling cleaning task which staff carry out ever night. One person commented: That was oddly comforting knowing they spend so long cleaning it. American TikTok user Josiah Kim has shared multiple videos on the process - which sees staff scrape grease and fat after grilling burgers. Firstly, an employee wearing globes scrapes the dark brown gunk off before pouring water onto the hot grill, which helps loosen any leftover gunk. The water turns yellow as it boils and an employee can be seen using a squeegee to remove any leftover remnants of meat or fat. The grill looks a lot cleaner at this point but there are some dark brown stains left behind. The staff member then adds goop that cleans the grill which they then scrub thoroughly. It then looks pretty clean but more water is poured over and it is scrubbed again.  In the video, Josiah adds: Itaposs so yellow and for what. But after it is rinsed again, it looks clean once more - and people in the comments were impressed. His videos giving a behind-the-scenes insight into the process have been viewed more than  million times since being shared. One viewer commented: Iaposm just happy they clean it bro. Another joked: Imagine eating the last burger before they clean it.  A third added: I felt that when you said aposscrub.apos Some were less enthusiastic about the viral video, with one viewer replying: Thank god Iaposm a vegetarian”. And some people were just confused about why they watched a video on how to clean a McDonaldaposs grill. One commented: That was oddly comforting.

Itaposs an unpleasant practice - and leaves you thinking, what did that person expect to happen when you turn up and they look totally dferent to what you expect  Do they expect you to forget or something  One woman recently received a tirade of abuse and bizarre comments after leaving a date.On TikTok, the woman explained that she met the -year-old man on Bumble and they arranged to meet at a bar in Las Vegas.But after she arrived, she was disappointed to see that he did not look like his photographs. She said: We swiped on each other and I was attracted to him because he looked like a young Harry Connick Jr.  He was very attractive, there was only a few photos, in one he was fishing, another he was next to a campfire, another it looked like he was at a party. So he looked attractive and I swiped on him and we matched. After chatting for a few days, the pair decided to meet up and met up at a local bar. But she says her first impressions wasnapost very favourable. She said: I get there, and I know where heaposs sitting and that he has a white shirt on.  Iaposm looking and I see the guy in the corner and when I saw I was expecting Harry Connick Jr, thataposs not what I got. She continued: He looked nothing like his photos...He looked worn out, he was probably five years older than his photos were. I was disappointed. So after finishing her drink, she made her excuses and left. But the man was clearly unimpressed by her exit and sent her a lot of cruel messages.  In the video, she explained: Went on a Bumble date. He was nothing like his photos and made me feel uncomfortable. So I left  minutes into the date...These are the messages he sent me for  hours, happy reading!, alongside a laughing emoji. One message said: That was so rude  What did you think I was taller  Another continued: Your just a rude ass person anyways.

Chambers have made similar calls on the furlough scheme and it must be extended until July.#Although this budget sets out some temporary respite, for many businesses without further action this short reprieve will simply be a stay of execution.#We repeat our calls for the Scottish Government to urgently publish a route map which sets out the process and timelines for the re-opening of our economy.#We are rightly in a race to vaccinate the population rapidly to protect public health, but we must be under no illusions that we are also in a race to save thousands of businesses across the UK.#Business leaders in the north-east hope to secure a region-specic rates deal and Ms Forbes said on Thursday that she was open to meeting with Aberdeen Donside MSP Mark McDonald to discuss the plan in more detail.Ms Forbes said the decision to extend the transition relief provided to Aberdeen businesses was taken because the revaluation had been further delayed but added that the extended reliefs #will hopefully be very helpful#.Speaking later, Mr McDonald said his office had been inundated with messages from businesses who are #essentially treading water# and are asking how they can access support packages to help them survive.#I#m encouraged that the cabinet secretary is willing to meet with me to discuss these issues further and hopefully she might look at some regional flexibilities, particularly around the thresholds for business support,# Mr McDonald said.#Because when you look at numbers of businesses in the north-east, in Aberdeen particularly, that qualy for the small business bonus, it is a fraction compared to where in Scotland.#We need to do something to ensure that businesses in the north-east are not being hit with a double whammy of a rates revaluation delay and thresholds for business support that continue to lock them out of much needed financial help.#And Scottish Conservative MSP for Aberdeenshire West, Alexander Burnett, called for the poundage freeze rate to be extended.He said: #The poundage rate freeze must be extended by  months and not just three.#The UK Government has pledged £. billion extra for Scotland which is more than enough for the SNP to roll out a -month extension.#Businesses across the north-east are on their knees and the effects of this pandemic will not just go away halfway through the year.#Meanwhile, Aberdeen Central MSP Kevin Stewart said:  #This was the most important budget since devolution and it will deliver unparalleled spending across the country, but what we cannot forget is that the

Outdoor Access Code applies in winter too.Making thorough preparations and ensuring you have appropriate skills, knowledge and equipment is more important than ever, along with remembering to park responsibly, take litter home and avoid disturbing sheep and other grazing animals.Stuart Younie, chief executive of Mountaineering Scotland, said: #There are fewer people about in the hills and mountains because most are adhering to the travel guidelines and tending to choose less busy areas, meaning climbers, walkers and skiers need to be far more dependent on their own skills and resources.#The unusually cold start to this year has also brought full winter conditions to the lower hills and paths, which means we have seen skiing and winter walking taking place in areas where we wouldn’t normally see so much activity, especially in the hills accessible from the central belt.#Damon Powell, chair of Scottish Mountain Rescue, added: #Despite the challenges the current situation is putting on our volunteer members, Scottish Mountain Rescue teams remain ready to respond to anyone who gets into dficulty in the outdoors, wherever that may be.#If you are lost or injured and can’t

She has travelled and trekked throughout the world but now lives in Argyll amongst the scenery she loves. www.heatheryheightsDuring wintry weather and shorter days it can be tricky fitting in longer walks and time for exploring the outdoors.What is fantastic about Knapdale and Kintyre is that we only have to go a short distance to gain truly spectacular views. The three walks in this edition y from relatively short, using tracks and paths to the lovely viewpoint of Castle Dounie, to challenging, where the terrain is tough underfoot and good route finding skills are required. All three start at Crinan harbour before climbing up through oak and birch woods to gain open vistas with views to Jura, Scarba and Mull. The convoluted ridge walks are rugged and wild, the steep sides sweeping down to the Sound of Jura where tides race and swirl. If you are lucky you may see pods of dolphins or even whales.. At the car park a signboard shows the Crinan Trail. This is the shorter of the routes but all three start and finish together. Leave the car park and turn left. Keeping to the road by the shore you will see a trail marker post ahead leading you briefly along the shore before the path heads into oak woods. After m the path bends sharply left. To the right a faint trail heads west towards the Sailor’s Grave but your route starts its steep muddy ascent to the forestry road above.. On reaching the road turn right, after m you will reach a bench and the first junction to your left. Here you have a choice either come back from the track ahead or to your left. All routes can be undertaken in either direction. I suggest for the longer routes you go straight on and for the Crinan Trail you go left.. For the Crinan Trail follow the waymark posts and arrows. After .km the route turns right onto a path and winds up and down with glimpses of views to come. Turn left at a sign for a viewpoint. This will take you up to the knoll atop which the remains of Castle Dounie, a prehistoric dun, command spectacular views over the sound towards the Gulf of Corryvreckan. There it is said the Cailleach Bheur, a giant witch, once washed her plaid in its whirlpools. Enjoy the vista before ing down to the junction and turn left. The path now meanders down to the forestry road. Turn right and head north round the coast above Adnoe Point and back to your path down to Crinan harbour.. For the longer walks, go straight ahead at the bench . Follow the track for nearly km, which leads you round a couple of hairpin bends and above Adnoe Point, before turning south. Keep your eyes open for the waymark posts and turn left onto a path. Head uphill for m. At the viewpoint sign turn right up to Castle Dounie and enjoy. To your south is the ridge that leads to Creag Mhor.. Immediately after dropping from Castle Dounie you will see a broken down wall on your right. Follow this for a short distance until you can start to work your way up onto the ridge to your right, by a couple of birch trees with coners on the skyline above. The ridge walk is convoluted, airy, rough and summits numerous lumps and bumps with fantastic views. Keep to the crest or east side as the drop-offs to the west are impressive but not to be dallied with. The highest rocky bump of Creag Mhor is parallel to the north end of the rocks offshore.. After  minutes of knobbly and exposed ridge walking #you do not fancy tackling navigation along walls in woods # this is now the time to keep an eye out for an obvious wide firebreakin the trees, below to your left. This leads you at a ° angle straight to a forestry track in the valley below. To check you have the right point look across from the firebreak and you should see a wall continue the line on the other side. Head down the firebreak to the track and turn left. This will take you back to the junction by the bench where you can turn right on the forest road then left todown the path to Crinan harbour.. If you wish to adventure on* and are confident with your route finding then continue south on the ridge # crossing over an old wall not on the map # to where it suddenly drops to a tiny col with forest directly ahead. Ahead is a steep little rise with walls on it. One drops to the right but it is the one going southwest into the forest you need to follow, for the next m. Keeping the wall directly on your right, circumnavigating the odd boulder and ducking the odd branch, you will see that the deer have created quite a path and that the way is often clear. Eventually it drops you very steeply down to a stream with another wall directly ahead. Turn left, southeast, up the stream with the wall on your right # it is boggy # until you reach a quaint waterfall on your left. A small break in the wall to your right allows you to escape the trees that have fallen across the wall higher up. Continue with it on your left across a tree harvested area and up the bump ahead. You will pop out onto a track end.. Follow this short track down to the forest road below. Turn right and almost immediately turn left onto a grassy track that crosses a stream and heads east up into the forest. After m you will come to a sharp left-hand bend. Directly in front of you a wall goes steeply up into the trees. This is your route up to Bealach na Moine. It leads up slippery, mossy rock for m, over a barbed wired fence , up a very rough and eroded track for nearly m, past a spring hidden with fallen trees, then over more pleasant grass and moss to the col. This last section makes you realise why it is worth the effort as views open up east and west. Turn right over a couple of steep little hillocks on the ridge. Suddenly ahead you will see your goal, the trig point and the summit of Cnoc Reamhar, also known as Gallachoille Hill and a Marilyn to boot. It really is a fantastic view.. Toeither descend the way you came or drop down from one of the breaks in the ridge to the north end of the small lochan on the west side of the summit, and follow the faint Landover track north to the spring. Re-join your ascent route, taking care on the way down. Turn rightat the forest road it is now an easy km back to the junction with the bench. Turn right then left after m, following the path back to Crinan harbour.*You can also drop down the firebreak and turn right on the track to join the route up to Cnoc Reamhar,continuing along the ridge does not appeal.The described routes and accompanying information are there to be used as a guide and do not replace the use of map and compass and the skills required to use them.

The sector in Scotland accounts for around  per cent of UK production and is worth about £ million annually.One fth of these exports go to the EU, amounting to more than , tonnes a year.This is clearly a disastrous Brexit outcome for Scottish farmers and like all other aspects of Brexit, foisted on Scotland against its will.A terrible negotiating failure on the part of the Tory government, and a devastating blow to an extremely valuable part of Scotland’s farming industry, I am sure it will not be the first damaging impact to be highlighted once the deal is fully analysed.Alex Orr, EdinburghSir,The report on the Piers and Harbours Asset Management Plan and Fees and Charges –  , submitted to the Argyll and Bute Council Harbour Board meeting of December ,  makes interesting reading.At a time when budgets are tight and councils have had to make hard decisions about where to cut services, it is dficult to understand why the council budget should be used to supplement the funding of dedicated ferry infrastructure for which CMAL should be responsible.The asset management plan allocates £,, for planned marine infrastructure works for the year  , of which only £, , is devoted to multi-use facilities.

Some do exist, however, and while not attempting to be a comprehensive history, there is a nicely illustrated booklet about the hospital and its past entitled #Up The Brae#, produced a few years ago by Brenda Bratt, Jess Grant and my former colleague Dr Grace Fergusson .These photographs are a reminder of the loss of a signicant social and economic element in the fabric of Mid Argyll, where for generations it would have been dficult to find a family without some connection to #the AB#. For those who worked there, myself included, any sadness however is much more about the loss of a self-sufficient and widely respected mental health service.I was a late participant in the story of the AB, being appointed physician superintendent in , a post I held in addition to that of clinical director for mental health services for Argyll and Bute and West Dunbartonshire until , and I feel a duty to the many splendid colleagues with whom I worked to comment on the loss of the service in which the AB served as the nucleus.During the course of   the hospital was awarded the accolade #Best Mental Illness Hospital in Britain# as the result of a national competition launched by the King’s Fund and sponsored by the Sunday Times. This was a recognition of the multi-disciplinary spirit and enthusiasm for innovation that characterised the service, and the ethos of best clinical practice being led by academic excellence. The service went on to be recognised as a centre of excellence by many visiting accreditation bodies.My reason for making these points has nothing to do with nostalgia.The past has no utility in the present or the future except as a source for learning how best to proceed.The ingredients for a good mental health service are the same today as they were in  and they have little to do with buildings or even location. Staff have to feel they #belong# to something there must be a collegiate spirit binding together the ious disciplines shared professional development and peer support and clear lines of accountability. It is frankly hard to see any such features in the current delivery of mental health care.Someone once said #psychiatry isn’t sexy#, meaning that in any competition for resources with other clinical specialities, psychiatry will always lose, and so to get the best out of the NHS for folk with psychiatric disorder, exceptional effort is required. The achievements and values of the past can act as a springboard for such effort, but here they seem to have been squandered by a distant and disinterested health board.It is all too easy to avoid investing in a service by reorganising it into invisibility, but the people who pay the cost are those who deserve the best of specialist professional help.So I am certainly sad at the disappearance of the old AB, because it is symbolic of something having been lost that is much more important than stones and mortar.Professor Angus Mackay OBE FRCPsych, ArdrishaigSir,Scots have taken to online technology like never before to keep in touch during this dficult time.When we first went into lockdown, there were concerns over whether our networks would cope with this big increase in online traffic. But though customers# usage of data more than doubled, our networks were able to stand up to the demands.I’m immensely proud of the role my colleagues have played in keeping the country connected during this crisis. From the engineers who keep our broadband and mobile networks connected, to the vital contact centre staff in Glasgow, Dundee, Greenock, Edinburgh and Thurso, helping people when they need it most.I’m also proud of the role our people played in supporting the NHS in Scotland during the crisis, including working with Scottish Government to quickly provide communications to the temporary hospitals.The pandemic has shown the vital role digital technology and internet connectivity now plays in all our lives. If all homes and businesses are going to stay ahead, we know that fast and reliable broadband and good mobile coverage is going to be essential for the post-Covid recovery.We#ll continue to work with governments and local authorities to make sure that no areas are left behind.Jane Wood, BT Group Scotland Director, Alexander Graham Bell House, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures january 8 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

This is ridiculous. I have attended  years of meetings on the A and all we get is fobbed off with pathetic excuses.We need a government which will deliver results, not spend all its time plotting to get independence while ignoring the real issues like a closed A which blight people#s lives.Councillor Alan Reid, Cowal wardSir,As we move into  and parents, teachers and pupils once again find themselves facing additional challenges to deliver and attain a full and rounded education, it is worthwhile remembering the role that music can and should play in improving our lives.Firstly, music will help to support and sustain our young people through the coming months. For children and adults alike, the creative arts play a vital role in promoting wellbeing and positive mental health, providing both a means of expression during the isolation of #lockdown# and a practical as well as enjoyable pastime.Secondly # and just as importantly # playing an instrument is complementary to academic subjects and has been shown emphatically to improve wider educational success. As we consider the often daunting challenge of theto home schooling, those parents whose children can mix domestic timetables with musical lessons will understand the release and stimulation playing an instrument can deliver.Across society music is integral to our identities and is made to be shared. We now have the means to do that successfully and safely with online tools whose use has been well-honed by recent experience.So whether you#re at the start of a musical journey, or are well advanced in music-making let#s keep singing, keep dancing and keep music lessons flowing, particularly while the restrictions necessitated by the pandemic keep us apart in our own homes.Dr Kenneth Taylor, head teacher, St Mary’s Music School, EdinburghSir,As Scotland faces a second national lockdown, the country#s national walking charity, Paths for All, is encouraging the public to explore local walking routes in a bid to help combat social isolation, anxiety and loneliness while maintaining physical health.The call follows the launch of the charity#s Walk Once a Day this Winter campaign, which asks people to make the pledge of walking every day throughout January.The campaign includes an online hub which outlines the importance of walking and regular physical activity during the winter months. A iety of activities and ideas, designed to motivate iniduals of all ages, are available on the hub with podcast recommendations, creative walking advice and prize incentives.In what is traditionally the time of year which sees a surge of gym memberships and fitness plans we suggest taking up walking instead as part of our new year resolutions.With walking being one of the few essential reasons for leaving your home, it is the perfect exercise and now is the time to get into a walking exercise routine which is consistent with the current government guidelines. Walking can help with our social health as the guidelines allow us to meet with one person from one other household outside.Last year we saw an increase in Scots taking up walking during the first lockdown and the outcome has highlighted just how many benefits are attributed to walking and how outdoor exercise as many times a day as we can has become an important way to look after physical and mental wellbeing.Follow the campaign over on Paths for All social media channels #WalkOnceADay.For more information on the Walk Once a Day this Winter campaign, visit the Paths for All website.Ian Findlay CBE, chief officer, Paths for AllSir,The New Year is usually a time for a fresh start – making resolutions, getting fit, setting new challenges and goals.

Since the first lockdown measures were introduced, the average monthly number of referrals from the NSPCC’s helpline to agencies in Scotland, such as the police or children’s services, have been more than  per cent higher than the first three months of .

The revised guidance recognises that travel is severely restricted by law and owners may only travel to their boatit is kept in the same local authority area they live in.RYA Scotland, Sail Scotland and British Marine Scotland have joined together to encourage boat owners to use the services of staff where their boat is stored,at all possible, in an effort to avoid making a journey, to respect that storage providers may not be able to open and to advise owners to contact providers before travelling to confirm access.The information is tailored towards RYA affiliated clubs and recognised training centres as well as inidual members and the wider boating community across Scotland.James Allan, chief executive officer at RYA Scotland, said: #Lockdown will be disappointing for everyone, but it is still possible to go boating as a form of exercise and spending some time afloat or near the water is great for our wellbeing. It is important to remember we are in the grip of a pandemic that has become signicantly worse in recent weeks. The overriding message for Scotland’s boating community is to stay at home wherever possible as we must all help stop the spread of the virus.#Importantly in this lockdown, owners may travel within their local authority to undertake essential maintenance on their boat but may not stay longer than theof time required to undertake essential maintenance.To check what level of measures apply in your area or venue where you intend to participate in activity, please check the postcode on the Scottish Government webpage.In the meantime, RYA Scotland has decided to postpone its directly organised, non-virtual events and training in response to these measures to protect participants, volunteers and others and to reduce the risk of placing an additional burden on the emergency services at what is a hugely testing time.The RYA will be providing a range of online events and #SailFromHome activities.

In the end he agreed a deal that the Scottish Fishermen’s Federation described as #desperately poor# and #the worst of both worlds#.Fishermen are restricted to catch fewer fish in most key species. Lorries carrying stocks that have been caught were left to sit at Larkhall – unable to penetrate the new fog of bureaucracy. Scottish fishermen are forced to land the fish they can catch in Denmark, which is grim news for Scottish fish processors.Instead of trying to fix the problem, Tory Minister Jacob Rees-Mogg says the fish are happier to be British. Of course they are # the fishermen aren’t catching them.The Tories must sort out this mess they have created. Our fishermen and fish processing workers deserve better than silly remarks about happy fish.Councillor Alan Reid, Cowal wardSir,In order to avoid fishermen being adversely impacted by export delays, Scottish Conservatives leader Douglas Ross has called on the UK Government to bring forward compensation to the affected fishermen and deliver it immediately.The SNP government must also accept responsibility and deal with ongoing issues involving their agency, Food Standards Scotland, which are holding up exports within Scotland.Both of Scotland’s governments must work together to deliver for Scottish fishermen.We in the Scottish Conservatives will back Scotland’s fishing communities all the way.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward Sir,The Scottish SPCA is appealing to animal lovers in Scotland to donate much-needed food to its National Wildle Rescue Centre in Fishcross, Alloa.Scotland#s animal welfare charity had its busiest ever year in  with over , wildle casualties admitted.The pandemic caused quite a signicant drop in the number of animals arriving at the wildle hospital. Over , wild animals were brought to the centre in .As we are entering fox cub season, we are appealing for Pedigree puppy food and puppy milk.Last year, we cared for  foxes, of which  were cubs. It can be a struggle to keep up with so many hungry mouths to feed.We expect to be even busier with admissions this year so we need help from members of the public.If anyone can help with food for these young mammals, we would appreciate anything that people can spare.Puppy meat can be purchased from the wildle centre#s Amazon wishlist http:amzn.to xkUe.Steven Gray Scottish SPCA National Wildle Rescue Centre managerSir,New Year resolutions can be a good starting point for making longer term health and lestyle improvements, but most people do not stick to them. Reasons for quitting include a lack of time, a lack of support from other people and feeling daunted by unrealistic targets.Often, goals are unachievable because they are too dficult, or they do not allow enough time for you to make gradual changes.There is nothing wrong with aiming high and being ambitious, but it is important that your goal is not too dficult or time-consuming as this could leave you feeling daunted.Ask yourself the following questions: Is the goal too ambitious  Is the timeframe realistic  What specic changes do I need to make  Can I fit my new healthy behaviour around my other commitments Breaking large goals down into smaller goals can make them feel more achievable and less daunting.For example,you are aiming to lose weight, the NHS recommends that you aim to lose around  to lbsa week. You should be able to achieve this by cutting down your calorie intake by about  to  calories each day. It might take longer than planned to lose the weight, but you are more likely to stick to it and not give up.Plan how you will achieve your goal and what changes you will make to ensure you stick to it. There are online resources available to help you plan your healthy activities, such as the NHS couch to km programme or the NHS programmes for stopping smoking, cutting down alcohol and losing weight.Try to be patient and don’t expect the results from just one or two weeks of dieting to show on the weighing scales, as it may take longer.A good way to motivate you is to involve other people. If you know someone who has a similar goal to yours, try to involve them as a #buddy# to provide mutual support.They may even be able to push you a little bit harder, helping you to achieve your goals sooner. Look for groups on social media who share your goal.If you miss a fitness session or have an alcoholic drink, cigarette or bar of chocolate, try not to feel guilty. Think about what might have triggered the deviation from your goal and try to avoid it in future. Forgive yourself and aim to get back to achieving your goal as soon as possible.On average, it takes between  and  days for something to become a long-term habit. Make goals that you want to be able to stick to long term, such as improving your overall fitness, stopping smoking or maintaining your weight.If you can make it through these first few weeks, you will notice that things will become much easier.Dr Helen Flaherty, head of health promotion and education, Heart Research UK"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures january 22 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Thatrsquos because it helps build up your immune system. Vitamin C is thought to increase the production of white blood cells. These are key to fighting infections.Popular citrus fruits include grapefruit, oranges, tangerines, lemons, limesand clementines.ZincldquoZinc is necessary for a healthy immune system,\" according toMelissa Snover, founder and CEO of Nourished.\"A lack of zinc can make a person more susceptible to disease and illness.\"This essential nutrient helps maintain the bodyrsquos ability to make new cells and enzymes, process carbohydrate, fat and protein in food and also increases the speed of healing muscles and wounds.\"Foods high in zinc include red meat, shellfish, eggs, nuts, wholegrainsand legumes, such as chickpeas, lentilsand beans.BroccoliBroccoli is supercharged with vitamins and minerals. Packed with vitamins A, C, and E, as well as many other antioxidants and fibre, broccoli is one of the healthiest vegetables you can put on your table. The key to keeping its power intact is to cook it as little as possible - or better yet, not at all.GingerGinger is another ingredient many turn to when they are feeling under the weather. The antioxidant is believed to fight off cold and flu symptoms, combat nausea, and is full of iron, zinc, calcium and magnesium.However, itrsquos worth noting that a study from  showed fresh ginger may help boost the bodyrsquos respiratory system, but dry ginger did not show the same results.GarlicBefore it became a staple in cooking, garlic was actually used for medicinal purposes. From manganese to vitamin B and C, as well as selenium and fibre, it is high in immune-boosting compounds.\"Garlic is a potent anti-viral, anti-fungal agent, and eating it raw, or as an uncooked puree alongside your normal foodwill wipe-out most miscreants,\" Sara Davenport, health expert and author of Reboot Your Health told the .YogurtLook for yogurts that have live and active cultures printed on the label, like Greek yogurt. These cultures may stimulate your immune system to help fight diseases.According to Healthline, yogurt can also be a great source of vitamin D, so try to select brands fortied with vitamin D. Vitamin D helps regulate the immune system and is thought to boost our bodyrsquos natural defences against diseases.Sunflower seedsSunflower seeds are full of nutrients, including phosphorus, magnesium, and vitamin B. Theyrsquore also incredibly high in vitamin E, a powerful antioxidant.Vitamin E is important in regulating and maintaining immune system . Other foods with high amounts of vitamin E include avocadosand dark leafy greens.Mushrooms\"There are approximately  species of fungi that have been identied with medicinal properties, and many have antiviral, antimicrobial or anti-inflammatory qualities,\" says Euan MacLennan, herbal director at Pukka Herbs and medical herbalist at an NHS practice in London.\"Mushrooms are high in beta glucans ndash natural substances found to help prime our immune system, making sure itrsquos ready for action to fight off infection.\"Red peppersAccording to Healthline, red peppers contain twice as much vitamin C as citrus. Theyrsquore also a rich source of beta carotene. Besides boosting your immune system, vitamin C may help maintain healthy skin. Beta carotene helps keep your eyes and skin healthy.Fermented foodsldquoIf you like saurkraut, miso, kefir and their immune-boosting relatives, add just a spoonful or two each day to your diet, says Sara Davenport.ldquoFermented foods encourage the growth of good bacteria in your gut and when their levels are high, so are your immune levels, defending you from viral infections."},{"url":null,"title":"galashiels-man-ordered-80-hours-unpaid-work","story":"WHEN police officers visited a womans house in Galashiels while enforcing a warrant, they discovered a -year-old man in the premises.But Andrew Atkinson was already the subject of a non-harassment order not to contact the woman and was subsequently arrested.Depute fiscal Ross Price told Selkirk Sherf Court the police had visited the house in connection with an unrelated matter at around .pm on December .They discovered Atkinson and also his partner who he was banned from contacting.The court heard that the partner had asked for the non-harassment order to be revoked.Atkinson, who gave an alternative address in Galashiels, was sentenced to  hours of unpaid work for breaching the order.Sherf Kenneth McGowan agreed with a request from defence lawyer Mat Patrick to revoke the non-harassment order."},{"url":null,"title":"covid-scotland-vaccine-passport","story":"A Covid- vaccine passport system may soon be introduced in Scotland.Jason Leitch, the countrys national clinical director, said the passports are an \"interesting concept\".But what are the passports, and how would they work in Scotland What is a vaccine passport A vaccine passport is an internationally recognised travel pass which would prove whether or not people have had a Covid vaccine.It could,implemented, allow people to prove their status and potentially travel abroad.It is being pushed forward by former prime minister Tony Blair, who told Boris Johnson thatBritain should use itspresidency of the G to launch theldquointernational Covid Pass.What would a vaccine passport look like It is far too early to say, however Mr Blair says he believes the passport scheme should consist of a single, standardised digital system.

bloc into the rest of the UK.Stormont First Minister Arlene Foster branded the EUrsquos triggering of Article  of Brexitrsquos Northern Ireland Protocol to stop unfettered flow of inoculations from the EU into the region an ldquoincredible act of hostility.Ms Foster spoke with Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove about the issue on Friday evening, and called for a ldquorobust response from the UK Government.The Irish premier Micheal Martin is in discussions with European Commission President Ursula Von Der Leyen to express his concerns, according to an Irish government spokesperson.The protocol, with is part of the Brexit withdrawal deal, normally allows for free movement of goods from the EU into Northern Ireland.Under the terms of the protocol, goods should be able to move freely between the EU and Northern Ireland as the region remains in the single market for goods and still operates under EU customs rules.The EU has triggered Article  of the protocol to temporarily place export controls on this movement in respect of vaccines.It comes amid a deepening row over the allocation of the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine after the company announced delays to its EU operations.The move to activate Article  will frustrate any effort to use Northern Ireland as a back door to bring vaccines into Great Britain.Mrs Foster said: ldquoBy triggering Article  in this manner, the European Union has once again shown it is prepared to use Northern Ireland when it suits their interests but in the most despicable manner ndash over the provision of a vaccine which is designed to save lives.ldquoAt the first opportunity, the EU has placed a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland over the supply chain of the coronavirus vaccine.The regulation means Northern Ireland will be considered an export territory for the purposes of vaccine sent from the EU the Republic of Ireland.Northern Irelandrsquos vaccines arrive from the rest of the UK at present so those will be unaffected.The DUP leader added: ldquoWith the European Union using Article  in such an aggressive and most shameful way, it is now time for our Government to step up.ldquoI will be urging the Prime Minister to act and use robust measures including Article  to advance the interests of Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom.The DUP has previously pressed the British Government to invoke the Article  mechanism because of disruption to the movement of goods between Britain and Northern Ireland.Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove has told the EU the UK is ldquocarefully considering the next steps after the bloc triggered an aspect of the Northern Ireland Protocol as part of its export controls on coronavirus vaccines.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster spoke to his counterpart on the UK-EU joint committee on Friday, No  said.In a statement, a spokesman said: ldquoCDL Michael Gove just spoke to European Commission Vice President Maros Sefcovic to express the UKrsquos concern over a lack of notication from the EU about its actions in relation to the NI protocol.ldquoCDL said the UK would now be carefully considering next steps.The European Commission said: ldquoExports of goods from Northern Ireland to other parts of the United Kingdom cannot be restricted by Union law unless this is strictly required by international obligations of the Union.ldquoTherefore, movements of goods covered by this regulation between the Union and Northern Ireland should be treated as exports.ldquoWhilst quantitative restrictions on exports are prohibited between the Union and Northern Ireland, in accordance with Article of the Protocol on Ireland Northern Ireland, this is justied as a safeguard measure pursuant to Article  of that Protocol in order to avert serious societal dficulties due to a lack of supply threatening to disturb the orderly implementation of the vaccination campaigns in the member states.UUP leader Steve Aiken said Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis should be embarrassed.He added: ldquoThe EU is unilaterally invoking Article  to protect its own interests and itrsquos about time the UK Government did the same instead of being lead actors in a ridiculous charade that there is no border in the Irish Sea and that Article  canrsquot be invoked.Traditional Unionist

anything for Northern Ireland or its people is exposed as utterly bogus.ldquoThe effect of todayrsquos regulation is to disavow the much vaunted free trade from the EU to Northern Ireland as part of

Everyone who did not request a refund of their  entry fee has a place in the  race.All other Covid-secure measures to be introduced will be explained in the race information email, issued closer to the time.Gail added: #Unfortunately, there will not be the usual post-race ceilidh in , as we feel it is unlikely to be acceptable to hold an indoor event of that size in May.#However, this is a part of the traditional event weekend which we will bring back in future years.#Entries for the junior race, to be held on Saturday May , will not be opened until closer to the time, when organisers can be certain that the event can go ahead # as much notice as possible will be given before race entry opening through the group#s websiteand Facebook page .In the event that public gatherings of this size are still unable to be staged in May, the race will become a virtual event, where participants will be invited to complete a K or half-marathon distance in their home area between May  and June , and submit proof of their run. T-shirts and medals will be posted out to participants on completion.Gail said: #It is fully the committee’s intention to host a live event, but we acknowledge thatthis is not possible then a virtual race is the best alternative, after the cancellation of the  event.

He is a part-time music teacher, with a passion for jazz, whose le has not gone the way he expected.Long story short, he gets an opportunity to play with his dream band. After this amazing gig, we find his character outside the jazz club, downcast and not feeling any dferent. His friend says: #You’re like a fish who’s looking for the ocean only to discover that the water you’re in is the ocean.#He missed the joy of the day-to-day experiences, thinking the big dream would make everything better. What a lesson. We can chase the dream only to miss the journey.Le in front of us is to be grasped and appreciated daily.

I was brought up in Princes Street and it was the first time I had been out the Wee Toon. I was only  or  so it was strange to me.I loved the folks on the island who made us so welcome. Once I qualied, I went around a bit, to Africa, west and east, and the West Indies, but Jura was better than anywhere I went. I hope the people of Jura see this.Leslie McArthur, Carluke, South Lanarkshire.I have contacted our roads department about the icy and, at times, ungritted pavements in my council ward.Many of my justiably concerned constituents have been in regular contact with me on this matter.With all that is going on, whether it#s the latest lockdown or a decreasing local authority budget, our hard-working roads workers are thinly stretched and do not have an easy task. However, when it comes to our pavements and roads, safety must always come first.Our pavements must be safe to walk on all year round.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands.The Scottish Government spin machine’s use of phrases last week like #encouraging progress# about the works at the Rest and Be Thankful cannot disguise its failure to make any real progress towards a solution.At an online briefing session last month, I questioned Transport Minister Michael Matheson on why it says it could take at least five years before it even starts work on a proper solution.He waffled on about planning permission, environmental impact assessments and compensating landowners. This is ridiculous. I’ve attended  years of meetings on the A and all we get is fobbed off with pathetic excuses.We need a government which will delivers results, not spends all its time plotting to get independence while ignoring the real issues like a closed A which blight people’s lives.Councillor Alan Reid, Cowal.The new year is usually a time for a fresh start – making resolutions, getting fit, setting new challenges and goals. But with the continuing uncertainty caused by the Covid- pandemic, it seems harder to commit to making a change.With restrictions ongoing, it’s becoming even more important for us to find new and innovative ways to raise vital funds for NSPCC Scotland to help children at risk of abuse and neglect.Children have been greatly affected by the pandemic. Since the first lockdown measures were introduced, the average monthly number of referrals from the NSPCC’s helpline to agencies in Scotland, such as the police or children’s services, have been more than  per cent higher than the first three months of . And the effects are far from over.Even with social distancing, there are still many ways you can fundraise for us. From hosting a virtual quiz or coffee morning to selling handmade crafts, cakes or old clothes, we’ve got lots of great virtual fundraising ideas you can try while following the Scottish Government’s advice on social distancing.By volunteering just a couple of hours each month, fundraising in your local area, you can help make  a better year for children.So please think about using your new year passion and enthusiasm to come up with some ideas to fundraise and help us be there when children need us most.To find out more or to request your fundraising pack, visit www.nspcc.org.uk support-us events-fundraising new-year-challenge or email jen.lindsay@nspcc.org,ukJen Lindsay, community fundraising manager for NSPCC Scotland.A new survey by the Stroke Association shows that  per cent of people in Scotland don’t know that high blood pressure is the biggest risk factor for stroke, one of the leading causes of death and disability in Scotland.This is really worrying because . per cent of people in Scotland have high blood pressure.Smoking, drinking alcohol, being physically inactive and sitting for long periods, can contribute to high blood pressure, diabetes, and being an unhealthy weight, all of which increase your risk of stroke.You can start to reduce your risk of stroke by making small changes to your lestyle.To launch the first ever national Stroke Prevention Day on January , we’ve worked with our partners at the Rotary Club, LoSalt and OMRON Healthcare to help you make #OneSmallChange to reduce your risk of stroke.It’s often easiest to start off small and pick something that’s achievable for you.This may be swapping your after-work alcoholic drink for a soft one, getting up and moving regularly during the day, cutting down on salt or sugar, or joining an online exercise group.Just go to our website www.stroke.org.uk PreventionDay and receive tailored advice plus monthly emails with hints and tips.We would like you to pledge to make the change for three months, then let us know how you get on and how you found ways of sticking to your pledge.The things you tell us will help others across the UK to reduce their risk of stroke and lead a healthier lestyle in .Juliet Bouverie, chief executive, The Stroke Association. "},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week january 15 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

It is stating the obvious, I know, but as we live through another lockdown, it is tempting to focus on the liberties lost and freedoms curtailed, when there are many good things still to celebrate.Not least of these is hope, another word that is used a lot in these days. We hope the vaccines will make a dference we hope things will get better we hope our children will get back to school we hope the planet can be brought back into balance we hope.But where is the ground for hope  Science and human skill A talk on the radio a few weeks ago, before Christmas, spoke about gts, and posed the question that the vaccines that have been developed might be God’s gt to humanity this Christmas, and the skills of the scientists ultimately come from God.Because for people of faith, the ultimate hope is in the God who is the source of le and who Christians believe came to earth in Jesus to show us the way forward.#For God so loved the world, that He gave His only Son…# John :Where is our ground for hope  Surely the power of love is our only hope, the steadfast love of the Lord who #never leaves us nor forsakes us#and is with us every step of the way.Just be glad you have a glass.Reverend Steve Fulcher,"},{"url":null,"title":"sponsors kit out young pupils players","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The problem is, Smithy, a teacher#s nightmare, causes so much chaos that the head teacher ends up on a le support machine.Enter Dr Hannibal Lecture, the replacement head, and the stage is set for a war of nerves. The musical is on next Thursday, Friday and Saturday, with the curtain going up at .pm.West Coast Motors will be extending its local town service to include the school on the three nights of the production.FIFTY YEARS AGOPaul abroadWhile the financial problems of the Beatles are being investigated in London, Paul McCartney is believed to be in America.

I would expect representation from pipers, Highland and Scottish country dancers, choirs and pop groups. Any inidual performer would also be welcome as a cross-section of our community and its talent is essential.#The present plan is to travel directly from Campbeltown to Montbeliard by luxury coach. The village is about km from the Swiss border and the city of Basel.Provost McKinven added: #We would expect to form a committee which would be responsible for organising the finance and travel arrangements for about  people inclusive of press, photographer and artists.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOTwo boys birchedAt a children#s court last Friday – Sherf McMaster Campbell on the bench – two boys were charged with the theft of purses containing money from a house in Burn Road. The crime was admitted.The boys, it appeared, were messengers, and the younger one was in the habit of calling at the house in this capacity daily. The purses were taken on separate days. On the first occasion a purse containing £ s d had been left lying on a small table near the window of one of the rooms. The window was probably partially open. After the younger boy#s visit in the afternoon it was missed.Next day a purse containing s d was left in the same position, and on the boy calling at the house, the occupier challenged him with the theft. He admitted taking the purse and handed it over to the owner. Only  shillings of the  shillings and sixpence remained in the purse.While this interview was going on at the back door of the residence, the older boy, who accompanied the other on the second occasion, appeared to have devoted his attention to the room where the first purse was got, and he possessed himself of the second purse and its contents. His lordship sentenced each of the culprits to receive seven strokes with the birch rod."},{"url":null,"title":"letters january 22 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

I see Loch Fyne langoustines are sent to the EU but, living fairly close to Loch Fyne, I don#t seem to be able to purchase the product locally.I am sure UK supermarkets would be only too happy to sell, crabs, lobsters and langoustines provided by Scottish fishermen but it seems they would prefer to supply the EU rather than the home market.Fishing boats enter Campbeltown Loch regularly but there is no local supply of their catch as this is transported #up the road# as soon as it is landed.I just suggest that supplying the UK market is maybe a way out of the continual problems with our #friendly# neighbours who seem hell bent on putting continual obstacles in the way of sensible trading partnerships.Keith Abendroth, Campbeltown.I grew up in Peninver and have been hiking on the hills around the Rest and Be Thankful many times, all year round. My initial thought a few years ago was that the best solution to the problem of landslides on the Rest was building avalanche tunnels like there are on the A at Lochcarron but there is practically zero ground to build on on the downhill side of the A.The big catch-pits along the uphill side of the road do seem to work but, in the long-term, removing the unstable soil and planting lots of trees and shrubs on the rest of the hillside to hold it in place, might be the best solution.Rather than replace the road through the Rest and Be Thankful with a new route through another glen or to continue trying to stop an unstable hillside from obeying the laws of gravity, how much would it cost to remove all the soil in these watercourses which regularly slide Maybe cost-wise removing the unstable soil from the Rest would be cheaper # and quicker  # than building a whole new road If there is a landslide in a watercourse, it weakens the soil directly above it so that will slide next, followed by the soil above it, etc. The bedrock at the Rest is only a couple of feet below the surface so removing the soil in gullies liable to slide after rain might be a lot cheaper than building a new road through another glen.For a permanent solution, perhaps close off the road from Ardgartan to the Lochgoilhead junction for six months in the winter, pipe water from Loch Restil to the top of the gullies prone to sliding # at the base of the first exposed bedrock high up the gullies # let the water run for three or four months, and hydraulically remove all the loose soil, then in the spring shovel all the accumulated debris of the other side of the road It would mean short-term inconvenience for a lot of people but it might save a lot of money, time, and perhaps lives, in the long-term.Harry Hood, New Hampshire, USA. As children and young peopleto being home-schooled due to the new lockdown, there is no doubt that this will have a continued detrimental impact on mental health and wellbeing.As a coalition, we applaud the Scottish Government’s greater investment in mental health services. However, a view we share with other organisations, is that this investment is simply not sufficient.Mental health services were already under immense strain prior to Covid-, with children waiting considerable s of time for support. Recent statistics from December, for example, point to the fact that more than , children have been waiting over a year for treatment.This pandemic will only serve to make matters even worse as services deal with a backlog of those already suffering from mental health problems, added to which will be those who have developed problems over the course of lockdown.What is needed is a national crusade, delivering signicant investment in the public, private and third sectors to deliver adequate mental health support, both during and as we recover from Covid-. We must also use this as an opportunity to radically transform our mental health services, both for now and for the future, refocusing on prevention and early intervention.In the meantime, we would urge those children and their families who feel they need help not to hold back and look to get the support they need.The Scottish Children’s Services Coalition: Kenny Graham, Falkland House School Lynn Bell, LOVE Learning Stephen McGhee, Spark of Genius Niall Kelly, Young Foundations.The serious neurological condition Myalgic Encephalomylitiswill sadly be all too familiar to some of your readers at least , children and adults in Scotland live with ME, also diagnosed as chronic fatigue syndrome .Many face barriers in accessing health and social care services that meet their needs, and some professionals still don’t understand the impact of ME and its symptoms.UK charity Action for ME is trying to change this by offering people with ME across Scotland one-to-one advocacy, via phone and email, to help them be heard, understand their rights and access support.We want to expand this much-needed service, and are seeking enthusiastic volunteers in Scotland who can make the most of our online advocate training programme to develop their skills, gain valuable experience, and help improve the lives of vulnerable people with ME, all from home.Anyone who is interested in finding out more can call , emailor visit our website– we would love to hear from good listeners who can spare two hours a week.Alice Cranston, advocacy coordinator, Action for ME."},{"url":null,"title":"mark beaumont goes the extra mile for marys meals","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The promise of food attracts impoverished children to the classroom, where they can gain an education that will one day hopefully be their ladder out of poverty.And thanks to Double the Love, donations made will go twice as far. Give until January , and the UK government with match public donations to the charity, up to £ million.Gillian McMahon, director of supporter engagement at Mary’s Meals, said: #Whether it’s doing your regular run, getting on your bike or upping your daily step count, we hope that lots of people will get moving and take part in Miles For Mary’s Meals.#Those taking part in Miles For Mary’s Meals are asked to ensure that they participate in their chosen exercise challenge safely and in line with Covid- restrictions in their local area.To find out more about organising your own Miles For Mary’s Meals fundraiser, visit marysmeals.org.uk"},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week january 22 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Thank you for supporting us during this incredibly challenging time.In July we saw relaxing of restrictions, especially in churches. Was it the light at the end of the tunnel With hindsight, no. I’m anticipating an end to the pandemic – coming out of the gloom. And there have been many episodes in le in which I’ve lived in the hope of emerging through the other side of the dark night. I thank God for the hope he gives me. But, how do we know when the darkness of night has ended In a rabbinic school, a very old rabbi posed a clever question to his young students: #When can it be said that night truly ends and the day begins  When is that moment when from darkness there comes light, when it can really be said the gloom has passed and brightness is here #The first student, still a bit immature, replied: #Well, it’s when it says so on the internet.#The rabbi smiled and told him: #That’s not what I mean.#The next student said: #It’s when you can distinguish sheep from goats, because in the dark they look very similar, but when light appears they can be told apart.#The rabbi told him it was a wiser answer, but not the one.The third student said: #When you can tell the fig tree and palm tree apart.#This interested the rabbi, but, no, this wasn’t it. The rabbi askedthere were any other ideas, but there weren’t. So he told them the answer: #It is when you look at another person and do not see a stranger but a brother or sister this is when know the night has ended and the day begins.#Father Tony Wood, Saint Kieran#s Catholic Church, Campbeltown."},{"url":null,"title":"happy lockdown birthday january 22 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +viaYOURTWITTERNAMEHERE\" title\"Tweet this\"TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

After nearly a year of people taking exercise and essential journeys on foot during Covid- lockdowns, plans to keep the nation walking are more important than ever.#The increases in people walking, has highlighted the lack of good infrastructure to support safe and enjoyable travel by foot. Communities that lack local facilities within walking distance have had challenges. That’s why we are calling for investment in everyday walking to build back better after the pandemic, and respond to the challenges of air pollution, climate change and Scotland#s health record.#Ian Findlay CBE, chief officer of Paths for All, said: #We launch our manesto at a crucial point of change for Scotland as we begin to plan for le after Covid-. During lockdown, we have seen a rise in the number of people walking as many used it as a way to cope with the pressures of everyday le, to reach essential shops and services in their  area, and to connect with others and nature in a safe way.#But we need to do more to make regular walking an enjoyable and accessible choice for everyone in Scotland, from all walks of le. By investing in walking programmes and safe, attractive places to walk we can signicantly improve the nation’s health, reducing health inequalities and pressure on our NHS.#Brendan Paddy, director of Ramblers Scotland, said: #Our joint manesto makes a compelling case for investment to make walking safe and attractive for everyone in Scotland.#We believe walking can play a vital role in Scotland’s response to the challenges of Covid- and climate change # and the obesity, bioersity and mental health crises we face. Booming numbers are enjoying the outdoors in the Covid era and we need to support these people to continue to get all the health and wellbeing benefits of outdoor recreation for years to come.#"},{"url":null,"title":"why your business must act now to continue trading with europe","story":"Wyvex MediaUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

It will be aired on March  at pm.TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGOPressure piled on for quick Irish ferry decisionPressure was growing earlier this week on the Scottish Secretary to give Caledonian MacBrayne the go-ahead to operate the proposed ferry link between Campbeltown and Ballycastle in Northern Ireland.Scottish Office officials are said to oppose state-owned CalMac’s participation in the project.But earlier this week it was revealed they had asked CalMac to submit a business plan for the route. The news was welcomed by the prospective Conservative candidate for Argyll and Bute, Mr Ralph Leishman.He told the Courier: ‘This is a definite step forward and knocks on the head suggestions that the Scottish Office is totally opposed to CalMac as the operator on this route.’Scottish Office reservations are believed to centre on proposals to use the MV Claymore on the route. This would mean £, would have to be spent upgrading another vessel for relief work for its west coast services.They are also said to be concerned that no private firm appeared to be interested in running the service all year-round.CalMac’s participation in the project has been backed by politicians on both sides of the Irish Sea.Both Scottish Secretary Mr Michael Forsyth and Prime Minister Mr John Major were believed this week to have been lobbied at Westminster by CalMac’s supporters.Northern Ireland secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew is said to be among those who have contacted Mr Forsyth to support CalMac’s involvement.The project supporters have been asking the Scottish Office to consider the economic benefits the ferry could bring to Ballycastle and Campbeltown, which are both areas of high unemployment. The project is expected to create around  jobs,  of them in Argyll.The only other company which has expressed an interest in running the service, Seacat, only wants to operate it over a four-month summer season.FIFTY YEARS AGOMr Noble ill # so Provost steps in to open new airport terminalThe new passenger terminal at Machrihanish Airport will be opened on Friday at pm by Provost Dan McKinven, in the absence of Mr Michael Noble MP Minister of Trade, through illness.The new building, which has been provided by the Department of Trade and Industry in conjunction with the Ministry of Defence, is a small one situated within a self-contained enclave and is designed to improve the facilities of BEA passengers using Machrihanish.Before the terminal was built, all BEA passengers had to be taken by bus between the aircraft and the old terminal building near the main entrance of the airport, and, latterly, to a dispersal point on the south side.Under the new improvements, BEA aircraft will now taxi directly to the new terminal area, and passengers will be able to walk the short distance from the aircraft to the terminal.A new road traffic control system has also been provided because aircraft taxiing from the runway to the terminal have to cross a public road.The new arrangements have the additional advantage of reducing the distance, and, consequently, the journey time between the airport and Campbeltown.A complete shake-up of BEA Highland services is on the way. It could mean higher fares and smaller planes and the end of the name British European Airways on some routes.Last year the Highlands and Islands routes cost the company more than £,.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOSparks and FlashesThe annual meeting in connection with the Campbeltown Cottage Hospital will be held on Tuesday first at . in the Council Room.Local footballers had again an idle Saturday last week on account of bad weather.

His solution is even more batty.Driven by resentment and sepia-tinted post-Empire English nationalism, cloaked in talk of Britain and the UK, the Tories have jemmied the UK out of the world’s largest and most successful single market.Having placed the UK as a #third country# outside the EU, alongside Somalia and Kazakhstan, it is not the EU to blame for the barriers to free trade, Mr Abendroth, but the UK government and those who parroted the cruel myths of Brexiteer #sunny uplands#.Mr Abendroth suggests that the fishing industry merely sells into the domestic market as a replacement to EU trade, without thought to the timescales required to repurpose supply lines and create a viable home market # evenit could be done fishing businesses would already be bankrupt.Scotland’s economy and the living standards and opportunities of Scots have been thrown under the wheels of England’s red Brexit bus. Never have the consequences of permitting Westminster to rule our country been more stark.But the time is coming when Scotland will have the historic opportunity to regain the huge benefits of EU membership and become a normal, thriving, independent state at the heart of Europe. There is an empty seat at the top table in Europe # and it won’t be empty for long.Ron Wilson, secretary, Kintyre SNP.Remember the closing stages of the Brexit negotiations  Boris Johnson pretended he was holding out to get the best deal for fishermen. In the end he agreed a deal that the Scottish Fishermen’s Federation described as #desperately poor# and #the worst of both worlds#.Fishermen are restricted to catch fewer fish in most key species. Lorries carrying stocks that have been caught were left to sit at Larkhall – unable to penetrate the new fog of bureaucracy. Scottish fishermen are forced to land the fish they can catch in Denmark – grim news for Scottish fish processors.Instead of trying to fix the problem, Tory Minister Jacob Rees-Mogg says the fish are happier to be British. Of course they are – the fishermen aren’t catching them.The Tories must sort out this mess they have created. Our fishermen and fish processing workers deserve better than silly remarks about happy fish.Councillor Alan Reid, Cowal ward.Keith Abendroth is spot on with his call for the fishing industry in Campbeltown to supply the home market.During my three-and-a-half years in the town it was possible to buy directly from the boat on occasion but it was nigh on impossible to buy fresh live lobster in the town#s fish shop.When I was new to the town , I experienced some shocking service at the some of the small retailers who I always endeavour to support. It is easier to get a full range of seafood and fish in Peebles, about  miles from the sea, which has an excellent fish shop supplied from Eyemouth on the East Coast.Much Welsh shellfish is sent by air to Europe. I often wondered why lorries trundled from Campbeltown across the Rest and Be Thankful and all the way to the English Channel crossings.Much of the st century supply chain is a mystery to me. For instance, much Pacic wild salmon is processed in China before being exported to the UK.  It is an excellent alternative to the farmed version at roughly the same price.Surely a town with an airport could develop a sea product freight service or is it simply down to volume, weight and cost Mark Davey, Peebles.Two weeks ago, at Campbeltown Free Church, we received a letter of thanks from Blythswood Care for filling shoeboxes to support the  Shoe Box Appeal.However, we are aware that many who contributed do not belong to Campbeltown Free Church.So, through the pages of the Courier, can I thank them for their kindness towards people they have never met but whose lives have been enriched by their generosity Dr Rodger M Crooks, Campbeltown Free Church minister.Like many, many other residents in Argyll and Bute I have received through the post a bizarre leaflet from the Liberal Democrats. Bizarre, because it promotes a candidate standing in a completely dferent seat # Caithness, Sutherland and Ross.Meanwhile, the good folk of Caithness, Sutherland and Ross have been equally mystied as to why the hapless Lib Dems have sent them leaflets promoting a candidate in Argyll and Bute!The Lib Dems have certainly lost their way when it comes to their policy on the EU # but it seems that they#ve lost their way in Scotland too.Les Wilson, Islay.Earlier this month the Prime Minister announced a third national lockdown. Although necessary, these measures mean many of our veterans will be facing the next several weeks – or months – completely alone.And while the vaccine rollout out across the country provides some hope, social isolation and loneliness poses a real threat to our elderly this winter, among them many former RAF personnel and their partners supported by the fund.To help combat this, last year the RAF Benevolent Fund introduced a weekly Check and Chat service to support members of the RAF Family experiencing loneliness. I speak to one such gentleman every Tuesday. He lives alone and spent much of  totally isolated and, for him, this service truly is a leline. We chat about what he’s been up to, what he’s cooking for tea, to his time in the RAF and often I’m the only person he will speak to for days.The fund also organises weekly telephone friendship groups, provides access to a listening and counselling service, relationship counselling support, and an online wellbeing portal to help support emotional wellbeing amongst the veteran community.Throughout the pandemic, many of us have learnt more about our neighbours and local community. That’s why we are calling on the people of Scotland to consider whether they know any RAF veterans, or their spouses or widows, who may be experiencing loneliness.To refer someone to the RAF Benevolent Fund, please visit rafbf.org or call   .Air Vice-Marshal Chris Elliot, chief executive, RAF Benevolent Fund."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week january 29 2021","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

He says it should be capable of tracking and verying an iniduals vaccine status across the world.It could, according to Blair, involve not only how many vaccinations someone has had , but also any test results they may have had in the past.It is hoped that the data would be transferred using a QR code, which would be scanned by participating countries at borders and ports.In evidence to the Scottish Parliamentrsquos Covid- Committee on Thursday, Professor Leitch said coronavirus is likely to be present in some sort of ldquoendemic form for years to come.When he was asked about vaccine passports, hesaid: ldquoI agree it is an interesting concept, the WHOhave begun to look at it.He stressed the latest scientic evidence suggests vaccination is not a ldquobinary state, but there is precedent for travel restrictions based on vaccination ndash including yellow fever certicates.Prof Leitch said: ldquoI think we will probably move towards that.

Its heyday lasted for well over  years, from its founding in  by Charles Jenners and Charles Kennington. The prospect of Edinburgh without Jenners is like Paris without the Efel Tower. On May , when the tills go silent, the city will bid farewell to its most lustrous store and the memories it holds.It was here that Christina Kay, the inspiration for Muriel Sparkrsquos Miss Jean Brodie, could occasionally be seen in her cloche hat, examining the latest couture styles. She would then go home and recreate them for herself, at a fraction of the cost. Spark was a connoisseur of Edinburgh stores, having worked as secretary for the owner of Smallrsquos which, with Forsyths and Patrick Thomsonrsquos, Darlings, Binns and Maulersquos, were in fierce competition with Jenners. In her autobiography she evokes the glamour: ldquoThe shop assistants in these super-elegant establishments all wore long black dresses and walked with a special gliding movement... On entering the store, the customer would be greeted by a tall man in morning coat and top hat. He would give a half-bow, a mere inclination: lsquoMadam desires... rsquo  ROSEMARY GORING: Celtic have no excuse for Dubai tripIn an Italian family memoir, Mary Contini recounts when her husbandrsquos mother went in search of a wedding dress, in . The department head, a Miss MacDonald, recognised the task ahead in getting the bride-to-bersquos mother to part with serious money, and plied her with champagne: ldquoMiss MacDonald assessed her adversary. She looked extremely warm in her winter coat .As a child, going to Jenners was like a trip to Disneyland. Its toy department was filled with rocking horses that cost more than the real thing, teddy bears as big as grizzlies, and trains sets that kept fathers occupied for hours on end while their wives sipped Earl Grey on the third floor, or had their hair done in its swanky hairdresserrsquos. With the shoprsquos layout constructed to mimic a magic mystery tour, the toilets were so hard to find it required the nose of a cadaver dog, or a degree in orienteering.Until recently, the staff exuded a self-conscious sense of distinction. They were as soigneacute as cabin crew, but with added froideur. Such a manner was perhaps necessary, given the clientele they had to serve, many of them middle-class, demanding, loud and loaded. Morning and afternoon, middle-aged and elderly Edinburgh ladies could be found taking coffee and tea in the cafe with the best view in the city. The stands during a Hearts-Hibs Derby could hardly be noisier. At lunchtime the restaurant ndash serving a Sunday-style roast six days a week ndash was always packed. With its imminent closure, there are fears that much of Morningside will starve.But it was not just women of a certain age who flocked to Jenners. Not so long ago, one of this penny-pinching nationrsquos fat cats was seen emerging, burdened with carrier bags. Always immaculately dressed, he waited every year until the storersquos famous January sale to stock up on shirts and shoes.For men of my husbandrsquos vintage, Jenners formed part of a golden triangle, with Fopp a few yards from its rear entrance, alongside the Abbotsford Bar. Moments after the shop closed, members of the cosmetics department could be seen at the gantry, recovering from another sht battling the cityrsquos bourgeoisie.A job on the perfume and make-up counters was the retail equivalent of joining the Foreign Office. A relative who worked there one Christmas discovered that staff used a secret language to ensure customers would not understand what they were saying. Conversations between spies in John le Carrersquos novels were no more heavily coded.When Jenners as we know it finally departs the scene, it will take with it the last vestige of Edinburghrsquos old air of elegance. Even so, calling it the Harrods of the North was always a misnomer. Unlike Harrods, which prides itself on attracting an international clientele, Jennersrsquo original and enduring purpose was to serve the locals. If an emporium could sum up a city, Jenners did. Its Victorian red sandstone grandeur was the embodiment of middle-class aspirations, status and image. Its splendid yet austere edice upheld the principles of value for money, good taste, and understated snobbery. When Glasgow designated itself Miles Better, Jenners typied the capitalrsquos riposte, which was Slightly Superior. ROSEMARY GORING: Country house huntersHow far off those days seem. One by one the great old stores have disappeared, like glaciers crumbling into the sea. The result is streets lined with global brands that could be found anywhere, from Bogota to Berlin. When Grayrsquos hardware store on George Street closed some years ago ndash like Crockettsrsquo big brother, it was a treasure trove of door hooks, bath plugs, vacuums and hostess trollies ndash it was obvious we were approaching the end times of traditional shopping.Nor is Edinburgh alone in suffering a surfeit of closures. The casualties of the pandemic afflict almost every town and city. Glasgow too is reeling, not least with the recent demise of Debenhamsrsquos in Argyll Street. Now House of Fraser on Buchanan Street and Harvey Nichols in Edinburgh are left to carry the torch of upmarket and glitzy department stores in central Scotland. Long may they thrive.Perhaps there are reasons to remain optimistic. The Danish billionaire Anders Holch Povlsen, who owns the Jennersrsquo building, has ambitious plans for it, involving a hotel, rooftop restaurant and luxury department store. Whether these will revive its fortunes is unknown. Wisely, however, he seems intent on keeping Jennersrsquo name.

Itrsquos unedying to watch politicians, of both sides, plough isive furrows while constituents die.Silence, however, is unlikely. The SNP ndash regardless of what Nicola Sturgeon says ndash is determinedly engaged in constitutional campaigning, as its recent announcement of a new roadmap to independence shows. Unionists are equally incapable of dignied silence.Inevitably, then, Mayrsquos Holyrood election becomes a de facto vote for or against a second referendum. If yoursquore pro-independence yoursquoll most likely vote SNP,you back the status quo yoursquove Unionist parties to pick from. With a majority now favouring independence, an SNP landslide is effectively guaranteed.: Yes to independence, No to the SNPNone of this serves Scotland well ndash the Holyrood election, particularly amid pandemic, should be about this nationrsquos daily governance. On domestic issues, the SNPrsquos record is unquestionably dismal. The SNP is also a party ided. On social media, the SNP regularly reduces itself to an ugly laughing stock as both sides in the nationalistsrsquo unrelenting civil war line up to attack each other, on everything from Alex Salmond to trans rights.Couple all this with the fact that Boris Johnson will never grant Scotland another referendum and wersquove a seemingly insoluble problem with only one outcome: pain for Scotland.So what to do  There is, perhaps, a simple, and maybe workable, suggestion we could explore. Allow me to bring it forward for discussion. Itrsquos this: at the May election, voters are given a second ballot paper which asks one simple question: lsquoWould you like a second referendum in the letime of this parliament rsquoThe question would be advisory only ndash it wouldnrsquot give power to hold a referendum, but would merely offer the best opportunity to get a clear understanding of the will of the Scottish people, and that after all is what matters most, and what lies at the heart of the constitutional question.The idea of this lsquoadvisory questionrsquo doesnrsquot come from the political class. The suggestion has been bubbling away under the surface of constitutional debate for some time now. Itrsquos cropped up in discussions among Herald readers ndash and readers of other newspapers ndash on debates within the commentsrsquo section of broadsheet websites, and in exchanges with journalists, including myself. Often ordinary people are much smarter than politicians.Given that wersquore already in an intractable situation, letrsquos give the idea an airing and see how it flies ndash wersquove nothing to lose, have we First of all ndash could it be done  Yes, it could. The updated  Scotland Act devolved powers over elections to the Scottish Parliament. Evidently, the wording of any lsquoadvisory questionrsquo would need to be cleared with the Electoral Commission, however,the Scottish parliament wanted a second ballot at the May election asking this lsquoadvisory questionrsquo it could, in theory, happen.Soit can happen, then the next issue is: what purpose would this lsquoadvisory questionrsquo serve Importantly,the lsquoadvisory questionrsquo revealed a majority in favour of a second referendum then the entire weight of the debate over whether or not this vote should take place falls squarely on the shoulders of Westminster. If ndash as the new SNP roadmap suggests ndash the matter of a second referendum will end up in court battles, then judges would inevitably have to take into consideration this expression of the will of the Scottish people.That, however, seems to stack the deck in favour of the SNP. But therersquos a flip-side. An lsquoadvisory questionrsquo could also provide a powerful new dynamic in Scottish politics, which limits SNP power, derived through its cornering of the market on the issue of independence.We need to be imaginative here ndash but for the sake of discussion, letrsquos suppose Monica Lennon becomes Scottish Labour leader, and the party adopts a position of not opposing a second referendum.Therersquos unquestionably a signicant proportion of independence supporters disaffected from the SNP, who would like to vote for a left-wing party, which either isnrsquot slavishly Unionist or has a more considered constitutional approach.So might there be a possibility thatan lsquoadvisory questionrsquo was put forward in May that pro-independence voters could express their desire for a second referendum without having to vote SNP  Voters could cast their Holyrood ballot in the direction of the party which most closely reflected how they wish Scotland governed, rather than through the prism of the constitution.The SNP wants the May election to be about independence. So perhaps we should do that, just not in the way the party wants it to happen ndash which is through votes for MSPs ndash but via a second ballot paper asking an lsquoadvisory questionrsquo about another referendum.: Scottish Labour must back independenceClearly, the SNP would still do well at the election, but a much-needed opposition in Holyrood might be strengthened and with the will of the people so declared, no Unionist party could dare oppose any democratic expression which favoured another referendum.Now we come to the final question ndash will it happen  Evidently, this is the first time the matter has been publicly raised, and it needs detailed discussion. I simply wish to pose an interesting question relating to the nationrsquos political dilemmas.But letrsquos be clear ndash the SNP wouldnrsquot back this idea. The idea of pro-independence voters being able to show their support for a second referendum without having to vote for the SNP would be antithetical to how this party operates. While opposition parties could exploit the idea ndash particularly a remodelled Labour ndash itrsquos unlikely hidebound Unionists would ever do so.Of course, therersquos that old thing called democracy to fall back on. Letrsquos say enough people did favour such an idea ndash whatrsquos to stop us all instructing our MSPs to obey us and implement an lsquoadvisory questionrsquo.

This would seem to a dictionary definition of both \"U-turn\" and \"mixed message\".The First Minister was keen to quote Burns to Mr Johnson.

There is an important balance to be struck between meeting cull targets, maintaining animal welfare standards and treating Scotlandrsquos deer with a degree of respect. We do not want to see a situation where deer are managed on private land as they are on public land, where the use of deer management contractors and licences to cull deer out of season and at night are commonplace.We have concerns about the welfare implications of prolically culling deer in extraordinary circumstances under licence, and we feel it relegates our iconic and much-loved deer to pest status. The time has come to rethink our approach to culling deer on public land in Scotland by promoting greater public participation in deer management through the use of qualied recreational deer stalkers.

Of four images of people doing their civic duty and staying at home, three show women caring for children, home schooling and mopping a floor. The fourth shows a man relaxing on a sofa, his arm around his we and child.The mopping is the most affronting. Not only is this peak drudge work but the mother in the picture is assisted by her daughter. Mothers little helper indeed.After some predictable outrage, the advert was pulled from the governments social media channels with a spokesman saying it does \"not reflect\" its \"view on women\".Doesnt it  Lets ask Rishi Sunak. In a statement this week to the Treasury, the chancellor said we \"owe mums everywhere an enormous debt of thanks\" for their additional labour during the pandemic.Is a thank you enough or could perhaps Mr Sunak have a think about what  mothers might want. Say, adequate maternity pay and leave, increased benefits, the end of the two child cap and accessible, affordable childcare.If we cast our minds back to November last year, when plans were being hatched for the Christmas period, a national newspaper reported that the Westminster government was afraid to say no to an extended festive relaxation of regulations due to fears of a \"mutiny of mums\".Is this all the result of a government packed with men suffering from nanny issues  Do any of them have meaningful, equitable relationships with women The \"mutiny of mums\" narrative was a particularly odd one to float, as though the cabinet is, at heart, a collection of small boys in short trousers afraid of being put over mummys knee.It cant be that they were scared of a mutiny at the ballot box, given the aforementioned failings in pay, benefits and childcare. If a politician had any genuine concerns about mothers organising politically, these things would be the source of worry.Not that mums might revolt over the lack of a chance to slave in the kitchen for eight hours, perfecting a turkey and trimmings feast for ungrateful in-laws and even more ungrateful weans.Global data from UN Women suggests the coronavirus pandemic could roll back gender equality by  years, which isnt enough to take us back to the s Tory pinnacle, but is undoubtedly a move in the wrong direction.As schools have closed and the working landscape radically altered, it is falling to women to carry out signicantly more domestic chores and family care. Pre-pandemic, for every one unpaid hour of work done by men, three was done by women.According to UN Women, that figure has increased. More women are dropping out of the labour market than men to take on caring roles, in part because the gender pay gap means its more financially viable in two-parent families for the man to continue working.The Fawcett Society said a third of working mothers reported having lost work or hours due to a lack of childcare during the pandemic, this figure rising to % for black, Asian and minority ethnic mothers.The womens rights charity also reports that, while both men and women have done more childcare since the start of the crisis last Match, the gap between the amount of time mothers and fathers spent with their children increased.Here, the Scottish Government, as part of its early years and childhood focus, has committed to giving  hours of free childcare to all three and four year olds, and some eligible two years olds but the pandemic has delayed the roll out of the scheme. Some local authorities report being able to honour the commitment while others are lagging behind.While the  hours is a welcome step, as schools and nurseries are closed, the default is women picking up the slack with childcare and home schooling.So, yes, Mr Sunak is right to acknowledge women have taken on the burdens of home and hearth. But he is wrong to normalise that default.The more that housework and childcare is framed as \"womens work\" the more dficult it becomes to encourage men to take on their fairshare. Of course, plenty of men do take on domestic roles equal to their female partners but they are the exception to the rule.The normalising of \"womens work\" is seen in the low uptake of shared parental leave. In  just % of eligible couples made use of shared parental leave, five years after the scheme was introduced.Fewer companies enhance paternity pay than maternity pay, so it makes little financial sense for fathers, when earning the greater share of the household income, to take parental leave.Unlike other countries, where paternity leave is encouraged, or even mandated, in the UK dads staying home with baby is still seen as outwith socially accepted norms. Improved paid leave for fathers needs to be embedded in law, and theof parental leave extended.Women have had to fight for their one year maternity leave - it is absolutely understandable that they dont want to give that up by sharing it with their partner. Instead of splitting  months between couples,  months or even  would be far more equitable.Post-pandemic, flexible working needs to be considered a norm also - we fit le around work when it should be, wherever possible, the other way round.Women dont need pats on the head, Rishi Sunak, or rounds of applause, we need positive and forward thinking steps. There are plenty of little helpers for mother time to cut the platitudes and put them into action."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/856920.jpg?type=article-full","title":"scots-now-exercising-less-watching-tv-first-lockdown","story":"Conversely, around one in sixof Scots are reporting watching television, streaming films and gaming, more than in the first lockdown, with .% doing these activities less.The UKs largest study into how people are feeling about the lockdown has led to new calls to ensure people know how to get access to mental health support.The study by the University College London also reveals that over one in five Scotsare working more, in particular those aged  to .People are also engaging less with hobbies than they were in the first lockdown, with nearly one in sevenreporting reduced involvement with arts and crafts and .% saying they are less engaged with other hobbies, such as gardening and DIY.Just .% and .% reported doing these activities more.Volunteering has also decreased, with % spending less time volunteering and just % increasing their volunteering during the current lockdown.The research found that the behavioural dferences to the first lockdown have occurred alongside worsening mental health.Happiness levels have decreased during the current lockdown, reaching lower levels than during April .Respondents across the UK when asked to what extent they felt happy during the past week on a scale from to  , the average in the past week was ., against . in April.Launched in the week before the latest lockdown started, the ongoing UCL Covid- Social Study has followed , participants across the last  weeks.:Coronavirus Scotland: Level four lockdown forcing gyms to close could be a health riskCheryl Lloyd, Education Programme Head at the Nuffield Foundation said: \"The findings highlight the mental health impact of the current Covid- lockdown with people reporting worsening levels of depression and anxiety, along with lower levels of le satisfaction.\"Some groups are more at risk than others including women, those on lower incomes and people from ethnic minority backgrounds.

It pains me to see that with % of our children out of school as a result of school closures, we risk taking away opportunities from our own coming generations.“The pandemic has illustrated better than most things the full consequences of the digital ide, with which we have lived for too long we see those areas of the country that have access to connectivity and those that do not, and the families who have broadband and sufficient devices for everybody to get home schooling opportunities, and those who do not. So when we come to the end of the restrictions and to rebuilding our economy, we must also look at rebuilding our own education system.”Reflecting on the impact of Government plans to renege on the . per cent Gross National Income target for international development, a Liberal Democrat policy while in Government, Mr Carmichael said: “Giving opportunities to young people in the developing world is not some act of altruism it is actually good for our own children and communities. I look at the work that has been done by Anderson High School in Lerwick for decades now through the Global Classroom Partnership, and I see what that has added to young people in Shetland. “The money—in hard cash terms—that we would be required to put in to meet the .% GNI target would already be much reduced not actually to meet that . per cent target is criminal.

However, there is still some way to go before our inter-island service is of a standard we see where in Scotland.#Orkney SNP candidate for the Scottish Parliament elections Robert Leslie said that the additional funding was brilliant news for the islands. He said: “This delivers on the fairer ferry funding calls that have been made by Lib Dems and the local authority and shows that the SNP government is in full listening mode when it comes to island issues.“I look forward to these enhanced services and reduced fares being put in place. The next step will be to engage further with the local authority and other parties on the replacement of Orkney’s ancient internal ferry fleet.”SNP MSP for the Highlands and Islands Maree Todd added: “The additional £.m in funding for inter-island ferries is a positive development and delivers on a key ask from local authority partners at a time of unprecedented financial pressure on the Scottish budget.“Whilst it is the local authority that is wholly responsible for the ferry services they provide, the SNP Government is sympathetic to the financial pressures which fall on inidual local authorities, which we know have been heightened as a result of COVID-.#She added: “It’s worth pointing out that for a long time, local authorities received no funding from the Scottish Government to support inter-island ferries, it is only under the SNP that this has changed and increased over the years. Today, we have a pledge to meet the revenue ask in full, fulfilling the SNP government’s commitment to fair ferry funding.“Considering the draft Budget meets a key ask from the Liberal Democrats, I hope to see the party get behind the budget and support it through Parliament.”Orkney#s MSP, Liberal Democrat Liam McArthur said: “This additional funding for our leline internal ferry services is undoubtedly welcome. Having been promised ‘fair funding’ by the First Minister since the last election, it’s remarkable how the prospect of an upcoming election concentrates the minds of SNP ministers.“Welcome too is the proposal to fund RET on internal ferry services. Some of these are amongst the most expensive routes mile-for-mile anywhere in the country.“Given we are still waiting for RET on Pentland Firth routes three years after it was due to be introduced and  years after it was introduced on west coast routes, it may be premature to celebrate just yet.“Of course, this will not stop SNP politicians from being first in the queue to pat themselves on the back. Let’s not forget, however, that Orkney has consistently been short-changed on ferry funding over the course of this parliament since the promises made at the last election.“There is a strong argument for the millions in under-funding now to be repaid. Indeed, it is a case SNP ministers themselves have been making to the UK Government over VAT payments for Police Scotland. If it’s good enough for police funding, it’s good enough for ferry funding.”The co-covener of the Orkney Greens, Councillor Steve Sankey welcomed the #long overdue# news.#The Scottish Greens won an additional £.million for Orkney’s ferries out of the budget settlement in , and this time around the Scottish Government has finally got there itself, after years of pressure from the three island councils involved and opposition parties,# Councillor Sankey said.“We’ve been saying for years that the knock-on effect of having to fund the deficit in ferry funding has impacted on us here greatly, and has precipitated budgetary pressures throughout Orkney. We emphasised that the situation was grossly unfair, particularly when compared to the huge increases in funding afforded to Calmac out west. The news that OIC will receive £. million next year is a relief, and will enable improvements in service such as Sunday sailings to the outer isles.#Councillor Sankey concluded: “Fairness with funding is all we’ve ever asked for, and now  years after Road Equivalent Tarf was first piloted, it seems that it will also finally be rolled out on our internal routes, although there is still no mention of the Pentland Firth.“Whilst this is good news, it now means that we turn our attention to the replacement process for our ancient ferry fleet which ranges in age from  to  years. It’s essential that any replacement proposals commit to a renewable fuel component, be it hydrogen, ammonia or electric, so that we can greatly reduce the high carbon emissions that afflict our marine transport sector.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

the rest of the UK.Stormont First Minister Arlene Foster branded the EUrsquos triggering of Article  of Brexitrsquos Northern Ireland Protocol to stop unfettered flow of inoculations from the EU into the region an ldquoincredible act of hostility.Ms Foster spoke with Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove about the issue on Friday evening, and called for a ldquorobust response from the UK Government.The Irish premier Micheal Martin is in discussions with European Commission President Ursula Von Der Leyen to express his concerns, according to an Irish government spokesperson.The protocol, with is part of the Brexit withdrawal deal, normally allows for free movement of goods from the EU into Northern Ireland.Under the terms of the protocol, goods should be able to move freely between the EU and Northern Ireland as the region remains in the single market for goods and still operates under EU customs rules.The EU has triggered Article  of the protocol to temporarily place export controls on this movement in respect of vaccines.It comes amid a deepening row over the allocation of the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine after the company announced delays to its EU operations.The move to activate Article  will frustrate any effort to use Northern Ireland as a back door to bring vaccines into Great Britain.Mrs Foster said: ldquoBy triggering Article  in this manner, the European Union has once again shown it is prepared to use Northern Ireland when it suits their interests but in the most despicable manner ndash over the provision of a vaccine which is designed to save lives.ldquoAt the first opportunity, the EU has placed a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland over the supply chain of the coronavirus vaccine.The regulation means Northern Ireland will be considered an export territory for the purposes of vaccine sent from the EU the Republic of Ireland.Northern Irelandrsquos vaccines arrive from the rest of the UK at present so those will be unaffected.The DUP leader added: ldquoWith the European Union using Article  in such an aggressive and most shameful way, it is now time for our Government to step up.ldquoI will be urging the Prime Minister to act and use robust measures including Article  to advance the interests of Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom.The DUP has previously pressed the British Government to invoke the Article  mechanism because of disruption to the movement of goods between Britain and Northern Ireland.Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove has told the EU the UK is ldquocarefully considering the next steps after the bloc triggered an aspect of the Northern Ireland Protocol as part of its export controls on coronavirus vaccines.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster spoke to his counterpart on the UK-EU joint committee on Friday, No  said.In a statement, a spokesman said: ldquoCDL Michael Gove just spoke to European Commission Vice President Maros Sefcovic to express the UKrsquos concern over a lack of notication from the EU about its actions in relation to the NI protocol.ldquoCDL said the UK would now be carefully considering next steps.The European Commission said: ldquoExports of goods from Northern Ireland to other parts of the United Kingdom cannot be restricted by Union law unless this is strictly required by international obligations of the Union.ldquoTherefore, movements of goods covered by this regulation between the Union and Northern Ireland should be treated as exports.ldquoWhilst quantitative restrictions on exports are prohibited between the Union and Northern Ireland, in accordance with Article of the Protocol on Ireland Northern Ireland, this is justied as a safeguard measure pursuant to Article  of that Protocol in order to avert serious societal dficulties due to a lack of supply threatening to disturb the orderly implementation of the vaccination campaigns in the member states.UUP leader Steve Aiken said Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis should be embarrassed.He added: ldquoThe EU is unilaterally invoking Article  to protect its own interests and itrsquos about time the UK Government did the same instead of being lead actors in a ridiculous charade that there is no border in the Irish Sea and that Article  canrsquot be invoked.Traditional Unionist Voice leader Jim Allister said the EU was showing its ldquocallous true colours.He said: ldquoThis afternoonrsquos invocation of Article  of the protocol to inhibit exports of Covid vaccines from the EU to Northern Ireland is the most telling illustration imaginable that for the EU the protocol is a plaything to be exploited when it suits its selfish interests.ldquoThe idea that the EU cares anything for Northern Ireland or its people is exposed as utterly bogus.ldquoThe effect of todayrsquos regulation is to disavow the much vaunted free trade from the EU to Northern Ireland as part of its single market and instead to treat deliveries of vaccines from the EU to Northern Ireland as lsquoexportsrsquo, which they can then restrict, lest such vaccines would make their way to Great Britain.copy -.

Skye and Lochalsh LGOWIT co-ordinator Kate Hathway purchased the bikes on behalf of the project following a successful bid to the Energy Saving Trust last year.. “Kyle had been identied as a priority area and electric bikes looked like a good option for a wide age range of folk.”The e-bikes were delivered a month into the first lockdown so were quickly utilised by key workers. Since their arrival there have been  free trials, averaging three weeks per user. Common long-term conditions are arthritis, fibromyalgia, joint-replacement rehabilitation, anxiety and depression and those who struggle with weight bearing exercise. The bikes are stored on Church Road and are maintained by Kate’s husband, Ian Mackay, owner of Skye MTB Adventures.“While we have prioritised people with long-term conditions –around  per cent of users – we’ve also enabled wider members of the community to trial them as it’s better that they’re out and about all the time,” said Kate. “With the dferent power setting options the bikes can be as easy or as challenging as you want them to be.“Initially a taxi-trike was purchased along with four bikes but it just couldn’t cope with the hills in the area, so an additional two bikes will be bought to replace the trike.“It’s a shame because the idea of the trike was to help combat isolation and get folk stuck at home out and about in the fresh air,” Kate said.The project is due to continue until August  and between now and then LGOWIT will consider legacy ideas for the e-bikes beyond that date.“If the Skye cycle way ever gets developed then it would be great to have a fleet of e-bikes available for the community as part of a network joining Kyle, Kyleakin and Broadford and so that would definitely be a good option to explore,” Kate added.If you would like a free trial of an e-bike contact Kate Hathway on ,   or lgowitkate@highlandtsi.org.uk"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/SKYES-THE-LIMIT-The-Hiker-Bikers-1-scaled.jpg","title":"skyes the limit 2 fundraiser is off to a flying","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineSkye#s the Limit  began on Friday th and by Tuesday this week it had raised £.The charity challenge has tasked people to clock as many hours of exercise as they can as teams between January th and February th while raising money for Skye Cancer Care and Skye and Lochalsh Citizens Advice Bureau.One of the teams involved in this year’s fundraising efforts is the Hiker Bikers, led by team captain Tim Moore.The team is made up of Tim and his we, Christine, along with their friends Ronald and Catriona MacDonald.Tim and Christine have been married for  years and have lived on Skye for  years.They are now both retired having run their own business, Skye Linen Services, which they built up from scratch.Over the past  years, Tim and Christine have been involved with countless charities and societies on the island, Tim served as an auxiliary coastguard in Portree for  years, while Christine was a founder member of the committee for the Portree Leboat guild.Christine now helps out at Crossroads Care, while they were both heavily involved in coordinating and distributing food deliveries during the first lockdown as part of the Skye Community Response effort..He said: “Our goals for this challenge are for Chris and I, with Brandy and Meg [their dogs], to walk - hours each week, so about - miles, and when we can about two to three hours cycling a week – not with Brandy and Meg, who stay at home since they cannot pedal!“Catriona and Ronald will have no doubt more time planned for cycling than we can manage, though.”As captain, Tim has the responsibility of tallying up what Ronald and Catriona have accomplished and add that to his and Christine’s total to determine what the team has achieved for the week.He added: “Our goals are simply to maintain fitness, help the cause, have fun, get soaked – well we get soaked most days anyway!”Event organiser Sam Crowe said she was impressed by the response to the second edition of the Skye’s the Limit challenge.She said: “Skye’s the Limit  is aimed at raising money for local charities and getting the folk of Skye fit, and it has got off to a brilliant start.“Well done to the teams for raising so much already.“We have had lots of positive feedback from the teams involved.”She added: “The challenge is getting folk out and about in all weathers and helping to raise some much needed money for valuable local charities.

In the islands, Highland and rural areas and villages across the country, BBs and self-catering properties are often the only tourism accommodation, and the spend by their guests supports these fragile economies.“The business owners on today’s webinar were understandably very concerned that the poorly-drafted ‘Short-Term Lets’ licensing legislation would be hugely onerous to microbusinesses in Skye and right across Scotland and would be a catastrophic ‘double whammy’ after these very same, small family businesses have been so disproportionately hit by Covid-.”SkyeConnect maintain that the fees for licensing accommodation with the council could be as high as £, per business. that the process to determine the fees has not been completed, and urged those affected to respond to the Parliamentary consultation before the cut-off date of this Friday. The draft regulations, published just before Christmas, will then be considered by the Local Government and Communities Committee.A spokeswoman added: “The fees are not proposed to be the subject of a statutory instrument but instead are at the discretion of each local authority to set. However, the fees must be set to ensure they are sufficient to cover the local authority’s administrative expenses.“In order to calculate this, it requires work to be carried out with our finance department as to the cost of processing and determining a licence taking into account income vs expenditure. It also requires to take into account the cost of resourcing the new licensing regime including factors such as recruiting additional staff, building and IT costs.“In terms of setting dfering levels of fees, this also needs to be assessed based on whether the processing of these applications will take longer, ie be more costly to administer.“This is an ongoing exercise and ultimately cannot be completed until the draft Regulations are finalised and we know for certain what types of letting premises will or will not be included within the licensing regime. Once this is known, it will require a paper to go to the Licensing Committee on the setting of fees for their determination.” she had “raised the concerns of constituents# with the Housing Minister Kevin Stewart. She also stressed the importance of responding to the consultation.She added: “I fully understand the concern of those across Skye and Lochalsh. In particular, I realise that the tourism industry has been through the most awful time. To that end, the deadlines associated with this have been extended to April  so that the sector has some breathing space. The purpose of the licensing scheme is a set of mandatory standards which apply to all short-term lets and I imagine that the vast majority of hosts already comply with all of these standards – and more.”A working group is currently being established to develop guidance, she said, and there will “definitely be a representative from the BB sector, as well as self-catering to “influence, inform and shape” that guidance.She also maintained that the Scottish BB Association responded to both Scottish Government consultations on the issue, in  and , and were “clear that they were in favour of levelling the playing field between BBs and properties listed on s such as Airbnb.”Ms Forbes added: “In terms of fees, there has been much concern about fees of several thousand points. The Scottish Government has not specied the specic fee level that local authorities should charge, and there is scope for local authorities to consider setting dferent fees for dferent types of short-term lets.“As the MSP for Skye and Lochalsh I will ensure that the concerns of SkyeConnect and others are passed on to those steering the legislation through parliament.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/CARBOST-SHOP-1.jpg","title":"community purchase secures future for carbost","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe project was delayed due to the first covid lockdown and since then the Carbost Community Shop Community Interest Company has been working hard to organise the legal side of the purchase.: “We are so pleased that everything has gone through at last and the current owner, Sharon Thacker, has been so supportive and patient during the whole process. We cannot thank Sharon enough for keeping the shop open for the community during the covid pandemic until we took over.“Sharon has also been a great help to our newly appointed manager, Ted McMullen, and supported the handover process. This all meant we were able to keep the shop open during this period and continue to provide a vital service for the community. We are also really pleased current and experienced staff member Fiona MacLeod is continuing working for us.“The local community have been great from the very beginning and are continuing to support our new manager, Ted, as he settles into his new role.”The Scottish Land Fund, who provided the £, of funds to purchase the shop have been great to work with, said Cathy, and supported the community fully during the project.“We are really grateful that they believed in our project and helped us to keep our shop in Carbost,” she added. “We would also like to thank Minginish Community Hall Association and their project officer Henrik Micksi who supported the project in the early days. MCHA are also pleased to support the project via their Fairy Pools carpark income and have granted funds to modernise the shop’s IT system.“We are all really excited about creating a really great little community shop. New signs are coming soon with a logo designed by committee member Cath Waters, we have extra funding from the SLF for repairs and these are planned for the next few months, and as a community business we will try to expand and improve the services we offer, for example, we would like to set up a more formal home delivery service.”Carbost Community Shop CIC have also obtained grant funding from Zerowaste Scotlandfor dispensing equipment which they will be ordering soon to help develop an eco-range of products.Fellow director Janette Sutherland said: “I am delighted that the Scottish Land Fund has allowed us to retain a village shop. It is an important community hub and provides a vital service especially during critical times like the current lockdown.”As a recently arrived resident, director David Smith said it has been “heartening to see the value people place on the continuation” of the local shop.“It has been a pleasure to play a part in bringing this about,” he added. that when he moved to Carbost a year ago, he didn’t really get a chance to integrate due to Covid restrictions.“So to now have the opportunity to manage the shop I am getting to know the character of the place,” he added. “It is fantastic. The people are so open, friendly and welcoming – even to this Irishman – and the characters are great.“As we are  miles from the nearest supermarket, the shop really is a leline to many, especially in these times where people are sheltering and when the winter grips the roads. Now the community of Carbost own the shop they are able to influence it, shape it and help us develop it to make it something even more special.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3595857.jpg--.jpg?1611825143000\n","title":"big ballymena response sought for big garden birdwatch 2021","story":"RSPB NI is hoping that more people from the Ballymena area than ever will celebrate their love of nature and unite to count garden birds at the end of January for the annual Big Garden Birdwatch.In the past year, it’s been clear to see how important the natural world is to everyone’s mental health and wellbeing. There has been a surge in interest in the nature on our doorsteps and many people have come to rely on garden birds to bring joy and comfort in these unsettling times. This year’s event takes place on Friday , Saturday  and Sunday  January. People are being asked to spend just one hour watching and recording the birds in their garden, then send their results to the RSPB. Close to half a million people join in the Birdwatch every year across the UK. Just under , people from Northern Ireland took part last year.Anne-Marie McDevitt, RSPB NI Head of Species, said: “With more people having to stay at home over the past year, everyone has been spending more time outdoors and in gardens and I think as a result have been noticing nature more and having more time to engage with it.“Last year people were asking usmore birds were singing during the lockdown, but it’s not that there has been more wildle about it’s just that we’ve had more time and space to notice it.“By taking part in the Big Garden Birdwatch, you are helping to build an annual snapshot of how our birdle is doing. It is only by us understanding how our wildle is faring that we can protect it. We’ve noticed that more people have signed up now for the Birdwatch than had at this stage last year, which is fantastic. We know that nature is in crisis and together we can all take action to solve the problems facing it. Nature needs us.”Just one hour every year for the last four decades has made the RSPB’s Big Garden Birdwatch the world’s largest garden wildle citizen science project. Now in its nd year,  million birds have been counted. Last year’s results showed that house sparrows remained at the top of the Big Garden Birdwatch rankings in Northern Ireland, with an average of almost five sparrows being spotted in gardens. Collared doves flew into the top , replacing coal tits, while sightings of goldfinches and robins were up too.While counties Down and Tyrone both had the same top two in  , starlings were the most-spotted birds in counties Antrim, Armagh and Derry-Londonderry – ahead of house sparrows – while Fermanagh’s number one bird was the chaffinch.Big Garden Birdwatch continues to highlight the winners and losers in the garden bird world. While house sparrows and starlings may be the UK’s most commonly sighted birds, a closer look at Big Garden Birdwatch data shows that numbers have dropped dramatically since the Birdwatch began in . House sparrows are down %, while starlings are down %. It’s a pattern echoed by two more garden favourites, with blackbirds and robins down % and % respectively.

I have always been clear that the furlough and the self-employed schemes are essential and must remain in place until there are clear signs of economic recovery.“Since last March, I have lobbied hard with national government on this issue and I will continue to do so. It is vital workers across Northern Ireland must be able to access the support they need, not just to protect their livelihoods now, but to be in a position to plan ahead towards recovery with some degree of certainty.“It is so important that we get infections under control and allow people and business to get back to work as soon as is feasible in order to begin the process of recovery. However, these figures demonstrate that too many workers are still reliant on this essential support. Therefore it is too early to consider stopping it.“That is why I am calling on the Chancellor to extend both schemes beyond the end of April .”According to HMRC figure, Northern Ireland has a % take-up rate on the CJRS of eligible employments as at  December. This is as increase on the % take-up rate at the end of September.Around , self-employed iniduals in Northern Ireland had claimed the third SEISS grant up to  December , totalling poundm.

Right now a UK-wide clinical trial called PRINCIPLE is looking for possible treatments.PRINCIPLE is a self-enrolment research study to find treatments for COVID- for people in the community who are at higher risk of complications and it is being run across the UK.The Northern Ireland Clinical Research Network , which is leading the study here, is appealing for people over the age of , or over  with a pre-existing condition, and with typical COVID- symptoms, to take part in the study.The study is looking at patients who are especially vulnerable to COVID- because of age, or pre-existing health conditions such as obesity, heart disease, stroke, diabetes or a weakened immune system. The trial will assess whether treatment prescribed in the first  days of COVID- illness can speed up recovery and prevent the need for hospital admission. The treatments include a steroid inhaler or antibiotics.Dr Janice Bailie, Assistant Director of HSC RD Division Public Health Agency , said: “HSC RD Division continues to ensure that Northern Ireland is well placed to participate in COVID- research. Praise must be given to the entire research infrastructure in Northern Ireland for how it has responded to the COVID- crisis. The PRINCIPLE trial is another example of how research can play its part in the fight against COVID- and I would encourage anyone who is eligible to participate to consider doing so.”As a community-based primary care COVID- trial, no face-to-face visits are required of those taking part – just telephone or internet access – and participant packs will be couriered to patients’ homes.By taking part in this study, you will be contributing towards the understanding of how we can treat COVID- and how the symptoms progress. Professor Nigel Hart, Co-Lead for the Primary Care group of the Northern Ireland Clinical Research Network said: “Whilst a lot of attention has shted towards the COVID- vaccine roll-out, we still need to have treatments for those who contract the virus in order to prevent them needing to be admitted to hospital.“We know that older age is a risk factor for having a poorer outcome with COVID-. We would appeal to those eligible to get in touch with the PRINCIPLE Study Coordinating Centre to register their interest.”Those who meet the criteria can self-enrol in the study, evenyour GP practice is not directly recruiting – visit the PRINCIPLE website www.principletrial.org for more information.

The number of claimants is expected to rise further when the UK Government’s furlough scheme ends. Cherrie Arnold, director of finance at the Department for Communities, which oversees the benefits system, told MLAs that the wait for the majority of claimants for their first payment could rise from five to six or seven weeks, and there could be more staff absences and sickness due to the high workload.“We are not going to be able to help people move into work and reduce their benefits and it could lead to potential financial penalties from the Treasury,” she said.“We will be the only region in the islands that is unable to support people in the middle of the biggest economic crisis we are currently facing.”Mrs Arnold said that in an ideal scenario , staff would be needed to deal with universal credit workloads, and the system was only coping at the minute with easements from the UK’s Department of Work and Pensions and a lack of face-to-face working because of the pandemic. She said the budget announced by Finance Minister Conor Murphy earlier this month for the   financial year was “very challenging” for the department. Mrs Arnold said the proposed budget was £m of resource funding, only £m more than  .Of the department’s £m bid for resource funding, £.m was granted. In terms of capital funding, the department bid for £m and was allocated £m.She said a number of bids for additional money, including for Covid funding, homelessness, the advice sector, language strategy, disability, gender equality, anti-poverty strategies, labour market interventions and staff pay, had not been approved.This would have a signicant impact on the department’s plans, she added.In terms of the New Decade, New Approach agreement, only funding to support existing welfare mitigations had been approved. Mrs Arnold said Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey was continuing to lobby party colleague Mr Murphy for funding. Alliance MLA Kellie Armstrong said it was a “horrendous budget” and added she hoped the situation wasn’t being exaggerated to generate extra funding. SDLP MLA Mark H Durkan echoed Mrs Armstrong, saying it was not uncommon for departments to put a “poor mouth” on things.The Foyle MLA described the budget as a “complete bombshell” and a “doomsday scenario”. Sinn Fein MLA Sinead Ennis said the department was in a “very dire situation”. She said the Executive had “yet again been dealt a bad hand by the British Government” and that it was “inconceivable” no money had been allocated for labour market interventions.The South Down MLA proposed writing to the Department of Finance to support the minister’s call for extra funding, which was accepted.Belfast Most ReadPSNI ‘used bodycams to film McCourt funeral in secret’Deputy First Minister has ‘grave concerns’ over Noah Donohoe investigationSecond former health watchdog official joins disgraced care firmIan Paisley hits back saying #Catholic IRA# criticism #misplaced#Covid claims Belfast dad#s le  days after he beat cancerLatest Northern IrelandLisburn man jailed for causing death of west Belfast pensioner George McCaul by careless drivingEU moves to prevent NI from being used as vaccine backdoor to GBNorthern Ireland vaccine numbers surpass ,Guidance on hauliers picking up multiple loads issuedTaoiseach: RTE northern editor Gorman ‘was essential part of NI peace process’Latest from Belfast Lisburn man jailed for causing death of west Belfast pensioner George McCaul by careless drivingFormer NI keeper Carroll signs for DungannonSSE Arena, Wembley to host fights involving Josh Warrington and Josh KellyTunisia terror attack case expected to be heard next yearEU moves to prevent NI from being used as vaccine backdoor to GB,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueNew guidance on hauliers picking up multiple loads for transfer from Great Britain to Northern Ireland has been published By Michael McHugh, PAJanuary   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailNew guidance on hauliers picking up mixed food loads for transfer from Great Britain to Northern Ireland has been published.The industry gave a cautious welcome to the Government advice.The Northern Ireland Protocol keeps the country in line with EU trade rules and animal products require special certication.A statement from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairssaid: “Freight volumes into Northern Ireland’s ports are at normal levels for this time of year and there have been no signicant queues.Our new approach to the movement of mixed food loads into Northern Ireland, known as groupage, is more flexible and gives businesses further options as to how they meet the required SPS checksDefra statement“We have always been clear that as the Northern Ireland Protocol is implemented we would work very closely with industry and DAERAto improve ways of operating.“Our new approach to the movement of mixed food loads into Northern Ireland, known as groupage, is more flexible and gives businesses further options as to how they meet the required SPSchecks and we will continue to offer our support to hauliers and suppliers as this beds in.”Agriculture departments in Northern Ireland and Great Britain have worked with hauliers to establish the new groupage model which will aid the movements of these loads into Northern Ireland.Following successful trials with industry involving taking goods from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, two groupage models have been agreed.Groupage means lorries in the rest of the UK picking up goods at multiple points for transit across the Irish Sea.It is a common method of reducing delivery costs for smaller retailers.Paperwork required due to the protocol had created problems with that because lorry containers were being opened and resealed multiple times.Defra proposed two models, one using “consolidation hubs” in which all mixed products arrived at one premises, were consolidated and certied as a single unit then sealed.Logistics UK is cautiously optimistic that the solution proposed will help prevent delaysAlex Veitch, Logistics UKThe other, known as a “linear model”, meant every inidual consignment like an inidual pallet would be checked and sealed by a certying officer before the haulier moved on to the next pick-up.The consolidated load would be sealed at the final point of dispatch before leaving for the port.Haulage industry body Logistics UK’s general manager of policy Alex Veitch said it followed pressure from the sector to ease the administrative burden after Brexit.He said: “Logistics UK is cautiously optimistic that the solution proposed will help prevent delays, by reducing the number of vehicles needing to be inspected on arrival in Northern Irelandadministered correctly.“The sector will continue to work closely with both Defra and DAERA as the scheme develops, because it is still untested for larger volumes of traffic and it is clear that further IT developments will be required as the system evolves.“As the scheme expands, it will be vital for government to work closely with Great Britain companies sending goods to Northern Ireland to ensure they are fully briefed on how to prepare groupage loads of SPS goods for Northern Ireland.”PAMost ReadPSNI ‘used bodycams to film McCourt funeral in secret’Deputy First

Singer-songwriter Ciaran Lavery, who is from Lurgan, said he had toured extensively around Europe but was worried that free movement on an Irish passport would be diluted in practice. Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseSnow Patrol FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueSnow PatrolPatrick McCarthy, the Ulster Orchestra#s head of artistic planning and operations, said moving woodwind instruments from Great Britain to here could prove a problem under the protocol, which keeps Northern Ireland in the EU single market for goods. But Snow Patrol publicist Warren Higgins said: I totally see an advantage for those with Irish passports in terms of the ease of being able to tour and not be restricted by the amount of time you can be there within a year. However, crew are usually a mix of people from the UK or all over the world so there#s that.And I guess when it comes to accounting and matters like merchandise, Vat, payment, etc, there will be some issues that need to be looked at. But NI acts are certainly a step ahead, they#ve got the Irish passport also.Anthony Toner, a singer-songwriter in east Belfast, said: I think having an Irish passport will be an obvious kind of advantage but where it#s going to get dficult is how you travel in a situation where you#re making money and bringing instruments in and out of countries.The problem for the UK arose because there was a lack of reciprocal arrangement between Britain and the EU for musicians to tour, he said.He added: Part of the challenge is that a lot of this isn#t clear as governments are quite rightly concentrating on vital trade regulations and Covid restrictions at the borders, so musicians are still far down the list - and we won#t be travelling to gigs for a long time yet anyway.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseCiaran Lavery FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueCiaran LaveryEven NI musicians visiting the Republic for a one-off gig could be asked for a carnet - a document detailing all the equipment the band is carrying, designed to stop musicians taking expensive kit into another country and selling it without paying duty.He said he hoped revisions to the NI Protocol could eventually remove the requirement, adding: I don#t think that#s been agreed yet - and you#ll need a special green card in the Republic for car insurance cover in advance, too. The same carnet, once you have it, will cover over  dferent countries - but that doesn#t helpyou only need it for a gig in Brussels or something.Mr Lavery sees no upsides to Brexit for musicians, adding: It#s not like it#s even taking the food out of your mouth - it#s like taking the whole dinner plate away and leaving you with this other option, at least you can control your borders.I can#t remember any musician having a discussion about the benefits of closing borders. Music#s about being able to take something creative and deliver it to people across all cultures.It will be a benefit with an Irish passport that you can travel about and work freely in the EU but I have the feeling it will be looked at again.He said along with his band - up to six of them at a time - he had toured European cities like Paris, Amsterdam, Utrecht and Barcelona. It#s great to go back again and keep building your fanbase and filling dferent, bigger venues each time, he said.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseAnthony Toner FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueAnthony TonerIt#s about more than making money, it#s that feeling that there are people who feel something for what you produce.Mr McCarthy said the orchestra is booked to play a concert in Linz in Austria in May . He added: That#s all Covid-permitting though we do hope to build a mini-tour around it, going to Slovenia and Germany as well. But Brexit will undoubtedly add another layer of complications, paperwork, time and money to it all.You#ll have dferent visa requirements thoughsome people have Irish passports, that will make a dference. There can also be issues around transporting instruments - not just around Europe but into NI from GB.Some instruments contain protected species such as Brazilian rosewood, which can only enter the EU - and single market territory like Northern Ireland - from third countries like GB with an import permit. Mr McCarthy added: Sowe have a woodwind musician coming into NI, their instrument may need paperworkit contains Brazilian rosewood. We#ll have to ensure that our freelance players have the correct paperwork, and that#s not something that would have happened previously.Belfast Most ReadPSNI ‘used bodycams to film McCourt funeral in secret’Deputy First Minister has ‘grave concerns’ over Noah Donohoe investigationSecond former health watchdog official joins disgraced care firmIan Paisley hits back saying #Catholic IRA# criticism #misplaced#Covid claims Belfast dad#s le  days after he beat cancerLatest Northern IrelandLisburn man jailed for causing death of west Belfast pensioner George McCaul by careless drivingEU moves to prevent NI from being used as vaccine backdoor to GBNorthern Ireland vaccine numbers surpass ,Guidance on hauliers picking up multiple loads issuedTaoiseach: RTE northern editor Gorman ‘was essential part of NI peace process’Latest from Belfast Lisburn man jailed for causing death of west Belfast pensioner George McCaul by careless drivingFormer NI keeper Carroll signs for DungannonSSE Arena, Wembley to host fights involving Josh Warrington and Josh KellyTunisia terror attack case expected to be heard next yearEU moves to prevent NI from being used as vaccine backdoor to GB,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

They, along with hundreds of others, worked in the local laundry without pay. Some women spent a letime in the institution, died and were buried from there in unmarked or ‘communal graves. This week these women and girls, along with thousands more, were described as the ‘voiceless’ who will finally have their stories heard following the announcement of an independent investigation. The Good Shepherd St Mary’s Laundry and Refuge was situated off the Dungiven Road in the Waterside area of Derry. googletag.cmd.push It was amongst eightMotherandBabyHomes, a number of former workhouses and four Magdalene Laundries researched by a team of academics from Queen’s University Belfast and Ulster University. Almost one thousand women and girls worked at the Derry laundry between  and . PORT CITY  A local solicitor purchased the residence known as Bellevue with one of the sisters saying of their arrival that there were ‘concerns about female sexuality’ in a port city that became temporary home to large numbers of military personnel during the First World War’. This was said to be a cause for concern amongst the local Catholic hierarchy. googletag.cmd.push A woman, who was identied as Sister , gave her testimony in the research report saying: “If I remember rightly,  we … we were asked to go to Derry by the local bishop because of the war situation and all the Army that were there and all the poor girls from the Bogside you know. “So that is why they were asked to provide protection for these women.” The laundry was outfitted and the local Catholic community mobilised to help recoup funds. ‘Fancy fairs’ were held, concerts and comic operas, coal was donated and affluent Catholics from both sides of the border made donations.     In , the Bishop of Derry, Charles McHugh, noted during Mass the signicant expenses the Good Shepherd Sisters incurred ‘in order to establish an industry for the employment of the inmates and to help in maintaining the institution’. The Good Shepherd Convent built a reputation for hosting musical events with girls from the home performing. In  Bishop Edward Daly preached at a mass, held in the Good Shepherd Convent, for the Catholic Nurses Guild. The report says: “Taking up the theme of ‘questionable medical ethics’, the Bishop opined that Catholics needed to take a stance against abortion and sterilisation.” FINANCES According to the report, financial records do not suggest that extensive profits were made from the laundries. However, one file does reveal that an extensive bank balance was amassed in the Derry convent by the early s. During the Second World War, lucrative military contracts resulted in a major increase in profits. For example in , it generated a total income of pound,.s.d - the equivalent of about pound, today. In September , between sixty and seventy St Mary’s home women and girls worked unpaid in the laundry. Money was also generated by other means, such as needlework and embroidery. In , Derry City wore a new team shirt with a crest ‘artistically done by the sisters of the Good Shepherd Convent’. Following the development of the Welfare State, after , regular payments were also received by St Mary’s Derry for girls placed in the institution by the state. Files dealing with the finances of the Good Shepherd convents were ‘patchy’, researchers say, but one that offers detail on the financial status of St Mary’s Derry for  reveals it held bank reserves of pound, - around pound, in today’s values. It indicates that over pound, was earned that year from interest on investments made by the Good Shepherd Sisters in Derry. The report states that it is not possible to assess whether this money was accumulated over several decades or whether there were particularly rewarding financial periods in which the Good Shepherd Sisters were in a position to build up the Order’s cash reserves. Criticism of the practices at these laundries dated back to at least the s on the grounds of ‘exploitation’ and the ‘institutionalisation’ of women and girls who were there for long periods. During the s the women began to receive a ‘modest amount of pocket money’ which they could spend on themselves.  PHOTO: A boarded up building on the site of the former Good Shepherd Covent on Dungiven Road. REFERRALS Iniduals were sent to St Mary’s by their families, others were referred by priests and religious institutions, moved from children’s homes, ordered there by the courts and it also housed those suffering domestic abuse. A number of teenage girls who were the victims of incest or sexual assault were also placed there. The Historical Institutional Abuse Inquiry , which was published in , found that placing such victims there amounted to punishment. Reasons for referrals ranged from having learning dficulties and mental health problems, being ‘socially inadequate’, having alcohol problems and being ‘unmarried mothers’ - but records didn’t show what happened to their babies. New arrivals declined slowly in the s and s before dropping sharply in the s. However, a number of girls and women deemed to be in a crisis situation arising from the Troubles were sent to St Mary’s Derry. In , one person who gave an oral testimony known as A., aged  at the time, was brought to the Good Shepherd Convent by the police who had rescued her from being ‘tarred and feathered’. It is not clear why she was under threat of this communal rough justice. The following year a woman arrived at the convent accompanied by a Protestant clergyman. She had a Catholic boyfriend and the UDA had threatened her. In , a -year-old known as C. was placed in St Mary’s Derry by her Parish Priest because an army officer had complained to her mother that she had been frequenting an army base. Other referrals arose from the breakdown in family relationships brought about by the Troubles. Over a quarter of the women and girls were from Derry City, thirty per cent were from the Republic of Ireland and the rest from other parts of NI. Seventy-one per cent of the women and girls who entered the institution were under  years of age. In addition,  girls aged between  and  were sent to St Mary’s Derry. The Historical Institutional Abuse Inquiryconcluded that their accommodation in the St Mary’s home was inappropriate and that there were instances where they worked in the laundry. The HIAI report concluded that this should not have been permitted by the Good Shepherd Sisters and considered it ‘to amount to systematic abuse’. TREATMENT The women and girls had a regimented culture and a long monotonous work regime. This was particularly true for the period before the mid-s when few of the longer-standing Sisters had social work qualications. In evidence to the HIAI the Good Shepherd Sisters explained how their policy was to offer mentorship and support for girls and women in the St Mary’s homes. But, researchers say, this task must have been undermined by the policy of re-naming new arrivals, imposing silence at meal times and punishing infringements of their rules in a cruel and demeaning fashion as judged by the HIAI. Sisters dropped the practice of giving ‘class’ names to new arrivals in . There were also increased educational opportunities at that time but their lives were still regulated and restricted. Newcomers to the Derry laundry feared they’d spend a letime in the institution like some of the elderly residents around them and were given limited explanations about their personal histories. Sisters who worked there and priests familiar with the home maintain that the women lived ‘mainly happy lives’. Most testimonies dfer from that perspective. Women gave accounts of being slapped, hit on the knuckles and locked in a dark room, being made to scrub floors or eat meals standing up and apologise on their knees for perceived wrongdoing. One woman had her hair cut off as punishment. Another woman referred to as ID - she attended two homes in the North - remembers being taken to hospital and given injections on a number of occasions. She doesn’t know what they were for and can’t remember giving consent. ID speculated that it was a procedure carried out on young unmarried women who had two children or more. The research notes that a couple of testimonies share common perspectives with the Sisters. However, the HIAI highlighted ‘systemic failures’ on the part of the Good Shepherd Sisters including forcing young girls to perform industrial work, punishing St Mary’s girls and women for ‘misdemeanours and accepting children under school-leaving age into an ‘institution that was not completely child-centred’. In addition, it found that the state, namely the Ministry of Home Affairs Department of Health and Social Services and the Social Work Advisory Group were also responsible for failing to carry out inspections of the Good Shepherd Homes, to take steps to ensure that school-age girls were not in Good Shepherd homes for long periods and to detect the absence of a system of monthly visits to the Good Shepherd homes.  ARDMORE Over half of the women and girls departed in under a year but  women remained for over five years and a ‘signicant number of women remained for very long periods suggesting the institutionalisation’ of these iniduals. Many of the , women and girls went back to their families, were ‘sent out’, left for other convents or orphanages,  of them were placed in hospitals -  of whom ended up in Gransha Hospital. Others left for work and some ran away. Ardmore Cemetery was the only site of burial for women who died while working at the Good Shepherd Laundry in Derry. A number of plots contain the remains of St Mary’s women buried in groups of four and five. A larger plot hosts headstones recording the names of  women who died between  and . On the smaller plots, it appears headstones were added in more recent years to mark deaths that took place in the s, s, s and s. According to the research some St Mary’s women’s burial sites are unknown at this time including that of a woman who died after an accident at the laundry in .  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

They, along with hundreds of others, worked in the local laundry without pay. Some women spent a letime in the institution, died and were buried from there in unmarked or ‘communal graves. This week these women and girls, along with thousands more, were described as the ‘voiceless’ who will finally have their stories heard following the announcement of an independent investigation. The Good Shepherd St Mary’s Laundry and Refuge was situated off the Dungiven Road in the Waterside area of Derry. googletag.cmd.push It was amongst eightMotherandBabyHomes, a number of former workhouses and four Magdalene Laundries researched by a team of academics from Queen’s University Belfast and Ulster University. Almost one thousand women and girls worked at the Derry laundry between  and . PORT CITY  A local solicitor purchased the residence known as Bellevue with one of the sisters saying of their arrival that there were ‘concerns about female sexuality’ in a port city that became temporary home to large numbers of military personnel during the First World War’. This was said to be a cause for concern amongst the local Catholic hierarchy. googletag.cmd.push A woman, who was identied as Sister , gave her testimony in the research report saying: “If I remember rightly,  we … we were asked to go to Derry by the local bishop because of the war situation and all the Army that were there and all the poor girls from the Bogside you know. “So that is why they were asked to provide protection for these women.” The laundry was outfitted and the local Catholic community mobilised to help recoup funds. ‘Fancy fairs’ were held, concerts and comic operas, coal was donated and affluent Catholics from both sides of the border made donations.     In , the Bishop of Derry, Charles McHugh, noted during Mass the signicant expenses the Good Shepherd Sisters incurred ‘in order to establish an industry for the employment of the inmates and to help in maintaining the institution’. The Good Shepherd Convent built a reputation for hosting musical events with girls from the home performing. In  Bishop Edward Daly preached at a mass, held in the Good Shepherd Convent, for the Catholic Nurses Guild. The report says: “Taking up the theme of ‘questionable medical ethics’, the Bishop opined that Catholics needed to take a stance against abortion and sterilisation.” FINANCES According to the report, financial records do not suggest that extensive profits were made from the laundries. However, one file does reveal that an extensive bank balance was amassed in the Derry convent by the early s. During the Second World War, lucrative military contracts resulted in a major increase in profits. For example in , it generated a total income of pound,.s.d - the equivalent of about pound, today. In September , between sixty and seventy St Mary’s home women and girls worked unpaid in the laundry. Money was also generated by other means, such as needlework and embroidery. In , Derry City wore a new team shirt with a crest ‘artistically done by the sisters of the Good Shepherd Convent’. Following the development of the Welfare State, after , regular payments were also received by St Mary’s Derry for girls placed in the institution by the state. Files dealing with the finances of the Good Shepherd convents were ‘patchy’, researchers say, but one that offers detail on the financial status of St Mary’s Derry for  reveals it held bank reserves of pound, - around pound, in today’s values. It indicates that over pound, was earned that year from interest on investments made by the Good Shepherd Sisters in Derry. The report states that it is not possible to assess whether this money was accumulated over several decades or whether there were particularly rewarding financial periods in which the Good Shepherd Sisters were in a position to build up the Order’s cash reserves. Criticism of the practices at these laundries dated back to at least the s on the grounds of ‘exploitation’ and the ‘institutionalisation’ of women and girls who were there for long periods. During the s the women began to receive a ‘modest amount of pocket money’ which they could spend on themselves.

REFERRALS Iniduals were sent to St Mary’s by their families, others were referred by priests and religious institutions, moved from children’s homes, ordered there by the courts and it also housed those suffering domestic abuse. A number of teenage girls who were the victims of incest or sexual assault were also placed there. The Historical Institutional Abuse Inquiry , which was published in , found that placing such victims there amounted to punishment. Reasons for referrals ranged from having learning dficulties and mental health problems, being ‘socially inadequate’, having alcohol problems and being ‘unmarried mothers’ - but records didn’t show what happened to their babies. New arrivals declined slowly in the s and s before dropping sharply in the s. However, a number of girls and women deemed to be in a crisis situation arising from the Troubles were sent to St Mary’s Derry. In , one person who gave an oral testimony known as A., aged  at the time, was brought to the Good Shepherd Convent by the police who had rescued her from being ‘tarred and feathered’. It is not clear why she was under threat of this communal rough justice. The following year a woman arrived at the convent accompanied by a Protestant clergyman. She had a Catholic boyfriend and the UDA had threatened her. In , a -year-old known as C. was placed in St Mary’s Derry by her Parish Priest because an army officer had complained to her mother that she had been frequenting an army base. Other referrals arose from the breakdown in family relationships brought about by the Troubles. Over a quarter of the women and girls were from Derry City, thirty per cent were from the Republic of Ireland and the rest from other parts of NI. Seventy-one per cent of the women and girls who entered the institution were under  years of age. In addition,  girls aged between  and  were sent to St Mary’s Derry. The Historical Institutional Abuse Inquiryconcluded that their accommodation in the St Mary’s home was inappropriate and that there were instances where they worked in the laundry. The HIAI report concluded that this should not have been permitted by the Good Shepherd Sisters and considered it ‘to amount to systematic abuse’. TREATMENT The women and girls had a regimented culture and a long monotonous work regime. This was particularly true for the period before the mid-s when few of the longer-standing Sisters had social work qualications. In evidence to the HIAI the Good Shepherd Sisters explained how their policy was to offer mentorship and support for girls and women in the St Mary’s homes. But, researchers say, this task must have been undermined by the policy of re-naming new arrivals, imposing silence at meal times and punishing infringements of their rules in a cruel and demeaning fashion as judged by the HIAI. Sisters dropped the practice of giving ‘class’ names to new arrivals in . There were also increased educational opportunities at that time but their lives were still regulated and restricted. Newcomers to the Derry laundry feared they’d spend a letime in the institution like some of the elderly residents around them and were given limited explanations about their personal histories. Sisters who worked there and priests familiar with the home maintain that the women lived ‘mainly happy lives’. Most testimonies dfer from that perspective. Women gave accounts of being slapped, hit on the knuckles and locked in a dark room, being made to scrub floors or eat meals standing up and apologise on their knees for perceived wrongdoing. One woman had her hair cut off as punishment. Another woman referred to as ID - she attended two homes in the North - remembers being taken to hospital and given injections on a number of occasions. She doesn’t know what they were for and can’t remember giving consent. ID speculated that it was a procedure carried out on young unmarried women who had two children or more. The research notes that a couple of testimonies share common perspectives with the Sisters. However, the HIAI highlighted ‘systemic failures’ on the part of the Good Shepherd Sisters including forcing young girls to perform industrial work, punishing St Mary’s girls and women for ‘misdemeanours and accepting children under school-leaving age into an ‘institution that was not completely child-centred’. In addition, it found that the state, namely the Ministry of Home Affairs Department of Health and Social Services and the Social Work Advisory Group were also responsible for failing to carry out inspections of the Good Shepherd Homes, to take steps to ensure that school-age girls were not in Good Shepherd homes for long periods and to detect the absence of a system of monthly visits to the Good Shepherd homes.  ARDMORE Over half of the women and girls departed in under a year but  women remained for over five years and a ‘signicant number of women remained for very long periods suggesting the institutionalisation’ of these iniduals. Many of the , women and girls went back to their families, were ‘sent out’, left for other convents or orphanages,  of them were placed in hospitals -  of whom ended up in Gransha Hospital. Others left for work and some ran away. Ardmore Cemetery was the only site of burial for women who died while working at the Good Shepherd Laundry in Derry. A number of plots contain the remains of St Mary’s women buried in groups of four and five. A larger plot hosts headstones recording the names of  women who died between  and . On the smaller plots, it appears headstones were added in more recent years to mark deaths that took place in the s, s, s and s. According to the research some St Mary’s women’s burial sites are unknown at this time including that of a woman who died after an accident at the laundry in .  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Polite waves are offered in . Several notices placed on buildings up and down Main Street implore drivers not to park in front of their access gates. One is particularly vocerous in its insistence, with a huge notice in red above the entry and a smaller one on either side. I find myself hoping someone does park there. Ive a feeling the fallout would be spectacular. googletag.cmd.push A neon sign above the Spar shop transmits a silent traders call. Hawking wares for the st century. Skinny whips - pound. Coors  pack - pound.. Tempting. The intermittent thermometer displayed on the screen keeps passers-by up to date on the current temperature. Greying sky unleashes a squall of hail, prompting a waiting NI Electricity worker to take shelter under the canopy of Poets Corner.  The cafe itself is open for takeaway food and drinks. Inside, the woman behind the screen says it has been quiet so far today. Its cold outside, she offers by way of explanation. “Seven degrees,” I inform her, drawing on Spars meteorological information.     It doesnt stay quiet too long as the lunch time trade begins to build. The cafe operates responsibly, only permitting two customers inside at a time. Mask compliance is high in the village. Owner Rebecca explains they take the safety precautions seriously. “We try our best to make sure there arent many queues, we cant have people standing in the shop, or anything like that,” she says. “Its horrible to see the other places closed. I would know the owner of the bar next door very well, its a sin to see everywhere closed and people not working. “We closed during the first lockdown and didnt open again until June, but we didnt get any grants or anything because we were a new business. “This time we stayed open because we have got so busy with the takeaways that we can still operate, which is a good thing. “There werent as many people about at all during the first lockdown, but there seem to be more out walking about now. “The shops are definitely quieter, but there are more people out walking around to exercise.” A man in the cafe who had greeted me exuberantly up the street does so again. His enthusiasm is infectious, social distancing or not. Those brief interchanges, that leave a smile on your face, have even greater effect these days. People remain resolute despite all setbacks. Heading up Castle Street, it becomes apparent just how quiet the shops actually are. A sign in the charity shop window informs passers-by it is closed until further notice. Turf Man hard at it. The hairdressers next door lies in darkness, as does the barber further up the street. Outside the Bellaghy Bawn, though, Turf Man is perpetually busy. I tweet out a picture, asking people to guess the location. One reply suggests I wont get many quotes off Turf Man. The quiet man at the quiet end of town. Walking down the Ballyscullion Road towards Paacuteirc Seaacuten de Bruacuten, the traffic noise subsides to a faint rumble. My footsteps begin to echo off the low walls of the houses on my left. A bottle blown across the road by the stf breeze rattles into earshot, against a backdrop of chirping birds. It is quiet down here. Some walkers are braving the changeable weather to get their steps in. A woman walking her dog walks along the empty stand on the far side of the pitch. I contemplate the plaque commemorating Sean Brown. The words remembering his tragic death are framed by a bleak sky. In need of inspiration, I head for Seamus Heaneys grave. At the chapel, two men are standing on scaffolding that reaches half way up its tower, staring upwards. With all churches closed, they can work largely undisturbed. The grave of Seamus Heaney. There is no one  in the graveyard, not even weary home-schooling parents taking a school trip to the Poet Laureates resting place. On the way back into the town, three children are playing in the yard of Bellaghy Primary School. A member of staff supervises. Their laughter carries on the breeze all the way down the hill. If only the drivers shooting disapproving looks at each other on the roundabout could hear it. Throughout Bellaghy, there are sets of outdoor chairs set into the concrete pavements. Under normal circumstances, people would be passing their lunchtime sitting in them, chatting to others. As I sit outside the pharmacy, the postman pulls up to the Spar, collecting letters and parcels from its post office. An NI Water van passes through. An Ulsterbus carrying just two passengers. Tractors rattle busily up and down the street. A DHL delivery van approaches the roundabout, the driver glancing at the street signs before turning left towards Castledawson. The unsung are quietly grafting away, navigating the pandemic and ensuring le goes on. No rest for the essential.  Back in the car, a radio bulletin announces the Northern Ireland Executive have extended lockdown measures for a month. Normalitys odds have ened. So much of normal le feels empty at present. The constant cycle of infection, sickness and death has hollowed it out. Leaving Bellaghy, Im struck by the symbolism of those empty chairs. Despite your best efforts, sometimes grim reminders are impossible to avoid.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Patsy, a native of Ardboe, has left a huge imprint on the Oakleaf County in terms of the Owenbeg Centre of Excellence project, as well as his involvement with Magherafelt, Loup and Ballinderry clubs. “The role of President is an honorary one” explained Tyrone Chairman Michael Kerr, in a tribute on the Official Tyrone G Website. “But it’s also a very important role. Our County President not only acts as a figurehead for the GAA in Tyrone but is also an advisor to us, a sounding board for us, someone who sees the bigger picture and who can bring other things into play.” googletag.cmd.push Patsys GAA career ran across eight decades and is littered with achievement. He won three minor and four senior titles with Ardboe, including their first senior in  as captain. He’s played for Tyrone at all levels, managed coached teams at club and senior, minor and U county level in Tyrone and Derry and been an ever-present behind-the-scenes man. He’s also a national GAA ‘President’s Award’ winner. Patsy has also been absolutely central to three of Ulster’s great GAA successes - Derry’s totally-pioneering Owenbeg project, Club Tyrone and Tyrone’s Garvaghey project “We’re always making the point that there’s no one way of contributing to the GAA,” Kerr continued. googletag.cmd.push “And Patsy is maybe an unequalled example of how to do that. He has never sought or held an elected position at County level in Tyrone. Yet is there anybody who has done more for Tyrone than this unique man ” Patsy made his inter-county debut for Tyrone in , coming on as a substitute in a Lagan cup game against reigning All-Ireland kingpins, Down. He remained an integral part of the county team for the next  years. While looking back on his playing career, Patsy fondly regards Derry’s Mickey Niblock and Down’s Colm McAlarney as two of the toughest opponents he ever played against at county level.     From  to , he was involved in the Tyrone over ’s team, actually captaining them to an All-Ireland Final appearance against Kildare. As an all-round sportsman. Patsy could turn his hand to any sport, as he proved by taking up rugby at the age of  and continued to play competitively for the next  years. He has also represented Ulster in the boxing ring as a Light Middleweight and has many amateur bouts under his belt. Always having a love for athletics and having maintained a high level of fitness throughout his football career, it was only natural that Patsy would display the same vigour on the track as he had on the pitch. He has won  Irish Master Titles and represented Ireland on many occasions. He won two silver medals in the World Games in the m and m in Torino and is also the current holder of three Irish indoor and three Irish outdoor records in the m and m. He also had the honour of carrying the Olympic torch on its journey in for the  Olympic Games in London. Together, with his long-term running partner, Dessie Ryan, Patsy received awards from Cookstown and Magherafelt District Councils for their achievements in athletics. After marrying Maura Higgins in , Patsy moved to neighbouring Magherafelt. They had three children, Sharon and Claire, and son Brian. Brian was a player on the Magherafelt minor side that won the Derry championship in . While still playing for Ardboe, he managed Magherafelt in , reaching the Final of the Derry senior championship. In , he assisted in the coaching and training of Ballinderry, while the following year, he co-managed Magherafelt minors to championship glory. He also coached Derry’s U’s to an Ulster Title in . He went on to Co-manage a Loup side to the Derry league title, defeating a highly fancied Bellaghy in the final. In the championship final, they suffered defeat against Ballinderry, who went on to claim an All-Ireland title. He also had a term in the ’s coaching the Tyrone senior team.

Ladies football and camogie, while they bring so much to the association, are still on the fringes. To a few, they have the same respect as their male counterparts, but not by all. I write this as the news breaks of Kamala Harris being sworn in as the first female Vice President of the USA, at a time when new President Joe Biden set about uniting the country. The camogieand ladies footballboards were formed after the main body of the GAA in , but to many they have always come under the loose GAA umbrella. But officially, and more importantly, they should all be part of one association. googletag.cmd.push At county level, venues for camogie and ladies are rolled out after football and hurling have theirs set in stone. Its not uncommon for teams to be finalising their training without knowing where they are playing. Just like in Croke Park, all provinces and counties have their separate fixtures boards. But Id like to see it all rolled into one. It just makes sense on so many levels. Teresa McKennaand Colette Darraghare exceptionally helpful when seeking information for games. Likewise, Breige ONeill with all things football and hurling. No doubt there will be a degree of working together in the background. Why not take it a step further, with a central committee that leads the ious codes  googletag.cmd.push There is so much common ground. And, overall, it would help on so many fronts – promotion, sponsorship, links to the media, sorting referees and venues. The benefits are endless. God rest Hugh McWilliams, but his HA brand is emblazoned across all Derry and Ballinascreen gear. Hurling and camogie. Ladies and mens football. That says it all. Uniting all parties is not something that could be done over night and it wouldnt be without its teething problems, but it should be granted adequate time at the committee table. When you think of the households across Ireland, where players are representing the ious codes. It makes sense to have a more joined up approach.     Last week, I spoke to Magherafelts Sara Gribben who has been the clubs camogie Chairperson for  years and she is very highly thought of for the efforts she puts in. Likewise, a lot of males have channelled a lot of effort for the betterment of camogie and ladies football. As a wider association, total integration is the way forward. A few years back, Slaughtneil ran a highly successful fundraising draw. At the heart of it was Bernie McEldowney, who worked diligently with her husband Eamon, as they kept tabs on over poundk. The Emmets adopted the GAAs One Club model. The senior captains and coaching officers of all three codes are on it. There is also a fair sprinkling of all codes across the main committee. And so it should. Desertmartin Chairman Pat Kidd is proud that their club committee has many women on board as men. In , the GAA, Ladies Football and Camogie Association came together to produce a -page set of guidelines for clubs to run their affairs. When you think about the amount of dferent skills a clubs membership now has, the potential is endless. There are experts in fundraising, coaching, running events, health and well-being, all with the personality to link into the local community. It can betied together with the use of technology. It gives everyone the chance of belonging. The only drawback can be those looking out for their own kids, but a strong chairperson and high standards will quickly knock that on the head. I just think that all this potential can be railroadedthe GAA is not totally united. There is a school of thought that feels the mens side have invested all the money in sponsorship and infrastructure and should keep the mainstream GAA on its own. In my opinion, thats a very shallow mindset. In this day and age, equality is everything. Any organisation worth its salt will want the best people involved. Thats how the GAA needs to be sold. The USA, for the circus it has become over the past four years, has made a seismic statement by appointing Kamala Harris. Why  Because, like newly appointed Galway United manager Lisa Fallon, she is the best candidate. For the GAA, they know what all the ingredients have to offer at the top tables finest feast. So, its time to put them all on the official shopping list.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Companies are being encouraged to familiarise themselves with these new actions and the free services that can help them manage the changes.  HELPING HAND: Alan Lowry’s Environmental Street Furniture company has signed up for the Trader Support Service Firms that are required to trade under the Northern Ireland Protocol should access the free resources available to help them prepare, including by signing up to the Trader Support Service . One firm that recognised the need for support was Environmental Street Furniture, based in Newtownabbey, County Antrim. Its managing director, Alan Lowry, was one of the first to sign up for the TSS scheme. googletag.cmd.push “We have been actively involved with the TSS from its inception,” says Alan. “We let them know about all our trading partners in Great Britain and they made contact with them directly to make them aware of what needed to be done. Since the end of the UK Transition period, we have been in contact with them on three occasions regarding EORI, commodity codes and VAT, and they have helped us on all occasions. We have found them to be accessible, helpful and knowledgeable.” There are additional online resources that firms here can avail of such as Invest NI’s EU Exit Resilience Tool to assess where firms will need to make changes. Businesses can also access the Brexit checker tool at gov.uk transition to receive a personalised list of actions to take. googletag.cmd.push Environmental Street Furniture has made good use of these services. “We have made use of both of these tools and we found the online webinars the best tools to get acquainted with the new requirements and details, Alan says. “It’s allowed us to ensure all our paperwork and invoices are correctly set up with the new information required for processing, and also to register all our commodity codes that were needed for shipping to ensure there were no added delays.” With his experience so far, his advice to other firms is to familiarise yourselves with the necessary procedures as best you can.     He adds: “Try to use knowledgeable haulage companies and carriers. Ensure your logistics team is aware of what is needed for paperwork and processing.” KEY ACTIONS FOR YOUR BUSINESS . Assess your exposure to changes:Use Invest NI’s EU Exit Resilience Tool and access the UK Government’s Brexit checker tool at gov.uk transition. . Register for TSS:The TSS provides free training and support for businesses, and can complete declarations on your behalf. .

At present, at least % of the respondents must be in favour of the bilingual sign for it to erected. However, the council this evening voted to support a reduction of this threshold to %. The decision was described by unionist councillors at the councils monthly meeting as a backwards step for cross community relations in the local area. googletag.cmd.push However, those who backed the decision said it would promote equality. The proposal to reduce the threshold was put forward in a motion by Sinn Fein councillor Mickey Cooper. His motion read: Given the increasing demand for bi-lingual street signs to be installed in the DCSDC area, this council supports the lowering of the threshold for the installation of bilingual signage in addresses within the DCSDC boundary to %.This proposal would require one resident or their local councillor to come forward with the request to erect a bilingual street sign andthis was to gain the support of % of residents on the electoral register then this would be suffice to go forward for approval by Council. googletag.cmd.push DUP Alderman David Ramsey proposed an amendment to Cllr Coopers motion, which read:In the interests of good relations, equality and democracy, this council asks the Environment and Regeneration committee to form a working group to consider this further and attempt to achieve cross community support. However, when a vote to decideAlderman Ramseys amendment would be added to the original motion, it was defeated by  votes to nine. Members of the unionist parties on the council voted to support the inclusion of Alderman Ramseys amendment, while Sinn Fein, SDLP, People Before Profit, Aontuacute, Alliance and independent councillors voted against it.     Cllr Coopers original motion was then put to a vote and was passed by  votes to nine. Unionist councillors voted against the motion, while it was supported by all other councillors at the meeting. Cllr Cooper said the issue was not about Irish street signs but about promoting equality within all communities. This is not about removing the English language from street signs. It is about being inclusive. That is not a threat to anyone and should be celebrated, he said.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The boat, named Day Dawn N , ran ashore on August  last year and has remained anchored to the spot ever since. The retired fishing vessel had been acquired by Nathan Ross and Druso Martinez de Riquelme with a view to mooring it at the Titanic Quarter in Belfast as an Air B ‘n’ B. However, after running into dficulty last August, those plans have been put on hold. It was initially suspected that the tide was too low to refloat the boat. googletag.cmd.push However, the owners later revealed that the bigger issue was the fact that it’s suspended over a three and a half metre crater in the mudflats. In late November, the stars seemed to align to the sailors’ delight a high tide arrived and they secured the services of marine specialists to dig a channel under the boat in order to move it to a nearby marina. The drones were out to capture the moment Day Dawn made it back to sea. Unfortunately, their efforts proved unfruitful and, according to the owners, the operation cost a substantial sum of money. There has been little to no activity around the boat since the start of this year. googletag.cmd.push The Derry News asked Foyle Portthere will come a time when it may have to intervene orit’s possible the boat could become a permanent fixture on the River Foyle landscape. In response, a spokesperson said: “The responsibility for the movement of the boat remains firmly with the owners and we would encourage them to continue to do all they can to have the vessel re-floated. “This is an unfortunate situation that they have created and now must make every effort to employ further resources to deal with this problem. “We continue to monitor the location to ensure that the vessel poses no threat to the main navigation channel, nor that it is causing any unnecessary impact to the local environment.”     The boat owners were contacted for comment but none was provided at the time of publishing.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Colmcille  is a year-long commemoration marking the thanniversary of the birth of Colmcille - also known as Columba. Donegal County Council and Derry City  Strabane District Council are co-ordinating a programme for the year which includes a community grants scheme now open for applications until .pm on Friday thFebruary . Grants of €, or pound, are available for projects that primarily take place within the Donegal County Council or Derry City  Strabane District Council areas and the scheme is open to community organisations or groups iniduals working in partnership with communities. googletag.cmd.push The thanniversary recognises the importance and legacy of the th-century saint, not only for Donegal and Derry but for the island of Ireland, Scotland and across the world. The year-long celebrations will last from the thDecember  to thDecember . The programme being co-ordinated by the two councils is supported by key partners including the North West Development Fund, in conjunction with and supported by The Executive Office and The Irish Government. The programme builds on an Audit of Columban Heritage undertaken in  and is being delivered in partnership with a range of local, regional, national and international organisations. A dedicated Colmcille  Project Manager has recently been appointed as part of the programme to lead and co-ordinate cross-border commemorations for the year. googletag.cmd.push This will include a range of projects, events and activities as well as the grant scheme. The programme aims to raise knowledge and understanding of Colmcille and to establish a lasting legacy. The grant scheme will play an important role in this by supporting local communities to contribute to the year and its legacy. Colmcille  Project Manager, Deirdre Harte said Im delighted to be in post and excited for the year ahead. One of the first tasks has been to get a small grant scheme up and running to provide funding for projects that relate to any aspect of Colmcilles legacy, for example, through culture, heritage, arts, literature, spirituality, language, music or storytelling.     I would really encourage local groups to come up with creative ideas to mark this signicant anniversary which could include activities such as events, exhibitions, artwork or other projects with a strong Colmcille theme. COVID has provided unique challenges to commemorating Colmcille this year but there is an opportunity to bring celebrations to an international audience through virtual events for example. This is an exciting opportunity to showcase the creativity of our local communities and to open up Colmcilles legacy to new audiences of all ages. We look forward to seeing what ideas emerge. Full details on the funding available can be found at:www.donegalcoco.ie heritage.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27Jan2021-Life.jpg","title":"A life in football well worth it for Andy  ","story":"ANDREW Waterworth has made his mark as one of the best Irish League strikers of his generation.Having started at Kilmore Rec, the  year-old Crossgar hit-man went on to get a taste of the full-time game with a move in  to Hamiliton in the Scottish Premiership after signing from Lisburn Distillery in a pound, deal.Following hishome he joined Glentoran, claiming Irish Cup and Irish Premiership titles during a five-year spell which ended in  when he made the switch to the Glensrsquo great rivals Linfield where he has enjoyed eight trophy-laden years.The Recorder caught up Waterworth to chat about his career, his work away from Linfield, and his hopes and ambitions for his post-playing days.CB: How have you been keeping during lockdown Andrew AW: It has been very strange. I suppose with the first lockdown, things were definitely easier. It was spring, coming into summer, we all had the good weather and there was a novelty to it really. Now though, it has been slightly tougher. But listen, overall I canrsquot complain at all. Irsquom still in training, working in football too, so I am very lucky I have that.CB: How did you find things at the start of lockdown because there did appear to be some ambiguity as to whether the Irish League players could be classed as elite athletes and continue playing  That must have been confusing and unsettling AW: It was a strange one no doubt. Certainly everyone involved in the Irish League, especially at Premiership level, strives to be elite. A lot of us are full-time. I have certainly no problem with the extra training that comes with that and the extra work.But the players do need to be subject to regular testing for Covid-. It is counter-productive to what we, as a society, are trying to do in terms of curtailing this disease otherwise.There has been a lot of ambiguity, but certainly I havenrsquot encountered a player who didnrsquot want to be playing. But obviously we are all concerned that we are able to do so in as safe a manner as possible.At the end of the day, after a match or a training session, we are all going back to loved ones and people who may be vulnerable too. We want to ensure they are as protected as possible.CB: In terms of your role and your standing now at Linfield, you would be considered to be one of the veterans of the side, but you still seem as hungry as ever for goals and success.AW: Absolutely, and in many ways you know that has been the case even more since the first lockdown. At that stage I had so much on with my work with the Irish FA, I probably didnrsquot have the time I would have liked to have dedicated to my own football.But certainly you can see the dference it makes to your season and your ability to hit the ground runningyou do get that good pre-season base in.I was doing my own fitness work in the house during the lockdown.I embrace where I am at now in my career and my age. But I am fortunate in that sense. I know a lot of people who get to my stage and they basically dread retirement. I am  now, so I suppose you do think about when retirement will come.Over the past while, as one of the more senior players at Linfield, I have been able to take on more, I suppose, of that advisory role to younger players. You know those younger guys coming to me asking me about fitness programmes, looking for advice about clubs and things like that, it is great.I am still, believe it or not, learning about the game. I am adapting my role on the pitch too as I move into this latter phase of my playing career. Sometimes you have to do that.But I am going back to foundations and in many ways that has really helped my form this season.Things like learning about playing more with your back to goal, how to use that to your advantage. It is something I have really enjoyed and as I say, embraced.CB: You have played under many of the top managers in the Irish League during your time. David Healy, another local figure at the club like yourself, obviously went into the Linfield job very much managerially as a rookie, although having of course achieved so much as a player. How would you rate him as a manager and indeed how he has made that switch from the pitch to the dugout AW: David I know, never really foresaw becoming a manager. He would tell you that himself. What I do notice about him is, despite everything he achieved, he never talks about his playing days. He is a huge Linfield supporter and he is results-driven. Make no mistake though, he rules with an iron fist.He expects very high standards. It is the job of the players who are there to win. Thatrsquos it, no excuses. Dferent managers bring dferent attributes to any job. But certainly with David,you fall below his standard, you will know.With playing under the like of David Jeffrey, he is a very dferent case. He loved to create that whole ethos of lsquoeverbody hates Linfieldrsquo, and I guess tap into that siege mentality side of things.DJ I suppose, would have been a bit more touchy-feely with the players than perhaps David Healy. Jeffrey would have brought the players to the side, and had the little one-to-one man management conversations with them.But I will say working with David [Healy], especially as he himself was a striker, has taken my game to a whole dferent level since I have been working with him. There is never a comfort zone at Linfield mdash that is the big thing. That has been a key part of my longevity I believe. You constantly have to be kicking on at Linfield. Anyone who coasts at Linfield, they donrsquot last long.CB: Casting your mind back to your days with Kilmore Rec, how much do you think the Amateur League and Kilmore helped you in terms of being ready for the steps up you made AW: Thatrsquos a really good question. The Amateur League is a brilliant springboard for then moving on to the Irish League. You play real first team football. As a player, you can sometimes spend too long at bigger clubsrsquo academies.I had been at the Glentoran academy for a while before I went back to Kilmore for first team football. I was lucky at that time with the Kilmore first team that was there. I played with boys like Gary Curran, Paul Smyth, Joe McMahon.They were players who wanted to win so badly, they played fair, but they played hard. I went into Duck [Donal] Bellrsquos team just as the club were going on a great Irish Cup run that season. That gave me a complete love for the game.But I quickly got to the stage where I didnrsquot just want to do two days a week with my football. Donrsquot get me wrong, the Amateur League, Premier Section is a good standard. As a footballing family, there is a lot for us to be proud of with the Amateur League.Obviously at the moment, all the clubs at that standard are in such a dficult place, but a good club at that level serves a purpose in so many ways, especially for the community. For clubs like Kilmore, and indeed all those playing at that level, it is a real tragedy that there is no football being played at the moment.CB: You are also heavily involved in the coaching side of things with your work with the IFA. Is coaching something you think you might be interested in post-playing, and indeed do you want to remain in football when you hang the boots up AW: I am definitely at the stage now I suppose where I am asking myself how can I remain in the game. It is without doubt something I want to do, to stay in football. But it is about working out exactly in what role that would be best for me.I suppose I have been able to work on a bit of a niche thing for myself with the Irish FA with a coaching and education role. I have done a bit of work with Gerard Lyttle with the Northern Ireland under-age teams and that has been something I have really enjoyed. It is great to see the progress of the younger boys through the dferent age levels with Northern Ireland.CB: You made the move for a time to Hamilton and were up against the top teams in Scotland. How was playing over there for you AW: It is funny you ask about that. My uncle only last night was asking me about all that is happening with Celtic at the moment. When I was there in Scotland you had boys like James McCarthy, Leigh Grfiths, James Forrest all up-and-coming and you could tell easily at that stage that they were boys who were going places. It is definitely a better standard of football in Scotland than a of people realise. I remember when I moved to Hamilton from Lisburn Distillery, I had played for Distillery on the Tuesday night, and then the move to Hamilton picked up momentum quickly.All of a sudden, come the Sunday of that week, there I was playing for Hamilton at Aberdeen in a Scottish Cup game in front of , people. I have to be honest, maybe I was a bit young at the time, maybe the home sickness got the better of me, but I do regret that I came home from Scotland again so soon.I have regretted it every day. You donrsquot want to let the like of that eat away at you, but I was there. I was rubbing shoulders with the gamersquos best.If I could go back and relive that experience again, I would do it in a heartbeat. But you donrsquot want to dwell on it, otherwise it could destroy you.I trained as hard as anyone over there. Maybe I would say compared to others at that standard, I struggled technically. You can get so down on yourself but when you are younger. For me, the chance came too early.It was the last day of the January transfer window when I made the move to Scotland. It actually looked for a long time that Irsquod be going to Aberdeen. However, that fell through at the last minute. I went to Hamilton then, but unfortunately it was just the wrong club for me.I did have chances again to go across the water. When Warren Feeney got the Newport job, he wanted me to go across there, but it wasnrsquot right for me. Everyone has a dferent journey. I was a late developer.Football is a tough place. People watch the Premier League and think that is what it is all about, but in many ways that is not the real picture of what football is, the glamour that is seemingly there. It is so tough to crack the code across the water.It is especially dficult for an Irish kid. If it is an English kid at an English club or a Scottish youngster at a Scottish club, they can easily go back and forth to their family, and alleviate that home-sickness.You canrsquot have thatyou are an Irish kid over there as easily. It can be lonely at times, and it is tough there is no doubt.CB: When you look at Scottish football this season, and particularly in the Premiership for Celtic and Rangers, there has been a complete transformation in fortunes and that in the season when Celtic have been chasing that historic ten-in-a-row. Has the role-reversal between the two Glasgow sides surprised you AW: There is no doubt, the change has been really drastic. I never imagined, despite how much Steven Gerrard has improved Rangers that the gap would be this big, particularly this early in the season.I know Michael Beale, a coach at Rangers from working at the IFA. He is a methodical coach, leaves nothing to chance, and I have no doubt he will have had a big role on the success Rangers are enjoying on the pitch at the moment. Gerrard has done a great job of getting that Rangers back four shored up.But things go wrong. For Celtic, I have no doubt they have found it dficult playing without fans.They definitely feed off the atmosphere that is usually generated by the supporters at Celtic Park.And the Dubai trip has been a really unwanted distraction that has not helped them at all.I do believe however for Celtic it can be a quick turn-around. I donrsquot necessarily see that they will now have to wait years for another Scottish title, the way in which it has been so long since Rangers last won it.Celtic can dust themselves down. Football can be so fluid. That is one of the great things about it..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27Jan2021-Ballynahinch.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch named Irish club of the year by writers  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH RFC have been voted as the best rugby club in Ireland.The club was named Club of the Year by the Guinness Rugby Writers of Ireland Club of the Year.The club won the accolade for its outstanding community outreach work during the Covid- lockdown.This community spirit, said the Rugby writers, was nurtured from mini rugby players through to the seniors.Club chairman James Kirk said everyone at the club was delighted with the award.We are obviously very pleased. We have known about getting the award for a while before it was actually made public knowledge, so it has been in the pipeline, he remarked.ldquoWe are very proud that what it represents especially is our work with community engagement. That is something we pride ourselves on here at Ballynahinch.ldquoIt is really special to have been awarded the prize this year especially. It has been such a tough year, for everyone, and for all sports clubs. It is certainly a nice little boost that we have been able to get this.James said the club was concentrating on getting the green light for action on the pitch to .ldquoThat is what everyone wants and what everyone is missing. To not be able to get playing is dficult, but of course we absolutely recognise why it is the case. Public health is of paramount importance.Ballynahinch RFC usually fields seven adult teams, as well as youth teams, a ladiesrsquo team and a thriving mini rugby section.ldquoThere has been no action at the club since October. New showers, installed at a cost of pound,, have not been used, James explained.He said that before the current lockdown members were able to use their free time to make improvements around the club.ldquoWe obviously donrsquot have that at the moment, due to the current restrictions, he continued.ldquoIt was great to see how the people benefited from it. They certainly did seem to have their spirits lted. Our volunteers are a hugely important part of the club, and that has had to be stopped too.ldquoHopefully things do improve soon, but I guess we are like everyone and just have to wait and see how things develop with coronavirus.Sinead Kissane, chairperson of the Rugby Writers of Ireland, said: ldquo was a very challenging year for all, but it is also important to recognise the work and achievements of many during this dficult time..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27Jan2021-BidBirdwatch.jpg","title":"Bid for help in the Big Garden Birdwatch event this weekend  ","story":"PEOPLE across the district are being encouraged to take part in the RSPBrsquos annual Big Garden Birdwatch, which takes place this weekend.The UK-wide event is the worldrsquos largest garden wildle survey with locals asked to help from this Friday to Sunday.For many people, garden birds provide an important connection to nature and bring joy and comfort, as well as being vital for mental health and wellbeing, with the RSPB hoping for a big response to the weekend survey.RSPB NI, a charity that works to inspire everyone to give nature a home and to secure a healthy environment for wildle, is hoping that more people than ever will celebrate their love of nature and unite to count garden birds at the end of January for the annual Big Garden Birdwatch.The charity said that over the past year, itrsquos been clear to see how important the natural world is to everyonersquos mental health and wellbeing.In addition, the RSPB says there has been a surge in interest in the nature on peoplersquos doorsteps, with many coming to rely on garden birds to bring joy and comfort in these unsettling times.People keen on taking part in the birdwatch are being asked to spend just one hour watching and recording the birds in their garden before sending their results to the RSPB.Close to half a million people join in the Birdwatch every year across the UK, with just under , of them from Northern Ireland.Anne-Marie McDevitt, the RSPB NIrsquos head of species, said with more people having to stay at home over the past year, everyone has been spending more time outdoors and in gardens and, as a result, have been noticing nature more and having more time to engage with it.ldquoLast year, people were asking usmore birds were singing during the lockdown, but itrsquos not that there has been more wildle about itrsquos just that wersquove had more time and space to notice it, she explained.ldquoBy taking part in the Big Garden Birdwatch, you are helping to build an annual snapshot of how our birdle is doing. It is only by us understanding how our wildle is faring that we can protect it.ldquoWersquove noticed that more people have signed up now for the Birdwatch than had at this stage last year, which is fantastic. We know that nature is in crisis and together we can all take action to solve the problems facing it. Nature needs us.Just one hour every year for the past four decades has made the RSPBrsquos big garden birdwatch the worldrsquos largest garden wildle citizen science project. Now in its nd year,  million birds have been counted.Last yearrsquos results showed that house sparrows remained at the top of the big garden birdwatch rankings in Northern Ireland, with an average of almost five sparrows being spotted in gardens.Collared doves flew into the top , replacing coal tits, while sightings of goldfinches and robins were up too.While counties Down and Tyrone both had the same top two in  mdash house sparrows followed by starlings mdashstarlings were the most-spotted birds in Antrim, Armagh and Derry-Londonderry, ahead of house sparrows, while Fermanaghrsquos number one bird was the chaffinch.The Big Garden Birdwatch continues to highlight the winners and losers in the garden bird world and while house sparrows and starlings may be the UKrsquos most commonly sighted birds, a closer look at the data shows that numbers have ped dramatically since the birdwatch began in .House sparrows are down %, while starlings are down %.Itrsquos also a pattern echoed by two more garden favourites, with blackbirds and robins down % and % respectively.To sign up for the for the big garden birdwatch visit www.rspb.org.uk birdwatch while to learn more about RSPB NIrsquos work log on at www.rspb.org.uk nireland  .prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27Jan2021-Brexit.jpg","title":"Brexit trading with Great Britain ‘complete nightmare’%2C says owner  ","story":"THE impact of Brexit and the Irish Sea border is impacting on one of the districtrsquos most popular garden centres.Beth Lunney mdash who runs the Saintfield Nursery Centre along with her family mdash has described the impact of the most signicant change to trading in decades and one that will affect many businesses.She said changes became apparent in November, just weeks before the UK formally left the EU.As part of the garden centrersquos preparations for the new sea border it, had signed up to the governmentrsquos Trader Support Service, with Beth also liaising with her suppliers in England.Her longstanding supplier of azaleas and rhododendrons got in touch and revealed that he was not going to be able to get the delivery to Saintfield, explaining that it was because of the possibility that there could be soil in the pots.The UK supplier had correctly interpreted the new rules which apply on trade in plants between Great Britain and Northern Ireland which is still in the EUrsquos plant health system and therefore must apply EU rules on products entering from Great Britain.Plants now need a plant health certicate to enter the country, but some products are completely banned, including soil as it can carry pests and diseases, but there maybe even more problems ahead.Beth said it was being suggested in some quarters that there may be an issue with pallets and even wooden handled forks and spades coming into Northern Ireland due to Brexit and the Irish Sea border and even delays in getting wooden furniture which she currently has on order.In the wake of Bethrsquos UK supplier of azaleas and rhododendrons getting in touch, her rose supplier subsequently got in contact via email to confirm that he would not be able to supply roses which had been on order since the autumn for planned deliveries throughout the season.ldquoThe problem is the peat reduced compost they use along with wood fibre and bark to pot up the roses, Beth explained, expressing sympathy for her suppliers.ldquoThe growers in GB are in a terrible position. They cannot take a chance and send plants to us as they may be delayed at our new border. A plant, like food, is perishable and a delivery could be taken and destroyed. Who will be willing to take that chance  I guess no one.Beth said Northern Ireland has the same climate as the rest of Great Britain and plants that do well there will also do well here, explaining that the local nursery is more selective about taking plants from Europe.She said the new regulations were not just a challenge for Saintfield Nurseries, but the entire Northern Ireland horticultural industry.The new reality for some businesses is that it has become easier to get key supplies from the EU, with Beth explaining that she already gets part of her stock from the Netherlands and the Republic of Ireland and that this may have to increase.She said that several nurseries in the Republic of Ireland are emailing the Saintfield business saying theyrsquore going to have roses, but they may not be the particular ieties that they really want.Beth added: ldquoWe were told we would leave the EU as one country, the UK.

I have made up my mind to go abroad to work and I think a lot of other students will do that as well.The Nursing and Midwery Council , the registration body for nurses, recently extended its Emergency Standards to allow final year nursing students to undertake paid clinical placements in order to support the existing nursing workforce during the pandemic.While this has been introduced in England, Scotland and Wales, Robin Swann has declined to implement them into Northern Ireland.In early December, the Department of Health said a joint statement from the NMC and UK chief nursing officers explained that students would not be put into paid placements, as happened earlier during the pandemic.The statement said that instead, employing health trusts would protect their status as supernumerary students and continue to support them through high quality placements, which is a fundamental aspect of pre-registration nurse training.South Down MP Chris Hazzard is supporting the call from Eimear and other final year nursing students.He added: ldquoThese nurses are working at the front line and saving lives.

He has performed the role of club chairman, with his playing reduced to part-time due to the fact he suffers from arthritis in a finger.He has played for Drumaroad in the past, and in more recent seasons for the former top club in Downpatrick, De La Salle.Back in the days of the Lecale Leaguersquos Spin magazine, which was edited by the late and sadly-missed Gerry Carson, Jim provided lsquoPeople in the Newsrsquo and lsquoAt your Servicersquo on a regular basis.This was back in the late s. Starting in  he produced another magazine named Equipment Plus.At this stage, he was running his Table Tennis Servicesfrom his home in Castlewellan. However, as many will recall, for some years he ran Northern Irelandrsquos only table tennis shop in Irish Street, Downpatrick. He had a steady line of customers from near and far who came to make their purchases.As all local players will of course know, Jim is the local man to go to for advice on what rubber suits inidual players.As one who has made use of his help and advice on many occasions, it is quite common to arrive in Strangford to play a match, or indeed in another local hall, and find Jim replacing rubbers.He has also given people from ious local halls advice and has moved many on to pimpled rubbers in recent years, saving them money. A good many seasons back, Jim, anxious to give some of the Strangford clubrsquos younger players a bit of extra publicity, wrote reports for the Down Recorder.As a close associate to the long-time secretary of the Lecale League, Pat Morgan, there was never any doubt who would replace Pat when he sadly passed away.Since taking over, he has certainly done his utmost to keep the league going. He has brought in new clubs and written regular and well-received reports, as well as travelling to matches to take team photos.As well as being a great supporter of the Lecale League over many years, he has also been a great supporter of the East Down Churches League.He has attended and made donations for the leaguersquos annual charity cup match, as well as being present at their annual presentation evening.While Jim has been in regular action in recent seasons, he has proven that while form is temporary, class is permanent.When called upon to help a local team out in the Belfast  District League, he has been the only player on the team to win a game.As well as being a title-winning player, he has also proven he is a superb organiser as those that have attended the Lecale Leaguersquos th and th anniversary evenings know.In fact, so many turned up at the th anniversary event that lsquohouse fullrsquo notices had to go up.He even ran out of anniversary mugs for those who had played in the league over the years.While the Lecale League may not have as many teams as it did had in the past, the fact that it is still going is mainly thanks to Jim.It is also worth noting that with his guidance, the many charity tournaments he runs every season have raised a lot of money for Marie Curie and provided some great action for players.It is thanks to Jim and the late Pat Morgan that the league has been going now for over  years.

Even before the pandemic hit last year, wersquod got to a point where we were considering closing. Then the pandemic happened and we knew that it wasnrsquot the right time. We just had to keep going.ldquoAfter Christmas we knew we all needed to have time for ourselves and our families as we realised that so much of our own lives were being out on hold doing the voluntary work. Mum is also getting older, shersquos  now, and we just felt that we had done as much as we could.She stressed that all counselling sessions promised would continue they were complete.ldquoWe have been family run on a voluntary basis and due to the generosity of the local community, we were able to pay up to three therapists at any given time with no waiting time for those in distress or despair, added Brenda.She said that while the lockdown had presented challenges to the group regarding fund-raising and provision of support, counselling work continued through Zoom.ldquoTherersquos been some great fund-raising and we have been truly grateful but we just felt it was time to step back.Brenda said that while she hope that others may well organise and take over the gap that PIPS Downpatrickrsquos closure may leave, she felt that local mental health provision had moved on since the group started.ldquoWe would hope that the statutory services run by the Trust will continue. There are now mental health social workers in all the surgeries, yet  years ago you wouldnrsquot have heard of this, she added.Brenda said that while her family was sad at the closure, they were all very proud of what they had achieved with the help of the local community.ldquoWe truly believe we have saved lives and while it has been challenging at times, I wouldnrsquot have missed it for the world.

In , the  gained two million new members worldwide per month.The Strava team wrote in the report: ldquoAt the global level, the Covid- pandemic resulted in a rise of activity on Strava like wersquove never seen before, far surpassing our normal projections.In the UK, from March to May, members logged  per cent more outdoor activities than would be expected for that time of year, making the UK the most active global nation for outdoor activity.Alison continued: ldquoIt was a very bad year for everyone last year, and unfortunately this year has started in much the same way. With running though, it is one of those sports that is still accessible to us to take part in.When the regulations on sporting activity took hold, Alison said she and other members of the club were fastidious in following them to the letter.ldquoWe took our directive closely from Sport NI. We were able to develop a training plan that our members could follow inidually in January, and our members, because of the fact they are associated with the club, are particularly stringent about following the protocols as they should be done.ldquoRunning is something that can still be done outside, safely, and at a distance. Unless, for example you are running in a train of people, in these times, it is still a relatively low-risk activity. Both our sport and cycling have been able to proceed relatively well in terms of participation numbers.ldquoAnd from a mental health perspective, it offers so much. It has been a terrible time, for everybody for months with everything that has been happening. People have lost their lives, their loved ones, their livelihoods, running can be a nice outlet to just get away from things for that short time.Things may still be in limbo now in terms of planning any sporting activities locally in the district, but East Down AC members are still keeping their fingers crossed that the year ahead can still be one which will become more positive the longer into it we get.ldquoThis time last year, we would have had all our members training a lot, said Alison. ldquoThis year of course, we are not able to offer that. The Jimmyrsquos K is obviously a big event traditionally in the local athletics calendar, but that can attract around  runners. At the moment, it is just too dicy to even entertain that we could host that.ldquoHowever, we havenrsquot given up hope that we can still have some action to speak of later in the year with events. We would urge our members to keep training, keep themselves ready for when things can come back.ldquoWe know there are people out there who are naturally struggling with how things are. However people are there for you. The amount of virtual contact we all now have is something to embrace in these times. We have found we can even run a virtual league, which is something.Alison is hopeful that normal service can be resumed soon, as for many it is a huge leline to be a member of a running club.ldquoSome people are solitary. They may live alone, or work long hours alone. For those people, coming to the club to train, is as important in terms of getting face-to-face company with others.ldquoThese are the type of runners who donrsquot come to win the medals, they donrsquot come with winning as being the most important thing. It is about that human connection.ldquoDefinitely when I look around the town in Downpatrick, I can see more people out running, especially around the Quoile River and on the streets.ldquoRunning is a great outlet.

That said, the Board and management are focused on achieving the best outcomes for all concerned.ldquoThe Board and management ask the parents of pupils, past pupils and members of the public impacted by these proposals to make their voices heard by participating in the consultation process. This is a matter for the entire community ndash not just those directly involved in education.The statement continued: ldquoFor over  years, St Patrickrsquos [the Red High] has been at the heart of the local community as a centre of learning, a resource hub and as an active contributor to civic le.ldquoPupils, past and present, have made and continue to make signicant contributions in the fields of sport, art, music, business and public service.ldquoThe motivation of the Board of Governors and management of the school is to ensure the widest range of parental and pupil choice remains available in the East Down region.Last December, the chairman of the Board of Governors, Dr Aidan Hamill, lost an application to the High Court for a judicial review questioning the Department of Educationrsquos authority to go ahead with the proposal before securing agreement from its governors.Under the merger plan the new school would educate girls and boys aged - with an admission of  pupils per year, with up to a maximum of % of pupils admitted through academic selection.Grammar schools in Northern Ireland normally admit students exclusively through academic selection.It is intended that existing school campuses would be used ldquopending capital investment for a one site solution.The closure of the three schools will also mean the loss of distinctive local school unorms as well as requiring all teaching and support staff to reapply for jobs at the proposed new school.The controversial amalgamation has been put forward by the Council for Catholic Maintained Schoolson behalf of the De La Salle Congregation, who are the trustees of all three schools.St Maryrsquos High School and De La Salle High School have declined to comment this week.However, both schools previously welcomed the proposed amalgamation, which originally included merging St Columbarsquos College in Portaferry.Mr Ciaran Maguire, principal of De La Salle, said in December that he was ldquodelighted to see the proposal going to full public consultation.He said at the time: ldquoItrsquos been a long time coming. I am reassured now that the families of the greater Downpatrick area will have an opportunity to finally get behind the vision to secure the town as a model of good practice, where childrenrsquos education is a priority.Ms Rosemary McLaughlin, principal of St Maryrsquos, said last September that the merger reflected her values and belief in all-ability schools.She said: ldquoIn terms of social justice, I feel the move is very important.

This is a musical and visual tale of ancient times that is relevant and attractive to modern Ireland.The St Patrick Show will also feature spoken word from  Grammy-nominated Fontaines DC frontman Grian Chatten and other well-known artists.The show will be filmed and be available virtually at first, but has the potential to create a new dinner-theatre culture at the St Patrick Centre and to travel internationally.ldquoWe already have interest from New York and Washington for this exciting project, said Dr Campbell. ldquoWe had planned four shows during St Patrickrsquos Week at the St Patrick Centre, but now due to Covid Restrictions this will be a virtual online event.It is anticipated that rehearsals will begin next month, subject government restrictions, with filming dates in early March.When restrictions lt, dinner theatre audiences in Downpatrick will not only drink in the refreshing story of Patrick this summer, but taste unique recipes created by celebrity chef Terry McCoyrsquos, showcased in his book, Saint Patrickrsquos Plate.Funding has come from from the Arts Council, the Community Foundation for Northern Ireland and Newry Mourne and Down Council.The aim is to have the show in place, marketed and ready for theof the tourism season.The St Patrick Centre is currently in discussion with Tourism Ireland about releasing the virtual event in tourist markets around the world, particularly in the United States.Details can be found on the St Patrick Centrersquos website: www.saintpatrickcentre.Artists are being asked to submit their CVs and tapes via email at stpatrickcentreshow@gmail.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27Jan2021-Speeder.jpg","title":"Speeder clocked at 82mph – double road speed limit  ","story":"A DRIVER has been clocked travelling at mph in the mph zone at the Strangford Road in Downpatrick.The figure mdash confirmed by the districtrsquos Policing and Community Safety Partnership mdash was recorded on an electronic speed indicator device which was one of a number put in place across the district last year.While the provision of the device at the entrance to a sports pitch at the Strangford Road was welcomed, a number of residents believe that the device should be located further back long the main road as the speed of drivers along this particularly busy and built-up area is a major concern.Some Strangford Road residents argue that the problem with the speeding device is that it is in the wrong location, given that it is just a few hundred yards from the start of a mph zone close to the townrsquos war memorial.They say that effectively, the speed restriction sign is policing only small section of the busy main road where there are literally just a handful of homes.Further back along the road, there are several major housing developments, many where young families live. There is also a busy local authority garage and depot and a private care nursing home, with this section of road governed by a mph limit.Residents say that the overwhelming majority of drivers who speed along the road are travelling from the Strangford direction and that the issue could be addressed mdashthe speed indicator sign was relocated further back to the entrance to Lecale Park mdashit has to have any signicant impact on the speeding.Those who live at this part of Downpatrick say while the majority of drivers obey the mph speed limit, there are a number who do not.The new speed indicator devices, designed to make drivers aware of their speed and to slow down, are dotted across the Newry, Mourne and Down Council area and have been warmly welcomed.South Down MLA Colin McGrath and Downpatrick councillor John Trainor say the speeding data recorded by the devices and released by the Policing and Community and Safety Partnershipshows an average speed reduction in the Downpatrick area of .% and that the new initiative is working.Mr McGrath said that when he and his SDLP colleague initially floated the idea of erecting the speed indicator signs, the feedback was that the such a scheme would not be efficient and would be too expensive, with little reward.He insists that confirmation that in the Downpatrick area alone speeds have reduced by .% in the short time the devices have been in place vindicates their installation.ldquoWhile John and I are delighted to hear that speeds are reducing across the district, we are in no way complacent about this.ldquoThe fact that the PCSP is doubling the provision of speed indicator signs is not only an indication of their efficacy, but also highlights the continued need for them.However, Mr McGrath said he was concerned about the mph speed recorded at the Strangford Road and appealed to all drivers to ensure they stick to the speed limit.Cllr Trainor said plans were in place to provide an additional seven speed indicator devices across the district.He added: ldquoCombining this with infrastructure minister Nichola Mallonrsquos scheme for mph zones at  schools across the country can only help safety on our roads.ldquoConsidering the very low temperatures we have witnessed this weekend, this is another reminder that we all need to be conscious of our speed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27Jan2021-St.jpg","title":"St Patrick’s parade off  ","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Council has pulled the plug on the forthcoming St Patrickrsquos Day parade in Downpatrick.The decision mdash confirmed on Monday mdash comes a week after a number of councillors urged the local authority to formally cancel the cross-community event due to the continuing coronavirus pandemic.Last yearrsquos cross-community spectacular was cancelled ahead of the first national lockdown to help combat the deadly virus and with infection rates remaining high across the district, the council has finally decided to cancel the event in the grip of the continuing public health emergency.The local authority, which last week would only confirm that it was ldquoreviewing plans for its St Patrickrsquos Day events in line with the current restrictions and ongoing response to the Covid pandemic, told councillors on Monday afternoon that the Downpatrick parade and one in Newry had been postponed, with the wider media informed yesterday.In the wake of other councils postponing their respective St Patrickrsquos Day parades, Newry, Mourne and Down was coming under increasing pressure to follow suit.The local parades have now been added to the growing list of national and international events across Northern Ireland which have been cancelled due to the pandemic, including the North West  motorcycle races.Belfast City Council has cancelled its St Patrickrsquos Day parade, with Derry City and Strabane and Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon councils currently discussing how their March  events will be celebrated.Local council officials have confirmed that following careful consideration of the current restrictions and the ongoing response to the Covid- pandemic, they have ldquoregretfully cancelled the traditional St Patrickrsquos Day celebrations.The organisation has confirmed that it will be hosting some activities and performances online via its tourism and arts social media channels.In addition, training green spotlights on a number of major buildings, including Down Cathedral and St Patrickrsquos Church in Downpatrick, is expected to go ahead as planned,restrictions allow.Council chairwoman Laura Devlin said it was with ldquogreat regret that the annual St Patrickrsquos Day parades have been cancelled for the second year in a row.She said the March  events were normally an opportunity to celebrate the districtrsquos connection with St Patrick and the arearsquos important place in his the patron saintrsquos story.ldquoI know how disappointed many will be about this decision and I share their disappointment, said Cllr Devlin. ldquoHowever, the councilrsquos priority at this time is to continue to support the ongoing response to the Covid- pandemic across wider society.She said that the decision to cancel was made in the best interests of residents, visitors, festival participants and event partners.She also confirmed that the local authority will continue to review plans for this yearrsquos tourism events programme on an ongoing basis and in line with guidance from the Northern Ireland Executive.Councillors Willie Clarke, Dermot Curran, Billy Walker and Robert Burgess, who last week appealed to the local council to cancel the parade, welcomed the decision and said they were looking forward to the  event going ahead.They said the local authority had to act to avoid any needless delay, warning that there was no way any festival parade could take place in the current Covid climate.Cllr Clarke said people needed to know that the parade would not happen, highlighting the continuing importance of protecting peoplersquos health.Cllr Curran said the event could not possibly have proceeded, given the ongoing public health emergency.He said the Covid situation remained ldquoextremely serious and that news of the parade cancellation would not come as a surprise.Cllr Walker urged council officials not to wait until the ldquoeleventh hour to pull the plug on the parade and hoped that next yearrsquos event will be one of the best ever.Cllr Burgess said current public health advice was clear, which meant the local council had no option but to cancel the parade, and urged council officials to start preparations for next yearrsquos event..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27Jan2021-Views.jpg","title":"Views sought on play park upgrade  ","story":"NEWCASTLE residents are being encouraged to have

Liltingwas called lsquojaw musicrsquo, or lsquopuss musicrsquo.Mummers played one of the worldrsquos oldest instruments, called the jawrsquos jewrsquos harp.Also called lsquothe trumprsquo, the miniature jawrsquos jewrsquos harp produced a twang sound, which changed by altering the shape of the mouth and moving the tongue.Another mouth instrument used by mummers was the harmonica, also called lsquothe mouth organrsquo or lsquoFrench fiddlersquo.Another impoverished instrument in early mumming was spoons, which were played as a makesht percussion instrument by hitting the concave backs of one tablespoon against the other.Typically played with the palm of hands repeatedly moving down towards the knees and back upwards again, the spoons sharply hit each other, producing dferent sounds, rhythms and rattles.Dry spare ribsof animals were used before the introduction of spoons produced a similar sound.In Ederney, the sole musician was a bagpiper lending a hand for the night.During the coldness of mid-Winter, keeping the bagpipes warm until the ldquomarching in tune would be ldquostruck up was remedied by the bagpiper carrying a hot water bottle next to the skin of the pipes.Once made from dogsrsquo skin, bodhrans notndash as a home-made, open-ended, willow-framed drum ndash emerged from a farm sieve used in winnowing corn, and were extremely popular amongst mummers.The bodhranrsquos deep, hollow sound was vulnerable to Winter weather, resulting in the goatskin or leather skin loosening.Latterly, snaredrums with synthetic skins and tightening snares replaced bodhrans, providing a thundering warning of mummers approaching.Mummers joined together to purchase a melodeon, thereby the name a ldquojoined melodeon.Commonly called lsquothe squeeze boxrsquo, music box, accordion or concertina, accordion players such Jim McGrathare called lsquobox playersrsquo.The Clarkesrsquo tin penny whistles and the music from the concert flute, by John Joe lsquoThe Puckrsquo Maguire, had the ear, hands and soul of his flute when playing for both the Aughakillymaude and Kinawley mummers.Over time, instruments became personal possessions of the musician, as was the case with the fiddle of legendary Sean Dan Maguire, who played more than  years with mummers, strawboys and wrenboys.Musicians often tried music out on the spot! They may have just heard a march tune just once or twice, but they would give it a go.Gaining consent, mummers lsquoploughedrsquo into the heart of the household with a lsquoMarching Inrsquo tune, with the next interlude for music being the performance of a jig to coincide with the start of comical combat.Protaganists ndash Prince Patrick and Prince George ndash instead of duelling, were lsquoseamlessly seducedrsquo by music from the reel, and turned the combat on its head by jostling in a dancing motion, with the absurd clashing of wooden swords keeping time with the music.With the fallen hero feigning death, the musician instinctively began a slow, melodic airconducive to his impending death.Its purpose was to impinge sadness and, of necessity, was always a slow air born of mourning or regret.The musiciansrsquo opening for celebratory music came immediately post the odious fight, when dancers amongst the mummers would instinctively dance by the rendition of a reel with a lsquogood ltrsquo in it!Playing at a brisk, dance tempo, the dancers would rely on both keeping the time and in step with the rhythmic effect of the music for their foot movements.Inspired by musicians who understood the dance styles, dancers would whirl the floor with precision and elegance.Dancing in front of the hearth was revered by dancers, especially when it was customary to lsquopull outrsquo, firstly, the women of the household for social interaction.If neither residents nor mummers had dancing skills, mummers resorted to lsquoshufflingrsquo, often with cut sparable boots, armoured with tip and toe plates, i.e. a form of dancing on one spot, with feet kept close to the ground.Mummers disported themselves by entertaining and involving everyone by getting their neighbours out dancing.By having a set of slow waltz tunes, lasting longer than the play itself, this would wind up the visit.The Belcoo mummers were unquestionably the traditional set dancers of high renown.Staging either a half setor a full set , they danced with artistic interlacing and unwinding movements at very brisk speeds, to high-tempo reels.Having just one good dancer, the musician would likely play a hornpipe to allow for a display of heavy step dancing, with either Harvey leather shoes or even hobnailed boots.Mummers were known to throw matches onto concrete floors, where friction from the nails on boots struck the matches alight.Mummers also put wax shaving of candles onto floor to ease and increase their whirling.Sean-noacutes dancing was the showpiece of the Toura mummers, and twin brothers, Johnny and Paddy McGee, were foremost at exhibiting face dancing, such as the clap dance.Sean-noacutes dances, such as the half-door dance, was performed either singularly or by the twin brothers on a space or floor covering no more than the size of a half door.Undoubtedly, there was no better man at demonstrating the brush broom dance with a besom broom than Dessie Reilly of Aughakillymaude.Ballyshannon school mummersrsquo group dance was the unique ldquopot stick dance, originally from the Drumbad area , which has the remnants of English Morris Dance influence.The Ederney mummers showcased the Square Highland, involving four men at close quarters, as it didnrsquot take up much space in households, and didnrsquot involve swinging.As a Highland was a fling, it lent to being performed quickly, enabling mummers to depart sooner.The Fermanagh or Donegal Highlands iations were danced by just two dancers, and are heavily weighted with Scottish connotations.The Highlands flings are referred to by Fermanaghrsquos dancers as lsquothe Schottischersquo, or lsquoCetishrsquo.With larger venues, musicians playing North Kerry polkas and Fermanagh kick polka with two dancers ndash which allowed for swinging ndash had the musicians even imitating the dancersrsquo movements.Notably, the jig for Christmas called lsquoPaddyrsquos Returnrsquo was played marking the ing of ex-pats from England.After music, drama and dancing, a singer would sing a ballad of local signicance, or a light-hearted yarn on people grappling with the frailties of the human body, matters of the heart, and lersquos trials and tribulations.Attention was also afforded to the storytelling narrative of mummers, where the farcical spinning out of a yarn brought much laughter.Marking the end, a two-hand reel was played as the Captain led mummers outside, but unbeknownst and hidden underneath their lsquoget-uprsquo, mummers secretly had taken bread for pure devilment.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is too small for international games, and too big for Irish League ones. Yet unionists and some Northern Ireland football team supporters helped kill the proposed £ million Maze stadium, in favour of keeping three stadia, with no parking facilities, in BelfastThe unionist parties have only themselves to blame for the self-created fiasco surrounding the huge funding now required for the rebuilding of Casement Park.

Please try again later.Submitting...\"Letter to the editorIt was termed a ‘Republican Shrine’ for maximum emotional impact yet it could have been equally used to illustrate the heinous crimes of some of the hunger strikers and also allow the victims’ narrative to be told. It would have had enormous tourism potential.What they have achieved now is the creation of a stadium only slightly smaller than the original Maze model in the midst of a republican area in West Belfast on the very site which has the propensity to become shrine to the vile mob which brutally murdered the two army corporals, Derek Wood and David Howes there on March  . Windsor Park capacity has proved to be too inadequate for matches when the Northern Ireland team is doing well and far too big for Irish League matches where the attendances are usually less than ,.All the main parties on Lisburn City Council including Sinn Fein supported the Maze proposal as did the then chief executive of the Irish Football Association Howard Wells. In addition to a section of disgruntled football fans who feared they might become disorientated once they went beyond Finaghy, the usual Belfast business lobby fought tooth and nail to keep all three stadia, with no parking facilities, within Belfast.The offer to rebuild Casement was used to draw Sinn Fein away from their support for the Maze but it still continues to veto any further development at the Maze until the provision for a Peace and Reconciliation building is promised but of course the European money for that has now been lost.In  the chairman of the Long Kesh Maze Development Corporation declared that the site “has the transformational potential of acting as a catalyst for the delivery of £ million investment and up to , high quality, sustainable jobs”.Can the leaders of the unionist parties please now confirm that no money will be made available for the Casement Park project unless and until Sinn Fein lts its veto on the long delayed development of the Maze site It is an immense tragedy that had direct rule not been ended by the re-introduction of devolution, the Maze Stadium would have been built, the area around it developed and the John Lewis store with its  well paid jobs would operating from Sprucefield.We know that it is the goal of republicans to destroy our economy but who would have ever thought that our unionist parties would be implicit in it There can be no clearer argument for the immediate termination of this failed, massively incompetent and grossly wasteful system of government.Ronnie Crawford, Dromore, Co Down——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

It was embroiled in controversy relating to its parent company making donations to the Green Pastures Church, of which Jeff Wright was a director.Wrightbus was in a bleak place when it went into administration in , only to be bought by the Bamford family the following year. Jo Bamford, grandson of the late entrepreneur and JCB founder Jospeh Bamford, is now chair of Wrightbus.He has aninterest in the use of hydrogen to power buses, which is timely in an age when there is so much concern about emissions and climate change. Hydrogen is a complicated but clean source of energy. Mr Bamford has praised the highly skilled workforce he inherited in Co Antrim.In a thrilling development, Wrightbus has created the world’s first hydrogen-powered double decker bus fleet, launched for use in Aberdeen, Scotland.Mr Bamford says “everyone at Wrightbus is incredibly proud” of the new fleets. And so should be everyone in Northern Ireland. For decades, particularly during the Troubles, Northern Ireland became too dependent on subsidies from London. But we are a population with an innovative history.Anything — from cyber security to film making to vehicle manufacturing —that builds upon that skilled industrial past and helps orientate NI towards a more productive and economically self sufficient future is very much to be celebrated.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

I will be urging the Prime Minister to act and use robust measures including Article  to advance the interests of Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom.”Alliance Party MP for North Down, Stephen Farry, tweeted: “Use of Article  is NOT justied or warranted in this situation. We don’t need a vaccine war. Other alternatives exist to manage this challenge. Invites further tension and instability. “Everyone needs to calm down.”Responding to the EU’s triggering of Article  of the Protocol, Ulster Unionist leader Steve Aiken criticised Brandon Lewis for not having done the same in response to disruption to GB-NI trade since the transition period ended.“The Secretary of State Brandon Lewis should be embarrassed and ashamed by the behaviour of the Government and the Northern Ireland Office following the unilateral decision of the EU to activate Article  to put controls on exports of vaccines from its territory,” said Mr Aiken.“Under the Northern Ireland Protocol, our Armed Forces can’t bring their equipment into Northern Ireland without permission, eels can’t leave, the movement of family pets has been restricted, products have disappeared from our shelves and GB companies are stopping trade with Northern Ireland.“For weeks now we have been told that Article  cannot be invoked accompanied by all sorts of feeble excuses for not doing so. The EU has unilaterally blown that concept out of the water by invoking Article .“They have done it at the drop of a hat. Activating Article  is clearly not the nuclear option as portrayed by Alliance, SDLP and Sinn Fein. We were told time and time again that it couldn`t be done. Despite EU claims that they always acted in the best interests of Northern Ireland, when push came to shove, the EU looked after itself.__A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityIN our bridge improvers sessions, we are continuing to deal with opening two bids, playing Benjy Acol.Here is a hand with a big point count that requires careful bidding to reach the right contract.The AuctionNorth has a hand with twenty-three points. So, playing Benjy Acol, North opens two diamonds. This shows at least nine tricks in hand or a balanced twenty-three points plus. It is forcing to game. Her partner, South, with only four points bids two hearts, which asks North, her partner, to show what she has. With a balanced hand North bids two no trumps. South now knows that between them they have more than the magic twenty-five points required to play three no trumps.But hold on a minute, whatNorth has five hearts  Four hearts would then surely be a better contract than three no trumps. So, as with last weekrsquos hand, the correct bid by South is now three clubs - five card puppet Stayman - asking Northshe has a four or five card major. North bids three hearts, showing her five-card heart suit. South now bids four hearts, as she knows that they have eight hearts and at least twenty-seven points between them. This is indeed the best contract, as three no trumps makes, but not so many tricks on a spade lead.The playEast begins with the queen of spades. North as declarer looks carefully at the hand before winning this trick with the king in dummy. She realises that this was the only way to dummy to be able to take the heart finesse. Remember - eight ever nine never is the rule. In other words, with eight cards between you in a suit the percentage play is to take the finesse. But with nine cards between you, the percentage play is usually to play the ace and then the king to try and drop the queen. So, declarer at trick two plays the two of hearts from dummy, playing the jack from her hand to execute the finesse.This wins, as West has the queen. North then plays the ace of hearts followed by the king, removing all the opponentsrsquo trumps. The odds for a   break are good, % in fact. Declarer then plays the king of diamonds from her hand. West holds up his ace of diamonds for two rounds, until declarer has played the king and queen, overtaking the third diamond with his ace. West does this in case declarer has a losing club, which could be discarded on dummyrsquos jack of diamonds.East has played first the three and then the five of diamonds, indicating he has three cards in that suit. We will see next week how he would have played his diamondshe had four cards in this suit, using what is known as a Peter. West then plays his ace of clubs, and it is all over, North winning the rest of tricks with the ace of spades, the remaining trumps, and the king and queen of clubs. So, she makes her contract of four spades with an overtrick,  tricks in all ndash two spades, five hearts, two diamonds and two clubs.Well bid and well played. Without the use of puppet Stayman North would probably play in three no trumps. On the lead of the queen of spades this only makes nine tricks - two spades, five hearts and two diamonds. Declarer takes the heart finesse and plays all her hearts. Then, she plays the king and queen of diamonds, West winning the third diamond with his ace, having refused to take the king or queen. West would thenthe ten of spades, which would be won by declarerrsquos ace. But when she plays the king of clubs, West pounces with his ace and plays the nine of spades, which wins, followed by Westrsquos last spade won by Eastrsquos queen, East West making four tricks ndash two spades and two aces, East having to discard one of his spades on the preceding tricks.What have we learnt . As we saw last week, five card Puppet Stayman, after the opening bidder has shown a strong two no trumps, is vitalyou are to find either a   of   fit in one of the majors. lsquoPuppetrsquo has sunk into bridge jargon over the past forty-five years. The convention was originally invented by Neil Silverman and developed in the s by Kit Woolsey and Steve Robinson, all American players. As well as finding a   fit in a major, -card puppet Stayman has the advantage that,there is a   fit, the person with the strong hand plays the contract, and the lead comes up to him.. Always take care to take the first trick in the right handyou want to take a finesse.. Sometimes it is advisable to hold up an ace, particularly in no trumps, to block your opponents from entering the hand with winners in it.Penarth club newsPeter Sampsonrsquos ladder competition continues.

And itrsquos been quite nice to feel a bit more relaxed because itrsquos an open environment.As soon as the staff are aware of the amount of stock that they will be getting from the health board, they can organise the clinics.ldquoWe have to factor in the spacing, itrsquos a new vaccine so people might have questions which we are always happy to answer.ldquoSo far itrsquos going pretty well.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityStormont First Minister Arlene Foster branded the EUrsquos triggering of Article  of Brexitrsquos Northern Ireland Protocol to stop unfettered flow of inoculations from the EU into the region an ldquoincredible act of hostility.Ms Foster spoke with Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove about the issue on Friday evening, and called for a ldquorobust response from the UK Government.The Irish premier Micheal Martin is in discussions with European Commission President Ursula Von Der Leyen to express his concerns, according to an Irish government spokesperson.The protocol, with is part of the Brexit withdrawal deal, normally allows for free movement of goods from the EU into Northern Ireland.Under the terms of the protocol, goods should be able to move freely between the EU and Northern Ireland as the region remains in the single market for goods and still operates under EU customs rules.The EU has triggered Article  of the protocol to temporarily place export controls on this movement in respect of vaccines.It comes amid a deepening row over the allocation of the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine after the company announced delays to its EU operations.The move to activate Article  will frustrate any effort to use Northern Ireland as a back door to bring vaccines into Great Britain.Mrs Foster said: ldquoBy triggering Article  in this manner, the European Union has once again shown it is prepared to use Northern Ireland when it suits their interests but in the most despicable manner ndash over the provision of a vaccine which is designed to save lives.ldquoAt the first opportunity, the EU has placed a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland over the supply chain of the coronavirus vaccine.The regulation means Northern Ireland will be considered an export territory for the purposes of vaccine sent from the EU the Republic of Ireland.Northern Irelandrsquos vaccines arrive from the rest of the UK at present so those will be unaffected.The DUP leader added: ldquoWith the European Union using Article  in such an aggressive and most shameful way, it is now time for our Government to step up.ldquoI will be urging the Prime Minister to act and use robust measures including Article  to advance the interests of Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom.The DUP has previously pressed the British Government to invoke the Article  mechanism because of disruption to the movement of goods between Britain and Northern Ireland.Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove has told the EU the UK is ldquocarefully considering the next steps after the bloc triggered an aspect of the Northern Ireland Protocol as part of its export controls on coronavirus vaccines.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster spoke to his counterpart on the UK-EU joint committee on Friday, No  said.In a statement, a spokesman said: ldquoCDL Michael Gove just spoke to European Commission Vice President Maros Sefcovic to express the UKrsquos concern over a lack of notication from the EU about its actions in relation to the NI protocol.ldquoCDL said the UK would now be carefully considering next steps.The European Commission said: ldquoExports of goods from Northern Ireland to other parts of the United Kingdom cannot be restricted by Union law unless this is strictly required by international obligations of the Union.ldquoTherefore, movements of goods covered by this regulation between the Union and Northern Ireland should be treated as exports.ldquoWhilst quantitative restrictions on exports are prohibited between the Union and Northern Ireland, in accordance with Article of the Protocol on Ireland Northern Ireland, this is justied as a safeguard measure pursuant to Article  of that Protocol in order to avert serious societal dficulties due to a lack of supply threatening to disturb the orderly implementation of the vaccination campaigns in the member states.UUP leader Steve Aiken said Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis should be embarrassed.He added: ldquoThe EU is unilaterally invoking Article  to protect its own interests and itrsquos about time the UK Government did the same instead of being lead actors in a ridiculous charade that there is no border in the Irish Sea and that Article  canrsquot be invoked.Traditional Unionist Voice leader Jim Allister said the EU was showing its ldquocallous true colours.He said: ldquoThis afternoonrsquos invocation of Article  of the protocol to inhibit exports of Covid vaccines from the EU to Northern Ireland is the most telling illustration imaginable that for the EU the protocol is a plaything to be exploited when it suits its selfish interests.ldquoThe idea that the EU cares anything for Northern Ireland or its people is exposed as utterly bogus.ldquoThe effect of todayrsquos regulation is to disavow the much vaunted free trade from the EU to Northern Ireland as part of its single market and instead to treat deliveries of vaccines from the EU to Northern Ireland as lsquoexportsrsquo, which they can then restrict, lest such vaccines would make their way to Great Britain..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: EU moves to prevent NI from being used as vaccine

He leaves a huge gap but his enormous contribution, enthusiasm and positivity will not be forgotten.Des was born in Drogheda in the Republic of Ireland but, whilst still very young, moved to NI where he grew up and was educated. He attended Portadown College before moving to Queen’s University Belfast in  to study German. He graduated with a First Class Honours Degree four years later, which included a year in Freiburg im Breisgau, a city where he made many le-long friends.Des’ first teaching job was back at his alma mater, Portadown College, where he taught German and French between  and . Keen to satisfy his thirst for travel, widen his knowledge of other cultures and experience teaching in other countries, he moved to Uganda in  where he taught French and German at the Aga Khan Secondary School, Kampala for two years. \"Des Johnston in his younger years.Des then ed to County Armagh where he was appointed Head of Modern Languages, again at Portadown College. It was during this time that I had the good fortune and privilege to be one of Des’ pupils. Des was ahead of his time. He recognised the importance of integrating language and culture.In spite of the passage of  years, I remember very clearly the lesson where he set up the screen and projector, cutting edge technology in the s, and showed us slides of his tour on a scooter through France, Luxembourg and Germany. As a class of  year olds, we were transfixed. Des was an example of Dali’s “true artist”, as two years later Keith, George and I packed our rucksacks and followed Des’ tracks, not on a scooter but by train. Des’ inspiration did not stop there as I was to follow his path to a degree in languages at Queen’s, a PGCE and a career in teaching. I was certainly not the first or the last of Des’ pupils to do this. It is striking that Des’ son, Philip, also followed in his dad’s footsteps, working in Germany for three years, studying in the Czech Republic and qualying as a German interpreter – without doubt a chip off the old block. Des knew how to manage a class. He had presence he got lessons off to a fun start he always progressed from what we knew, gave us confidence and self-belief and made us curious to learn more. Lessons were fun. Time flew by. We felt that we were achieving. Motivation was not an issue. He got the very best from each of us. Des was a master of the art of teaching.In  Des’ itchy feet took him to Luxembourg where he spent two years working as a translator for the European Commission. During this time he also won two caps for the national rugby team of Grand Duchy.Keen to pass on his pedagogical skills and knowledge and to champion modern languages teaching and learning, he joined Her Majesty’s Inspectorate, Department of Education, Northern Ireland in . We all feel apprehensive about the visit of the inspector. Des was not to be feared, however. His focus was always on the supportive and the formative. His aim was always to help and guide and build the confidence of those he visited. Des’ distinguished career did not end when he retired in  but rather took a gentle turn. He continued to teach with the University of the Third Age and at Millburn Primary School where he taught English and English as a Foreign Language to Polish children, a role in which he found particular enjoyment and fulfilment.Des was born to teach and so very many of us, across the world, have benefited from his skill, encouragement and warmth. Teaching was not his only passion, however. I have already mentioned his rugby caps for Luxembourg. He also excelled at the shot put in athletics and played badminton and table-tennis. He loved music, good food and reading. Des could talk convincingly and engagingly on a very wide range of subjects. He was knowledgeable, interested and interesting. He was a wonderfully entertaining raconteur, the perfect dinner guest.I feel very honoured to have been able to stay in contact with Des from the time I left Portadown College until a month before he sadly died. He and I always thought it an amazing but lovely coincidence that, in the small world that is language teaching, the boy who was to become his future son-in-law, Chris, was one of my pupils in the school in the north-east of England where I first taught.I was not the only former pupil to enjoy his wisdom, guidance, mentoring, support and friendship for many years after leaving school. I was one of a large number across continents. Des was always generous in investing time in people. He cared. This is why he was so respected and much loved by so many.Des is survived by his we, Irene, and his children Tanya and Philip.Des Johnston -PSNI investigation after girl found dead in NI flats Read the full story hereEditor’s Message:Thank you for reading this article.

As a result, Cllr Baxter’s proposal passed with  votes in favour, eight against and one abstention recorded.However, upon discussion of the committee meeting’s minutes at December’s meeting of full council, Councillor Liam Mackle proposed that Council did not accept the recommendation put forward by the committee.This proposal was seconded by his party colleague Councillor Paul Duffy.Councillor Pope said it “was very important” that the occasion is marked and noted the need for education and cultural events to be spread throughout the borough.He also expressed his concerns about budgets and the idea of a large event taking place giving the current pandemic.“I would propose we accept the original recommendationfrom the November committee that listed the programme, including the £, budget,” said Cllr Pope. This proposal was seconded by his party’s group leader, Councillor Eoin Tennyson.Speaking about the issue, Cllr Tennyson said the programme had been discussed atand explained, from his perspective, initialdiscussions were constructive.“All parties engaged with a view to marking the centenary in a way that was inclusive and respectful,” said Cllr Tennyson. “I think the original recommendation that was presented by officers to the committee was one that did that.“It would allow us to mark the centenary in a way that was inclusive and reflective of the entire borough and also balanced against the need to be prudent in terms of the financial situation we as a council and indeed many of our rate payers are in.“I can’t in good conscience support a proposal that would see this council commit to an additional £, unbudgeted spend. The reality is that money is going to have be found through the estimates process.“We could end up in the situation where that money will have to be found through a rates hike or cuts to services. I think Councillor Pope’s proposal is an eminently sensible one and I hope all parties can see it in themselves to support that approach.”DUP councillor Darryn Causby sought clarity on what was being proposed andthe proposals tabled complied with standing orders.“Under standing order .. there should only be one amendment moved and discussed at one time, the same applies for proposals on the floor,” said Cllr Causby.“There was one on the floor, Cllr Pope then put a second one on the floor but can I please get clarity on the first one [Cllr Mackle’s proposal] it seems to be a direct negative of what is in the papers and under standing orders I am not clear on whether that is acceptable.“The other point I would raise is the budget was actually agreed at the November council meeting and we just ratied that a short time ago.“If someone is not happy with that, I suggest they look through standing orders and bring a rescinding motion to change that decision.”At this point Council’s Lord Mayor, Councillor Kevin Savage informed members he needed to speak with Council’s Chief Executive Roger Wilson and muted his microphone.Following his confidential discussionwith Mr Wilson, the Lord Mayor confirmed the budget had already been agreed before putting Councillor Mackle’s proposal, to reject the recommendation put forward by the committee, to the floor.All unionist councillors present voted against the proposal as did the three members of the Alliance Party. The members of Sinn Fein and the SDLP voted in favour of the proposal.With the votes totalled, the proposal was defeated with  members voting against the proposal and  voting in favour.The Lord Mayor then explainedthat as the recommendation of the committee stands, a rescinding motion would be requiredbefore Cllr Tennyson’s proposal could be heard.Councillor Tennyson said he was not sure he agreed with this interpretation.“The proposal was that we proceed with the programme originallyproposed by officers not the budget,” said Cllr Tennyson.“The budget may have been agreed, the programme has never been agreed therefore a rescinding motion is not required.“We have proposed that we proceed with the originalprogramme as proposed to the economic development and regeneration committee, it just so happened to be at a cost of £,.“I would be quite keen for that to be voted on as I do not share the analysis that a rescinding motion is required for a decision that has never been taken.”Councillor Baxter then said that as a matter of process given that Cllr Mackle’s proposal has fallen by “default the recommendation goes through”.“I do note Alliance are quite clearly trying to claw back as they could not bring themselves to vote for the celebration of Northern Ireland at the last committee meeting,” said Cllr Baxter.“By the very fact Cllr Mackle’s proposal has failed this recommendation from the committee is going through.”The Lord Mayor said that was his understanding as well and the recommendation as it stands has now gone through.A proposal to accept the minutes of the committee was put forward by Councillor Brian Pope and seconded by SDLP group leader, Councillor Thomas O’Hanlon.Editor’s message:Thank you for reading this article.

Speaking at a press conference this afternoon, First Minister Arlene Foster, said the ongoing public health situation meant remote learning must continue. It may also be the case that only some year groups go back to school on  March,athen is possible. Mrs Foster said she recognised it would come as a disappointment for many parents and pupils. She said special schools will remain open and mainstream schools will continue to provide supervised learning for vulnerable children and the children of key workers. Childcare settings and childminers will also remain open, she added.The recommendation had been made by Education Minister Peter Weir at a meeting of the Executive this morning.Deputy First Minister Michelle ONeill described the decision as dficult but urged people to stay the course. We wish we could be more certain about a definitive date, but we will keep it under review, she added. The Executives next review of the lockdown restrictions, which in place until March , is scheduled for February .  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_abaffcfadcceac   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_dbbabbbfa   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1611929889106.jpg--covid_19___fri_29th_jan_figures.jpg?161192988900","title":"covid  fri th jan figures ","story":" The NI Department of Health dashboard shows a further  coronavirus related deaths and  new positive cases.  deaths occurred outside of the current reporting period.

The latest figures show a total of , first doses and , second doses – bringing the overall number of vaccines administered to , Today’s figures provide a further indication of important progress in the roll-out of vaccines to combat the virus. In addition: * Mobile vaccination teams have administered first doses in all of Northern Ireland’s care homes - and second doses to over % of the homes. * We have vaccinated % of the  year olds and over, and have started to vaccinate  –  year olds through the GP programme. * Online booking was opened on Wednesday night for - year-olds to book their vaccination appointments in one of NI’s seven regional vaccination centres. In the first  hours of the online portal, , people had booked their vaccination jabs. Intensive work has been undertaken to address teething problems with the online system, linked to high levels of demand. * A further signicant consignment of the Astra Zeneca vaccine is due in NI next week, for immediate distribution to GPs. This will help facilitate a rapid acceleration of vaccinations for those over  and patients who are Clinical Extremely Vulnerableto Covid-. * In another important development on the vaccine front, a large-scale UK trial for a new coronavirus vaccine indicates it to be .% effective against the virus. The Novavax vaccine is expected to be available across the UK in the second half of this year,approved for use by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency  People in Northern Ireland have played a key role in the development of Novavax. Nearly  participants were recruited from Northern Ireland for the trial which was led locally by researchers from Queen’s University Belfast and the Belfast Health and Social Care Trust. Health Minister Robin Swann said: “I want to thank everyone working on the vaccination programme right across Northern Ireland. “This is a massive logistical exercise and I am very encouraged by the strong start we have made. It should be remembered that the first Covid- vaccine approval was only announced last month, with the second approval coming some four weeks later. We have made great strides forward since then. “There will inevitably be frustrations along the way. We will get to everyone - we are getting to thousands more each day.” Chief Medical Officer Dr Michael McBride thanked everyone involved in the Novavax trial. He said: “The rapid development of Covid- vaccines is our long-term route map out of this pandemic. We should be rightly proud that Northern Ireland continues to play its part in the historic global effort to develop new drug treatments and vaccines. Throughout our response we have all come together in support of each other. We continue to see the benefits of the partnership between academia, health and industry and this another example.” The Department of Health this week announced a twin track approach to accelerating NI’s vaccination programme - ensuring more people can take up the offer of vaccination and help protect themselves against Covid-. GPs will be focusing on the  plus age group with the Astra Zeneca vaccine, while the seven regional vaccination centres will in parallel be offeringPfizer vaccination appointments to - year-olds. The plans are to offer everyone over  in NI a vaccine by the end of February. People who are Clinical Extremely Vulnerableto Covid- are also a priority for February. GPs will be vaccinating a large proportion of CEV patients. The twin track approach will see the Trust vaccination centres offering vaccines to CEV patients who are frequent hospital attenders.  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:    n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_efffacdfddcac   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_abddefebedea   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
