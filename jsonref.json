The Catcher in the Rye author, who died in 2010 at the age of 91, also hated the internet Matt told the New York Times that he once explained Facebook to his father, who had been horrified that people shared personal information online.But Matt, who helps run the JD Salinger Literary Trust, said that a letter from a woman in Michigan in 2014, who had a “permanent right-hand disability” and struggled when reading physical books, made him reconsider how best to respect his father’s wishes.“She took me personally to task in a very sharp but humorous way, and from the moment I read her letter I was committed to figuring out a way to let her read my father’s books, as she so wanted,” Matt said.“My father always did what he could to keep his books affordable and accessible to as many readers as possible, especially students, and he consistently refused to give up the cheaper paperback editions for more profitable trade paperbacks, even when Hemingway and Fitzgerald and Faulkner had done so, and when Little, Brown was urging him to.“Making his books accessible to a new generation, many of whom seem to prefer reading on their electronic devices, and – specifically – people with health conditions or impairments that mean they’re unable to read physical books, is a very exciting development, and totally in keeping with his wishes even if he greatly preferred the full tactile experience of a physical book. Would he prefer and encourage readers to stick with the printed books? Absolutely. But not exclusively if it means some not being able to read him at all.”However, there was no announcement of any official audiobooks. Salinger detested the idea of his books interpreted in any medium beyond the page and often rejected proposals for stage and film adaptations of his work.Salinger is not the only author to have opposed ebooks. In a 2012 interview, children’s author Maurice Sendak said: “Fuck them, is what I say. I hate those ebooks. They cannot be the future. They may well be. I will be dead, I won’t give a shit.” And in 2009, Fahrenheit 451 author Ray Bradbury told the New York Times: “They wanted to put a book of mine on Yahoo! You know what I told them? ‘To hell with you. To hell with you and to hell with the internet.’”In February, Matt revealed in the  that decades of unpublished writing by his father will be released over the next 10 years, predicting that it will take five to seven years to finish assembling.Four works by Salinger will be published as ebooks by Penguin in the UK and Little, Brown in the US on Tuesday: The Catcher in the Rye, Franny and Zooey, For Esmé – With Love and Squalor and Raise High the Roof Beam, Carpenters, and Seymour – An Introduction."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e28a7c34f5ac1330cfd79e129bc367b18f2b59ca/7_385_1065_639/master/1065.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=87d0e7fff5d1e488cd0c2fdcb11ec420","title":"dr martens profits up 70 with success of new vegan range","story":"Equity investor Permira weighs up sale or flotation to realise profits on £300m investmentOther successful products included departures from the original Dr Marten boots such as sandals, collaborations with the Sex Pistols and designer Marc Jacobs, and versions for children.The fast growth comes as the shoemaker’s owner considers options to cash in its investment.

How ghastly. But everyone has their line in the sand. Mine is a literal one, each summer, as blacked-up morris dancers enjoy my local beaches.“Broadstairs is a bit like a Cornish fishing village perched on the side of Kent,” says Jo Tuffs, director of the town’s folk week, which began on Friday. By the end of the week, around 60,000 people will have passed through Broadstairs – population 25,000 – to enjoy the 54-year-old festival. Sixty acts, 50 events a day, 15,000 tickets. All this will generate an estimated £2.5m for the town.If it’s your first visit, some of the acts may surprise you. There are 35 troupes of morris dancers attending, for example, and five of these perform in blackface. These are typically morris dancers from the “border morris” tradition – a style which came from the counties lining the English-Welsh border: Herefordshire, Worcestershire and Shropshire. The origins of their use of blackface is a key argument in the clash between folk festival organisers and the critics who want to run the tradition out of town – as happened in 2016 when the Shrewsbury folk festival banned such dancers.Those in favour say the face-painting has nothing to do with racism, the Black and White Minstrels or the lampooning of anyone of black and minority ethnic backgrounds. It is “history” or a “bit of fun”, they claim. They argue that the practice dates back centuries to well before the time morris dancers might have encountered blacked-up performers from overseas. They are dressing up as chimney sweeps or miners, a ploy that originated with agricultural workers trying to disguise themselves from their employers when they went out to sing and dance for a few extra pennies, when begging was illegal. It has nothing to do with race, they say. The chancellor, Sajid Javid, defended the practice in 2017, when he was communities secretary, saying he was “proud” of a group in Alvechurch in his Bromsgrove constituency. “They are as racist as I am,” he tweeted.Driver is convinced, based on evidence from a number of folk-dance scholars, that the practice was influenced and inspired by American minstrel shows from the Victorian era and their homegrown spin-offs. With the advent of the railways and music halls, styles of dancing, shows and skits spread easily across the ocean and from town to town. The race equality thinktank, the Runnymede Trust, has said that “supporters of the English folk tradition claim that blackfacing has nothing to do with race but their protestations certainly need to be contrasted with historical evidence and not reported as if this were undisputed fact”.History is interesting. Origin stories fascinate people. All of these arguments are well-worn. But the more I listen to how critics and supporters slice, dice and muddle the evidence, the more tempted I am to say to hell with all of it. What relevance has origin in what is perceived as outwardly – often proudly – racist behaviour? As a university lecturer, I used to teach a cultural studies class on race and identity to journalism students. It was a racially erse group and included three or four undergraduates who educated me over our time together. I felt guilty watching the scales fall from my students’ eyes as we studied a number of current instances of blackface. They’d experienced racism. They were ready to debate whether white people wearing dreadlocks is a form of blacking up. They hadn’t necessarily thought deeply about how outdated modes of behaviour are still supported and validated in 21st-century Britain.Blacking up has got all sorts of people into all sorts of trouble in recent times: Prada, Gucci, Vogue, Kylie Jenner, Ariana Grande. Just last week Belgium’s Africa Museum held a party, for which it has since apologised, where guests wore colonial costumes, and some painted their faces black too. There’s an easy solution.I don’t think the folk week organisers need to further examine whether performers’ use of blackface is or isn’t racist. They could simply move the festival’s identity on by banning the practice.• Sophie Morris is a journalist and university lecturer.

Start a revolution with your wardrobe by swapping, sharing and repairing clothesIt may be cheap and on-trend but fast fashion isn’t the answer for cash-strapped students. For Mia Smith, a fashion communication student at Liverpool John Moores University, it’s not an option. “I am strongly aware of the effects fast fashion has on the environment and I believe they’re too catastrophic to ignore,” she says. “More people need to be aware.”Thanks to our hyper-connected world and ethical fashion movements such as Fashion Revolution, we know more about the industry than ever. We know that garment factories pump toxic chemicals into local rivers, farmers use dangerous pesticides to grow the huge amounts of cotton needed, and thousands of gallons of water are used to make just one T-shirt. “The industry’s dirty secrets are now easily uncovered and once revealed they’re hard to ignore,” says Jessica Donnelly, programme leader of fashion communication and styling at De Montfort University.Instead of shelling out on new clothes, why not get creative and make the most of what you already own?I started selling clothes I didn’t wear, on Depop 18 months ago, and after about half a year it became a business. I started off looking for stock in charity stores and at car boot sales, and I go back home to Thailand a couple of times a year where there are loads of vintage clothes that are really cheap. Wherever I go, I’ll make sure that I find charity shops or markets to go to. I’ve dedicated two wardrobes just for Depop.When you take photos, it is best to put the clothes on someone – that’s when people buy them.

For centuries, Mexicans have cooked sauces enriched with ground nuts (and other ingredients) to add flavour and protein to simple combinations of vegetables, tortillas, beans and chillies. At Wahaca, we often have a cashew-nut mole on the menu, and it is not unlike this green tahini dressing, enlivening food with its vivid green colour and intriguing taste.

Toss the aubergines with the rapeseed oil and molasses, season well with salt and pepper and spread out in a single layer in the tray (use two trays if they are crowded). Roast for 20-25 minutes, turning the aubergines halfway through cooking, until golden and caramelised. Remove from the oven and leave to cool.Meanwhile, toss the shallot with half the vinegar and the sugar, then set aside. Dress the chickpeas with the remaining vinegar and the oil, and season to taste. Put to one side to absorb the dressing.To make the tahini dressing, put the garlic and herbs in a food processor and blitz for 30-40 seconds (you can also do this with a hand blender). Add the tahini, honey and lemon juice, and blitz again. Combine the oil and 90ml water, then, with the motor running, add to the dressing in a slow, steady stream, until you have a bright-green sauce. Season with salt and pepper and transfer to a bowl.Drain the shallot, then add to the chickpeas along with the tomatoes and chopped watercress, and toss gently.

But does that mean everyone was happy? Hell, no! Here are a few of the issues that this first round of matches brought up, some contrived, some actually rather serious.Let’s start with the contrived. Gabriel Jesus had a goal disallowed against West Ham on Saturday after Raheem Sterling was ruled offside by the width of a unicorn’s horn. It meant the first thwarted celebration in the Premier League (more of that in a bit) but also provoked “lively” debate.Football may be a game of opinions but it is always better when they are based on something factual. Instead, on Match of the Day, Ian Wright (to pick one, prominent, well-remunerated example) left facts to one side and luxuriated in emotion instead as he decried “offside by an armpit”.Wright’s co-pundit Alan Shearer, a man well suited to his new role as sombre face of killjoy regulations, pointed out that there was no problem with VAR in this instance. It was applying the law and it was wrong to conflate one with the other.Separate out the two, however, and Wright is still wrong. Not only is the rule the rule, it is there for a reason and that is to provide clarity. When Wright made the plea that Sterling “gained no advantage” by being offside by an armpit and Gary Lineker chimed in by calling for “leeway”, they were making emotional appeals that work for them but might be unpalatable to someone else.With a clear rule you know where you stand. With “leeway” and “common sense” you open the door to subjectivity. And when you do that, more decisions become contestable and controversial, great for pundits but bad for football in general and referees in particular. Grey areas are a field day for those who like the words “incompetent” and “biased”. That the Premier League has chosen to go the other way ought to be seen as a good thing.Matchgoing fans at risk of losing emotional highSo that is the confected controversy. Now for the real thing. When Gabriel Jesus “scored” that “goal” City fans in the London Stadium celebrated heartily. Those cheers were then stifled as the VAR check ran on and, finally, they were stolen by West Ham fans whooping at the news of it being disallowed.Celebrating a goal has traditionally been an experience that is logical and emotional. First comes the knowledge that your team has been successful, then comes the freedom to revel in it among a group of like-minded people. Celebrating a goal in a crowd on a terrace is one of the best things in life. VAR could ruin it.Disallowing a goal not just seconds but maybe minutes after it has been “scored” is going to have an effect on how fans celebrate. They are going to hold in the excitement. They are going to tell their brain not to jump to conclusions and their heart to keep calm. And if they do that, then the joyous chain reaction breaks down.VAR decisions will surely be made more quickly as people get used to the tech but will they be fast enough to preserve that split second of explosive euphoria? And with VAR obliged to check on every goal, such decisions will be frequent. Willy Boly’s handball in the run-up to Wolves’ “goal” against Leicester was missed by Andre Marriner but it came up so quickly – and at such an oblique angle – that many other referees would miss it too. In that situation the VAR must intervene.This is a real problem but, unlike armpit offsides, it does not apply to all fans equally. Those watching at home have distractions. They can watch replays, get up and make a cup of tea, switch to another tab. For the casual viewer the “drama” of whether a goal will stand or not might even be enjoyable. For those in the ground, however, it kills the very reason they spend time and money following their team. Being a fan is about celebrating goals the whole thing changes without it.Finally, the good news: no one will have to endure Miguel Almirón being “clever” in the box again. The Newcastle United forward tried to con Martin Atkinson on Sunday by ing during the first half of the Toon’s 1-0 defeat against Arsenal. Atkinson called simulation and booked the Paraguayan. But, even if he had missed it and awarded a penalty instead, VAR would have been obliged to check the challenge and would have spotted Almirón falling, despite not being touched. The penalty box swan e is now an endangered species. So that is something."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e375d36882f6dbb5a4c112d6b4bfddafee1032aa/209_396_3950_2370/master/3950.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ecc6da883b6f1e90b529748701fa6ed8","title":"wally downes carabao cup","story":"His club pulled off an extraordinary escape in League One and now prepares to meet its bitterest rivals MK Dons in the Carabao CupWally Downes has spent almost an hour dissecting moments from an unprecedented six months that will forever live in AFC Wimbledon’s history when conversation sticks on an epic war film, The Great Escape, which quickly became a byword for the club’s extraordinary tale of survival in League One last season. And there was talk on the terraces of another thriller. “They couldn’t work out if it was Mission Impossible or The Great Escape,” he says, smiling. “I prefer The Great Escape because that’s only been one film and Tom Cruise seems to rock up every 18 months for Mission Impossible. I wouldn’t fancy going through that again.”The room erupts into laughter but the scale of his achievement should not be overlooked when Downes took charge last December Wimbledon had lost nine games on the bounce and only a superior goal difference kept them off the foot of the table. Downes guaranteed safety on the final day in early May but Wimbledon’s moment in the sun was short-lived.The immediate focus is on welcoming – if that is the right word – MK Dons to Kingsmeadow on Tuesday in the Carabao Cup first round. The last time the sides met in Norbiton in September 2017 Wimbledon referred to MK Dons as ‘MK’ on the scoreboard and made no reference to them on the cover of the matchday programme, leading to Wimbledon being charged with misconduct, charges which the EFL later dropped. The league has been mediating between the clubs since, with AFC Wimbledon instructed to adhere to several conditions including displaying “the name of the MK Dons on the website, match tickets, match programmes, teamsheets and scoreboard (as applicable) in a manner that is consistent with all other teams that visit”.Downes switches into diplomatic mode. Asked whether referring to MK Dons by name is banned in his household, he takes a ludicrously long sup of tea. “They are footballers playing for a football club they have to get a living.” As for the match itself: “Just another game, let’s win it,” he deadpans. Does the Football Association’s decision to allow the original Wimbledon club to move to Milton Keynes still grate on those associated with AFC? “Oh yeah,” he says. “To have it ripped away as it was, it was a disastrous time for anyone that had any affinity with the club. The fact that it has never been allowed to happen again shows what a terrible decision it was. It has been well documented who the people were that made that decision. I can never remember who they are …”Seventeen years on from their rebirth, the return to Plough Lane they have long craved is nearing. The club have set a crowdfunding target of £7m to help them smooth their return to Merton, the pocket of south-west London they regard as home, where they are building a 9,500-seat stadium which they believe will be ready for the 2020-21 season. The less debt funding, the less the stadium will eat into Downes’s annual playing budget of around £2m. Every shareholder’s name will be inscribed on a plaque while investors will be entered into a draw to have their name up in lights at the ground the winners will enjoy stadium-naming rights throughout the season. Fans can equally invest to personalise concourses, turnstiles, beer taps – and urinals. “I will be buying something there but it certainly won’t be a toilet,” Downes says. “The whole raison d’être of the club once it became a bona fide club on Wimbledon Common with 300 people was not about being in this ision – although it was an inspiration – it was about getting the club back playing in Wimbledon by hook or by crook. The fact we are in this ision is way beyond what anybody thought.”Downes, who had a two-year spell in charge of Brentford in 2002, never hankered to return to management and before taking the Wimbledon job was watching their games from afar, on his laptop in Calcutta, where he was coaching in the Indian Super League alongside Steve Coppell, whose assistant he had been at Crystal Palace and Reading in the Premier League. Downes recognised radical change was needed Wimbledon had lost the ball 30 yards from their own goal more than any other team in the ision and were not only conceding at set-pieces but not scoring from them either.One of Downes’s first decisions was to go more direct. “There’s a massive snobbery if you play the ball long, opposition fans start booing and you get pigeon-holed as ‘they’re just a boot-it team’. It’s a load of nonsense.” He sought to address other holes too, with the club appointing a head of recruitment in Nick Daws and hiring a full-time kit man.These are exciting times. Despite losing captain Deji Oshilaja and Toby Sibbick over the summer they have made several intriguing signings. Aaron Ramsdale excelled on loan from Bournemouth last season and they have recruited another goalkeeper from the Premier League, with Nathan Trott arriving from West Ham. Adam Roscrow has joined from Cardiff politan University, while Nesta Guinness-Walker has signed from Met Police FC. “It was marvellous what the boys did last season but it’s for the memory bank and it’s for other people to bring up,” he says. “Getting us into the new stadium is the next chapter.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aec573bb00eb67788d2e5e555efb7e651ff2094d/0_0_1920_1152/master/1920.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=937acfbd9dc1685a5f293e73327f15d9","title":"how we met when he got through passport control i was deliriously happy","story":"Clara Tait, 29, a teacher living in the UK, met Nkosi Kerr, 31, on holiday in Tobago. They got married this yearWhen Clara’s family were planning a holiday to celebrate a series of milestones and anniversaries, they each put their dream destination into a hat and her mother pulled out Tobago. And so, in April 2014, Clara spent two weeks on the Caribbean island with her parents and sister. Clara and her mother decided to stay on for a bit longer, moving out of the resort and into a guesthouse in a village. One day, they visited the rainforest and met Nkosi, who had just started a new job as a tour guide there. He offered to take them into the forest but Clara’s mother didn’t want to do a tour. When they came out, Nkosi was still there, and Clara’s mother offered him a lift.What should have been a 20-minute drive turned into an all-day trip, with Nkosi showing them around the island. What did they talk about? “I would have just shown off about Tobago,” says Nkosi, with a laugh. Clara says: “I was feeling really shy. I think my mum was doing most of the talking.”They had all got on so well that Nkosi invited Clara and her mother for breakfast the next morning at the house he had built. “That, for me, was like: ‘Wow, this person’s really cool’,” says Clara. “I felt drawn to you then. My mum must have picked up on it because she was like: ‘Well, I’d better take her home now before I leave her here for ever.’”What did Clara like about him? “I wasn’t used to someone being so genuine,” she says. Boyfriends in the past “always had an image of themselves they wanted to portray and Nkosi seemed so open and honest, and it was quite disarming to meet such a pure heart. He wasn’t flirty at all, just warm to me and my mum.” Was he keen on Clara? He says he didn’t want to seem too forward, but “I thought: ‘I like this girl.’”The next day, Nkosi took them out on a boat trip with his friend. “I could feel that Nkosi, just the way he helped me on to the boat, was just a bit more tactile,” Clara remembers. He laughs. “What do you mean?” “You gave me your hand to help me on to the boat and I was like: ‘That’s not really necessary.’” Back at the harbour, they got a beer and sat down together – alone for the first time. “We had this nice talk about what we think about the world and what’s important to us,” says Clara. Nkosi says: “There was a connection.”He took Clara and her mother to the airport the following day, having exchanged numbers and email addresses but not sure if they would ever see each other again. “I didn’t worry,” says Nkosi. “Because I think everything is going to happen as it’s meant to.”For two years they talked on the phone, online and, towards the end of that period, by video calls. By then they were talking every day. Around then, says Clara, “I felt I loved him. I had a job and the means to come and see him again, so I booked a two-week holiday in Easter 2016.”When they met at the airport, she says, “it felt like being with family, it felt so comfortable straight away”. Nkosi says: “I was happy. We were in a position where you can’t analyse it. You just have to know it, and I knew. We had to make it happen.” Clara, he says, “inspires me to be the best I can be.” For her, Nkosi “really calms me down and grounds me because I’m someone who is quite analytical”.A few months later, Nkosi came to the UK so he could meet her family and friends. Clara waited at Gatwick for him. Hours passed. “Finally I got a call, about five or six hours after his plane landed, saying he was being detained and questioned.” She was interviewed a couple of times on the phone, sitting in an airport cafe. “Eventually they told me he was going to be sent back to Trinidad and Tobago, that they weren’t satisfied that he was coming here on a holiday to see his girlfriend.”Clara managed to find out where Nkosi was being held and, having missed the visiting hours, she pleaded to be able to see him. She was told she had 15 minutes. “It was pretty bittersweet,” she says. The obstacles to being together, says Nkosi, “made me work harder – that became the inspiration”.Clara had qualified as a primary school teacher and for the next two years went to Tobago every school holiday. Nkosi tried again to come to the UK last year. This time, despite being questioned for several hours again, he was allowed to enter. “When he got through, I was almost delirious with happiness,” says Clara.They got married earlier this year in Tobago and are hoping to live in the UK together. “My mum sent Nkosi a picture of me working on our visa application,” says Clara, “and he texted her back saying: ‘Thanks for everything – especially that lift.’ It really did change both of our lives.”Want to share your story?

Here’s how parents can help them forge good habits and avoid creating lifelong insecuritiesJusna Begum lives near the South Bank in London with her four children, aged between one and 11. When a health visitor told her that her three-year-old girl was “on the chubby side”, Begum was surprised. “I didn’t think she was at all I had felt like my children weren’t eating enough.”She did, however, accept an invitation to join a six-week healthy parenting programme called Henry. Four weeks in, she has rebooted her family’s lifestyle, from making dinner times earlier to allow for more activity before bed to the food she prepares. Coming from an Asian background, says Begum, “There’s a lot of fatty food – we use a lot of oil and salt in curries.” Her children also loved drinking juice and snacking on crisps and chocolate after school. “I would just allow them,” she says, incredulously. “I thought it was normal.”In following her health visitor’s advice, however, Begum is in a minority. Just one-third of parents who are informed that their child is overweight or obese accept any help offered to them. Peymané Adab, a professor of chronic disease epidemiology and public health at the University of Birmingham, has been developing obesity prevention and management programmes for nearly 20 years, including studying parental responses. “There is definitely underrecognition of obesity,” she says. “Part of it is that we base our judgment on what’s normal, what’s around us, and as more children become obese and overweight you compare and say: ‘My child isn’t that overweight.’”While every child develops differently, healthy puppy fat generally ends with toddlerhood. The critical periods are around ages five and six and again around puberty when, says Adab, there is a tendency for weight gain and “perhaps we should be intervening more”.From age three and up, the main way parents are informed that their children are overweight is through the National Child Measurement Programme (NCMP), which registers children’s body mass index (BMI), once at four or five and again at 10 or 11. But BMI, a calculation based on weight and height, has limitations – for instance, it underestimates body fat in south Asian children (the demographic with the highest levels of childhood obesity) and overestimates it in black children.Another problem with the NCMP is there is no hard and fast procedure on informing parents of the result – it was set up to monitor trends, not as a screening strategy. “Some local authorities contact families of the children who were overweight and try to get them to engage in services some don’t do anything other than send a letter,” says Adab. “We don’t know what the best approach is.” Many simply don’t trust the figures. “Even colleagues here, working in academia, have said they’ve binned that letter because they think it’s rubbish.”Attempts have been made to word the notification differently, to little effect. “It’s an impenetrable problem,” says Adab – and it is exacerbated by our sugar-coated and deep-fried food culture. Her daughter was given chocolate by teachers as a reward. “I was part of our parent-teacher group and remember trying to speak up, saying maybe we shouldn’t have so many sweets,” she recalls. “All the parents thought I was from another planet.” At least in primary school, there is some control over what children eat the newfound autonomy of starting secondary school – and the sweet shops and fried chicken joints that come with it – poses the greatest challenge. Taste preferences are formed in early life: even exposure to flavours in the womb influences later habits, while sugar – separate to weight gain – conditions our brains to crave ever-bigger sweet fixes. “From a young age we can start getting children used to less sugar and less fat,” says Dr Angela Donin of the Population Health Research Institute at St George’s, University of London. “If they’re more used to snacking on savoury crackers that are high in oats or bran, and fruit and nuts, that will hopefully shape their preferences.”In 2017 Zoe Willman, who lives in Sheffield, sought help to persuade her two young sons, who have autism, to eat anything other than chicken nuggets and potato faces. “My eldest would eat cucumber, but apart from that vegetables were a no-go, and I was really worried they weren’t getting what they needed.” After a year working with a Henry volunteer, “Now we’re on fish,” she says proudly. Simple changes such as making shapes out of food and reward charts for trying something new have worked wonders. A healthier diet seems to have changed Willman’s children’s behaviour for the better – “There are more calm moments now” – and she herself has shed several stones.Begum was also pleasantly surprised by the Henry programme’s help in introducing healthy snacks to her family. She says it taught her simple presentation tactics, such as making carrot sticks, which are pleasing to children’s palates. “I peel and slice apples and then they’ll eat them. They love carrot and cucumber sticks with hummus now. Giving them a packet of crisps is easier than having to peel and cut fruit, but my kids really love it – and vegetables. It is expensive to buy, rather than the fatty stuff, so I’m careful not to waste it, freezing vegetable portions for dinners.”For parents who are anxious about their children becoming obese, the temptation can be to restrict certain foods and stress the terrible consequences of eating them – but this approach comes with its own concerns about instilling complexes. “It is a difficult balance, but I don’t think we should be saying there are taboo foods that we shouldn’t have,” says Adab. “That extreme has definitely been shown to lead to problems. It’s fine to have sweets on occasion but it should be no more than once a week. Every day we drink water rather than fizzy drinks.” But this isn’t easy, she says, and there needs to be a bigger buy-in from schools and parents. “If it became the norm it would be different.”Given the temptation-laden world we inhabit, will trying to limit access to unhealthy snacks encourage children to binge on them when they get the opportunity? Adab says there isn’t a scientific consensus as to whether restriction leads to weight gain. “Some studies do find an association, but we recently completed a study and found there isn’t an association when you adjust for children’s weight at the start. It could be that parents are restricting because their child is overweight, rather than the restricting causing the weight.”Zeroing in on weight and size, however, is psychologically unhelpful. Many professionals now emphasise positive, healthy living. “There is very little evidence that weight management programmes lead to unhealthy behaviours,” says Adab, “but there is always a concern that children will slip into eating disorders. It is still an area that is underresearched, but on the whole most weight management programmes don’t result in unhealthy behaviour if they are done properly.” The trend now is for weight management programmes to call themselves healthy lifestyle programmes, incorporating increased activity, prioritised sleep and limited time on devices into daily routines. “Providing hands-on activities rather than didactic stuff improves uptake and retention,” says Adab. Donin says that the Child Heart and Health Study in England (Chase) of about 5,000 children aged nine to 10 found lower screen time was linked with a lower fat mass index. Stephanie Byrne, a Henry practitioner who works in Lambeth, south London, says she tends not to mention weight at all: “It’s more about looking at the whole lifestyle of the family and getting people to identify where they want to make changes.” Rather than going on a diet, families might decide to buy a dining table. “We talk about eating slowly with other people, regular meals, portion size, not snacking all the time, turning the TV off, talking to children and giving them lots of praise and rewards. The evidence shows that is the best way to tackle childhood obesity and being overweight.”Begum has picked up ideas for how to make being healthy fun, from involving the children in cooking to creating a lucky-dip jar of activity options. “I’ve seen the difference in the kids,” she says. “I used to struggle to get them to bed but now they get tired. Before, I just didn’t think about healthiness.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7211b3e9f0b56a6de1b36bdb30f1c56e73a8a419/0_342_5122_3073/master/5122.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9507bfa1e1857cf4814edb012de5ccec","title":"more than half of people aged 65 and over now shop online ons","story":"The online shopping revolution has officially become mainstream among the once tech-resistant generation aged 65 and over, with more than half now saying they shop online.Shoppers from the 25-34 age group most commonly made 11 or more purchases in the three-month survey period.

Impoverished! But when you’re young that’s fine. We’d take the mattress out of my bedroom, stick it in the back of a rental van and off we’d go on tour.Bandwagonesque captures that spirit. There weren’t many people at the time making melodic pop records that were kind of sloppy too. The vocals aren’t brilliant, the playing’s all right … it’s not been tidied up like a lot of records are these days. It captures young people trying to find their feet. That’s what I think people pick up on.Our producer Don Fleming advised us to drink Jack Daniel’s in the studio. He said: “It’s good for singing, guitaring and playing the drums.” Words of wisdom! He was a cheerleader for making the recording process an event rather than a dry session. Don was very encouraging musically too. He was the first person to get us working on harmonies because he said not many people were doing that at the time. We were slacker and noisier back then but Don got us hitting some really high notes – as we’ve gotten older they’ve gone out of our range.The album opens with The Concept, which has the lyrics: “She wears denim wherever she goes  Says she’s gonna buy some records by the Status Quo.” I liked the idea of referencing them because if you wanted to be cool you never would. I could have referenced the Moving Sidewalks instead and people would have thought: “What a wanker.” I’ve not seen the film Young Adult, but I know that Charlize Theron sings The Concept in it. That’s pretty crazy to think she knows the song.We had to play the entire album live recently. Has it stood the test of time? I suppose the best you can say as a musician is, if you don’t cringe too much when you listen back to it, then you’ve kind of done OK.I was still living with my mum and dad in a multistorey council flat, and yet I’d be on the phone to New York lawyers and labels in North America trying to sort out record deals. We’d be talking about all this money but I still didn’t have enough to get the bus down to the rehearsal room in Motherwell.We didn’t have a manager at the time and I was so tied up doing that kind of thing that I only wrote one song on the record, but I still felt I contributed in lots of other ways. It was a good collective experience. Me and Norman had spent a few years in the wilderness waiting to get to a place where we had time in a studio with a band, so we enjoyed focusing on ourselves.Bandwagonesque has a certain idiosyncratic sound. After we finished I thought “Oh God, I don’t know if this is the best thing we could do here.” But as time goes on, you realise that’s all part of the creative process. It has its flaws, but so do all our records.I did the sleeve with my girlfriend at the time. She gets a credit but really it’s my fault. When bands sign to a bigger label, they end up with an art department record sleeve, where everything looks a bit slick and airbrushed. I had the idea to do the exact opposite and make the cheapest sleeve ever configured. I used a free-to-use Microsoft clipart image. Geffen, our American label, hated it. I don’t think the other guys in the band liked it either. And we ended up getting sued by Gene Simmons who claimed to have trademarked bags of money. So I’m trying to produce the cheapest sleeve possible as some kind of comment on the music business and we end up getting sued by Gene Simmons. I said to our lawyer: “Can we just tell him to fuck off?” He said no, so we gave him $500 and a credit."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/184467aefa4d0fe4b930567f2b561946b582755c/0_332_4657_2794/master/4657.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5bc384d79b246b490a4344302cddb74e","title":"is a british university degree really worth it any more","story":"We run the rule over UK higher education, as school leavers prepare for their A-level resultsThere are about 140 universities in the UK. It depends on your definition of a university: if it stretches to any public institution with degree-awarding powers, then the number rises to 164, according to Higher Education Statistics Agency (Hesa) data. A small number of private providers can also award degrees.University enrolments have risen steadily since 2015, when the government lifted the cap on student recruitment to increase competition. The system is now driven by demand as institutions scramble to attract students each year.The upward trend is expected to continue as the 18-year-old population rises. The Higher Education Policy Institute (Hepi) thinktank recently predicted that universities will need to provide at least 300,000 more places by 2030 to meet demand.As for mature students, entry rates have declined by half since 2012, particularly in part-time and non-undergraduate courses. More than 1.3 million students in the UK are over 21 years old.More than 40,000 overseas students could face difficulties applying for visas this September after the process was outsourced to the French IT services company Sopra Steria, which has received complaints about delays and high appointment costs.No university in the UK is completely publicly funded. The student loans system requires students to pay for all or some of their degree after they graduate. Repayments are deducted as a percentage of their salary after they start earning £25,000, and the outstanding balance is written off after 30 years. As such, the government will effectively pay for some of a graduate’s degree, though how much depends on their lifetime earnings.Most universities in the UK have charity status and on average they receive just over a quarter of their funding from the government in the form of research grants and funding to cover the teaching of high cost subjects.There is also a small but growing number of private universities in the UK that can award degrees, such as the University of Buckingham and Regent’s University London. Their tuition is not subsidised by the government and so they usually charge higher fees.Some universities say they are struggling because of competition for students, political uncertainty and weakened finances. Last year, some English universities were reported to be at risk of closure following a drop in enrolments. Several universities have faced falls in numbers in recent years, including Kingston University, London politan University and the University of Cumbria.Experts warn that some institutions are risking financial vulnerability.“I think we are closer to seeing a university suffer financial collapse than at any point in living memory,” says Nick Hillman, director of Hepi and a former government adviser.Hillman says universities lost a safety net when the government closed the Higher Education Funding Council for England in April last year and replaced it with the Office for Students (OfS). The OfS, which takes on its full legal powers this summer, has already indicated that it will not support institutions in financial trouble in the same way the old funding council did.But institutional failure is not inevitable, Hillman adds. “Whatever people may say now, if any big institution does go under, I suspect public authorities will have to step in to facilitate a merger, takeover or bailout.”It’s a fair question. The financial burden of a degree isn’t to be taken lightly. Since tuition fees were tripled in 2012, university applicants have faced a large debt that keeps rising due to high interest rates. The average graduate debt – tuition compounded by maintenance costs and high rates of interest – stands at more than £50,000 for a three-year degree.After the maintenance grant was scrapped in 2016, many students have struggled to manage financially during term time. The grant was replaced by the maintenance loan, which averages at £509 per month, but its value has since declined in real terms as rent and other living costs have risen.The pressures extend to parents, who stump up an average £360 a month to support their children’s studies, according to a recent survey. Students don’t get the full maintenance loan if their parents’ household income is higher than £30,000, so parents are expected to make up the rest.That said, a degree still pays off in the long run. According to the latest official statistics, graduates last year earned a median salary of £34,000, while non-graduates earned only £24,000.But some students will benefit from a bigger wage premium than others. For instance, white graduates earned a median salary of £35,550, compared with £25,500 for black graduates. The graduate gender pay gap has widened slightly since 2016, with the median salary for graduate men rising by £1,500 more than for women.Graduates from the Russell Group of universities and comparable institutions tend to earn the most, according to last year’s data from the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Across the board, the average graduate earns between £26,000 and £30,000 after five years.The highest earners of any gender are graduates from the London School of Economics, with women earning £45,000 on average and men earning more than £60,000.Several universities in Europe offer the opportunity to study for free or for a lower tuition fee than in the UK. German universities offer students places with free tuition, as do some institutions in Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Iceland.These countries offer lots of courses in English, although students may need to meet language requirements for others. Accommodation and other costs will obviously vary.In Scotland, tuition is free for Scottish students and students from the EU, but not to other UK students.Another study abroad option is the Erasmus+ student exchange programme. This September, about 17,000 students plan to move overseas for a year through the EU-funded scheme. However, its future is uncertain as the government has so far failed to guarantee funding for the scheme amid the Brexit tumult.The academic route isn’t for everyone. There are plenty of alternatives, including distance learning and online courses, which can be done remotely and part-time. Further education colleges offer higher apprenticeships and foundation degrees, which combine academic and vocational study.The newest option is a degree apprenticeship, which was launched in 2015. For three or four years, apprentices study for their degree while gaining paid industry experience. Course costs are covered by the employer and the government, meaning degree apprentices often don’t have to pay for their tuition."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90028295cb408255156c8fe8e9c65e3102ab1848/0_0_3685_2404/master/3685.jpg?width=1010\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4cc326e1c7dc58e1260b2eb8c1f0614b 1010w","title":"british diplomats to pull out from eu decision making meetings within days","story":"Critics say No 10 move to quit bloc’s institutional structures leaves UK blindsidedBritish diplomats will pull out from the EU’s institutional structures of power in Brussels within days, under plans being drawn up by Downing Street.In an attempt to reinforce the message that the UK is leaving the EU by 31 October, “do or die”, the UK will stop attending the day-to-day meetings that inform the bloc’s decision-making.The move under discussion is said by UK officials to be in line with Boris Johnson’s first statement in the House of Commons, in which he said he would “unshackle” British diplomacy from EU affairs.Critics have countered that the symbolic walkout would merely leave the UK blindsided on decisions and ultimately damage the national interest.EU working group meetings at which British diplomats were expected to take their seats alongside the other 27 member states will deal with issues on security, the pan-European response to any future crises involving civilians, foreign affairs and the protection of consumers interests.It is unclear how far the UK’s withdrawal from the EU structures would go before 31 October, and whether ministers or the UK’s permanent representative in the EU would ultimately fail to show up for meetings in September and October.The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said he would attend a meeting of his EU counterparts at the end of August in Helsinki.Luisa Porritt MEP, the deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats in the European parliament, said: “Boris Johnson is unnecessarily sabotaging British influence in Europe.“Haughty grandstanding like this undermines our place in the world and will be treated as a snub by our European neighbours and allies, who we should be working with to address shared challenges.“Margaret Thatcher and Winston Churchill would be appalled by this short-sightedness. We should be leading in Europe, not undermining our own interests.“To be outside the room while our shared security interests are being discussed shows weakness and pettiness, not strength. Brexit is not inevitable this national humiliation must end alongside this rotten Conservative government.”There are about 150 diplomats in the UK’s permanent representation in Brussels lobbying for British interests during the drafting of EU positions and regulations.Far from being keen to abandon the field in Brussels, Theresa May’s government had been looking at how to maintain ways into the EU’s institutions in order to influence events from outside.But in his statement to the Commons on becoming prime minister, Johnson had said that both sides needed to recognise the “reality” that the UK’s “national participation in the European union” was coming to an end.The prime minister claimed there were “very many brilliant officials trapped in meeting after meeting in Brussels and Luxembourg when they could be better deploying their talents in preparing to pioneer new trade deals and promoting a truly global Britain”.While the UK has not played its usual full role in meetings in areas on the future of the EU, including in discussions on the bloc’s budget, it has been an active player in other fields such as foreign affairs since the Brexit referendum in 2016.EU diplomats said they would regret any decision by the British government to prematurely leave the Brussels institutions where the UK diplomats have built up a strong reputation.“They were once the most respected diplomatic corps here,” one said. “That was diminished during David Cameron’s government but the UK representative’s position was always important. Even in areas where the UK did not have a strong national stance, they would have ideas to solve a problem.”Paul Adamson, a visiting professor at the Policy Institute, King’s College London, said the UK government would need to build up its embassy in Brussels after Brexit.He said: “One of the many ironies of Brexit is that the UK government will have to significantly increase its diplomatic presence in Brussels - as well as in key EU capitals - both to find out what is going on in meetings from which it will be excluded but also to try to influence the direction of EU policy making. Brussels decisions will continue to impact the UK.A government spokesman said: “We are leaving the EU whatever the circumstances on 31 October. It therefore makes sense to review our attendance at EU meetings to make sure we are making the best use of government time. This process is ongoing.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e7d3a86502e520b47bc6255d1b9602695ca9e75/0_296_3648_2189/master/3648.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1bd1646c6030b8314de22008031b26f8","title":"allotments share your pictures and stories","story":"Glut of green beans or a cornucopia of courgettes?

The 32-year-old is the biggest casualty from Eddie Jones’s 31-man squad, with Piers Francis preferred in his place.Lewis Ludlam and Willi Heinz have both been included after their impressive debuts against Wales on Sunday while Ruaridh McConnochie is also picked, making him the first uncapped member of an England World Cup squad since Joe Simpson in 2011.The writing was on the wall for Te’o when, along with Brown, he was left out of the squad preparing to face Wales last week. Details of the pair’s altercation then emerged but Jones’s decision to leave him out is still a surprise considering how highly he has valued Te’o’s direct running in the past. Brown also misses out meaning, along with the omissions of Dylan Hartley, Chris Robshaw, Nathan Hughes and Danny Care, Jones has decided against selecting six players who have 361 caps between them.Brad Shields, who has been struggling with a foot injury, is also conspicuous by his absence with Ludlam getting the nod as the fifth back-row. Jack Nowell, who continues to recover from an ankle injury, and Mako Vunipola, who missed the end of last season with a hamstring injury, are both included, as are Jonathan Joseph and Anthony Watson after making their first England appearances in more than a year against Wales.There is no place for Harry Williams, however – Jones opting to select just two tighthead props in Kyle Sinckler and Dan Cole, who along with Ben Youngs is the most capped player in the squad which has a 17-14 split between forwards and backs.With McConnochie and Nowell both selected, Jones has picked six back-three players and, as expected, only two scrum-halves with Youngs and Heinz preferred to Ben Spencer, who is overlooked. The captain, Owen Farrell, and George Ford are the only two fly-halves with Danny Cipriani long since out of the picture.Joe Launchbury is named among the second-rows but Charlie Ewels, who impressed against Wales on Sunday, is overlooked. Jack Singleton, another who made his debut against Wales, is the third hooker along with Jamie George and Luke Cowan-Dickie.“A lot of good players have missed out, we feel for them, I feel for them personally,” said Jones. “But as we know the World Cup is an incredible tournament where opportunities can present themselves and all those players who have missed out have been told they have to be ready.“Today is another step in the progress towards the Rugby World Cup. We have taken the decision to go early because of what we learned from previous campaigns. We want the squad to know early and now we can get on and be the best prepared England side there has ever been, ready to win the World Cup.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ff13af2251abfd00e4110a87a90b10b9c37bea4/0_82_2944_1767/master/2944.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=794b8eb676e45fc687c6b2fbeb47b25a","title":"jofra archer england australia ashes second test cricket","story":"Is Jofra Archer ready to go the distance in Test cricket?It was the question posed by Justin Langer, Australia’s head coach, before the fast bowler’s much-anticipated debut at Lord’s this week there is a theory that stamina could be a shortcoming.But when Australia’s plan to get overs into the legs of England’s expected replacement for Jimmy Anderson was put to the man himself the answer was in keeping with a cricketer who is softly spoken off the field and yet supremely confident with it.“I’m probably more ready than I’ve ever been,” said Archer, who earlier that morning had tweeted his hope of claiming a spot on the honours boards at Lord’s. “I don’t think Justin Langer has seen me play first-class cricket. I usually bowl 40 overs every game. I think he has another thing coming.”Archer was England’s leading wicket-taker in their victorious World Cup campaign with 20 victims but is coming into a Test side that sits 1-0 down to Australia. He is right to point to his back catalogue of four-day cricket –televised short-form tournaments propelled him to global superstardom but it is the longer stuff he claims to prefer.Since his first-class debut for Sussex in 2016 his workloads have been significant too. That said, despite averaging 24 with the Duke ball, Archer has played only one first-class fixture in the last 11 months – the 2nd XI match last week in which he took seven wickets but, more importantly, proved his fitness after a recent side injury by sending down 31 overs across two days.This is perhaps why Archer, back at the ground where his super over helped secure the World Cup, has warned England supporters not to “expect miracles” from him this week. Replacing Anderson, the country’s most prolific Test bowler, would represent a fair old challenge for any newcomer even if, in the case of Archer, his debut is probably the most talked up since Kevin Pietersen at Lord’s in 2005, if not Graeme Hick 14 years before that.While the pitch looked green but dry two days out the ground’s topography should suit him. As well as the much-discussed 90mph-plus speeds he generates, bowling wicket-to-wicket is one of Archer’s great attributes. And having claimed eight wickets for Sussex against Middlesex here last season he believes the famous slope is a significant factor for him.“I personally believe in Test cricket you get a lot more opportunities to redeem yourself. In 50-over cricket if you don’t have a good 10 overs, that’s it – you’ve got to wait till the next game. But you have ample chances to do it in a red-ball game.”Another difference is the tighter regulations on short balls in limited-overs cricket. Archer’s deceptive bouncer struck three batsmen on the head during the World Cup and, while still restricted to two per over in Test cricket, there is more leeway as regards wides.“Pace makes batters do funny things. It may make him play a shot he is not accustomed to. He may be a bit late on the ball so if you have the batter overthinking then you are in a good place.”England have certainly been thinking about how best to remove Steve Smith and while they are yet to decide whether Sam Curran replaces Joe Denly – a move that would give Joe Root six bowlers but put greater pressure on the top order – it is hoped Jack Leach can pick the lock.Asked about Smith’s average of 34 against slow-left armers – 29 runs less than his Test average but slightly amplified by turning pitches in the subcontinent – Langer replied: “I don’t buy into it. He’s got this incredible ability to solve problems, I’m sure he’ll be thinking a lot about he’s going to play all the new bowlers who are coming in.”While Australia trained during a dry morning, England were forced indoors by rain and Simon Harmer, the Essex off-spinner who plays on a Kolpak deal, made a guest appearance to help replicate Nathan Lyon. Smith’s wicket may be the most pressing issue for Root but it is not the only one."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f2716124dda663057a574bd108a334c7ce03ec7/452_641_2515_1509/master/2515.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f8a7a7246c329ebc144eb7a8f5fe347a","title":"suzann pettersen solheim cup wildcard europe golf","story":"Norway’s Suzann Pettersen has been handed a Solheim Cup wildcard, despite having played just two events since November 2017.The 38-year-old will make her ninth appearance in the biennial event at Gleneagles next month, having originally been appointed one of European captain Catriona Matthew’s vice-captains.The two-times major winner took time off in 2018 to have a baby and only returned to action last month, partnering Matthew in the Dow Great Lakes Bay Invitational in Michigan, where the pair missed the cut.Matthew also gave wildcards to France’s Céline Boutier and the English duo of Bronte Law and Jodi Ewart Shadoff to complete the 12-strong team which will try to avoid a third straight defeat to the United States.The eight automatic qualifiers – Anne van Dam, Charley Hull, Georgia Hall, Carlota Ciganda, Caroline Hedwall, Azahara Muñoz, Caroline Masson and Anna Nordqvist – were finalised after last week’s Scottish Open.Pettersen said: “I was honoured to be a vice-captain but I would much rather play.

Billed as the biggest arts festival in the world, the fringe offers thousands of different shows with plenty to cater for almost any taste you might imagine. Almost.For the last two years grassroots organisation Fringe of Colour has been on a mission to highlight and rectify the lack of BAME presence at the festival. Last year Layton Williams, an actor who has appeared on BBC Three in Bad Education and on the West End as Billy Elliot, accused security staff at the Assembly George Square venue of racial profiling after they alleged that he looked like a man who had jumped the fence two weeks before. The venue eventually apologised, but Williams’ experience is not unique.Not every experience is negative, and of course the fringe also offers unimaginable opportunity for directors, producers and performers, with many considering it the highlight of their creative year. Those in charge of the fringe are also making an effort to increase inclusivity, having designated ersity as one of the key strands of this year’s fringe central programme. But is enough being done to welcome people of all backgrounds to the fringe? We asked comedians, performers and  readers about their experiences.I haven’t had any proper negative experiences unless you count the occasional hostile reaction from drunk men when I tell them I’m not Romesh Ranganathan. When I told another BAME friend that I hadn’t experienced much racism in Edinburgh, they said “It’s because you get to be Nish”. I’ve been able to exist outside of the usual micro-aggressions because of the status I have at the fringe.I have heard more stories about racism in Edinburgh from other performers over the last couple years, but I suspect that is a symptom of a wider national problem with people becoming more comfortably racist. There’s also this weird strain of liberal racism where people believe they’re so liberal that they couldn’t possibly be racist – at another festival I had a woman describe me as “a little bit namaste”. Edinburgh changed my life and I owe my career to it so I really want to give more people from backgrounds like mine the sense that this is something they can do too. Nish Kumar, comedianI’ve heard other BAME acts talk about how their friends don’t even come up to Edinburgh because of the associated costs. The fringe is definitely skewed towards wealthier people who might not be from a BAME background, and so you’re fighting an uphill battle if you’re doing something for a more varied audience. Personally I haven’t experienced any racism at the fringe, but I still think what Fringe of Colour is doing is fantastic – if only there was a way they could eliminate the transport and hotel costs since they’re likely the biggest inhibitor stopping young BAME people from going up to the fringe. Arnab ChandaOur poetry collective, 4 BROWN GIRLS WHO WRITE, did a five-day run at the fringe with three sell-out shows. We felt that it was important to create a space for performers of colour. Both our white and non-white audience members felt empowered by the stories and voices on our stage and we even had one white member of the audience tell us that the show had helped her reflect on her privilege. We received a great response from our audiences who said there weren’t any shows like ours. We were there to creatively challenge the audience through our collective vulnerability of what it’s like to be “othered” – and people were welcoming of the space we created. 4 Brown Girls Who Write, performers and poets, LondonI love the fringe and want to keep going every year, but sometimes the subtle ignorance can get tiring. As a hijab-wearing Muslim, people handing out flyers for shows don’t approach me but instead give flyers to my white, non-hijab wearing friends. At comedy shows I’ve gotten used to comedians never trying to begin a conversation with me, no matter how many times I sit in the front row, and at bars I find people staring at me before quickly looking away. These things may be small but they all add up to make it clear that the fringe is not meant for people who look like me. Faaiza, 33, LondonI have a love-hate relationship with the fringe. Having worked on it 14 years out of the past 29, I love that the best emerging acts come to Edinburgh in August and I get the artistic nourishment that isn’t there the rest of the year. However, as an Indian woman and a creative, I hate how invisible BAME work and artists are made, through lack of access to high-profile showcases, press coverage and reviews. It can be a breeze for some BAME people but for most of us it’s not about our art, it’s about physical and mental stamina. To succeed you have to be a fighter. Annie George, performer, EdinburghI’ve been attending the fringe for almost 13 years and have never felt out of place as an ethnic minority. Perhaps more widening access schemes and better space and accommodation would help ease this problem. I think it would be more effective to reduce prices of concession tickets overall and have cheaper tickets for Edinburgh locals. It’s expensive to put on a show and this is off-putting for poorer people generally. Anonymous, EdinburghAs brilliant as the fringe is, I did look around when I was there and think: “why is this not more erse?” And I didn’t have an answer to that. With more ersity you get more interesting stories, which is especially important for art forms like theatre. There’s nothing wrong with admitting that a lack of ersity is a problem for the fringe. I do believe that to fix that there has to be a top-down movement with people who organise it making an effort to be more inclusive.

For three days, I’ve plodded rain-drenched backstreets, consuming hours of drama, comedy and performance art about eating. I’ve watched comfort food cabarets and comedy about the Toby Carvery, listened to rants about clean eating and calorific excess and met (albeit figuratively) the young women who tested Hitler’s dinner each evening for poison.There has been immigration-based drama Citizens of Nowhere?, staged in the kitchen of a Novotel hotel, and a Fawlty Towers dining experience where a man with a stick-on moustache and a faux-Spanish accent proffers waldorf salad to fans of the 70s sitcom. In Hold On Let Go, a drama with music by Paul Smith from Maximo Park, bread is baked live on stage. Despite all the walking, I’ve gained extra pounds, having eaten chocolate mousse made by an Australian woman singing Teenage Dream by Katy Perry as she whisked, plus a weirdly delicious chicken caesar salad made in a cement mixer by the anarchist cook George Egg.The highlight, however, took place in a humid, rather fetid drama space in Summerhall, as 20 of us watched the performance artist Sacha Plaige silently dissect the concept of dining during her one-woman show Feast. Plaige’s deft movement contains traces of Rik Mayall, Leigh Bowery and Björk while remaining beguilingly unique. It is a wordless, head-spinning, messy muse on appetite, scarcity, debauchery and greed. Plaige eerily mimics a chicken being roasted, flavouring herself first with parsley, shrinking as her skin becomes crisp and irresistible. Although she squashes tomatoes behind her knees, devours raw onion and rolls in cornflakes, it is the section where Plaige mimics the masks we adopt around fine wine – from the sommelier’s proud brandishing of a label to the customer feigning knowledge of a vintage – that stays with me long after the performance.“I’m half French,” Plaige tells me afterwards. “So I wanted to show that wine tasting, this delicate process, is actually grotesque. The gargling, the sniffing and swirling, the spitting through teeth. It’s an acknowledgment of the strangeness of the process.” Plaige describes Feast as “visceral”. She doesn’t warn the audience they might get hit by fruit pips or watch a courgette make love to a melon. Yet, on the night I went, this worked out very well. “Feast is about our relationship with food. It wasn’t supposed to be political, but then food does mark how and where we belong in society … hunger, excess. I’m interested in how we often disrespect the things we are given. We gorge, we eat too much, we do things to our own bodies that are violent and scary.” By the end of Feast, as a viewer I felt exhausted. As a restaurant critic, I felt understood. Plaige is delighted. There’s a sense, she says, “that I have taken my skin off every night”.Another piece that tackles the human obsession with food is the one-woman show The Perfect Body, by the Italian actor Lavinia Savignoni. She delivers a whirlwind, nigh-hysterical 50-minute monologue on “wellness”, diets, purging and the ghosts of our past that haunt every mouthful we eat. Savignoni plays the part of a clean-eating guru and Instagram star, dispatching juicing advice to clients longing to be as happy, toned and centred as she is. On stage, Savignoni loads a juicer with melon and guava. Vitamins are paramount! Meat is evil! Wheat will cause inflammation!Savignoni’s facade soon slips as she rambles into a secret world of hunger, craving and painful-sounding coffee enemas. Both The Perfect Body and Feast contain moments where young actors squat on stage straining to evacuate their bowels and flush the “badness” out. Both shows view food as friend and enemy. After watching The Perfect Body, I ate a warm cinnamon twirl from Baba Budan, weighing up, exactly as Savignoni would have, the calorie value against the seven miles I walked the previous day.What was needed, after all this truth, was comedy so off I went to see Pierre Novellie’s You’re Expected To Care. Novellie is one of my favourite funny-thinkers, as well as a food lover who cannot help writing material about Christmas dinner, Chinese takeaways and his fight to stay slim and TV-ready as all new-wave comedians must. In his show, Novellie, who is South African, puzzles over the intrinsic sogginess of British cuisine. Our need to add vinegar to battered fish. Our need to roast meat for so long that the juice depletes, then scoop these same juices to add back. “We moved from South Africa to the Isle of Man,” he tells me, “and I can still vividly remember queueing up for my very first school lunch. Nuggets, yes, chips, yes, but then beans poured all over everything. It was outrageous. Why do the British need to put a varnish on their food?” Novellie’s breakdown of the British gravy obsession is deliciously funny to a northern woman like me. He never mentions the word Brexit, but it hangs in the air like Bisto.Pity and anxiety for those eating alone is laid bare in Gareth Mutch’s new show, The Old Man in the Carvery, in which Mutch, who is in his mid-20s, discusses a moment that has haunted him. As a teen, Mutch met an elderly solo diner in a Toby Inn in Livingston, West Lothian. “Just sitting there … on his own … and he thought we were laughing at him … but we weren’t. It just looked like that.” Mutch says that he has let this diner who was clearly alone in the whole world, maybe widowed, maybe worse, define his adult happiness. But did the whole thing even happen? Mutch’s chaotic hour is really about how, in the absence of true angst, sometimes the brain likes to invent things. Nor does he talk about carvery at all, which was clearly quite a shock to many audience members who had bought tickets to hear 45 blistering minutes on the Toby Inn’s limitless veg and stuffing ball policy.Another show that left me puzzled was Hitler’s Tasters, although it was playing to sellout crowds. Based on true events, this hour explores the world of loyal young Third Reich women sitting in a room gossiping while waiting for a meal that may or may not kill them. The subject matter is fascinating and there are moments of pathos, but the thrust of this venture relies on the girls snapping selfies of themselves continually and at one point having a rather long twerking session wearing swastika vests that is pure Springtime for Hitler. This is apt, as the play is written by Mel Brooks’s daughter-in-law, Michelle Kholos Brooks. It is a strange way to pass an hour especially at the end, when the actors begin flogging Hitler’s Tasters merchandise.I lament the shows I’ve missed. I failed to see Chocolate by the Java Dance Theatre, which promised a rich, dark story, the air heavy with cocoa and a performer smeared with melted goo. I missed the rather wonderfully titled The Only Thing a Great Actress Needs Is a Great Play \u0026amp the Desire to Succeed, where two Mexican domestic servants cook breakfast. The Edinburgh festival is like a tremendous running buffet of things you’ve never tasted. All you can do is stack your plate up and hope you enjoy some. Others will stick in your throat and you will overlook some things completely.One selection I’m happy I made was George Egg’s Movable Feast, in which an anarchist amateur chef cooks a three-course meal with power tools, laptops and a cement mixer, then shares it outside with the audience. There is a mischievousness about Egg’s humour that is deeply lovable. Egg was never a chef, but he did once run the crepe stall for the circus troupe Archaos. In Movable Feast, he plays the part of one man against the system, eschewing boring service station food, going off-menu at Pret with his own salmon sous-vide, cooking aubergine on a Virgin Pendolino, caesar salad on a building site and haddock on his car engine as he motors down the highway.“This show is about anarchy, resourcefulness and the ability to cope with life’s situations,” Egg says when I chat to him afterwards. At the end of each show, audiences line up to chat about his recipes. “A man came in who couldn’t see the other day,” he says. “But he loved it. He could smell the toasting aubergine with tahini way before everyone else.” In a world of food restrictions, it is rather quaint to see queues of strangers digging in together, sharing forks, not giving a stuff for allergy advice labels and the threat of cross-contamination.“I come here every two years,” Egg says. “I love anything to do with food. It was either this, or run a cafe.” I left Edinburgh 4lb (1.8kg) heavier. On balance, it was totally worth it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af34e0f255923d3164578a3e2eda2046f79d9215/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e753024da361e03b76dd48120c101803","title":"from game of thrones to loving noses life as a self employed sculptor","story":"It takes a meticulous eye for detail to become a sculptor, but for Lydia Smith to make a living out of her art she needs to be equally diligent with her business planningSculptor Lydia Smith splits her time between her personal sculpture projects, running workshops, and the sets of films and TV shows for which she has sculpted props – such as Game of Thrones and Tomb Raider. The 24-year-old artist behind Lydia Smith Sculpture says the secret to fitting it all in is her constant companion: a paperback diary.I think with my hands. I always wanted to use clay and do 3D stuff but I wasn’t allowed. I completely fell in love with sculpture, and figurative in particular, when I started my art foundation. Making something 3D makes so much more sense to me than drawing. My hands just know what to do.One of my tutors told me: “Use a model to make a sculpture, but don’t make a sculpture of the model.” I’m attracted to models who have different angles in their faces and good noses, I love noses. I ask people I know to pose – raise their arms, twist a bit, look in different directions. Depending on what I’m trying to achieve with the mood of the piece, I might elongate or shorten limbs, or twist the torso more to give more drama.I worked on Game of Thrones season eight. There’s quite a lot of polystyrene sculpture used for trees, or castles, or rock formations. Little animals on the King’s Landing set were sculpted out of clay. The time pressure of working on set and never knowing if designers will change their mind is a challenge. My colleague and I had an hour to clad a whole piece and sculpt some rock detail into it, we were completely exhausted by the end then the designers came back and said they now didn’t need it until the next week.It’s part of my ethos to bring sculpture to younger people. I run portrait sculpting and torso sculpting workshops. You just don’t get the opportunity to do it in schools because of all the processes involved, you have to know your anatomy and there are just so many different techniques. It’s just so involved. Most people would have no idea how much stuff goes on behind the scenes of creating one sculpture.Health and safety is a massive part. We use knives and electrical equipment, so I have masks for breathing protection and eye goggles and gloves, which we wear when operating heavy machinery and moulding and casting. I have insurance to cover injuries, to cover my tools in case someone breaks in, and I have it to cover my apprentice, who was working for me one day a week.I’m trying to make my studio as eco-friendly as possible. I make my sculptures on armatures. I mould them and then get them cast in bronze, plaster, and a material called jesmonite. They’re non-toxic, so it’s more eco-friendly than resin. That’s something I’m trying to really bring into my studio, because there’s so much waste within the whole process.This year, I had five months off where there was no film work. Having that time off really pushed my personal work forward. It was really quiet and it enabled me to do some courses in Athens and in Spain. I’ve got five sculptures on the go at the moment, and I did two ice sculpture competitions over the Christmas break. But five months of no pay and all of a sudden it becomes: “I really need to find another film.”I always ask the question and I’m a little bit ballsy. I got my first actual job by wandering around on my tea breaks with my portfolio and breaking into art departments so I could speak with art directors. I love networking, I’m a network addict and I’m always paying attention to what might be next, even though I’m already doing something.I don’t know where I would be without my diary. If something is not in my diary I will just completely forget what it is film work, my personal stuff, my social life, gym, everything. I’m a very visual learner so everything is on this bit of paper, written down, rubbed out, scribbled out, different colours.I’m the most scatty person ever. To run my business as a sole trader I have a business account that everything goes into, I have an app to scan all my receipts and my invoices that calculate all my tax and expenses for the end of each year. A couple of years ago to get my head around it all was hard, but now it’s fine. I’m always on my emails, I always sit down at the end of the day and run through them to flag up the ones I need to reply to.I want to have a public sculpture somewhere someday. Ideally I want to be running workshops to teach people. My own personal goal is to have my artwork in exhibitions in galleries, and for people to commission me to do portrait busts and figures, and then drop in and out of film work whenever I get asked to come in.Lydia Smith takes care of business.

After starting her grooming business, Waggywoo, from her Surrey home conservatory last year, Palmer, 54, says there has been a lot to learn about the different types of customers – animal and human – that come through her doors.I started with my own puppy – a little cavachon. Like most groomers who start out I thought: “I can do this myself.” So I tried, and I made a mess of my own dog. But I really enjoyed it, even though I didn’t know what to do, so I took a couple of professional courses and it snowballed from there.When I started out I would be grooming dogs and not even know their names. But I wanted to have a business where it would be an enjoyable experience for the dogs, being groomed in a relaxed, unhurried environment free from stress. I work from home at the moment so I don’t have massive overheads, which means I am able to devote as much time to each dog as they deserve.I like to allow three hours for each groom. I’m a one-to-one groomer and I prefer to have in no more than three dogs a day. I assess each dog when they come in and discuss what’s required with the owners. One thing I have learned is that even though some may ask me to “take it all off” that’s not what they actually mean, so I take the time to go through everything they want carefully.It runs like clockwork. I make sure my equipment is to hand, charged and ready to go, so everything is running smoothly. There’s nothing worse than grabbing a piece of equipment and it’s not working when you need it. After each groom is done I clean and sterilise my kit and clean and wipe everything down. What people don’t realise is that although it’s dogs, it’s still important to be hygienic and clean.I have an electronic appointment management and customer record system. People can book their own appointments online or on mobile. Each client’s dog has their own record – from any medication they’re taking, any allergies, their behaviour, whether they can eat treats, to whether they are happy with other dogs. I also note exactly what I’ve done during each groom so I can adjust next time if needed. The dogs have a good time and the owners get exactly what they have asked for.I haven’t encountered a dog that I haven’t been able to groom. Most dogs are easy-going if you provide an environment that is relaxing. I have some dogs that just stretch out and lie down on the table. But I also had one dog that was so stressed she wouldn’t let me trim her nails at first – that’s when you have to be sensitive to the dog and know when to ease off.As a groomer you are constantly aware of the safety and wellbeing of your dogs. I have animal first-aid training, but it’s always good to have insurance there, so if you have to pay any vet bills you are covered. I do have business insurance but I haven’t needed to use it – and hope I never have to. But it’s so nice that insurance is there if I ever need it.I’ve learned that every customer is different and all the dogs are different. If an owner is anxious and doesn’t want to leave their dog on their own, I’m perfectly happy for them to stay. For the dogs, I have all sorts of tricks, like sticky treats they can lick when I’m cutting their nails. There’ll be things to take their mind off anything that they’re anxious about.I’m keen to grow my client base. I’m attracting several new clients a week, but it can take anywhere from two to four years to build to a full client list. I started Waggywoo last December so I’m working hard right now on advertising my business and making people aware I’m here.You have to be sensitive and flexible. When customers come in you have to be able to understand them and their dog – what their preferences and needs really are. That’s been my goal – to build a good relationship with my clients so they get what they ask for.Rebecca Palmer takes care of business. AXA Business Insurance takes care of Waggywoo.

Larralde grabs the bird and, as it struggles, bites off its head, which he then spits out.Daniel Raposo from the BB foundation said the organisation’s lawyers had been instructed to sue. “We must absolutely highlight this because it is serious and punishable by the law,” he said.“It’s always shocking and sickening in 2019 to see people killing animals for amusement. This man might be an example to young people – therefore we cannot let this act rest unpunished,” he added.“Whether it was a boozy evening or not … animals are sensitive beings and there are laws that protect them. What he did is a criminal offence.”Larralde told the Basque news website Mediabask that he did not want to comment on the legal action. However, the website reported that he said he was aware his behaviour was “an error and a bad thing to do”.If convicted of animal cruelty, Larralde could face a fine of up to €30,000 (£28,000). A petition has been launched, calling for him to be excluded from the Basque pelota team of France and dropped by sponsors.The animal rights organisation 30 Million Friends said it would join the BB foundation’s legal action.The dinner took place after a championship match in Hasparren, south-east of Bayonne, won by Larralde’s older brother Peio.

Independent booksellers have disappeared from the city, before reappearing in mainland China facing charges.Under the terms of the agreement by which the former British colony was returned to Chinese control in 1997, the semi-autonomous region was meant to maintain a “high degree of autonomy” through an independent judiciary, a free press and an open market economy, a framework known as “one country, two systems”.The extradition bill was seen as an attempt to undermine this and to give Beijing the ability to try pro-democracy activists under the judicial system of the mainland.Lam has shown no sign of backing down beyond agreeing to suspend the extradition bill, while Beijing has issued increasingly shrill condemnations but has left it to the city\u0027s semi-autonomous government to deal with the situation. Meanwhile police have violently clashed directly with protesters, repeatedly firing teargas and rubber bullets.Beijing has ramped up its accusations that foreign countries are “fanning the fire” of unrest in the city. China’s top diplomat Yang Jiechi has ordered the US to “immediately stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs in any form”.Lily Kuo and Verna Yu in Hong KongHong Kong is a semi-autonomous territory under Chinese sovereignty, meant to maintain a range of freedoms under the terms of a handover agreement between China and the UK. Beijing claims Taiwan, where a rival government was set up in 1949 and has operated independently since, is still part of China.On Monday, as demonstrators filled Hong Kong’s airport, a popular blogger posted images of a 2018 T-shirt made by Coach, listing Hong Kong and Taiwan as countries separate from China, prompting an online campaign to call out other brands for similar behaviour. The hashtag #CoachinsultedChina soon become the top trending topic on the microblog Weibo and other brands were quickly targeted.“Coach respects and supports China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. We are fully aware of the severity of this error and deeply regret it,” Coach later wrote in a statement posted on Weibo.Givenchy said in a statement that it “has always respected China’s sovereignty and firmly adhered to the one-China principle”. It said it would take “immediate precautions” to fix mistakes of “human negligence”. Asics, a Japanese corporation, said it supported “Hong Kong and Taiwan as an inseparable part of China’s territory”.On Sunday, Donatella Versace apologised after an online outcry over one of the label’s T-shirts, which had Hong Kong and Macau, another semi-autonomous region of China, as separate countries.Public figures have been making their positions known on social media. The Chinese model Liu Wen said she would be terminating her relationship with Coach, as did two other Chinese celebrities, the actors Guan Xiaotong and Ren Jialun.“I didn’t choose the brand wisely and this has hurt the feelings of Chinese people. I hereby apologise. I love my country and will protect China’s national sovereignty!” Liu posted on her Weibo account.The party newspaper, People’s Daily, said in an editorial on Monday: “Especially during the ‘sensitive period’ of ‘pro-Hong Kong independence activists’ creating troubles, this kind of mistake is even more serious.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/975263e356f9e9deac9b23a6c6e7597c23b8f47d/61_0_1798_1079/master/1798.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ad6abfeaf8c4b68ef7b6ca5218e97e84","title":"greenland residents traumatised by climate emergency","story":"Islanders are struggling to reconcile impact of global heating with traditional way of life, survey findsLife on thin ice: mental health at the heart of the climate crisisThe climate crisis is causing unprecedented levels of stress and anxiety to people in Greenland who are struggling to reconcile the traumatic impact of global heating with their traditional way of life.Scattered across 17 small towns and approximately 60 villages, all situated on a narrow coastal strip, Greenland’s residents have often been overlooked by data science. The island faces some of the most acute social issues in the world with high levels of alcoholism and historically disproportionate rates of suicide.According to its lead author, Kelton Minor, the survey finally gives Greenland’s most remote and inaccessible communities a voice on the climate crisis.“Therein lies the paradox: while satellites and sensors monitor the surface of Greenland’s ice sheet, chase icebergs and scan sea ice daily, relatively little is known about what the residents of Greenland think about their changing surroundings.”According to the data, detailed in a  investigation carried out across Greenland in the last month, the majority of local residents interviewed believe that the climate emergency will harm its people, sled dogs, plants and animals. The revelation contradicts arguments that local people believe climate breakdown will benefit the Arctic and raises concern over a growing mental health crisis around climate in the polar region.Minor said: “We find that a large majority of the Greenlandic population thinks that local sea ice has become more dangerous to travel on in recent years, suggesting that perceptions of growing risk are widespread for this important social, ecological and economic platform used by residents from all regions. Importantly, we find that residents are more likely to feel negative rather than positive sentiment when thinking about climate change, recent changes in sea ice, as well as glacial changes.”The survey is revealed as the Arctic faces potentially record warming levels. According to the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Colorado, US, Greenland has already lost more than 250bn tonnes from a combination of melt runoff and low total snowfall in July.For mental health professionals who specialise in the polar region, the latest survey findings from Greenland will present another red flag for the Arctic’s vulnerable Inuit communities. According to Courtney Howard, the board president of the Canadian Association of Physicians for the Environment, who lives and works in the Arctic, the intersection between the climate emergency and mental and physical health will become one of the world’s major issues.Howard said: “Temperature change is magnified in circumpolar regions. There is no question Arctic people are now showing symptoms of anxiety, ‘ecological grief’ and even post-traumatic stress related to the effects of climate change.“We are challenging the medical profession to acknowledge the world we are inheriting. Schools and universities aren’t considering how climate change will affect people, from a medical or a psychological perspective, so we are not training a new generation of medical professionals to help people in a fast-changing planet and this is intolerable. We are moving too slowly on this.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a191b587157cd58f144ea51a1fa2a2c6ee65afcb/0_146_3711_2227/master/3711.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=54a056169e48498a561737807aaf5cf4","title":"italian politicians move to scupper salvini election push","story":"Discussions sparked by withdrawal of far-right League party from fractious coalitionPolitical leaders in Italy are meeting on Monday to discuss a no-confidence vote in the government after Matteo Salvini’s far-right League party dramatically withdrew support for its fractious coalition with the anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S) in a push for snap elections.Salvini is eager to capitalise on his popularity and wants the no-confidence vote this week, but factions within M5S and the opposition Democratic party (PD) are attempting to scupper his move knowing the League could seize power.Salvini, who is deputy prime minister and interior minister, has also threatened to withdraw his seven ministers in order to topple an administration that he says is no longer viable.If the heads of the political groups back a no-confidence motion in prime minister Giuseppe Conte’s government, the next step is to set a date for the vote. This could happen by 20 August, with elections needing to be held within 45 to 70 days. If no agreement is reached, the decision would have to go to a full vote in the senate.Luigi Di Maio, the M5S leader, rallied his MPs on Monday morning and reportedly accused Salvini of betraying the government contract for his own interests. Di Maio said on Friday that he favoured a return to the polls, but he now says he first wants parliament to adopt a reform to cut the number of senators and deputies from 951 to 605.Some in his party have been working with counterparts in the rival PD to carve out a caretaker government to pass the 2020 budget. The PD faction is led by the former prime minister Matteo Renzi, who still wields influence within the party but is unpopular with voters. The PD leader, Nicola Zingaretti, has ruled out such a move, saying it would be a “gift to the dangerous right”, while appealing for unity within his party. Beppe Grillo, the founder of M5S, called Renzi a vulture.Salvatore Margiotta, a PD MP, said: “It’s true that there have been talks … but every hour the emotions change.”The decision to dissolve the government and call fresh elections rests with the president, Sergio Mattarella. He could install a technical government, but that option also tends to be unpopular with voters.The three parties joined forces before national elections in March 2018 and compete together at regional level. A coalition between the League and the Brothers of Italy, a party with a neo-fascist lineage, would create a fully far-right government in a major western European nation.“We genuinely rule out that there is any life left in this parliament and we consider elections in October as a baseline scenario,” Policy Sonar, a Rome-based political consultancy, said in a note.Franco Pavoncello, a political science professor and the president of John Cabot University in Rome, said: “There are people who don’t want elections right away, others who want them desperately and others who are sort of neutral. But I think it’s a long way to Tipperary for the elections … the last time Italy held a vote in the autumn was in 1919, just before Benito Mussolini’s victory.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5bf2289c0e802505ae0204ef95b00144217a49e4/0_312_4672_2805/master/4672.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2be5ff122efccd2ee4c74346d44c04d3","title":"russia indicates rocket engine exploded in test of mini nuclear reactor","story":"Test failure symptomatic of wider escalation of US-Russia nuclear tensions, expert saysRussian scientists have indicated that they were working on miniaturised sources of nuclear energy when a rocket engine exploded last week, increasing scrutiny of the possibility that the accident occurred while testing an experimental cruise missile powered by a small reactor.The explosion last Thursday at a military testing ground in Russia’s Arkhangelsk region killed at least five people and caused radiation readings in neighbouring cities to spike to 20 times their normal level for half an hour.Russia’s defence ministry said the explosion had taken place during testing of a rocket engine, but the country’s nuclear agency, Rosatom, later confirmed that several of its employees had been killed during testing of an “isotope power source in a liquid propulsion system”.David Cullen, the director of the Nuclear Information Service in the UK, said on Monday that the view among independent experts was that the explosion appeared to have been caused by the failure of an experimental nuclear-powered cruise missile known in Russia as the 9M730 Burevestnik and by Nato as the SSC-X-9 Skyfall.The Burevestnik (Storm Petrel) experimental cruise missile – called Skyfall by Nato – is an ambitious nuclear-powered cruise missile in development by Russia\u0027s armed forces.The concept builds on an idea originally examined by the US in the late 1950s: a nuclear-powered missile able to fly vast distances powered by an on-board reactor, tracing a complex flight path to outflank enemy defences.Essentially the idea has been to develop a missile with effectively no limitation of conventional fuel range, which could fly around the globe multiple times or trace a flight path – for instance – over the Pacific and through South America to target the US via Mexican airspace, making conventional anti-missile defences, as they are currently deployed, redundant.The US air defence network is configured on the assumption any air attack would come from the north, west, or east, but not the south. By comparison the US Tomahawk cruise missile has a range of 1500 miles.Dismissed by the US decades ago because of the dangers and technical problems involved, the missile has been pursued by Russia in the last few years along with other vehicles designed to outfox conventional defences\u0026nbsp including high-speed underwater drones and hypersonic glide vehicles.According to what little is known about the project, the missile is designed to be launched using a traditional jet propulsion motor before the nuclear power plant takes over in the air.While it would be a formidable weapon if successfully deployed, leapfrogging US missile capabilities, doubts remain among researchers as to whether its core technology is viable. Peter BeaumontAnnounced by the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, in 2018, the missile is theoretically able to use an onboard source of nuclear fuel to heat fast-moving air and fly for indefinite periods. Moscow has touted the missile’s unlimited range and potential ability to penetrate US missile defences, but doubts remain among researchers as to whether its core technology is viable.Experts in Russia’s nuclear programme have also spotted the nuclear fuel carrier ship Serebryanka near the site of last week’s explosion, where it is believed to have been taking part in a recovery effort. The vessel had previously been spotted in the waters near Novaya Zemlya, where Russia reportedly tested the Burevestnik missile in 2017. “Our suspicion is that something went wrong during or after a Russian test of its nuclear-powered cruise missile,” wrote Jeffrey Lewis, a US arms control specialist with the Middlebury Institute of International Studies. Russia was believed to have moved Burevestnik testing to the current Nenoksa site earlier this year.Vyacheslav Solovyov, the centre’s scientific director, said similar work on “small-scale nuclear reactors” is also taking place in the US. He did not say how much fissile material had been involved in the accident, or what role it may have played in the explosion.“We are now trying to understand, we are working closely with a government commission, analysing the entire chain of events to assess the scale of the accident and to understand its causes,” Solovyov said.The slow release of information has heightened concerns that a major incident took place offshore from the Nenoksa missile testing site. Residents of Severodvinsk and other northern cities had reportedly stocked up on iodine, which reduces the effects of exposure to radiation. Russia has also closed a bay in the White Sea near where the accident took place for a month, indicating possible contamination or a continuing search operation.The development of an experimental weapon such as the Burevestnik would also help to explain the secrecy around the incident, despite public concerns over radiation levels.The US tried and failed to develop ground-hugging nuclear-powered cruise missile technology during the cold war, and questions remain as to whether the Burevestnik has a meaningful purpose, given the existence of high flying intercontinental ballistic missiles as an alternative.Such experimental long-range cruise missiles would not have been covered by the intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty between the US and Russia that lapsed last month, because it only banned land-based cruise missiles with a range of between 500 and 5,500km (300 and 3,400 miles).Cullen said, however, that the test failure was “symptomatic of a wider escalation in nuclear tensions stemming from a gradual breakdown in US-Russia relations” partly because “Russia is trying to rectify what it believes is a strategic disadvantage it has against the US by developing non-conventional capabilities”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70e99c6e14e3b2610f8be74473e9efedd29ef1f1/611_391_2670_1602/master/2670.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2116e466117cb368c2673159262534aa","title":"venezuela activist calls on uk to back icc referral over human rights maduro","story":"Tamara Sujú visits London to seek support for six countries pressing for investigationThe UK foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, has been urged to draw on his experience as a former Foreign Office human rights lawyer to press the legal case that the Venezuelan government of Nicolás Maduro has systematically tortured its people.The call was led by the prominent Venezuela human rights defender Tamara Sujú who visited London to persuade the UK to join six non-European countries in pressuring the international criminal court (ICC) to pursue a case against the Venezuelan leadership.Raab worked as a lawyer for the FCO, including at the ICC in The Hague, from 2000 to 2006.In theory the case could end with Maduro arraigned in front of the court, but progress with the ICC case has the potential to play into the various indirect talks currently under way between supporters of Maduro – who succeeded the leftwing Hugo Chavez as Venezuela’s president – and Juan Guaidó, the self-proclaimed interim leader recognised by most EU countries and backed by the US.British backing for the ICC investigation would be a further blow for Maduro. The ICC referral was initially backed by Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Paraguay, Peru and Canada at the end of last year, becoming the first state referral to the ICC by other states.The ICC launched a preliminary investigation in September 2018.Sujú, executive director of the Casla Institute and a Guaidó supporter, said: “We need a European country, preferably Britain, with sufficiently solid institutions, a democratic tradition and commitment to human rights to join us in the ICC not just with words but to subscribe formally to the case.“We also need Great Britain to impose personal and economic sanctions against the Maduro regime and to close their spaces.”The Trump administration tightened economic sanctions against Maduro again this week. Sujú has compiled more than 600 detailed cases of alleged human rights abuses. Her critics say she is part of an army of Maduro opponents who use human rights to denounce the leftwing government.An ICC case has four initial stages, including a case to answer, identification of the victims, assessment of whether the crimes are eligible as crimes against humanity and whether the government has sought to prosecute the cases.Sujú’s chief claim is that the arrests of demonstrators and, increasingly, of figures in the military, are systematically directed by the Maduro government, indicating the leadership would have to face justice at the ICC.Nicolás Maduro\u0026nbsphas ruled\u0026nbspVenezuela\u0026nbspwithout two of the greatest assets possessed by his mentor and predecessor, Hugo Chávez. He has not been lucky. And he has no charisma.Chávez enjoyed an oil bounty and sublime political talents that secured his power at home and reputation abroad.Maduro, in contrast, inherited a wobbling economy addicted to high oil prices and a system of authoritarian populism dependent on showmanship and patronage. Oil prices tumbled and Maduro proved to be a fumbling showman, exposing the financial ineptitude and ideological hollowness of the “Bolivarian revolution”.This could have doomed his presidency, which began in 2013 after\u0026nbspChávez\u0026nbspdied, but the former bus driver, a hulking bear of a man who rose up trade union ranks, turned out to be tenacious and ruthless.Born into a working class family in Caracas in 1962, he left school without graduating and drove buses for the Caracas metro. He became a union organiser and early supporter of Chávez, who, after leading a failed coup, led a leftwing coalition to an electoral landslide in 1998.Maduro was the speaker of the assembly before serving as Chávez’s foreign minister from 2006 to 2013, a visible if largely silent presence as the comandante held court on the world stage. Chávez anointed Maduro as his heir before succumbing to cancer.The story of his rule – and\u0026nbspVenezuela’s agony\u0026nbsp– is a determination to keep power amid economic collapse, humanitarian disaster and international condemnation.\u0026nbspSince January 2019 his presidency has been disputed, with Juan Guaidó being sworn in as interim president, and recognised as Venezuela’s ruler by some international powers.Crisis after crisis has buffeted his government – hyperinflation, food and medicine shortages, power blackouts, mass protests,\u0026nbspdrone attacks, defections, US-led sanctions – and Maduro has remained standing, resolute, implacable.It is a remarkable position for a man who, in a 2014  interview,\u0026nbspdescribed himself as a bit of a hippy\u0026nbspand a fan of Led Zeppelin and John Lennon.“I never aspired to be president,” he said. “I always honour something that commander Chávez told us: that while we were in these posts we must be clothed in humility and understand that we are here to protect the man and woman of the streets.”“There are not random accidents of violence,” she said. “What has stood out is that they group masses of protesters 40 or 50 at the time, take them to the station and torture them as a group. We have cases where families were taken. They made the father watch as his child was tortured and then the child would watch his father be tortured. They tortured a mother and daughter, took off their clothes off before they applied electricity.”She highlighted the death of the military captain Rafael Acosta Arévalo, who was arrested on 26 June and died three days later. At his military tribunal he was unable to stand, hear or understand what was happening and pleaded with his lawyer for help.The UN high commissioner for human rights, Michelle Bachelet, has visited Venezuela to find political prisoners are tortured, including with electrical currents, simulated drowning, beatings and sexual violence, and is setting up a permanent mission."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e5d6917fc1e6aeefd46bc6c7db22c8f88397775/0_313_4695_2817/master/4695.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ee7f9fa154925b2b0df1489fb9e9f3a1","title":"small is beautiful in tokyo golden gai in pictures","story":"Nearly 300 bars and restaurants are squeezed into an area about the size of half a football pitch in the Golden Gai area of Tokyo.

Photograph: Cyril ByrneBear in mind that this is not an exact science.\u0026nbspPoints for all programmes increase and decrease annually as the demand among applicants and the number of places offered by each college changes from year to year.For most applicants, success or otherwise in being offered a specific course will be decided when the admission officers representing all the colleges meet in the CAO offices in Galway.They will know exactly how many places on each course are already accounted for through other entry routes (outlined below) and how many places they can now offer to the main body of applicants.Once the CAO knows the number of places for every course on offer, it enters that data into its computer system to determine what offers will be made to you online at 2pm on Thursday, August 15th.Until then, neither CAO officials nor college admissions officers know the points required to secure the last available places on offer in this round. These will be published in table-form in The  on Friday, August 16th, in the First Round Offers education supplement.If there are more applicants with the same points than there are remaining places on offer, the CAO computer will generate a random number for each of these applicants those holding the highest numbers numerically will be offered the available places. When this occurs, an asterisk (*) appears beside the printed points score in the published charts.At 2pm on Thursday, the CAO will place all offers live on cao.ie. Each applicant has an inidual CAO application number enabling them to access their own CAO file. You will have a week to accept a place. Students must print off a receipt of their acceptance before ending their online session with CAO.If you wish to defer an offer of a place, you do not accept your offer. Instead, you must email or write to the admissions office of the appropriate college immediately. You must give your name as it appears on your CAO application, quote your CAO application number and the course code of the offer you wish to defer, and set out the reason(s) for the request.Applicants must mark “DEFERRED ENTRY” clearly on the envelope or in the subject line of the email. You can also check the website of the relevant college to see if they have a deferral policy available online that you can refer to.The letter or email must arrive in the admissions office of the institution at least two days before the reply date shown on the offer notice.The college will communicate their decision to you directly. If the deferral is not granted, you may then accept the offer for the current year, providing you accept the offer by the reply date. You must send all communications about deferrals to the appropriate admissions office and not to CAO.Taking up a deferralTo take up a deferred place you must:1. Re-apply through CAO in the succeeding year and pay the appropriate application fee. You must complete the application form in full and follow all of the instructions carefully.2. Place the deferred course as your first and only preference on the application form. Indicate your deferral by ticking the Deferred Applicant indicator box in the Course Choices section on your application.It is important to read the letter granting you the deferred place for further instructions. You will breach the conditions of your deferred place if you enter more than the single deferred course code on your application.In that event, you will forfeit the guaranteed place and enter the competition for places in the normal way. When reapplying in the succeeding year, you must complete an application fully. In other words, you must include again any personal information and documentation you provided with the original application (unless instructed otherwise by the institution offering the place).If I am offered one of my higher choices on my course list?If you choose to accept the new offer, any registration fees you paid to the first college will simply be transferred to the second one.Vacant places offered to all potential applicants?What if you change your mind and want a place on a course you have not applied for? This can only happen if vacancies for the course are advertised on cao.ie. This happens if the original list of qualified applicants to the CAO is exhausted, or if a college has offered a new course since July 1st. Always check you meet the minimum entry requirements before you place any course with vacant places on your existing list of choices.Result appeals and college offersThe State Examinations Commission will automatically notify the CAO in mid-September in the event of a successful appeal of any of your results.You will then be contacted regarding any new offer for a course that this upgrade may entitle you to.This year, upgrades happen one week after courses start, to ensure students can start their course immediately and will not have to wait another year as they had to do previously.If you want to accept a new place but do not want to start this year, you can accept the place as a deferred entry for next year.For deferred-entry students, the most important point to remember is that they must apply to the CAO again by February 1st, 2020.They should place the deferred course as their only choice on the application form in 2020, in order to take up the original place offer.Some places on the courses you are interested in may have already been allocated. In the past six weeks, the CAO offered places and received acceptances from more than 8,000 of this year’s CAO applicants. These include mature applicants (aged over 23), those who deferred a place in 2018 and reapplied for it this year, and those who sought a place on the basis of a QQI award through a PLC programme taken during the past academic year.Those with awards other than the Irish Leaving Cert, mainly school-leavers who have taken Northern Ireland or UK-based A-levels, and other EU end-of-school exams will also have been offered places.Colleges now also offer a growing number of places to applicants from outside the EU at full fees to generate additional funding for courses.Hear and DareSome students will receive an offer of a college place on lower points than those published on Thursday. This is because the CAO has been instructed to offer a place by a specific college based on a successful Disability Access Route to Education (Dare) or Higher Education Access Route (Hear) application, or on the basis of a scholarship programme, often in a designated sport."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3979700.1565192538!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"leaving cert 2019 all you need to know","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tStudent Alex Burke, centre,  with his former classmates after receiving their Leaving Cert exam results at Christian Brothers College, Cork, last year. Phtotograph: Daragh Mc SweeneyProvisionHow and where do I get my results?There are two ways to get your Leaving Cert results. You can collect them in person from your school from 9am on August 13th or you can access them online from 10am that day.There is merit in calling to the school to collect the results as teachers and guidance counsellors will be on hand to talk to and advise students who may not have done as well as anticipated. It’s also a chance to share in the excitement with your friends.If you are not collecting the results in person, you can do so instead through the Candidate Self-Service Portal on examinations.ie. The results will also be on the SEC’s website from 10am.How do I appeal a result?If you feel a specific grade in one or more subjects falls below your expectations, you will have the opportunity to apply to view that script on the new Leaving Cert sSelf-sService pPortal.The application to appeal results through the Candidate Self Service Portal will be available from 5pm on Friday 16th August, closing at 5pm on Thursday 22nd August. The SEC will then make the appealed scripts available to examiners for remarking.Students must have registered with the portal. Not only are these services being provided earlier than in previous years but the time window for accessing these services is narrow. Students will not have much time to decide whether they want to view their scripts or to appeal the results.The viewing of scripts in schools takes place at the earlier time this year of Tuesday 20th and Wednesday 21st August. The application to view scripts will be available through the Candidate Self Service Portal from 9am on Wednesday 14th August and this service closes at 5pm on Friday 16th August.\u0026nbspOnline viewing of scripts will be available from 5pm on Tuesday 20th August until 5pm on Wednesday 21st August.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspCandidates who notice any issues with their online marked scripts during the viewing are\u0026nbsp advised to contact the SEC’s Online Marking Team.\u0026nbspHow do I register with the portal?Students will have received a letter in June containing their exam number and a PIN. This letter was accompanied by an information leaflet containing information about the guide to the simple registration process.Registration requires the student to use their Leaving Cert exam number and PIN in the initial step. They will then be asked to provide an email address and a mobile phone number. They will need to create a password and the final step is to activate the account by replying to a link that will be sent by email.Students will then log in to the portal using their account details (exam number and password) to access all the services which will become available, commencing with the results.What if I did not receive my PIN letter from my school?If you did not receive the PIN letter from your school, ask the school authority to provide this to you as you need this information to complete the registration process. If you are an external candidate, The SEC should have posted this to your contact address.What do I do if I have not already registered – can I do this now?If you haven’t registered, now is the time to do so. If you wait beyond this morning to complete the registration process, they run the risk of missing the deadlines for applying for services.* For more information read the Candidate Information Booklet 2019 or visit: examinations.ie.\u0026nbspHow do I calculate my CAO points?You count the best six scores you’ve achieved across all subjects.If you did the LCVP and your score for the module is better than your lowest of the six scores, you can include the LCVP instead. If you got at least a H6\u0026nbspin higher-level maths, remember to add 25 to the normal points score attached to the grade you achieved.There are some slight variations in how points are calculated by some third-level colleges, and all such variations are clearly outlined in the CAO handbook. If you cannot find your copy, it is online at cao.ie.How do I view my exam scripts?You must personally view the script: you cannot send someone to view it on your behalf, although you may be accompanied by a parent or teacher or someone else you nominate.Several subjects which were marked online in 2019 will be viewed online through the Self-Service Portal. They are maths, biology, physics, chemistry, LCVP (written component) and politics and society. Viewing (online and in schools) is taking place 10 days earlier this year.There is no charge for viewing a script and no limit to the number of scripts you can view.As you will be able to see the exact percentage you got once you view your script, you should view every script if you’re looking for another five or 10 points for a place on your preferred course.Should I bother to view a script if I’m happy with the grade I received?If you need more points for your first-preference course, it is always worth viewing the script.Each grade, such as H1, H2 or H3, represents a 10 per cent band. The SEC sends out scripts to be remarked by teachers in a week’s time – about 20 per cent of such papers are upgraded annually .One could therefore assume those candidates who are within 1 per cent of the next grade up stand a higher chance of receiving an upgrade than those who are 9 per cent short.By viewing all your scripts, you will know in which subject you are closest to the next grade. It may not necessarily be the subject in which you are disappointed with the result.What if I discover an error in calculating my score?Candidates can seek to have clear discrepancies between the mark awarded and the grade awarded rectified outside of the appeals process.In the event that you discover a discrepancy between the mark awarded and grade awarded \u0026nbspyou should ask the organising Superintendent for a Rectification Outside the Appeals Process Form (ROAP form)\u0026nbspand complete it in accordance with instructions.The ROAP only applies in specific circumstances of an error in transcribing the overall mark from the front of the answer book to the marking sheet\u0026nbspor an error in keying the mark from the mark sheet onto the SEC examinations database. \u0026nbspOther issues\u0026nbspwill require the expert judgment of an examiner through the formal appeals process and cannot be resolved through this administrative facility.In the event that you discover a discrepancy between the mark awarded and grade awarded in a script that was marked online you should contact the Online Marking Team in the SEC at onlinemarkingqueries@examinations.ie or (090) 644 276824602869.Note, the SEC says it strongly recommends that candidates applying for the ROAP process also apply to appeal their result. \u0026nbspIf the case for rectification is upheld the appeal fee will be refunded. But, if the case for rectification is not upheld and the candidate has not applied for an appeal they will not have any further opportunity for review of their result as they will have missed the appeal application deadline of 5pm on Thursday 22nd August.What if I think I should have received a higher mark?Finally, if on viewing your script there are no obvious errors in the correcting teacher’s work but in your view (or that of your subject teacher) you should have received a higher mark for the paper in question, you can apply to have your paper re-marked through the Candidate Self-Service Portal. There is a fee of €40 for this work but if the paper is upgraded, this will be refunded.The results of appeals are published in mid-September and if you are one of the 20 per cent who appeal each year and are upgraded, the revised Leaving Cert result will be sent to the CAO and it will make you a revised offer if appropriate.If you are already studying for another course, you will not suffer any adverse college-related financial costs becse of transferring to another programme at that stage.When do the CAO offers come out?The CAO will release round one offers at 2pm on Thursday. They will be available at cao.ie.Each applicant has an inidual CAO application number enabling them to access their own CAO file. You will have a week to accept a place. Students must print off a receipt of their acceptance before ending their online session with CAO.Will points for my CAO course rise or fall?It is impossible to say for certain until the results are released at 2pm on Thursday next.But latest course preference data for the categories of courses gives a broad indication of where demand is up and down this year.This, in turn, influences whether points requirements are likely to rise, fall or stay the same.The CAO gathers inidual courses into a total of 26 broad categories - such as arts , education and languages - and provides data on whether demand is up or down in these areas. We’ve outlined some of the trends below.One important caveat to note: while demand is a strong indicator of whether points will rise or fall, there may be other unseen factors at play.Whether colleges allocate more or fewer places on inidual courses will influence the direction of points requirements so, too, will decisions on how many places they set aside for mature students and others.And remember: the categories used by the CAO above are broad and represent the average per centage changes in first-preferences across sectors, rather than inidual courses. In the meantime, here’s what we know from the latest data:So, in what categories of CAO courses is demand up?At level eight ( honours degree), the biggest surge in demand is in the area of transport (+ 39 per cent), followed by humanities - excluding languages (+ 38 per cent), environment (+ 25 per cent) and languages (+ 25 per cent).These courses are the most likely to see an increased in points (though this is not guaranteed as you’ll see if you read on).Other areas where there has been a significant, but more modest, increase in first preferences include:Agriculture (+18 per cent), engineering and engineering trades (+12 per cent), interdisciplinary programmes in natural sciences, maths and statistics (+11 per cent), maths and statistics (+10 per cent), social and behavioural sciences (+9 per cent).And in what categories is demand down?Among level eight courses the sharpest decrease in overall demand has been recorded in the category of journalism and information (-54 per cent), followed by interdisciplinary programmes and qualifications involving arts and humanities (-42 per cent).There was also a significant decrease in interdisciplinary programmes and qualifications involving agriculture, forestry and veterinary (-17 per cent).Smaller decreases were recorded in personal services (-6 per cent), veterinary (-5 per cent), arts, business (-4 per cent), health, hygiene and occupational health (-2 per cent).There is little or no change in overall demand for other areas including: biological and related sciences (+6 per cent),education, law, ICT, welfare (+2 per cent), architecture and construction (+1 per cent). There has been no change in science.What are the trends in demand for level six and seven courses this year?The patterns in demand for first preferance courses are different for level six and seven courses (higher certificate and ordinary degrees) compared to leel eight.For example, the biggest increases were for education (+71 per cent), humanities except languages (+64 per cent).By contrast, the greatest decrease in demand were in areas such as social and behavioural sciences (-39 per cent) and transport services (-22 per cent).What do I do if I want to defer a place?If you wish to defer an offer of a place, you do not accept your offer. Instead, you must email or write to the admissions office of the appropriate college immediately. You must give your name as it appears on your CAO application, quote your CAO application number and the course code of the offer you wish to defer, and set out the reason(s) for the request.Applicants must mark “DEFERRED ENTRY” clearly on the envelope or in the subject line of the email.

If the deferral is not granted, you may then accept the offer for the current year, providing you accept the offer by the reply date. You must send all communications about deferrals to the appropriate admissions office and not to CAO.How do I take up a deferred place next year?1. Re-apply through CAO in the succeeding year and pay the appropriate application fee. You must complete the application form in full and follow all of the instructions carefully.2. Place the deferred course as your first and only preference on the application form. Indicate your deferral by ticking the Deferred Applicant indicator box in the Course Choices section on your application.It is important to read the letter granting you the deferred place for further instructions.

Photograph: Sara Freund There are three guarantees in life: death, taxes and the inevitability that some students will be upset or confused about their Leaving Cert results. We can’t help you with the first two, sorry. But, from August 13th, The  free online exam helpdesk is here to answer questions from parents and teens about the implications that the 2019 Leaving Cert results might have for them.The helpdesk will be manned by Deirdre Garrett and Brian Howard, who are both members of the Institute of Guidance Counsellors. Garrett is a guidance counsellor at St Paul’s Secondary School in Monasterevin while Howard is a guidance counsellor at Newbridge College.Our guidance counsellors aim to respond to all your online queries within half an hour but, particularly on results day itself, the huge volume of queries means it can take longer before they get back to everyone. Due to changes in how the exam results are being delivered this year, there may be fewer guidance counsellors in some schools – and students and parents may be more likely than ever to contact The  helpdesk.“We’ve never had a question we don’t have the answer to, but if we didn’t know, we find out,” says Garrett. “Our key advice: stay calm, research your options and if you feel you don’t know what your options are, get on to the helpdesk.”What sort of questions does the helpdesk receive, and how do they answer them?Queries tend to be similar from one year to the next but, with the introduction this year of an online portal where students will be able to access their results online from as early as 10am, Howard anticipates a larger-than-usual volume of calls about the new system.Last year, a student missed out on a place on a veterinary medicine course in UCD as a result of examiners incorrectly totting up her points. She took a High Court case and won, prompting the State Examinations Commission to undertake a reform of the system so that other students wouldn’t go through the same ordeal.“As a result, there’s a new student support portal and every student has been given a PIN number and encouraged to register with this,” says Howard. “From 10am, they can go online and get their results. This will probably mean that fewer students go to their school to collect the results. The possible downside is that students don’t have immediate access to the school’s principal and guidance counsellors if they go online, but the upside is that, this year, they will get the results and CAO offers much faster, and the appeals process will be sped up too. They will only have to wait two days between results and CAO offers. Students will also get a breakdown of how they did in the different parts of the exams, including orals and practicals, and be allocated a time to go back to the school and view their scripts.”This year, scripts for some exams were scanned and marked online, and students will be able to view these through the portal.When the CAO first moved online, it was dogged by crashes, and there’s a possibility the volume of students logging on could cause delays.What if students have lost their log-in details for the new portal? “They will have to go back to where they sat the exam,” says Howard.2. Confusion over Hear and Dare offers3. Why didn’t I get a place? Minimum entry requirementsIf a student was exempt from Leaving Cert Irish and got the required CAO points for their chosen course in a NUI college but hadn’t applied for the exemption or let the college know, then they will be considered as not having met the minimum entry requirements. The same could apply if they don’t have a European language when applying to another university.Hope is not lost, however: they could still get in on round two.“Sometimes parents contact the helpdesk because they’re not sure of how to add up the points, especially for the Leaving Cert Vocational Programme,” says Howard. “For the LCVP, you add up the points for the six best subjects and, if the points for the LCVP are among your six best, leave them in – if not, take them out and replace them with the points for your next highest grade.”There’s a big misconception about bonus points for honours maths. “You only get 25 bonus points if maths is one of your six best subjects,” Howard says.The exam helpdesk receives a lot of queries about the dates for viewing scripts and when rechecks will be completed. Students will have received an exam handbook with all the information needed, and it can also be downloaded as a PDF from Examinations.ie – The  helpdesk can provide information too.Students only need to wait two days for their offer this year, but there’s very understandable anxiety for those who aren’t confident of getting the course they hoped for. And when the offers do come out, some will be disappointed.The  guidance counsellors will be on hand to talk students through their options, which include the pros and cons of repeating details of PLCs and how they can be a route into a college course apprenticeships and training studying abroad and the value of other options, including a year out.The helpdesk receives queries from students who applied for medicine and want to know if they are in with a chance of an offer.7. Have points but not minimum entry requirementsA student could get 550 points and still miss out on a course that only requires 500 points. “This could happen if, for instance, they applied for primary school teaching but didn’t get a H4 in Irish,” Garrett explains. “We advise that they have the option of only repeating Irish they could study in their own time while doing a PLC course or working.”"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed really goes recycling rubbish behind scenes","story":"The chaos of Britain’s recycling system is exposed today with hundreds of thousands of tons of waste being redirected to landfill or incinerators.Despite residents sorting their household waste into separate bins, up to half of “recyclable” material is not being recycled in some areas of England, government data shows.It comes as an undercover investigation by The  and Unearthed reveals staff at a recycling centre in London are sending recyclable plastic and paper to be incinerated.Today, The  launches a Zero Waste campaign calling on the Government, local councils and private companies to do more to boost the country’s lacklustre recycling rates.It is backed by Boris Johnson...To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Russian nuclear body says deadly blast was caused by nuclear power project, not powerful new missileArchaeologists in Pompeii find amulets and charms that may have been used by Roman sorcererBeef banned by university in bid to fight climate changeGhislaine Maxwell told friends she planned to \u0026#39disappear\u0026#39 as Jeffrey Epstein case \u0026#39raised its ugly head\u0026#39Bladder cancer survival rates drop after shortage of crucial drugCauliflower off the menu after hot July kills cropMore than half of pensioners shopping online for the first timeComment: Caroline Lucas\u0026#39s all-female Cabinet shows how desperate Remainers have become but at least it\u0026#39s provided light reliefComment: There\u0026#39s nothing regressive about promoting tough justice Boris Johnson accuses Jeremy Corbyn of wanting to \u0026#39cancel the referendum and argue about Brexit for years\u0026#39Comment: What\u0026#39s wrong with being a pointy-elbowed middle-class parent?

Older shoppers have become more savvy but they still have concerns over the security of online shopping. Click and collect often means they don’t need to pay online.”More than half of those aged over 65 are now purchasing goods onlineThe proportion of over-65s buying groceries online increased from 7 per cent in 2015 to 12 per cent this year, while other popular online purchases among this group were holidays and event tickets.Age UK, a charity, said that changing demographics were also playing a role in the rise, as more and more older people will feel comfortable using the internet having had experience of being online in the workplace.The decline of the high street could also be pushing older people online. Research from the British Retail Consortium, a trade body, showed that the number of vacant shops in town centres is at its highest in four years.Clothes and sports goods were the most popular purchases among those over 65Chief executive Helen Dickinson said: “With more than four in every five pounds still being spent in physical stores, our high streets remain important locations for both shopping and community activities. “Successful stores are integrating their online and offline offerings in order to provide the best experience for their customers.”Independent Age, another charity, said it was important that high streets are kept accessible for older people as around a quarter had not used the internet at all in the past three months. Phil Mawhinney, from the charity, said: “We need to ensure that people can still access high-street shops, supermarkets and banks in a way that suits them, so that they aren’t excluded from life’s essentials.”Russian nuclear body says deadly blast was caused by nuclear power project, not powerful new missileArchaeologists in Pompeii find amulets and charms that may have been used by Roman sorcererBeef banned by university in bid to fight climate changeGhislaine Maxwell told friends she planned to \u0026#39disappear\u0026#39 as Jeffrey Epstein case \u0026#39raised its ugly head\u0026#39Bladder cancer survival rates drop after shortage of crucial drugCauliflower off the menu after hot July kills cropComment: Caroline Lucas\u0026#39s all-female Cabinet shows how desperate Remainers have become but at least it\u0026#39s provided light reliefComment: There\u0026#39s nothing regressive about promoting tough justice Boris Johnson accuses Jeremy Corbyn of wanting to \u0026#39cancel the referendum and argue about Brexit for years\u0026#39Comment: What\u0026#39s wrong with being a pointy-elbowed middle-class parent?

Despite not publishing any new work since 1965, Salinger was known to have continued writing until his death in 2010 at the age of 91.  Announcing the digital publication of his father\u0027s work, Mr Salinger also revealed he hopes to release a lot of that work within the next five to seven years. Mr Salinger disputed claims made in a 2013 documentary that four unpublished novels would be made available between 2015 and 2020. But he added: “I wanted people to know that, yes, he did keep writing, there’s a lot of material, and yes, it will be published.”Russian nuclear body says deadly blast was caused by nuclear power project, not powerful new missileArchaeologists in Pompeii find amulets and charms that may have been used by Roman sorcererBeef banned by university in bid to fight climate changeGhislaine Maxwell told friends she planned to \u0026#39disappear\u0026#39 as Jeffrey Epstein case \u0026#39raised its ugly head\u0026#39Bladder cancer survival rates drop after shortage of crucial drugCauliflower off the menu after hot July kills cropMore than half of pensioners shopping online for the first timeComment: Caroline Lucas\u0026#39s all-female Cabinet shows how desperate Remainers have become but at least it\u0026#39s provided light reliefComment: There\u0026#39s nothing regressive about promoting tough justice Boris Johnson accuses Jeremy Corbyn of wanting to \u0026#39cancel the referendum and argue about Brexit for years\u0026#39Comment: What\u0026#39s wrong with being a pointy-elbowed middle-class parent?

We’re no longer free to leave our homes, Filippo Cioffi, a residents’ representative, local said.“We’re living in fear, worried that we are going to be attacked. In the past we had cases of female boar being aggressive towards dogs in order to defend their young, but now they are aggressive towards people as well.”Earlier this month, a young father pushing his 20-month-old in a pushchair said he was followed and felt threatened by a small herd of wild boar in the area.“Since 2017 the situation has got much worse and we’ve had no response from the council to our requests for intervention,” said Mr Cioffi.As the boar proliferate, Rome may have inadvertently come up with a partial solution to the problem – wolves are on the increase too and are increasingly encroaching on the periphery of the city.Two years ago, it was revealed that a pack of wolves is living just outside Rome, in a nature reserve outside the motorway that encircles the city.It is now reported that wolves are present in other areas close to the city. The problem is, they appear to have more of a taste for sheep and goats more than they do for wild boar.“The she-wolf is the symbol of Rome, but for a little while now farmers around Rome have not been sleeping well at night,” said Vincenzino Rota, from the farmers’ association Confagricoltura.Wolves are starting to encroach on farms around Rome, experts sayHe said wolves have been spotted along the Appian Way, an ancient Roman road that still leads out of the city, as well as in the Castelli Romani, a range of volcanic lakes and hills just to the east of the capital.“The situation is unsustainable,” said Mr Rota, who added that many of the wolves preying on livestock appeared to be dangerous wolf-dog hybrids. They are considered to have less fear of humans because of the canine element in their genetic makeup.The increasing presence of wolves was “very dangerous for people too,” said Massimiliano Giansanti, the national president of Confagricoltura.The latest attack, in which two sheep were killed, happened in a farm “which lies just 10 kilometres from the Campidoglio (Rome’s Renaissance-era town hall) as the crow flies.”The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

The data suggested trading was “consistent with material illegal activity”.An FCA spokesperson responded: “The FCA has been aware of these matters since the first tweet and price movements on Tuesday of last week and at that point we began undertaking wide-ranging enquiries. We will continue to make enquiries using the wide range of data and resources at our disposal.”Burford said it detected signs of spoofing and layering – illegal methods of driving down share prices, which have resulted in convictions previously.For example, trading data showed that there was “an unusual flood” of order cancellations beginning shortly before Muddy Waters’ original tweet. Burford also said: “While Muddy Waters was suggesting that Burford was insolvent, it was at the same time buying Burford shares.”In its report, Muddy Waters labelled Burford a “poor business masquerading as a great one”.

The data suggested trading was “consistent with material illegal activity”.An FCA spokesperson responded: “The FCA has been aware of these matters since the first tweet and price movements on Tuesday of last week and at that point we began undertaking wide-ranging enquiries. We will continue to make enquiries using the wide range of data and resources at our disposal.”Burford said it detected signs of spoofing and layering – illegal methods of driving down share prices, which have resulted in convictions previously.For example, trading data showed that there was “an unusual flood” of order cancellations beginning shortly before Muddy Waters’ original tweet. Burford also said: “While Muddy Waters was suggesting that Burford was insolvent, it was at the same time buying Burford shares.”In its report, Muddy Waters labelled Burford a “poor business masquerading as a great one”. Burford’s shares plunged by 65 per cent over the course of 6 and 7 August, with almost £2bn wiped off the firm’s value.The following day, Burford hit back against the report, accusing Muddy Waters of peddling “factual inaccuracies” and “fallacious insinuations”.Christopher Bogart, chief executive of Burford, said the company’s “market-leading” business is the same as it was a week ago.He said: “What has changed is that a substantial amount of market value was wiped out by activity we believe is consistent with illegal market manipulation that has nothing to do with Burford’s business.

We need an immediate freeze in rates, as well as fixing the transitional relief, which leads to corner shops in Redcar subsidising banks in central London.”Last month was also the worst July on record for year-on-year growth in total retail sales.Figures from the BRC-KPMG retail sales monitor published earlier this month showed sales edged up by just 0.3 per cent\u0026nbspyear on year in July, compared with an increase of 1.6 per cent\u0026nbspin July 2018.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Policymakers have looked for an explanation in the so-called supply side of the economy – the ways in which goods are made and services delivered – and pointed to declining technological innovation and cheap loans keeping unproductive “zombie” firms afloat, among other possible reasons.\u0026nbspBut the New Economics Foundation says its research shows that the government must also look at the demand side – the level and nature of spending across the country.\u0026nbsp“Average productivity, wages and living standards have experienced their worst decade in almost two centuries. It is increasingly clear that weak demand has been the overlooked problem,” said Alfie Stirling, head of economics at the think tank.\u0026nbsp“Raising demand by putting more cash in the pockets of the UK’s poorest workers, while giving people more paid time off from work to spend it, should now be part of a radical mix of options for any government that is serious about increasing productivity in a way that works for people and society.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Britain’s Jamie Chadwick wins first-ever W Series title.

Instead, companies rely on cheaper labour that can be shed quickly if demand doesn’t improve. As a result, productivity does not improve.The New Economics Foundation finds evidence of exactly this in official data.\u0026nbspIt says that since 2012, firms have increasingly preferred to hire rather than to invest and that, relative to all employees, the proportion of zero-hour and self-employed workers, as well as one-person “micro-companies”, has grown by two fifths since before the financial crisis. The corresponding lack of investment now explains at least a quarter of the UK’s gap in productivity with the historical trend.A report by the New Economics Foundation sets out a number of measures to lift demand, including gradual increases in statutory paid holiday and faster rises in the minimum wage.\u0026nbsp“The evidence shows that increased leisure time for workers can be expected to increase economy-wide demand,” the think tank says.It adds: “Increasing minimum wages is a particularly efficient way of boosting demand because workers on minimum wages are far more likely to spend rather than save any increases in salary, compared with higher-income iniduals.”Based on the same logic, the report recommends abolishing the personal allowance of income tax and using the extra public revenue on direct payouts to consumers and an increase in child benefit. It says this will redistribute £8bn a year from the richest 35 per cent of households to the remaining 65 per cent, with most of the gains concentrated on the poorest 10 per cent.\u0026nbspThe think tank also argues the government should frontload a large share of investment required to turn Britain into a zero-carbon economy over the next five years, in order to boost demand.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It was how they were produced and how people used them when they got to the UK that matters. So that was a real eye-opener.”Most of this comes from\u0026nbspfertilisers,\u0026nbsppesticides and the fuel used by machinery during harvesting.They are then processed and sorted. If the orange is used to make juice, 22 per cent of the total footprint is down to transport and distribution.Professor Reay said: “If you just assume everything closer to you is better, so if you’re thinking these blueberries or cucumber from Holland in January will be low carbon, they\u0026nbspwon’t be. It’s going to be intensive production with a high carbon footprint.“This will massively outweigh the food miles of bringing them\u0026nbspfrom a country where the climate is right at that time of year.”Created with Sketch.Teenage climate change protesters threatened with arrest at Heathrow  Show all 13Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Four teenage protesters, holding a banner reading “Are we the last generation”Police surround the protestersFour teenage protesters, holding a banner reading “Are we the last generation”Police surround the protestersAccording to government data, buying a tomato grown in the UK has three times the footprint of a tomato grown in Spain.Lettuces grown in the UK during winter are cultivated in poly tunnels which require\u0026nbsplots of energy to keep them warm. In terms of carbon emissions, it is more environmentally friendly to buy them from Spain during the winter and in the UK during the summer.But food miles do matter if the product has been transported by air. For this reason, Professor Reay says consumers should avoid eating out-of-season soft fruit such as raspberries and blueberries.A 100g box of blueberries\u0026nbspgrown locally or imported via ship will produce around 100g of carbon dioxide. If it’s flown in, that increases by ten times, pushing its carbon footprint up to more like 1kg.Destruction of land must stop to tackle climate change, says reportClimate change could cause toxic mercury to accumulate in seafood“If you want to go into the high carbon footprint foods then once it’s been air freighted you’re in real trouble. That’s when the food miles absolutely soar in terms of emissions. We should have a blanket ban on air freight,” said Professor\u0026nbspReay.Despite the fiendishly difficult business of counting carbon he says the message “buy local” needs to go with “in season”. \u0026nbsp“The food mile message is a little more nuanced than it’s sometimes presented,” he added.Reducing waste would also make a significant difference to the carbon footprint.According to 2017 research, food waste accounts for 8 per cent of total greenhouse gas emissions. If food waste were a country it would come behind China and the US as the largest emitters on the planet.Professor Derek Stewart, an agri-food sector expert from the James Hutton Institute, said the book was interesting but some of the data could be challenged, notably on the grounds that it only looked at carbon dioxide emissions.Ships use dirty fuels that emit nitrogen and sulphur as well as carbon dioxide which has a significantly larger greenhouse gas impact than carbon dioxide alone, he said.PMQsProfessor Stewart added: “The carbon footprint is too nebulous for most people and in fact forms only part of a food supply chain.”Dr Eugene Mohareb, a lecturer in sustainable urban systems at the University of Reading, commended the overall analysis of food miles and the impacts of production.“In an ideal world, embodied carbon from production and transport would be communicated to the consumer on food products so that they could make informed decisions. But in the absence of that, eating produce in season can be a good guide,” he said.Food systems contribute to between 20 and 30 per cent of emissions globally and Dr Mohareb says the UK is unlikely to reach net zero by 2050 unless these emissions are reduced.“There are many things that we as consumers can do to reduce this impact. For example, we found that a simple measure, such as using grocery delivery instead of collecting by car just half of the time, reduced someone’s total impact on the food system by around half a percentage point,” he said.Eating vegetarian\u0026nbspone day a week could reduce someone’s overall impact by around 4 per cent.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Pink Meanie was discovered during a nightlight jellyfish e by the collections team in the waters around Robben Island and in Cape Town Harbour.

monitor reports regarding Britain’s departure from the EU.With 80 days to go until the Brexit deadline, the rapid rebuttal unit is being created to respond to “inaccurate media reporting” and “reassure the public” the government is prepared to leave without a deal.In his capacity as the chancellor of Duchy of Lancaster, Mr Gove will launch the unit as part of his role in leading the government’s preparations for a no-deal exit on 31 October – now considered No 10’s “top priority”.Confirming the move on Monday, a spokesperson for the Cabinet Office told The Independent it would keep a close watch\u0026nbspon articles related to Brexit.“All government departments are responsible for responding to inaccurate media reporting in their areas,” a spokesperson said.Created with

added: “A team focusing on reacting quickly to Brexit-related stories is being established as part of preparations to leave the EU on 31 October, so as to reassure the public that the government will be full prepared for the UK to leave then, whatever the circumstances.”But opposition parties at Westminster seized on the establishment of the rapid rebuttal unit. \u0026nbsp“Setting up a no-deal spin unit is a pointless waste of taxpayers’ money, and will do nothing to help avoid the years of chaos and uncertainty that will follow,” said Labour’s shadow Cabinet Office minister, Jon Trickett.\u0026nbspGove is in charge of government’s\u0026nbspno-deal Brexit preparations (Reuters)The Liberal Democrats’ Brexit spokesperson, Tom Brake, added: “The British public deserve the truth about the realities of what no deal will entail for the British people, but this is not what Gove’s rebuttal unit will provide.“It will be nothing more than a spin machine trying to mask the danger and chaos a no deal will cause, with the cost coming out of the public purse.“Rebuttal units in the past have been nothing more than a colossal waste of time and money.

Policymakers have looked for an explanation in the so-called supply side of the economy – the ways in which goods are made and services delivered – and pointed to declining technological innovation and cheap loans keeping unproductive “zombie” firms afloat, among other possible reasons.\u0026nbspBut the New Economics Foundation says its research shows that the government must also look at the demand side – the level and nature of spending across the country.\u0026nbsp“Average productivity, wages and living standards have experienced their worst decade in almost two centuries. It is increasingly clear that weak demand has been the overlooked problem,” said Alfie Stirling, head of economics at the think tank.\u0026nbsp“Raising demand by putting more cash in the pockets of the UK’s poorest workers, while giving people more paid time off from work to spend it, should now be part of a radical mix of options for any government that is serious about increasing productivity in a way that works for people and society.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Britain’s Jamie Chadwick wins first-ever W Series title.

Instead, companies rely on cheaper labour that can be shed quickly if demand doesn’t improve. As a result, productivity does not improve.The New Economics Foundation finds evidence of exactly this in official data.\u0026nbspIt says that since 2012, firms have increasingly preferred to hire rather than to invest and that, relative to all employees, the proportion of zero-hour and self-employed workers, as well as one-person “micro-companies”, has grown by two fifths since before the financial crisis. The corresponding lack of investment now explains at least a quarter of the UK’s gap in productivity with the historical trend.A report by the New Economics Foundation sets out a number of measures to lift demand, including gradual increases in statutory paid holiday and faster rises in the minimum wage.\u0026nbsp“The evidence shows that increased leisure time for workers can be expected to increase economy-wide demand,” the think tank says.It adds: “Increasing minimum wages is a particularly efficient way of boosting demand because workers on minimum wages are far more likely to spend rather than save any increases in salary, compared with higher-income iniduals.”Based on the same logic, the report recommends abolishing the personal allowance of income tax and using the extra public revenue on direct payouts to consumers and an increase in child benefit. It says this will redistribute £8bn a year from the richest 35 per cent of households to the remaining 65 per cent, with most of the gains concentrated on the poorest 10 per cent.\u0026nbspThe think tank also argues the government should frontload a large share of investment required to turn Britain into a zero-carbon economy over the next five years, in order to boost demand.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Arab, explains how he has lost $1000s of dollars being displaced due to the water crisis in Iraq (Photo: Bel Trew)A United Nations report released last month warned that the world is heading for a “climate apartheid” scenario, “where the wealthy pay to escape overheating, hunger and conflict while the rest of the world is left to suffer”.\u0026nbspIn Baghdad, that is already a reality. On 48C\u0026nbspdays, which are now coming earlier in the year, air conditioners are the most effective way of staying cool. But an electricity crisis in the country is putting even that essential tool out of reach to low-income families.\u0026nbspThe crisis – caused by a combination of corruption, mismanagement and a creaking national grid\u0026nbsp– has exacerbated the country’s energy ide. The result is a huge gap between electricity supply and demand, especially in the summer. A diesel generator can be used to meet some of the shortfall, but running an air conditioner from a generator is a luxury only a few can afford.\u0026nbsp“The electricity is completely unpredictable,” says Abu Ahmed, a metal shop owner just down the street from Muhammad. “Sometimes it comes on at 10am and lasts all day, sometimes it’s only one hour. The air conditioner is out of the question without the government grid.”\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspAbu Ahmed pays around £50 a month to run a generator that gives him a supply of four amps of electricity. That is all he can afford. If he goes over the allotted amps, the power turns off. \u0026nbsp“I can run the fridge and the lights, that’s all,” he says. “I can’t sleep at night and I’m always sweating.”Boiling Basra: Iraq’s water crisis threatens to destabilise the regionIraq’s electricity crisis may be a local problem, but the inequality of keeping cool is a global issue that is likely to become more relevant as temperatures rise.\u0026nbspNearly 2.8 billion people live in countries where the average daily temperature is greater than 25C, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA), and less than 10 per cent of them own an air conditioner. The agency estimates that by 2050, 1.9 billion people living in hot countries will be without access to an air conditioner.\u0026nbspProfessor Philip Alston, the UN’s special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights and author of the “climate apartheid” report, says the lives of the world’s poorest will be at risk.\u0026nbsp“The ever-higher record temperatures that will be recorded in Iraq and around the world will put vast numbers of vulnerable iniduals at grave risk. Children, older persons, those who are already ill or are just not very strong, will all be at risk of dying from excessive heat,” he tells The Independent.\u0026nbspAFPGetty)“The only way for some of these to get a degree of protection will be from air conditioning. But that costs money both for the system or the equipment as well as for electricity. The poorest people will often have neither access nor the money needed to have access to such relief.”\u0026nbspIraqi cities have some advantages over Europe when it comes to dealing with extreme temperatures. Its neighbourhoods and homes were designed with the heat in mind. Narrow streets carry the wind through tall windows, cool air flows up from the basements in older houses.\u0026nbspAs the recent heatwaves in Paris, London and Berlin have shown, European countries are significantly less well-equipped to deal with these higher temperatures.\u0026nbspLast month’s record-breaking temperature of 38.7C\u0026nbspin the UK prompted apocalyptic headlines, transport chaos and a spate of government health warnings –\u0026nbspand for good reason.\u0026nbspHigh temperatures in Europe are usually accompanied by a spike in deaths, usually among the elderly and people with heart and lung conditions. In 2003, a heatwave caused an additional 70,000 deaths across the continent. The British parliament’s Environmental Audit Committee has warned that Britain faces 7,000 heat-related deaths every year by 2050 unless action is taken.\u0026nbspAs it stands today, Europe is ill-prepared. The IEA estimates that less than 5 per cent of European households are air-conditioned, but it adds that air conditioning could become one of the top drivers of global electricity demand within a few decades.The UK’s Met Office describes heatwaves as “extreme weather events,” but adds that with climate change they are likely to become more frequent. Its own projections show that heatwaves could occur on average as regularly as every other year by the middle of the century.\u0026nbspChildren, older persons, those who are already ill or are just not very strong, will all be at risk of dying from excessive heatThe rise in temperature is likely to have an impact on how we work, too. According to the International Labour Organisation, the best-case scenario predictions for the level of warming would result in a 2.2 per cent reduction of global working hours due to heat stress by 2030, the equivalent of 80 million full-time jobs.\u0026nbspBut as Europe considers a future of climate crises, here again, Iraq is years ahead. Muhammad, the hardware store worker, knows very well how the heat can stop you in its tracks.\u0026nbsp“This job is easy, I don’t move around so much. But it takes an extra effort to do anything. Other jobs, like labouring, is much more difficult.”\u0026nbspAnd while European countries may at least have the time and means to adapt, Iraq is fast approaching an environmental disaster. \u0026nbspAFPGetty)A 2018,\u0026nbspreport produced by a group of academics from the EastWest Institute and the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) described Iraq as “one of the Middle East’s most climate-vulnerable countries”.“Climate change is currently manifesting itself in prolonged heat waves, erratic precipitation, higher than average temperatures and increased disaster intensity,” the report says, adding a prediction that the country’s mean annual temperature will increase by 2C\u0026nbspby 2050.Mahmoud Abdul Latif Hamed, a weather forecaster and manager of environment at Iraq’s Meteorological Organisation, says Iraq is experiencing extreme temperatures earlier in the year. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“In 2011, the temperature in Baghdad reached 50C\u0026nbspin August. Now it’s June and the temperature in Baghdad is already 49C. That means there has been a two-month shift in reading the temperature,” he says.\u0026nbsp“Fifty degrees is very dangerous if you’re out in the open. For the poor it is even more dangerous. They have no air conditioning to cool down.”According to Hamed, there are things the government can do to deal with the extreme heat.\u0026nbsp“The ideal solution is to make more vegetation, which can lower temperatures. And we need to remove all the factories and old technology,” he says. \u0026nbspBut despite Iraq’s massive oil wealth, corruption is hampering reform and Iraqis are furious. Last summer, deadly protests erupted in the southern city of Basra over the government’s inability to provide reliable electricity and water. The government has promised to invest billions in improving the national grid, but few have noticed the difference so far.\u0026nbspProtesters have been back on the streets this year in anticipation of another sweltering summer.\u0026nbsp“We expect the future climate of Iraq to be very dangerous,” Hamed,\u0026nbspsays. “I expect that if the issue isn’t fixed, it will bring down the government.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They voted to leave the EU. The only problem, as we have since discovered, is that many MPs don’t share the Queen’s trust in the judgment of the British people. Rather than respect the decision, they have sought to overturn it.Given their lack of respect for the British people, it is perhaps not surprising to see their total lack of respect for our Monarch and our long political traditions. It is not the job of hard-Left politicians or Remainer MPs to decide what the Queen should or should not do.The only person from whom the Queen can take constitutionally binding advice is the Prime Minister. Should Boris Johnson lose a vote of no confidence then the Queen will be advised by her outgoing Prime Minister about who can or cannot command the confidence of the House of Commons.Further, as Prime Minister, it would be up to Mr Johnson to advise the Queen on whether to give Royal Assent to a Bill passed by the Commons and Lords blocking a No-Deal Brexit. It would be well within his rights to advise the Queen not to sign such a bill into law.Were Johnson to seek to remain after  days without calling an election, he would be breaking the law, and it would then be for the courts, not the Queen, to intervene.It is certainly possible in theory that the sovereign could be called upon to choose between two rival claims to form a government. However, this would be regarded as highly political and has not been done since .In reality, it is far more likely that the numbers in Parliament will tell us who does or does not have a majority, and that a general election will be called before getting the Queen involved.We all know what this is really about, though. The vote for Brexit was always destined to bring us to a constitutional crisis. It was the first moment in our country’s long and proud history when a majority of people outside of Parliament asked for something that a majority of people inside Parliament did not want to give.The right way through this mess is not to drag the Queen into politics but to deliver on the decision that was made by the British people more than three years ago.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It wasn’t. It was a vote to take back control.And as we look towards our departure, this Government must deliver an open immigration system that welcomes those who will  contribute to the economy and  le of our great country.With a say on who comes in — and who doesn’t — we’ll be able to ensure our public services are ready for a population increase and that the supply of houses goes up as quickly as it needs to.Don’t believe the doomsayers.

She’s since become a celebrity chef in her own right.I recall that Alex brought her sheepish husband along with her that morning for her first appearance on live TV.Perhaps it was for moral support, but I reckon it was more likely to keep an eye on him. He did his best impersonation of a penitent man and they somehow managed to reheat the souffle.Of course, it didn’t last.They split up in  and that same year, Hollywood began his relationship with ex- barmaid Summer.Alex was convinced the affair began before they finally split but this was vehemently denied by both Paul and Summer.Paul and Alex, of course, are now orced. And he apparently faces an imminent court battle over cash.Alex could even end up with half her ex-husband’s ­estimated £million fortune.She is currently enjoying a holiday in France, where she was photographed looking chic, cool and effortlessly ­elegant.No one could fail to forgive her for feeling a bit smug that her ex has been so publicly dumped. After all, she had to bear her share of public humiliation over his behaviour.Meanwhile, it gets worse and worse for Paul, as inevitably there is now talk of ­Summer writing a book and appearing in a clutch of reality shows.She didn’t sign the NDA so is completely free to warble about their sex le and all sorts of potentially embarrassing revelationsshe wishes.So it looks like Paul is leaving Summer behind him and entering the autumn and winter of his le alone, with only himself to blame.I’ve just gobbled up the entire new BBC series Fosse Verdon about the hugely talented husband and we team who, among many other hits, gave us musicals Sweet Charity, Cabaret and Chicago.It’s gratying to see Broadway legend Gwen Verdon finally given the acclaim she deserves for the part she played in Bob Fosse’s success.He was a genius choreographer and director but also a notorious womaniser, chain-smoker, heavy drinker and pill popper.This series never shies away from Fosse’s sleazy side, showing how manipulative he could be – and his seduction of vulnerable young actresses and dancers is not easy to watch.We are light years from the #MeToo movement, and this series illustrates why we need it so much.Sam Rockwell plays a blinder as Fosse, but Michelle Williams is a revelation as Gwen Verdon.It’s as though the red-headed dancing star has been brought back to le.You know those stock responses you get after stating the bleedin’ obvious – about the Pope being Catholic and bears defecating in the woods.There is another one which I always thought was very callous.“Does Rose Kennedy own a black dress ”This is particularly unfeeling given the many tragedies visited upon the Kennedy clan – continuing right up to the present day.Theirs is a long litany of pain and suffering.Matriarch Rose endured the death of her eldest son Joe during World War Two, before the unimaginable ordeal of seeing two more sons publicly gunned down.First when John, as US President, was assassinated in . Then his younger brother Bobby, the former Attorney General turned senator and presidential candidate, was brutally slain in .The “Kennedy curse” has persisted through the decades.Twenty years ago, John F Kennedy Jnr, JFK’s only son, died while flying his light aircraft to the Massachusetts island of Martha’s Vineyard when it crashed into the ocean.In , Mary Kennedy, the estranged we of Robert Kennedy Jr – Bobby’s son – was found dead in her New York home, having apparently taken her own le.And this week, the family gathered for yet another tragic occasion.This time it was the funeral of Bobby’s -year-old granddaughter Saoirse Kennedy Hill, who died from a suspected overdose at the family compound in Cape Cod.Rose died in  aged .She was spared witnessing the deaths of some of the younger members of the family, including poor Saoirse.But after all she endured during her long le, she deserves a bit more respect and understanding than being the punchline to a weak joke.Whoever signed up Michelle Visage for Strictly Come Dancing deserves a pay rise.Michelle, right, one of the stars of the fabulous RuPaul’s Drag Race, will be a firecracker of an addition to Strictly. She’s sassy, sexy, ballsy and a real grafter.She has a wonderful dirty laugh and a terric outlook and she’ll seize this show by the throat.I’d have paid real money to have seen her reduce sacked former pro Brendan Cole to a whimpering jellyfish.It’s a huge shame that’s no longer a possibility, but bosses need to make sure Michelle is paired with a young, hungry dancer not afraid to take risks.There could perhaps be a chance for Kevin Clton to win two Glitterballs in a row after his success with Stacey Dooley last year.Kevin and Michelle could really burn up that dance floor and there would be no hanky panky from this loyal woman whose -year marriage to hubby David is rock solid.So no Strictly “curse”, but knowing Michelle, maybe rather a lot of Strictly cursing.Her big-heartedness remains undimmed even under the cruel shadow of Alzheimer’s, so it was no surprise that Dame Barbara Windsor used her nd birthday this week to demand more action to help fellow sufferers and their families.While other entertainers with long careers might have used their special day just to celebrate their achievements, Dame Barbara instead pleaded for us all to show compassion towards those with dementia, and for the Government to ensure more resources are made available.Barbara and her devoted husband Scott Mitchell have become ambassadors for the Alzheimer’s Society charity and have sent an open letter to Boris Johnson to sort out the care crisis that is making le so very hard for everyone affected by this disease.Now Boris might profess to being unafraid of all of the EU grandees as he tries to deliver Brexit, but he should be quaking in his boots at the prospect of the wrath of our Barbarahe doesn’t deliver vital help and money to those affected by dementia.More power to this incredible woman and how lucky she is to have Scott to take care of her because, sadly, not everyone dealing with dementia has such a devoted partner.They have both made a huge dference in raising awareness and much-needed cash.When this horrible disease is finally vanquished, and one day it must be, we will never forget the part Barbara and Scott played. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Abigail Wardle, , had to endure the horror of son Oliver Aisthorpeaposs leg self-amputating in her hand as she held him in his hospital bed. She had been warned that the -month-old might lose his fight with the disease that began with a simple undiagnosed throat infection. But the brave tot has made a miraculous recovery and medics hope they may even have his first prosthetic legs fitted in a few months. Abigail, from Cleethorpes, Lincs, has chosen to speak out in a bid to help other parents learn how to spot the signs of the killer bug. The jewellery designer said: Some people might feel sorry for us but I feel like the luckiest mum in the world - I still have Oliver with us - he might not have any hands or feet but he is still my smiley, brave little boy.    What we went through was horrendous and I had never been so scared in my le. But Oliver was so brave that I knew I had to be brave too. I am his mum and itaposs my job to fight for him and make him feel safe. He went from laughing and giggling to deathaposs door within  hours and nobody knew what was wrong with him. I donapost want any other family to go through what we went through, and so I want everyone to be more aware of sepsis - families but also GPs, who sometimes donapost have the specialist paediatric training available to spot it. I want some good to come out of what happened to Oliver. Abigail first took her son to an out-of-hours GP on March , when she noticed his soft spot appeared to be sunken.  But she says she was sent home and told her to give him fluids and Calpol. But by the next day, he had deteriorated - and Abigail again took Oliver to see a doctor. When he arrived at the hospital, a nurse took one look at him and rushed him to resus, where a team of doctors began battling to save his le. Abigail said: Oliver had seemed a bit under the weather . But that night, he got more ill and seemed leless. When I moved him, it was as though his bones were aching. “He quickly became very pale and lethargic and just wasn’t his usual self. “I would cuddle him and he was groaning as though his bones were aching. “He eventually stopped crying and was just whimpering, as though he didnapost have the energy to cry.    “I had just started him on solid food but he wouldn’t eat anything. He only wanted milk but barely drank anything. “I knew he was not well and he needed to see a doctor but I didn’t have a clue that he could have had sepsis. My gut said he wasnapost right so I took him back to the out of hours GP and within minutes, a nurse had whisked him off and he was being put under anaesthetic. Everything was a blur. I still had no idea what was wrong with Oliver, I was just trying to hold it together as they were putting him to sleep. I could hear a doctor on the phone to another hospital asking how to treat Oliver. His hand and feet had started to go purple, and I just remember thinking he must be cold and telling them to put some socks on him. ■ Sepsis affects , people in the UK and kills , per year. That’s more than bowel, breast and prostate cancer and road accidents combined. ■ Sepsis is the body’s often deadly response to an infection. ■ Initially, it can look like flu or a chest infection, but it can swtly get serious. ■ Seek medical help urgentlyyou develop any one of the following… – are lethargic or dficult to wake – feel abnormally cold to touch – the skin looks mottled, bluish or pale – are breathing very fast – have a rash that does not fade when you press it – have a fit or convulsion A doctor sat us down and said: aposYour son is very poorlyapos, I just thought, I know that, heaposs in a coma and hooked up to a load of machines, but I had no idea how ill he was. It was only when a nurse came over to speak to us and burst into tears that I realised how serious is was. She told us: aposWe donapost know which way itaposs going to go but it doesnapost look good.apos Doctors discovered that the sepsis had developed from an undiagnosed throat infection - which Oliver had never shown any symptoms of. They managed to stabilise Oliver but warned Abigail thathe deteriorated they would not be able to save him.  She and Oliveraposs dad were told twice that he was not going to survive, and they asked the hospital chaplain to baptise Oliver. Incredibly, though, the little boy pulled through - and survived with no damage to his brain, but the sepsis has caused both hands and his legs to turn black and effectively die off. Medics battled to savein Oliveraposs leg, but mum Abigail begged them to speed the operation along because she could see the leg self-amputating. She said: Oliver was out of the woods but they kept delaying a date for his amputations to try to save more of his leg - but I could see his body was trying to get rid of it. The limbs were heavy and uncomfortable - Oliver was miserable, I know it sounds like an odd thing for a mother to say but I was desperate for them to take them off.

While Gareth was the son of a woman battling metal health problems and never knew his father. Yet despite astonishing odds stacked against them Sarah and Gareth have become an inspiring success story. Fteen years after meeting in a care home, they have found love with one another, started a successful business and have a family of their very own. They now hope their own story will help give hope to others struggling to cope with losing families and parents.    When Sarah was just two, she was initially placed with foster parents before going to live in a care home with five other children.Her parents were drug addicts who also suffered with mental health problems, which meant that they were unable to care for her as a child.Garethaposs mother also suffered with dficulties with her mental health. The pair have described the dficulties that they faced leaving the care system, saying that it felt like they were left on their own as they tried to find their way in the world. But they did receive some help from former staff members who worked at the care home in Hull where they grew up, and the Hull Youth Enterprise Partnership which helped them launch their business .Sarah told Grimsby Live: I first met Gareth when we were both placed in a care home in Hull together  years ago. At the time we had a little bit of fling, but it was nothing serious, and I never imagined that we would be here now, with two children, starting our own business together.    When I left the care home, we lost contact with each other, as I was living in a hostel until I managed to get a flat for myself. Then when I did I found out that he was living down the road at his mumaposs house again, because he wanted to be with her as he missed her so much. We have pretty much been together ever since and never looked back. When you are in a care home, there are lots of members of staff who are very supportive and help you while you are there, but once you leave at  , it can be quite horric, it feels like you are just left to fend for yourself, and those first few months alone were really a struggle. I can remember our first Christmas together in the flat, we had no food and no presents, but were determined to make the most of it. Then a little miracle happened, and a lady who used to work at the care home with us called Lorraine, called at our door and told us that she was going to take us out shopping.She told us to fill up our trolleys with everything that we needed, including a Christmas dinner with all the trimmings, and paid for it all. Then later that night she came back to the house with a huge bag of presents for us to put under the tree, it was one of the kindest things that anyone has ever done for us, it was amazing. After that day, Sarah went on to get a job in sales for KCOM, while Gareth achieved a diploma in horticulture before getting a job at Hull City Council as a tree surgeon, which he worked at for seven years. Garethaposs role then gave him the confidence he needed to branch out and start his own business.He said: When I first got a job with the council, I started noticing the work that the tree surgeons did, so I asked my bosshe would give me a chance at it, and he let me, telling me not to let him down. I am sure that I didnapost because I spent seven years in that role, working on every dferent type of tree that you can imagine, and through that I got the confidence to want to step out and start a business with Sarah. With the help of The Hull Youth Enterprise Partnership, the couple established their own tree surgeon business, called Tree Fellas. Sarah said: The support that we have received from the Hull Youth Enterprise Partnership was amazing, they help us secure support grants and brought in mentors from other larger businesses who helped to teach us about doing our accounts and finance, managing assets and getting the business up and running. We really wouldnapost be where we are today without them. The couple now have two young daughters, Alyissa, , and Eva, , who have also thrown themselves into the business.

Tired of spending four hours commuting from Kildare to the Dublin everyday, the couple made the le-changing decision to move island which has been abandoned since .Lesley told the Irish Sunday Mirror : “I have always been interested in the Great Blasket Islands - I wrote my thesis about their heritage.“As part of my research Gordon and I went out there and we stayed in one of the cottages.“We just fell in love with the place and in January I saw a Facebook post advertising a job looking after the hostel there.“I had been working in the heritage sector at a Seamus Heaney exhibition and Gordon was in the civil service at the time. “I loved my work but we both wanted a bit of a change and a break from our routine so we decided to go for it and  days later we got the job.”  The island has no electricity or hot water, and they have to rely on gas to cook their food. Lesley added: “There’s a wind turbine which powers a socket so we have one socket for the whole place – it wouldn’t be powerful enough to run a hoover or anything but it can charge my phone. “I can take bookings for the hostel on that and send in our shopping lists – we couldn’t do without it. “I still walk into a room sometimes and think, ‘It’s very dark in here’ and go to turn on the light, then remember I can’t. “The lack of electricity hasn’t actually bothered me that much but it did take me a while to get used to not having hot water. “I said I was going to heat up water every day, that I’d never have a cold shower – but to be honest you’d be upstairs and dressed by the time you’d have the water heated in the kettle so I just decided to brave it.”The island was abandoned in  as emergency services had dficulty accessing the mainland in times of bad weather . Lesley said: You just have to be prepared and hope that nothing goes wrong. “Sometimes we are cut off from the mainland for three or four days. “We just have to be mindful of that and not take any chances, we take it easy when we’re lting chairs and tables in the house and things like that.” The couple, who supervise a hostel on the island, said they are never lonely because they always have visitors. Lesley said: “We can have up to  people in the accommodation, boats come out from Dingle, Bantry and Dunquin. “Thenthe weather is bad it’s just us but that’s actually our favourite time. All you can hear is the beach and the waves. That’s when we really get to appreciate the island and landscape and what the islanders would have went through when they were living here.” "},{"url":null,"title":"kate middleton in hysterics after","story":"NewsKate Middleton in hysterics after Bear Grylls tells her about Georges mischievous act at regattaKate Middleton and Prince William took their kids Prince George and Princess Charlotte to the Isle of Wight so they could watch them take part in the Kings Cup - but George had a rather cheeky momentShareCommentsByZoe ForseyLestyle Editor:,  AUG Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video princess-charlotte-sticks-tongue-out-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true\"\"Get the biggest Royal Family stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Prince George and Princess Charlotte may be royal, but theyaposre just the same as any other kids when it comes to the occasional mischievous behaviour.

Today elephants are facing many challenges habitat loss and competition for resources creates conflict with humans, climate change and fires destroy much needed resources and poaching for the demand of ivory makes elephants bigger targets than ever. African elephants are especially prone to human-wildle conflict because of their large home ranges. Finding, preserving and creating elephant corridors is therefore of great importance in helping to maintain habitats suitable for movement and minimising human-elephant conflict. Corridors are a mitigation technique to better the livelihoods of local communities and the elephants themselves, by providing environment and ample space for wildle to navigate from one habitat patch to another, without affecting the livelihoods of communities.

Shaun Winstanley, , from Staining near Blackpool, Lancashire, had worked at the supermarket giant for  years and won several awards including Years of Outstanding Service. But the father-of-three was left devastated after he was sacked from his role as a customer assistant at Tesco Express following an investigation meeting on January  this year. Mr Winstanley was told the decision was made because of the “unreasonable behaviour” of chasing a shoplter and putting himself and a customer in danger on January . Despite appealing the decision, Tesco kept their decision on February  and he was sacked. Following his appeal and subsequent dismissal, Mr Winstanley told a friend that he was having suicidal thoughts.    A few days later, he was found dead at home after suffocating himself by police officers who forced entry on February , an inquest heard. Mr Winstanley had a history of mental health problems which became worse when he was held at gunpoint during a robbery in May last year. The inquest was told how his fragile mental state further deteriorated following the sacking until his eventual death sometime between February  and February  - nine months after the gunpoint incident. Speaking after the hearing at Blackpool Town Hall, his devastated step-daughter Siobhan Winstanley, , told how she had written to Tesco about her father’s death but was told the matter was closed. She said: “It is very raw and very dficult for us to come to terms with. “He was of the very strong opinion that [suicide] was a selfish thing to do, so obviously it’s not something he would have done lightly, knowing he had children. “It’s not something that’s actually sunk in. We feel maybewe go into the Highfield Road shop he’s going to be there. But he’s not going to be there, because he’s not here any more. “I am angry at Tesco. We have got our father in an urn in our living room. “I sit there every morning with my coffee and look at him and wonder maybethings had been dferent he would still be here. “I think there needs to be an awareness of mental health and I think employers need to be doing right by their employees. “I could try to take them [Tesco] to tribunal but anything they could give me wouldn’t be good enough. It would be blood money. I don’t want money. I want my dad back. “Seventeen years he gave them and when he needed them most they let him down. “After  years, they sent him off without even a ‘bye’.”  Siobhan said her dad was offered five counselling sessions following the traumatic armed robbery in May last year and also moved stores, from Highfield Road Tesco Express - where the robbery took place - to shops in Bispham and Poulton. But his mental health continued to deteriorate and was made worse by the fact that he was disciplined for missing three shts following the crime, she said.

But step inside this th century tower and itaposs a totally dferent story. Martello Tower Y, tucked away on a quiet stretch of Sussex coastline, was built for a Napoleonic invasion that never came. It was meant to repel the French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte and as such dates back to the early th century. But a complete refurbishment in  has seen the property scoop a number of architectural and design awards, with English Heritage labelling the renovation as “exemplary”.    It has been described as one of the most original and soul-stirring modern homes in Britain - and it could be yours for a cool £.million. The three-bedroom home has a completely re-sculpted interior which perfectly blends period features with modern, contemporary architecture. It even has a modern-day drawbridge as well as a wrap-around roof terrace so buyers can take in that stunning seaside view, which is classed as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Inside, there are two elegant spiral staircases and a rustic, cosy atmosphere by the log-burner. Each of the three bedrooms fits between the inner funnel wall and outer curved wall, while lightwells and skylights are found throughout the property.    The roof extension, in the words of designer Duncan Jackson, “echoes the sculptural interior of vaulted brickwork creating a congruency between the contemporary and historic”. During its former le, the tower would have been shared by troops and coastguards in cramped, living quarters, with plenty of gunpowder and cannonballs for company. It was decommissioned in the s. Rightmove’s property expert Miles Shipside said: “This strikingly unique tower is one of the finest conversion projects I have ever seen.    It beautully combines its rich history and modern finishes with effortless charm. The innovation is second to none and I am hugely impressed by how sensitively the collaborators have dealt with the property. It’s a real gem.” There is a climb up a metal staircase to the first floor to get into the unusual home and there is a wood burning stive to cosy up next to in the living room. On the second floor is kitchen living dining area, which opens out onto the stunning terrace. The three bedrooms, two study spaces and two bathrooms are all on the ground floor.

Goldsmiths, University of London, said it is to remove all beef products from sale from next month as it attempts to become carbon neutral by . Students will also face a p levy on bottles of water and single-use plastic cups when the academic year starts to discourage use of the products. The collegeaposs new Warden, Professor Frances Corner, said staff and students care passionately about the future of our environment and that declaring a climate emergency cannot be empty words.    But the National Farmersapos Unionsaid the move was an overly simplistic approach and said there was a lack of understanding or recognition between British beef and beef produced where. Goldsmiths Studentsapos Union has backed the ban with president Joe Leam saying that the university has a huge carbon footprint and that the promise to eradicate this in the next few years is needed. There are also plans to install more solar  across the collegeaposs campus in New Cross, south-east London and switch to a % clean energy supplier as soon as possible. Officials said Goldsmiths will also continue to invest in its allotment area and identy other places where planting could help to absorb carbon dioxide. It will review how all students can access modules which cover climate change and the role of both iniduals and organisations in reducing carbon emissions. Prof Corner said: The growing global call for organisations to take seriously their responsibilities for halting climate change is impossible to ignore. Though I have only just arrived at Goldsmiths, it is immediately obvious that our staff and students care passionately about the future of our environment and that they are determined to help deliver the step change we need to cut our carbon footprint drastically and as quickly as possible.    Declaring a climate emergency cannot be empty words. I truly believe we face a defining moment in global history and Goldsmiths now stands shoulder to shoulder with other organisations willing to call the alarm and take urgent action to cut carbon use. NFU vice-president Stuart Roberts told PA that the union has been encouraging public bodies, such as universities to back British farming and source locally-produced food. Tackling climate change is one of the greatest challenges of our time but singling out one food product is clearly an overly simplistic approach, he said. The main issue with this is the lack of understanding or recognition between British beef and beef produced where. Our standards of beef production in the UK are among the most efficient in the world, with British livestock grazing in extensive, grass-based systems - meaning a greenhouse gas footprint . times smaller than the global average. Anyone wanting to play their part in helping our planet amid the current climate change challenge weaposre all facing should buy British, locally produced beef reared to some of the highest and environmentally sustainable standards in the world. The NFU has for years been encouraging public bodies such as schools and universities to back British farming and source their produce locally wherever possible. This makes more sense and keeps the choice to eat tasty, sustainably-produced meat firmly on the menu.

But mopping, sweeping and dusting can all have a negative effect on our health. And, in some cases, cleaning can even make us ill. We spoke to cleaning expert Ralitsa Prodanova from home cleaning firm Fantastic Services about the top  mistakes you could be making around your home and the best way to keep your pad spick and span. Scrubbing black mould Nobody wants their house to get mouldy, but scrubbing spores can be extremely hazardous. Ralitsa says: “Black mould, caused by damp, is unsightly and itaposs tempting to try and scrub it away. But doing so could cause respiratory problems – and even hallucinations. “Black mould that grows on damp walls can often be highly toxic. These living, organic moulds can send spores into the air – which spread like a virus.”    The most common type of mould can cause respiratory problems, skin inflammation, tiredness and nausea. Whereas moulds such as “rye ergot” can even cause hallucinations. To get rid of mould safely, Ralitsa, advises: “Always wear a protective mask, rubber gloves and safety glasses. “The most effective way of combatting mould is to pour bleach into a spraying bottle, before covering mouldy areas and letting the bleach get to work for  minutes. Open all windows to allow any toxic fumes to escape and wipe and rinse the area.” Skipping the gym From dumbbells to yoga mats, many people have some form of fitness equipment lying around at home. But how often do they get thoroughly scrubbed  Ralitsa, says: “There have been lots of studies into the bugs that lurk on workout equipment. And, often, gym equipment carries more germs than toilets – including those which can cause boils, eczma, acne and rosacea – aw well as the dreaded superbug, MRSA. “Gym equipment might get missing in your cleaning routine but it needs to be wiped and disinfected regularly.” Chemical reactions When youaposre using multiple cleaning products you need to be careful not to mix them.    Ralitsa, says: “Household cleaning chemicals are often hazardous. But they become even more dangerous when mixed. “The key thing to watch out for is mixing bleach with other substances. Bleach and any ammonia-based cleaners is a no-no, as it can potentially create a toxic gas that could even prove deadly in some circumstances. Meanwhile, bleach and vinegar can also release a gas that can attack your airways.” Making your bed Forget everything your mother told you, as making your bed can actually be bad for your health. Ralista, explains: “You should actually stop making your bed in the morning, as soon as you wake up. Instead, you should throw the duvet off the bed and let your mattress breathe. “Dust mites love warmth and humidity, which is why they love your bed.   “The problem is that their microscopic faeces can trigger reactions, including asthma and eczema , as well as sneezing, a runny nose, red eyes, itching, tightness in the chest and shortness of breath.“Butyou leave your bed unmade every morning – exposing your bed to cold air – the miles will simply dehydrate and die. “Then itaposs just a case of washing bedding weekly in hot temperatures while frequently dusting and vacuuming, too.” Not cleaning the vacuum Most of us only empty our hoovers when they are full. But it needs to be done on a regular basis. Ralitsa explains: “The brushes and the insides of vacuums essentially act as a mobile germ factory.  “Bacteria and germs are festering and breeding on the inside, multiplying rapidly. And, there has been research to suggest that  per cent of all vacuum cleaners actually harbour the bug, E. coli. “Iaposd advise homeowners to empty their vacuum on a much more regular basis and to give it a good wipe and disinfection after every use, too.” Forgetting to seal the deal Itaposs incredibly close to all our food – but the fridge seal is often overlooked in the cleaning process. Ralitsa says: “Fridge door seals typically have lots of folds and crevices, where it pushes against the sides of the unit in order to form a tight seal. But these crevices are food residue traps and bugs can sit there, undetected, for years. “It can also trap mould, which gets released every time you close and open the door and which can lead to allergies.” Have you got a story to share  Email webfeatures@trinitymirror.    Not throwing the towel in Tea towels often get used multiple times before theyaposre tossed into the washing machine. But you should actually be changing them every single day. Ralitsa says: “Tea towels are often moist and warm from previous use – allowing for bacteria to multiply rapidly. “Iaposd recommend you either replace them every day with clean, dry ones. Or wash them at the end of each day, so they are ready for use again the next morning.” And Ralitsa suggests performing the same routine for our oven gloves too. Putting the lid down Your bathroom might be sparkling after a good clean, but youaposll instantly undo all your hard workyou leave the lid of your toilet up when you flush. “Every time you flush your toilet, poo particles are flung into the air,” says Ralitsa. “These bio-aerosols can be extremely harmful – and the airborne water droplets are often contaminated with viruses and bacteria.” "},{"url":null,"title":"schoolgirl 10 like 60 year","story":"NewsSchoolgirl, , like a -year-old with cruel kids yelling grandma at herBo Rakching, from Cambodia, was born with wrinkled and sagging skin due to rare condition - but still has the physique of a childShareCommentsByKelly-Ann Mills:,  AUG Updated:,  AUG Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news world-news video cambodian-school-girl-age--,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, subsets :[,,,,,],bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, subsets :[,,,,,],bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA little girl who was born with was born with wrinkled and sagging skin has always looked liked on old woman.

Bo has never received treatment and is taunted by the other children in her remote village on the outskirts of Phnom Penh, Cambodia.    Relatives and local monks have lead Bo to believe that her appearance is because of bad karma she is carrying from a past le - one of the fundamental teachings of Buddhism.

Bo said that she has asked them to stop calling her names but they continue to taunt her.

defeat in Croatia, the Reds were looking to get back to winning ways, but Ilkay Durmus# early goal in Paisley denied them.Derek McInnes’ team never really got their attack going and were found to be vulnerable on the break in damp conditions.The rampant optimism of a week ago, after they’d beaten Georgians Chikhura Sachkhere and then Hearts at Pittodrie, has been dimmed, and they’ll need to improve across the board to have any chance of overturning the Croatian Cup winners’ - first leg lead and keep their hopes of the Euro group stage alive.McInnes made four changes from the team which lost - to Rijeka.Shay Logan, who handed Rijeka a penalty by pulling back Luka Capan, was dropped for new Bristol City loanee Zak Vyner, who made his first appearance.With one eye on Thursday’s , McInnes freshened up the attack with Scott Wright, Connor McLennan and league debutant Curtis Main in for Jon Gallagher, Niall McGinn and Sam Cosgrove – although there were questions marks as to whether Cosgrove’s absence was due to muscle tightness.St Mirren had the first chance to threaten on  minutes from a free-kick after Greg Leigh  bundled Paul McGinn to the deck on the right of the box.Durmus’ initial left-footed effort hit Funso Ojo in the wall, before Tony Andreu’s tame effort from  yards was caught easily by Joe Lewis.However, the home side opened the scoring on  minutes.Greg Leigh got caught out of position after a poor clearing header, with McGinn setting Kyle Magennis free down the right.He squared to the Durmus, who broke into the area and finished into the bottom right corner.It could’ve been two on  minutes. Calum Waters cross from the left headed over by Durmus.Main blazed a shot over from outside the area with  minutes played, having shrugged Gary Mackenzie off in the visitors’ first effort.The Dons interchanging midfield four of Wright, Ryan Hedges, Lewis Ferguson and McLennan wasn’t quite clicking for all their energy, with the man in possession being crowded out.Up the other end, big striker Jon Obika looked a real handful, with his pace, strength and aggression occupying Andy Considine and Scott McKenna.However, Hedges did find space to fire into Vaclav Hladky’s hands from  yards on  minutes, before Ferguson shot miles wide with a free-kick from  yards.Despite building a bit of pressure towards the end of the period, no more real chances materialised.Conversely, an  Andreu free-kick and Durmus overhead kick could’ve extended Saints’ lead, but were both caught by Lewis.Soon after play restarted, Main turned well with the ball and almost found the top left corner from range.On  minutes, Vyner got forward and delivered a pinpoint cross on to Ferguson’s head, and Hladky tipped over the bar.Three minutes later, the keeper threw himself on a deflected McLennan strike. However, he appeared to lt his hands from the ball, which Main stole and rolled into the net.Referee Steven McLean didn’t allow the equaliser – which would’ve been contentious – to stand.But it was a decent spell for Aberdeen, with Hladky punching a whipped Hedges free-kick clear soon after, before Sean McLoughlin looked to handle another of the attacker’s deliveries into the middle.Vyner was booked for protesting too vocerously for a penalty.Gaffer McInnes sent the rested Niall McGinn and Jon Gallagher on for McLennan and Wright in an attempt to force the issues for the Reds.But, on  minutes, St Mirren could’ve scored again, but Andreu somehow flicked Paul McGinn’s cross past the post.Ryan Flynn then went close with  minutes to go, ghosting inside, but shooting straight at Considine as he tried to find the inside of the front post.Kyle McAllister was next to try for the home side, and his long-range effort narrowly missed the top left corner.James Wilson was sent on for the Dons as they threw everything at the quick-countering Buddies to try and level it.The big chance of a frantic finish fell to substitute McGinn, from Considine’s cross, but he struck the outside of the post on the angle at the death."},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/08/5d510305d933b7.48651057-423x564.jpg ","title":"aberdeen fc lodges complaint over treatment of supporters in croatia","story":"Aberdeen FC has lodged a complaint after supporters spoke of “shocking” treatment on a European away day as fans were caged.Dons fans travelled to Croatia on Thursday to watch their side play in the Europa League qualier and complained of being forced to pay £ on-the-spot fines in what one source described as an “organised scam”.Others complained the visitors’ enclosure resembled a cage, toilet facilities were “medieval” and fans were not allowed to leave for half an hour after full-time.The host club has denied fans were treated improperly.Dons officials said they gave extensive written advice to all travelling supporters about the anticipated conditions at Stadion Rujevica in Rijeka – but were still surprised at how they claimed to have been treated.“We complained to the Croatian police and to the Rijeka FC stewards regarding the treatment of our fans,” said an Aberdeen FC spokesman.The stadium is being used temporarily while Rijeka’s new ground is being built.Before Dandies supporters jetted out to Croatia, Aberdeen wrote to them advising about ground regulations, including banned objects and alcohol regulations.However, supporters arrived and had hayfever tablets and even lipstick confiscated.One Dons fan, who asked not to be named, said: “The policing was far too heavy-handed.“I saw fans get things like lighters and lipstick taken away and one wee boy had hayfever pills taken away because they were classed as drugs.“The conditions were shocking. We were placed in a cage and there were only two basic portable toilets for everyone to use and no washing facilities. It was really medieval. A lot of the fans were upset.“At least five fans were apprehended and finedfor being drunk. They were breathalysed at random.”One source close to the incident told the Evening Express: “It looked very much like an organised money-making scam with the stewards.”Another fan, who asked not to be named, said: “We never had any bother, but the folk who were getting lted for being drunk were no worse than me.“I would say it’s the tightest and most over-the-top security I’ve ever been through.”It is understood several plain-clothed Police Scotland officers were in attendance and will write a report on the game’s policing – as is routine for European games.A Rijeka FC spokesman said: “The statements madeare not true.”The Dons suffered a - defeat to the Rijeka side on Thursday in the first leg of their Europa League tie."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 14 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsBike scrambling fans out there of a certain age will be feeling nostalgic at the prospect of ato a track described as #one of the best in the world# later this month.Kilmartin is famous in the motocross world and mouths are watering at the prospect.Not that long ago,you had walked into a shop and asked for a bottle of water you would be offered fizzy French stuff or perhaps tonic or soda water.Plain drinking water  We had taps for that.A multi-million pound industry has #sprung# up, selling water to us in plastic bottles.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 25","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowFiona McCuish of Ardrishaig captured the VIC puffer wending its way up the Crinan Canal.Fiona used her camera phone as the vessel passed through West Bank, Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 28 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat is it with recruiting #professionals# to Argyll We seem to be a distinctly unattractive prospect, as witnessed by the problems with recruiting a dentist in Lochgilphead.What people fail to appreciate is that they stand to gain so much more than they would lose by coming to Argyll.The scenery is unrivalled the pace of le is civilised we are not that far from the central belt and a sense of community remains.Just turn to our front page story for proof.Disappointment at losing out on council grant funding has turned into joy in Tarbert.But only because the people of the village have such big hearts, as they have demonstrated in the past.The council may argue that this vindicates its decision to refuse funding.

Players subscriptions covers pitch hire, insurance and other bits and bobs but it is the support from other organisations that allows us to be ambitious and grow not only the number of children participating but also development opportunities including bringing in professional coaches for development weekends which are free to local children.#"},{"url":null,"title":"aliens invade lochgilphead library","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowChildren at Lochgilphead Library had a fun afternoon creating their own alien friends.As part of the LiveArgyll Space Chase to keep young people reading throughout summer, the theme of space travel was expanded upon at a merry little get together, with the children making their own little alien friends out of clay.While they worked, librarian Sylvia Bolwell read them a story of a distant planet where everyone fits in.The youngsters had a lot of fun chipping in with the story and they all had a fun new friend to take home."},{"url":null,"title":"northern jolly for loch fyne anglers","story":"Nikki ThompsonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Loch Fyne Sea Angling Club couldn’t have asked for better weather for its annual soirée to the fertile fishing grounds of Stornoway.The crossing from Ullapool was as smooth as you like and a sure sign we were in for a good couple of days. Day one saw us head out from Carloway aboard the SYSAC II under the watchful eye of skippper Robbie Bell who knows these waters like the back of his hand.The day kicked off with a bait hunt in the East Loch but the mackerel were pretty scarce, it took an hour or so to fill the baskets before steaming out to the two-mile mark in search of spurdogs. By then there was a fair wee wind picking up and it was a tad rough to say the least, with the heavy swell claiming a few breakfasts along the way.All that was soon forgotten as the battle commenced with the mighty spurs. The action started on the first drop with some thumpers coming aboard, single and double shots causing mayhem thrashing about the deck and we lost count of the number of rigs sliced through on the way up. But that’s what we came for, not everyone’s choice but great sport all the same.In between the madness we picked away at the haddock, whiting, grey and red gurnard, ling and pollack, until we had our quota and decided to seek the smoother waters of East Loch Roag for some flattie bashing on the soft ground. It was good to get into the calm and fish the light gear, picking away for dabs and plaice. There was plenty around, nothing huge but a steady flow coming aboard taking us to the end of the day with a good mixed bag of species.Day two set off in brilliant sunshine and not a breath of wind, it was almost tropical conditions. We quickly got our supply of fresh bait in West Loch Roag and set off for the rough ground in search of a few more species, but there was little or no drt so we took a turn into Clf Bay and settled in for a day on the rays. It was brilliant fun, everyone got their fair share with loads of thornback rays and a few spotted rays coming aboard, plenty of dabs, plaice, dogfish and a bonus lb oz turbot to add to the tally. It was a great opportunity to brush up on some of fishing techniques that don’t get practised much at home.We decided to hit the hard ground on the way back to the harbour. It was quite slow, maybe a wee bit early yet, but it produced more haddock, a lovely lb cuckoo wrasse and pollack bringing our two day adventure to an end. All in all another excellent club trip.This year we picked up  species,  counting fish and a few personal bests. Add to that, great company, loads of banter, a good skipper who makes a mean cup o’ tea and you have the ideal ingredients for another memorable few days away on Lewis. We’ll be back next year for sure.Results: Nikki Thompson  points, Robert MacBrayne , Nick Friel , Jim Smith , Gary Sinclair , Steven MacBrayne ."},{"url":null,"title":"mach1 scottish tarmack rally championship report","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowWith  starters and  Cobble shop STRC registered the championship tables were always going to change on this mid-season two day event.Sunshine was forecast for the Machrihanish Airbase Community Companycourse and that’s what was delivered. Some crews were hoping for rain but this year it wasn’t to be. Last year’s winner Bruce Edwards in the Darrian T GTR was favourite and since Bruce had not driven the car competitively since Mach   we all thought he would be a bit rusty.Bruce led from the start and set some impressive times throughout the two days but on the last stage he threw it all away and rolled the car as he clipped a large lorry tyre a mile from the finish line, unable to right the car and with the stage blocked the clerk of the course decided on the grounds of safety to cancel the final stage. This allowed Alistair Inglis in the lotus Exige and a previous Mach  winner to clinch the top spot.Class  had  STRC registered this year and new to class  was Tom Blackwood in the gorgeous yellow and Black Fiesta R+. Tom#s first event driving in anger and showed that with some tweaks here and there with suspension settings it’s a great car to drive. How well the car drives notwithstanding, there was a slight moment coming out of one of the tight sections onto the main runway when Tom ran wide and clipped a boundary fence damaging the front bumper of the car but kept the fence intact. Tom finished third Overall and second in class .John Rintoul in another Fiesta R on the back of the recent win at Crail was on it all weekend but just couldn’t clinch the win this year, John finished second overall and took the class win.Alan Wallace in the distinctive green and white Mitsubishi Evo finished a very well deserved th overall and third in class. Harry Chalmers was a Mach  virgin and loved every mile of the venue. Harry commented at the end of the event they we had no problems at all on day one and the car ran faultlessly all day to give him a real confidence boost to push on harder and let him get used to some new parts on the car. Harry kept it neat all day and came away with rd overall after day one.Day two was very fast. Fastest he’s probably been in the car to date with these faster stages suiting faster cars Harry just had to push on brake late and keep it tidy and with that being said the team dropped to th overall due to some of the quicker cars retiring out.Harry said: #I couldn’t be happier for how this event turned out for the team and are all delighted with the result and how far they have come.#Harry also managed the full two days on the same Hankook Tyres Finishing th overall.Alan Stark in the stunning Red Mitsubishi Evo had decided he was playing the long game and would drive accordingly. The plan went well and they played about with tyres trying to make them last for the two days. On the second last stage on the Saturday the manold gasket started to blow and he lost a fair bit of power mid stage. The service crew managed to bolt it up again but the long stages were killing it and it usually faded about  rds in each time.On Sunday he decided to push on a bit and of course it bit him. The interior mirror fell off and he became aware there was a car coming up behind after a merge but wasn’t sure how close. He decided to do the next lollipop and then see where he was on the straight but in his enthusiasm got to him and he understeered into the bales bouncing off them, hitting his bonnet. He also noticed the brake pads were rattling more than usual and it turned out they had lost a pin. The team had to improvise with spare tyre borrowed from Allan Wallace which didn’t quite fit but they wired it in and it lasted.Class  had  STRC registered crews this year and top spot and current championship leader in class went to Colin Gemmell in the Mark  Escort. Colin had a trouble-free run on both days and managed to finish the event th overall just  seconds behind Tom Blackwood and second in class.Alistair Inglis winner of the  Mach  stages kept just ahead all weekend. Nothing could touch his car which stuck to the road like glue.Inglis said: #Overall victory and a class win  Can’t get any better.#Robert Marshall in the Mark  Escort was looking forward to some decent results but an issue on day one with the car losing all its water put an end to any real chances and on day two an engine mount broke putting an end to what Robert described as a perfect weekend.Ross Auld was a welcomethe Mark  Escort and also managed a couple of days assistance in setting up the venue. Ross had managed to set some decent times on Saturday but late in the day the alternator belt snapped and took with it the dry sump belt causing the engine to cease. Ross loaded up the car and headed home and by the Sunday evening he had the engine out the car ahead of its rebuild.Class  saw four STRC registered crews compete in Kintyre this year and top of the list was Greg Inglis in the Lotus Exige. Greg exited the last stage on the Saturday and noticed the rear brake calliper hanging off. A call was made to Montrose where a spare part was removed from a car and the handover was done half way between Montrose and Machrihanish. Greg finished a respectful fth overall and took the class win.Second in class and th overall was Michael Harbour in the Mark  Escort, on the back of electrical problems that saw the team fail to finish the last round at Crail the team have now got the car singing on the stages. Michael didn’t report any issues during the weekend and brought the car home in one piece.Michael Robertson isn’t having the best of luck this season as the Honda Civic Type R driver reported issues with the CV joint that led to driveshaft and df failure but as usual the team loved the event and will be back for sure.Class , with eight registered STRC in class  the battles were all tensely close. Taking top honours in the class was Kyle Adam a full two minutes ahead of nearest class  car of Des Campbell. Kyle also managed a top  overall clinching th spot and despite some overheating at one point the car ran faultlessly doing his championship hopes no harm.Lochgilphead local, Jamie Miller in the C R Max loves the track and had the luxury of booking indoor servicing. With navigator Ian McCulloch, his biggest problems were brake related but with some fluid changes and adjustments it was just all back to normal for the team finishing a well-deserved th overall and fourth in class.Kayleigh Strachan in the Citroen Saxo finished th in class on the event and th overall but managed to pick up  points and th in class in the STRC.Gary Coutts in the Fiesta commented after the final stage on the Sunday that on the second to last stage of day one he developed a few ‘minor’ issues. A change of driveshaft, ball joint, wheels and tyres seemed to cure the problem. With an early start on the Sunday morning the car was back on form. Loss of intercom on way to stage  and a half spin on stage  cost them a bit of time and after a few tweaks at service they were away again. The last stage of the day was cancelled resulting in a th overall and th in class.Alan Watt was again out in the green Saxo and finished th in class and st overall. A great result for the team with no damage or mechanical issues to report.Class  had four teams registered in the STRC this year at Mach  but only one managed to finish.

We were incredibly grateful to get all, or most of the fish donated, which allowed us to give all the profits to the festival. I’d also like to thank Seafood Scotland who helped with the funding of our equipment.‘Cooking in front of the boats which caught the fish was pretty spectacular.

It would be fair to say the midges enjoyed a feast, chewing both young people and their guests with vigour. But they didn#t dampen the spirits of the Scouts who were presented with numerous awards including Bronze, Silver and Gold Chief Scout Awards.The highlight of the evening was the presentation to Martha Payne of her Diamond Chief Scout Award, the second highest award in Scouting. Martha has been an enthusiastic and active member of the th Argyll for more than seven years.After gaining her award she said: #I have loved my time in Scouting – it has provided me with so many opportunities and memories.#Shortly after receiving her Diamond Chief Scout Award, Martha and her sister Polly, jetted off to join , other Scouts from around the world at the th World Scout Jamboree in West Virginia. This event is held every four years in dferent countries. The objective is to promote peace and understanding and to develop leadership and le skills in those attending.While Martha and Polly were in the United States, seven members of the th Argyll travelled to the world’s oldest rainforest in northern Malaysia to take part in a community development project with members of the Orang Asli tribe.The project had been organised by the West Region of Scouting in Scotland supported by the Yayasan EMKAY foundation. This charity exists to improve the living standards of the people living in this remote and challenging area. In total the group comprised  leaders and  explorersand networkerscompleting four projects.The projects included renovating a classroom to allow the villagers to attract a primary school teacher , building a playpark , preparing fields for planting of fruit trees, herbs and vegetables, and building a table for the elders to meet and discuss village business.Working in the rainforest was challenging with very high levels of humidity and temperatures regularly touching C. The whole group had an amazing adventure with memories and friendships formed that will last a letime.Finally, two members of the th Argyll had their first outings as members of the Mid Argyll Pipe Band. Robert Tonerand Martha Moirtook part in the recent Ardrishaig Gala Day.David Smart, Scout leader, th Argyll said: #This has been an amazing summer. We are so proud of all our members who have grasped the opportunities that Scouting provides. Scouting for the th is all about having adventures, whether small ones or big ones.#Last year we ran two camps for our Beavers, our Cubs attended the Adventure Centre at Lochgoilhead and won the District Camping competition, our Scouts completed a number of weekend camps including the Snowdrop Challenge Hike, and our Explorers had their first taste of ice climbing. Next year is our th birthday and we are planning a whole host of activities and adventures to mark this milestone.#John McCartan, chairman of the group, said: #Scouting in Mid Argyll is as strong as it has ever been. The leadership team, guided by the young people, have developed a fantastic programme in all of the sections.#We are keen that as many young people in Argyll take up the opportunities that Scouting provides. We have a stand at the forthcoming Mid Argyll Show and would be delighted to discuss our plans.#If you are interested in finding out more about the th Argyll Lochgilphead Scouts, email thargyllscouts@gmail or call  .The group runs four sections – Beavers , Cubs , Scoutsand Explorers .

Only on the wettest and windiest days do we use the huts for some shelter.#I think it makes a huge dference in a time when technology is being used more and more in education – with no electricity, wi or running water, the children are challenged to learn how to make things with little help.#I love seeing it when the wee ones learn something new or master something they’ve been trying to do for a while, like climb that little bit higher in the tree. It’s also really rewarding when the children see me outside of work and they run over to talk to me.#If I was to say one thing to somebody considering a career in early learning and childcare, I’d say go for it!

I would like to congratulate everyone who helped to make it a professional and successful day. Everyone involved played their part in a professional manner.#I hope this is an important part of the regeneration of Mid Argyll and I will continue to give them all my support in my duties as a councillor.#The Egg Shed is the latest marker in the regeneration of Ardrishaig Harbour and has already been taken to the community’s heart.

It is bounded to the west by Montgomerie Terrace.ldquoThe proposed new development will be accessed via a new access created off Montgomerie Terrace, with the two new houses towards the front of the site, which replace the existing ldquodoran pre-fab and former canoe shed, accessed off the B.ldquoThese proposed homes reflect high standards of design to ensure successful integration with the character of the local area, without damaging the design characteristics of the conservation area.ldquoThe materials, scale and height of the surrounding area have all been assessed to ensure the proposed development is in keeping with the existing housing.The plans attracted five objections relating to the height of the buildings in relation to nearby properties, and raised issues surrounding privacy and sunlight.However, at a meeting of Scottish Borders Councilrsquos planning and building standards committee on Monday August , planning officers urged councillors to approve the plans.In a written submission to the committee, planning officer Julie Hayward writes: ldquoThe main issue with the development is the potential impact of the dwellinghouses proposed on plots five and seven on the light, privacy and outlook of Orchard House to the east due to the position of the proposed houses and dfering ground levels.ldquoThe agent has submitted a drawing to show the relationship between the three houses and section drawings showing ground levels.ldquoIn terms of the impact of the proposed house on plot seven, the proposed house would have two bedroom windows in the east elevation at ground floor level and would be on slightly lower ground. Applying the guidelines in the approved supplementary planning guidance, there would be no signicant loss of light or privacy to Orchard House from this property.ldquoIn terms of the impact of the house on plot five on Orchard house, the garage would be positioned on the eastern side of the proposed house and the decking is shown on the western side beyond the rear wing.ldquoThere would be a window and door to the garage and a window to a WC in the rear elevation, which are not considered to be habitable rooms. There would be a large glazed area in the rear wing serving the living room.ldquoThe house is on signicantly higher ground than Orchard House.ldquoAgain, when applying the approved guidance there would be no direct overlooking and no loss of privacy to the habitable rooms of Orchard House.Kelso councillor Simon Mountford said he did not object to the proposals, but wanted to see a design change: ldquoWhat we have here those very boring roof shapes, although I appreciate modern roofs do not have chimneys or anything to break them up a little bit.ldquoIrsquom wonderingwe could ask the developer to break up the roof lines with some new designs.Tweeddale West councillor Eric Small told the committee: ldquoIrsquom quite happy with the way itrsquos sited in this location, so Irsquom going to go with the officers on this one.

Built around a single, beautully menacing chord, which apparently symbolises the background radiation in our universe, the finale discusses the search for discovering a unying theory of everything.To quote Small from Imprints, As you travel through space, you are displaced, imagining time. You exist like a plant, you bloom and you grow, then wither and die. But the one card you play, genetically, is always an ace.

at Barrel Law, near Hawick.In September, plans for an poundm wind farm were rejected by Scottish Borders councillors.The proposal would have seen seven turbines, of up to m in height, erected on land to the north-west of Roberton, near Hawick.The company behind the plans, Germany-based ABO Wind, then submitted an appeal to the Scottish Governmentrsquos planning and environmental appeals ision .As part of that appeal process, the DPEArsquos appointed reporter Elspeth Cook held a hearing at Forman Hall, Roberton.However, the hearing was simply to clary and define legal terms and certain technical standards in order to help inform Ms Cookrsquos decision.For example, one point of contention between Scottish Borders Council and ABO Wind is whether or not the combined appearance of Barrel Law and the existing wind turbines at Langhope Rig will create a lsquolandscape with wind turbinesrsquo or a lsquowind turbine landscapersquo, as per the legally-defined definitions.The councilrsquos position is that a distance of between -km is required in order to maintain the current landscape type in the valley, but ABO Wind suggest the turbines should be less than km apart, as they state that spreading out the two turbine sites would actually make the landscape look more saturated as the wind turbines would effectively cover a larger area.Furthermore, they state that a greater distance between the two developments would push the Barrel Law turbines outside of the topography which makes wind farms viable in this area.Appearing as part of ABO Windrsquos  of representatives, land and development consultant James Welsh told the reporter: ldquoIn our opinion we preserve the distinct identity of the two groups.ldquoThere are examples of wind farms being approved with similar distances between them but still being accepted as being clearly separate wind farms.ldquoTo insist on a greater separation would increase the effect of a cumulative effect between them.Scottish Borders Councilrsquos planning consultant, Dr Guy Wimble, said: ldquoI donrsquot dispute that they are identiable as separate elements, my issue is the effect of the wind farms on the landscape, and recognising that they are two dferent wind farms not one development.ldquoThe proximity of them makes this appear more of a wind farm landscape rather a landscape with wind farms.ldquoWhile I accept that separating the developments would make the wind farms seem more spaced out, by putting them closer yoursquod increase density.John Campbel QC, appearing on behalf of a group of objectors called Barrel Law Action Group, said: ldquoIf you pull the wind farms apart then clearly you increase the area of cumulative effect.ldquoIf you pull them together, yoursquore going to increase the cumulative effect just by sheer numbers, and you lose the ability to discern the two as distinct entities.Melrose and Leaderdale councillor Tom Miers, appearing in his capacity as Scottish Borders Councilrsquos executive member for planning and environment, told the hearing: ldquoIt seems to me that the guidance allows for developments in this area but doesnrsquot necessarily promote it.ldquoNo one is disputing that the two wind farms would be separate, wersquore working to find out what degree of separation would be appropriate.Mr Welsh responded: ldquoIf you increase to a km distance it will push all m turbines outwith the area that has been identied as having the appropriate topography for this type of development.Ms Cook also sought clarication on certain technical points, mostly surrounding tables and figures contained within ious reports submitted by the appellant and the local authority."},{"url":null,"title":"art-thou-shakespeare-cyclists","story":"BORDERS

use at school.Best-selling lestyle author Amanda is also a mother-of-two and is concerned children do not drink enough water throughout the day.She said: ldquoEncouraging children to have a regular water intake throughout the school day is a vital aspect to maintain good health and a healthy learning environment.ldquoIt has been proven that through drinking water and staying hydrated children are more attentive and focused during lessons for longer periods of time.ldquoWe are lucky to have safe and delicious water from the tap, we should all be making the most of it. For parents trying to wean kids off sugary drinks, it can help to add a slice or orange, lemon or even a sprig of mint to tap water for extra flavour.For children aged five to eight years old the recommended water intake is one litre a day.The amount increasing even more to one and a half litres for eight to -year olds and up to two litres for over rsquos.And with the new p deposit scheme for throwaway drinks containers being rolled out in the Borders this year, reusable water bottles will not only save families money, but also teach children to respect the environment.Amanda added: ldquoLike many families, in my home we do all we can do reduce the use of plastic.

are fortunate in Scotland to have a way out of such dficulties in the form of a Debt Arrangement Scheme , which is one of Scotland’s best-kept secrets.  It’s available from charitable organisations such as StepChange and from commercial debt advisers such as TC Debt Solutions, too.  It is a Scottish Government scheme that is legally binding and prevents creditors from taking further action against people who owe money.Set up back in  by the Scottish Government, the scheme allows people to freeze interest and charges on their debts and pay their debts off interest-free over a longer period of time.  This brings payments down to levels that people can afford and gives people the chance to get their lives back on track.  Interest and charges are simply written off.Apart from reducing debt, one of the best things about the DAS scheme is that it protects people from their creditors but is not a form of insolvency: people get to pay back their debt in an affordable way.  Lenders like the scheme because they know they will eventually get their money back – and borrowers like it because they don’t have to pay interest charges and they get longer to pay their debts off.  It’s a case of everyone wins.There’s plenty of information about the Debt Arrangement Scheme online at  www.aib.gov.uk debt-arrangement-scheme.  Thousands of people have used the scheme, but so many more could get this help – whether through financial charities or commercial organisations.Richard Gardiner,"},{"url":null,"title":"letter thanks","story":"I#m pleased to report the day raised £ for

summer tournament, winning the competition in , the one-off match was played in a good spirit, but it was the Pupils who found their ruthless streak to snatch a win in the closing minutes.Rhu, fielding a team with plenty of height and energy, featuring several former youth players from Dumbarton FC # and former teammates of Pupils’ playmaker Donald McCallum # threatened early on.At the other end, though, the McFadyens-sponsored Pupils had first-half chances, with Scott Souden and youngster Calum McKillop both having one-on-one opportunities, but their efforts were stopped by the Rhu keeper.The second half exploded into le on the hour mark as former Sons youth Callum Scott made his mark for Rhu, turning inside his marker to curl a classy left-footed finish beyond stand-in goalkeeper Ellis Robertson.Undeterred, the Pupils searched for an equaliser, and were given the opportunity minutes later when a Rhu handball in the box was penalised by referee Thomas d’Alessandro.John McCallum, playing as sweeper in a back three with Fraser Wylie and Ross Souden, stepped up to send the keeper the wrong way and make it -.However, after a lapse in concentration, the Pupils conceded a second goal, a cleverly guided header from a near-post corner evading Robertson in goal.Then, with the -degree heat and high humidity making the game hard work for both teams, the Feathers-sponsored Pupils rallied to equalise.A sweeping move involving midfield trio Keith Mitchell, Stuart Crossan and Donald McCallum found Scott Souden, who made no mistake when bearing down on goal, lashing a right-foot shot past the Rhu keeper, to the delight of his teammates and the clutch of Campbeltonians making the long journey to spectate.Then, in the dying seconds, after seeing shots blocked at their own end, thanks to some vital interventions from Robertson, the Pupils stole a winner when midfield substitute Finn Scott was teed up by Scott Souden to slot the ball home low beyond the Rhu keeper, ensuring the visitors completed pre-season unbeaten.Pupils manager Campbell Robertson said: ‘The conditions were tough, but the boys played really well, and our shape was good too. We would like to thank Rhu Amateurs for their excellent post-match hospitality.’Meanwhile, the Pupils’ centenary season officially starts tomorrowwhen they host Argyll rivals Lochgilphead Red Star at Kintyre Park, in the SAFL’s aptly named Centenary Cup, with a pm kick-off.And with two more Saturday group matches to follow in August, firstly away to Dunoon and then at home to Tarbert, the Pupils will look to continue their dazzling pre-season form once the competitive action begins.Photograph:"},{"url":null,"title":"simply the best for james","story":"James was + after nine holes and then proceeded to put together an excellent back nine to finish on +.Meanwhile Donald had gone to + n the front nine only to fall back on the inward nine and finished on +.Result: , James Williamson +  ,  Donald Brown +  ,  Bill Brannigan +  ,  Sandy Watson +  , Ken MacMillan +  , Robert Cook  +."},{"url":null,"title":"letter trying to keep everyone happy","story":"We, as the private landowners, have endeavoured throughout the years to make this historical area  as fully accessible to the general public as possible.Our use of introducing a few sheep to graze down the grass over certain months of the year is our preferred method but often, when summer visitors appear, we find the animals get frequently disturbed and distressed with human contact , and very often remove them in busy months to avoid any upset.The larger access gate is frequently left wide open, leading to constant rounding up of the livestock and  posing a danger to the passing road users, with even the odd complaint about our animals ‘deposits’  around the Footprints area coming into the equation too.Changing climate conditions have ensured that bracken and other plant species have increased in volume as every year passes and with worry about the decreasing insect population and visiting dogs perhaps being harmed by ingesting sprayed grass, we have never used any chemical solutions to help keep the undergrowth at bay.Strimming has been used on occasions  but this, too, has produced complaints from the public about the unnecessary removal of wild flowers and plants that provide food for the visiting bird and butterfly population.Sign posts are often needlessly torn down and often used to fuel beach fires and barbecues, with even the old, fragile, stone dyke surrounding the area being constantly clambered over,  rather than using the access gate, causing stones to be dislodged and even the wall being  deliberately dismantled, in order to use the stones to construct fire pits for outdoor cooking.In short, we’ve found there are never any easy answers when it comes to trying to keep everyone happy.Yours,Catherine Barbour,"},{"url":null,"title":"top artist jolomo finds inspiration on his doorstep","story":"The latest exhibition by John Lowrie Morrison, which opens on Saturdayat the Archway Gallery in Lochgilphead, concentrates on paintings of Crinan and Knapdale, landscapes found within a few miles of his Tayvallich home.Although John’s work is now sought out by collectors all over the world, he continues to exhibit every August at his #local# gallery # this will be his th solo exhibition at the Archway.

It is an intimate world, personal and subjective, the world of our thoughts and feelings. Children live in it quite naturally, but as adults we tend to withdraw from it.#I use high-key expressionist colour to express how I feel about the landscape.#I’ve been painting the area around me now for over  years, and the more I paint Knapdale, the more intensely I use light and colour to express my emotions for the landscape.#John worked for  years as an art teacher at Lochgilphead High School, then in art education with Strathclyde Region before leaving work to paint full-time in .His distinctive colourful landscapes quickly made him one of the Scotland’s most successful painters, with celebrities such as Sting, Madonna, Simon Le Bon and Gregor Fisher collecting his work.Wilma Meikle, who owns the Archway Gallery with her husband Iain, said: #We’re delighted that John has supported the gallery for all these years.

He retired from the House of Lords in , but his lelong interest in and passion for politicsremains intact. And he is as engaged in the principal issue of the day as the rest of us. Not that he is any clearer as to what is going to happen.ldquoItrsquos very dficult to predict what this Prime Minister will do because he has said so many dferent things. He talks about leaving at any cost. He talks about there being a one-in-a-million chance of a No Deal Brexit. I donrsquot think he knows. I donrsquot think anybody knows. I think wersquore flying blind and I think that is deeply dangerous for the country.And how does he feel about that  ldquoExasperation and anger and in a sense, fear. Not for me. Irsquom  and Irsquom comparatively prosperous. One of the things that irks me particularly about leaving the Community is that it wonrsquot be people like me who will suffer. It will be people at the bottom of the heap. It will be the disadvantaged and the dispossessed. It will be generations in -or--yearsrsquo time. We are mortgaging the future of the least well off, and thatrsquos alien to all I believe in.And where in all this does his own party stand  Whither Labour  Does he know  ldquoNo. One of my complaints is we have failed to adopt a serious position over the great issue of our time, perhaps the great issue of the century where Britainrsquos future lies. Our party doesnrsquot have a firm position in either direction.Note that ldquowe. Hattersley remains a Labour man through and through. He is probably best known for his time as the partyrsquos deputy leader through the s when Neil Kinnock was trying tothe party to power during the Thatcher years. He was always seen to be on the right of the party, although today he declares himself a ldquoradical socialist. And he was critical of the Blair government at the turn of the century. The question today is what he feels about the party now.Later this week he is in Scotland to tell us. He is appearing at the Edinburgh International Book Festival to talk about the future of the party he has served for so long. What hersquos actually going to say, though, hersquos slightly reluctant to tell me.ldquoThere are a number of things the Labour party has to do to recover and get itself back into the mainstream of politics, he argues. ldquoBut Irsquom not going to tell you what they are. Otherwise, no one will come.For a few minutes we circle around the subject. Is the leadership part of the problem, I ask  ldquoYes. And I shall deal with that.Can that be changed  ldquoYou are going into forbidden territory, he says, laughing.Well, would it be fair to say that Corbynism is a kind of mirror image of Blairism, both movements in their own way deeply inimical to what the Labour party should stand for ldquoNo. I had very many reservations about New Labour because I am a radical socialist and Irsquom not sure they were. I believe in equality and Irsquom not sure they did. Some people will blame Corbynism on New Labour and the Third Way, but I donrsquot believe they are responsible for it. I believe that Blairrsquos was a good government that made one terrible mistake with Iraq. But, my word,Tony was leading the Labour party now, I think it would look very dferent.The ultimate question that must be asked, I suggest, is what Labour stands for now. ldquoYou are asking the fundamental question Irsquom addressing on Thursday. What is the Labour party for  And Irsquom going to say we havenrsquot made it clear what wersquore for. We were always, since our foundation, reluctant to talk about the principles, the ideology. Wersquod just rather get on with it. And now is a time when we have to define what we are for, what we are about.Whatever his opinion of the current Labour leadershipHattersley thinks there is no shortage of talent on the Labour benches. ldquoThe parliamentary party is more full of talent than any time in my political experience. Night after night you put Newsnight or Channel  News on and some backbencher yoursquove never heard of ndash quite often a young woman ndash will speak with immense ability, grasp, confidence, understanding. The parliamentary Labour party is full of people of very high quality. They need to say what we stand for.When it comes to Scotland, he is, as you might expect, a Unionist. ldquoBut I understand part of the reason for Scottish nationalism. And part of the reason is not just the desire for independence. Itrsquos that the Scottish National Party filled the radical vacuum that was in part left by Blairism. The Labour party lost some of its radical edge and the SNP took over. So,we had a genuinely radical Labour party ndash not an extreme Labour party ndash I think Labour would do much better than it is doing in Scotland.That may be wishful thinking on his part. But then, as he says, he can recall a time when Scotland had no Tory MPs. Hattersleyrsquos political le covers most of the post-war period and the sht from welfare state consensus to the confused, atomised, political present. He was born in  and served as the MP for Birmingham Sparkbrook from  to .He also had, as politicians of his era did, a hinterland. Hattersley has also been a successful writer. In his last book, Catholics, published two years ago, he revealed that his mother Enid OrsquoHara, ran away with a priest, Frederick Hattersley, two weeks after he had officiated at her wedding to another man. Itrsquos a remarkable revelation. Did learning his fatherrsquos story change how he looked back on his own le, I wonder  He thinks not.ldquoI wish I had known about it because my father and I were very close. But he was a very self-effacing, retiring, shy sort of man and I would have liked to known about this heroic moment in his le when he did this, in my view, wonderful thing. And it makes me unhappy because I think he didnrsquot tell me because he thought I would be ashamed of him. In fact, I would have been very proud of him and I wish I had known about it.When he was  Hattersley read a book about equality and it changed his le. Politics suddenly seemed a worthy ambition. The frustration may be that, after serving in the Harold Wilson and Jim Callaghan governments in the late s and through the s, he spent the rest of his political career in opposition as Labour toiled during the s and early s.What he did achieve in that time was to see off Militant, one of the things, Hattersley says, he feels most proud of. ldquoFor two or three years, two or three of us, two of us really, John Smith and me, spent our time going around the country saying the Labour party is better than it sounds. Speaking out for the real Labour party in the country. And somebody needs to do that again. Because some of the old people, literally some of those expelled years ago, are now back with card-carrying Labour membership doing the damage they did before. So, we must go over all that ground again. And I hope some people will emerge who will do it.John Smithrsquos untimely death in  left us pondering one of the great what s of modern British politics. Whathe had lived to lead the Labour Party into the  general election  Hattersley is in no doubt.ldquoIf John had lived, we would have had a proper Labour government. He would have won the election. He probably wouldnrsquot have won it with as big a majority as Tony. Tony reached middle classes that John probably wouldnrsquot have reached. But he would have certainly won the election. And not only would Britain have changed, the world would have changed, too. We wouldnrsquot have had Iraq. The damage that was done to Britain and the world from John Smithrsquos death is incalculable.Roy Hattersley will discuss ldquoThe Labour Partyrsquos Future this Thursday at the Edinburgh International Book Festival, at .pm."},{"url":null,"title":"iain-macwhirter-john-mcdonnells-edinburgh-declaration-caught-scottish-political-world-completely-surprise","story":"If anyone tells you that theyd expected this, theyre lying.

Labour, at a UK level, has started to think about forming much wider political alliances in future in order to defeat the rising tide of the right. This has been discussed by a number of Labour people, including the former BBC economics editor Paul Mason in his book Clear Bright Future.Mason has argues that Labour should abandon its traditional base in the white working class and the trades union movement, and look to creating a new progressive alliance, or ldquopopular front, with LGBT and BAME groups, and with other progressive political parties. Mason regards the SNP, unlike most other nationalist parties, as progressive and social democratic. On the eve of McDonnells Edinburgh interview Mason called infor ldquoa penalty-free independence referendum whenever Holyrood chooses.Im not saying that Paul Mason is writing Labour policy. Far from it. Many in the party regard him with suspicion, not least for appearing to abandon the working class. But it looks asthe Labour leadership has finally been persuaded that the SNP is not just a band of ldquotartan Tories, and that Jeremy Corbyn could do business with Nicola Sturgeon.Scottish Labour is anyway likely to be crushed again in the forthcoming General Wlection, while the SNP is in line for around  Westminster seats according to the polls. Its support would almost certainly be requiredLabour is to try to form a government, and McDonnells intervention could be an attempt to prepare the ground. Theres been no love lost between Corbyn and the mostly Blairite rump of the Scottish Labour Party, so he probably regards them as expendable.Not that Labour is admitting any of this. Indeed, the line from McDonnell in Edinburgh, echoed by the Shadow Business Secretary, Rebecca Long-Bailey on Newsnight, is that Labour will not form any ldquocoalitions or pacts with anyone. Labour is still smarting from those Tory election posters in  which showed the then leader, Ed Miliband, in Alex Salmonds breast pocket. It is imperative for Labour, in England at least, to deny any hint of an alliance with the SNP.But Scotland is a dferent. A ing Labour government in Westminster would require the tacit assistance of the SNP, perhaps on a confidence and supply basis. At any rate, the UK party leadership seems to have decided that offering a referendum is a risk worth taking to help some future co-operation to happen. This is huge development and raises questions about whether Labour can still be called a Unionist party.Paul Hutcheon: the biggest threat to the Union is Scottish Labours disintegrationLast week felt asa dam has broken. After three years in which Scottish politics has been in suspended animation, suddenly everyone was talking about independence again. Even Conservative commentators like The Times Iain Martin are now calling for a referendum in five years. s Simon Jenkins believes independence itself is now unavoidable, and called on Westminster to plan for it now.Of course, a referendum may not deliver a Yes. The polls still show Scotland split down the middle on independence. But this is a vindication of Nicola Sturgeons cautious, constitutional approach to winning independence. It is a blow to her critics, who had been calling for an unauthorised referendum, or even UDI. The former SNP MP, George Kerevan, had been calling for mass civil disobedience to obstruct London transport. But this is a blow her internal critics will be happy to take for there is now a real possibility of a referendum in the next couple of years.That isLabour manages to defeat Boris Johnson ndash a big ask, perhaps, but far from impossible. There will likely be a vote of no confidence the Tory PM next month, and he will almost certainly lose. If Labour fails to form an alternative government in  days, then Johnson has to call a General Election. Hes hoping to delay polling day until after Brexit on October . But that is a risky tactic. Such constitutional jiggery pokery could easily alienate voters, many of whom are anyway unconvinced by Johnsons abilities.Just about anything could happen in the next few weeks. But what is not in doubt is that Scottish independence, or at least a referendum, is back on the agenda. And almost exactly five years since the last one."},{"url":null,"title":"revealed-uk-shoppers-want-39-perfect-39-community-high-street","story":"In a land of strip malls, edge-of-town supermarkets and soulless retail parks, shoppers still dream of traditional mom and pop stores.A survey , adults has found a real community shopping street should have baker, a butcher, a barber, post office, and hardware store.And even in an era of downloads, those surveyed said they would want a record shop.So we all know want makes the perfect high street.

for a firm in Tyndrum, Argyll, after it received the necessary funding to buy the excavation equipment needed to start work at the site.Scotgold Resources has been working to reopen an abandoned gold mine in Cononish for  years and claims it will now be able to begin commercial gold production later this year.If successful, this will be the first time in decades that the precious metal has been mined in Scotland.Richard Gray, managing director and CEO at Scotgold, said he believes the the project will ldquoprovide a signicant boost to the local economy around Tyndrum.In the latest raft of funding for the firm, finance provider Simply has loaned the project pound,, which has been used to purchase equipment including an excavator, a loading shovel and a dumper.It is hoped that this will give the firm the last push it needs to be fully operational by the end of the year.Ross Pickburn, regional sales manager at Simply, said: ldquoThis was an incredibly interesting deal to work on, not least because it was the first gold mine Irsquod ever helped fund.ldquoItrsquos great working with a company that produces Scottish gold and a team that is creating jobs in the area.ldquoWe got to know about the needs of the company and were able to structure a deal that worked for all parties.Scotgold acquired the Cononish site in  and has embarked on a long journey to bring the mine up to a workable state and start producing gold.Planning permission for the project has been agreed, subject to certain conditions, by Loch Lomond and Trossachs National Park Authority, while the business also recently renegotiated and extended a secured loan deal with Nat le Roux, its chairman and ldquomajor shareholder.The loan facility from Mr le Roux, who is a former chief executive of the IG Group, is said to have increased by up to poundm to poundm.At one point Scotgold predicted that gold and silver production at the site could reach as much as pound million per year over a seven-year lespan.However, this has changed over time due to fluctuations in the price of gold.Experts think there could be as much as five tonnes of gold to be found in the hills near Tyndrum, encased in quartz which must be dug out and crushed.Up to , ounces of precious metals could be mined per year, and the project could create around  jobs for local people.Villagers in nearby Tyndrum, a popular stop on the route north to Glencoe and Fort William, hope to open a visitors centre and market Cononish gold to tourists.Scotgold produced its first gold from Cononish several years ago during a bulk ore processing trial at the site.It was later sold for an average of pound, per ounce, a more than three-fold premium on the average gold price of the day.The mineral was sold in the form of ldquorounds minted by Baird and Co Bullion Merchants.The first round, embossed, like all the coins, with a stagrsquos head, was snapped up by Graham Donaldson, a Scotgold shareholder who lives in Christchurch, Dorset.His bid of pound,.p was the highest.At the time of the sale, he said: ldquoAs to what I would do with it now, I would probably look at it and stroke it, and put it in a safe.Mr Donaldson said he and his we planned in time to get new engagement and wedding rings made from Cononish gold, to replace the budget rings they bought when they married.ldquoThose are worn thin, he added.Scotgold, which also has offices in West Perth, Australia, believes its gold will attract a premium price as a niche product for tourists, jewellers and couples keen on Scottish gold wedding or engagement rings.The firm also previously announced it had struck a deal with a prominent jeweller to manufacture the first items made from Scottish gold.Exploration work in another area - the Grampian gold project - is also continuing, with a view to potentially developing sites in the Ochils, Glen Orchy, Glen Lyon, Inverliever and Knapdale under Crown Estate ldquooption

wind and watertight accommodation in remote locations which are left unlocked for anyone to use and have become popular with hillwalkers and climbers.Scattered throughout the wilder parts of Scotland, England and Wales they are the shepherdsrsquo cottages, huts and similar buildings many of which in the normal course of events might be allowed to fall derelict.Very few are less than a century old and the ravages of time, climate and remoteness makes maintenance a challenge.Now it has emerged that in a bid to make them fit for the st century, a record amount has been spent to get them into shape.Repairs and updates to the tune of pound, have been made over a year to continue to offer a safe place for climbers out in the mountains.The Mountain Bothy Association was founded  years ago by Bernard Heath after he spotted a remark in the visitor book at the Backhill of the Bush bothy in Galloway Forest park, suggesting the setting up of a club to save a growing number of deserted farm buildings from ruin.He felt a collective effort was needed to keep the abandoned cottages and huts weatherproof in order ldquoto maintain simple shelters in remote country for the use and benefit of all who love wild and lonely places.The charity now runs over  bothies across the UK with the vast majority being in Scotland. They obtain the ownersrsquo permission to maintain buildings as bothies and to make them available as open shelters.MBA volunteers are tasked with visiting the buildings to look for any structural faults or cosmetic issues that need fixing or more fundamental renovation. And it is the volunteers that carry out the restoration and maintenance work which is financed by member subscriptions and by donations.The charity revealed that their latest annual spending on the bothies has risen by % and expect that the expenditure will not stop there.Neil Stewart of the MBA said: \"We now look after  bothies plus two emergency mountain shelters throughout Scotland, Wales and northern England.\"Through membership fees and generous donations we managed to spend a record sum of pound, on bothy maintenance in  and managed to increase our membership to over , - an increase of %.\"These buildings are however in remote areas and subject to the worst ravages of the weather so ongoing repair and maintenance is required. We look forward to continuing our efforts in years to come to provide open shelters in remote country for use by outdoor enthusiasts.\"Its biggest task in  was taking over the Garbh Choire refuge hut deep in the Cairngorms National Park and doing extensive work to bring it into use as part of the scheme.Among the projects was a former schoolhouse at Duag Bridge in the northern Highlands, which had declined to a state of dereliction, which was taken on as a new bothy by the association and fully renovated.Camban bothy in the western Highlands, which has been an MBA-maintained building for  years, was given another major renovation with volunteers undertaking work over a number of weeks.Concerns over bats delayed progress in getting Willrsquos Bothy in working order in southern Scotland, but the MBA say they still hope to have work completed this year.In its latest annual report for  the trustees of the MBA said: \"The Association believes it has a duty to care for the quality of the experience enjoyed by those who visit bothies, and to ensure that all those who are involved in outdoor recreation understand the fragile nature of this resource, and the impact their behaviour can have on the bothy and its environment.\"In general, the work of the association continues to be a success. We are achieving our objective in maintaining simple shelters in remote country for the use and benefit of all who love wild and lonely places.\"A bothy would not normally be connected to the public utilities, and any amenities provided would be of a very basic standard.In areas there is an appreciable fire hazard, or limited fuel, existing fireplaces may be replaced by a stove.The increase in spending comes a month after a bid was being being made to stamp out antisocial behaviour, vandalism and fire-raising at remote bothies in southern Scotland.Police said they wanted to ensure the shelters were \"used for the purpose they are intended for\".In one recent incident a group of hillwalkers was denied access by a \"bothy full of revellers\" and later had to be rescued off a hillside.Bothy Watch aims to raise awareness and keep the buildings free from damage.A wide range of groups including Forestry and Land Scotland, the Mountain Bothies Association , local authorities and mountain rescue team volunteers are involved in the initiative."},{"url":null,"title":"cultural-sports-attendances-soar-glasgow","story":"In the  years since the organisationrsquos creation, attendances have increased by . million, from . million in the first year to . million last year.Kelvingrove and Riverside museums attracted more than . million visitors each, while Glasgow Club facilities welcomed attendance figures of around . million.There were . million recorded visits to the cityrsquos  libraries, including The Mitchell, while music venues such as Glasgow Royal Concert Hall, City Halls, Old Fruitmarket and the Kelvingrove Bandstand attracted more than , customers.:Harry Potter route still waiting for ScotRails scenic trainsCouncillor David McDonald, Glasgow Le chair, said: ldquoWe deliver for the people of Glasgow and thanks to our incredible staff and volunteers we are changing lives for the better.ldquoMore people are getting fit and physically active more people are engaging with, and enjoying, our cultural assets more people are benefitting from services which are rooted in, and valued by, their local communities.ldquoGlasgow is home to iconic cultural and sporting venues, world-class events and community facilities which make a dference each and every day.ldquoTo achieve record-breaking attendances of almost  million in the last year is testament to that success.:An updated guide to Scotland - with a distinctly Outlander themeOther events which boosted the figures include the inaugural Glasgow  European Championships, Celtic Connections and World Pipe Band Championships.Dr Bridget McConnell CBE, Glasgow Le chief executive, said: ldquoWersquove enjoyed another exceptional year.ldquoFrom stand-out events such as the  European Championships, to bringing Dippy the dinosaur to Kelvingrove, wersquove worked to provide opportunities which touch the lives of citizens and visitors alike.ldquoOn the global stage we excel, but in our communities, the work we do changes lives.

It was during the study of his PhD in Place Based Education that the idea began to crystallise.He said: ldquoI was thinking about the shieling as a way of educating kids because thatrsquos how they learned about the wider natural landscape. In the old days, they went up to the shieling, they found about all the place names and all the plants and animals out there.ldquoI loved the idea of kids being in the outdoors, running around the hills, learning about them, looking after the cows, fending off the wolves, singing all the songs around the fireplace.ldquoEventually, I just kind got to a stage where I had no choice but to start.Six years on and the project now has  employees who welcome school and private groups to pitch in while learning lost skills.The project represents the value of how communities used to live. Dr Harrison said: ldquoItrsquos a reminder that we managed to live for a very long time in a sustainable way. There were more people living off the land who were were self sufficient.Careful not to romanticise what would have been a hard le, Dr Harrison believes modern societies would only benefit from reconnecting with the wild.He said: ldquoI think nowadays when we think about environmental issues, we just think humans are bad but the Shieling is giving children a story that people arenrsquot inherently bad but were part of a healthy eco-system.ldquoThe Shieling is a little tradition that has got a big message about what wersquore struggling with today about sustainable communities.Children, young people and adults come to the project to learn how to tend to animals, grow food, cook and turn off their devices to collaboratively create a culture for themselves through songs, storytelling and film.Guests help construct low carbon buildings and monitor the energy they are using while on site.:Dr Harrison said: ldquoTypically environmental education has been disaster education. How rubbish everything is, attempting to motivate change by guilt and shame. Here, and especially for children, we think that a stronger motivation is love, enjoyment, care for a place.ldquoHere we let people experience a bit of off grid living and be outside for long periods of time. All this adds up to skills for a sustainable future, but it also adds up to fun, to a sense of mental and physical well-being.Dr Harrison hopes that visitors might then see any changes they need to make to adapt to and mitigate climate change as positive.He said: ldquoIn terms of educating children like this, the idea is that we try and use practical experiences so wersquore getting peoplersquos bodies and minds engaged, because most of schooling is either sitting being told stuff or is virtual and itrsquos not engaging peoplersquos bodies and hearts, as well as their minds.It is during the practical experiences of making a basket or digging up peat or feeding calves where young people can think through the ideas they are being taught and ldquolive through some of the big questions being asked.Dr Harrison said: ldquoYou canrsquot ask a child what a stable future looks like and expect an answer in a minute. They need weeks or years or lives to think about that. And they also need to experience it, rather than just have it as an abstract thing, because thatrsquos the problem with all these big things like climate change, sustainability, and bioersity, theyrsquore so huge. How do you get hold of it  How do you understand it  How do you make it real in a way that you can hold on to and do something about it ldquoOtherwise, itrsquos just like, lsquooh, Irsquom scared about thatrsquo, because itrsquos just an idea.The untraditional gender politics of the historical shielings is another teaching arm of Dr Harrisonrsquos programme. While the men remained in the low lands with the burgeoning crops, the women took the cattle, and therefore all the wealth, up to graze.He said: ldquoThat alone was fairly unusual in some of these traditional cultures where the men tend to be fairly entrenched in their power positions.Children are ldquowonderfully resilient, and flexible and open to new ideas but are not able to make the choices about how they live and what they do.Dr Harrison said: ldquoWhat wersquore trying to do is show that sustainability is a way of being happier and healthier and having fun.ldquoWe want them to see that we can build up build some of our buildings, we can grow some of our food, we can take our entertainment, art, and cultural experience back into our own control and do it ourselves. We can actually have a feeling that wersquore involved in our landscape and our community.The beauty of the project is that it looks both backwards and forwards to inform its teachings.Dr Harrison said: ldquoWersquore asking what the future is going to look like, and what does that mean to you."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-working-class-solidarity-not-end-borders","story":"In  Labour, the Liberal Democrats, the STUC, the Scottish churches and civic Scotland agreed the Claim of Right which asserted the sovereignty of Scotland within the UK. It stated that the signatories acknowledge the sovereign right of the Scottish people to determine the form of government best suited to their needs and do hereby declare and pledge that in all our actions and deliberations their interests shall be paramount. The Claim of Right was launched at a historic ceremony in the General Assembly Hall in Edinburgh. I attended as Vice -Chairman of the Scottish Labour Party. It was signed by every Labour and Liberal Democrat MP who were currently serving, including Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling, except Tam Dalyell. The Claim of Right was the genesis for the  Scotland Referendum which led to the re-establishment of the Scottish Parliament. The Claim of Rights was endorsed by the Annual Conference of the Scottish Labour Party and this position has never been rescinded.This does not mean that Scottish Labour cannot campaign against independence in a referendum as they did in , supporting the status quo or some form of devo max. However, I agree with our former First Minister, Henry McLeish that Scottish Labour must have positive and radical policies for a new constitutional settlement.Richard Leonard passionately argues that the problems and solutions for working people are class-related and not those of national identity. He is right. But where and at what level those class solutions are applied are for voters to decide on tactical and other considerations. Working-class solidarity does not and never has ended at borders.There is also a lot of hypocrisy from Labour MPs and MSPs who support a second referendum on Brexit but oppose a second referendum on independence, the democratic principles are the same.I am a long-time supporter of devolution of power not just to the countries and regions of Britain but to communities. Our unwritten constitution is in desperate need of reform, a fairer voting system, abolition of the unelected House of Lords, an elected head of state with specied powers to hold ministers to account, and much more.Bob Thomson, Past chairman treasurer, Scottish Labour Party, Glasgow G.AS a \"tribal\" Labour voter who may never vote Labour again, could I suggest to Jeremy Corbyn, John McDonnell, Diane Abbott, et al that they should consider leaving and, instead, take over an obscure student union somewhere far away and play their infantile games there, as this is clearly their level. This would allow the grown-ups a chance to revive a once-great party and provide a credible challenge to one of the worst governments in living history.Jim White, Glasgow G.REGARDING the many letters you have published over recent days about the increasing woes of the Labour Party, I note that they iniably refer to \"Scottish Labour\" or even the \"Scottish Labour Party\", but according to the Electoral Commission, Labour in Scotland is registered merely as an accounting unit of the UK Labour Party.It is hard to whip up enthusiasm for an accounting unit, and as Richard Leonard sits Miss Haversham-like in his branch office,amid the ruins of his expectations, he should admit thathe and his members have no aspirations for their Scottish accounting unit it is hardly surprising they have no aspirations for Scotland.Ruth Marr, Stirling.THE SNP would like Scotland to leave the UK but remain in the EU. However,Scotland left the UK, before or after the UK left the EU, then Scotland would be both outside the EU and outside the UK.Most people would agree that for Scotland to prosper it must agree trading terms with both the rUK and the EU, possibly becoming an EU member state. I am told by nationalists that the UK Government does not care about Scottish interests. Nationalists portray Westminster as the villain. Irsquom then puzzled by the seemingly contradictory idea that somehow Westminster would be better disposed towards Scotlandit were to become independent. I would have thought a separate rUK would put its own interests first and at the expense of Scotlandrsquos. While Irsquom sure Scotland could become an EU member, the terms of its joining are not decided by the people or the Government of Scotland, it would be on EU terms.Outside both the UK and EU, Scotland would need to find secure trading partners and make trade agreements quickly. This is also the weakness in Brexit it is not a strong negotiating position, even for a large country. The argument that Scotland has great natural assets that other countries will compromise their interests over is simply wrong. Except for niche brand luxury products, for example whisky, there is nothing that can be found in Scotland that cannot be sourced, cheaper and in greater quantity where, this includes financial services, energy, petrochemicals, timber and food.I suggest it would be a serious mistake to leave the UK, eventhe UK leaves the EU. There is little to be gained from compounding the current Brexit situation. If Scotland left the UK I think many people would be disappointed with the result.James Reilly, Turrf.CHRISTINE Grahame, SNP MSP , displays selective memory loss. She should try to remember, had we voted Yes in  we would be out of both the UK and EU by now. We voted to stay part of the UK in the full knowledge there was to be a later UK-wide vote to remain or leave the EU.This was not a four-part membership of the EU so collectively the UK voted Leave. Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon were quite happy to drag Scotland out and Leave both unions.Scotlandrsquos votes in several previous General elections have determined what colour of government sat in Westminster without feigned outrage from the losing voters in England. You canrsquot always get what you want, that is democracy at work. To use the SNPrsquos own warped logic, the Kingdom of Fe, Orkney and Shetland Isles, and the Lord of theIsles could all cry ldquoFreedom and demand independence.Allan Thompson, Bearsden."},{"url":null,"title":"mark-smith-wings-scotland-party-good-idea-theory-just-look-ways-turn-yes-no","story":"Anyway, the more important question is: how seriously should we take his theory, which is that a new party could maximise the pro-independence vote at the next Scottish election  Mr Campbell thinks the new party may be necessary because he knows therersquos a risk the  vote wonrsquot produce an independence-supporting majority. And so, hersquos thinking a new pro-yes party could bring in more regional list votes for the cause.On the face of it, the theory seems sound. The Holyrood electoral system was set up with the aim of making it dficult for any one party to get a majority which means a party that performs well in the first-past-the-post seats will find it harder to make gains on the regional lists.:Jim Sillars: Wings over Scotland plan for a new party could \"split\" pro-indy voteYou can see this from the last election. The SNP did well in the list vote, but because it also did well on first-past-the-post, it was the other, mainly unionist parties that picked up the list MSPs. Mr Campbellrsquos idea is that a Wings party could change this by taking some of the list votes that are being ldquowasted on the SNP, therefore increasing the chances of a Yes majority.But the theory has over-looked two important factors. First, the SNP wonrsquot stand for it. At the last election, they ran a ldquoBoth votes SNP campaign based on the theory thatthey lost some first-past-the-post seats, they could pick up seats on the regional list ndash and that was despite the fact there were other pro-independence parties standing on the list, such as Rise and the Greens. Adding another party based on Wings is not going to change that.Second, Mr Campbellrsquos theory is based on the idea the SNP will broadly retain the number of first-past-the-post seats they have at the moment, but thatrsquos far from certain. Whether we like it or not, the next Scottish election will be fought on a single issue ndash whether the pro-Yes parties should be given a majority to demand another referendum ndash and in that scenario many,not most, supporters of the union will vote tactically against the SNP, and that means the party could lose some first-past-the-post seats. Combined with losing list votes to Wings, this could put a pro-independence majority at risk.There are also particular problems with a party based on the Wings brand, the main one being its aggressive image. Mr Campbellrsquos traditional response to this has effectively been ldquochill, itrsquos just banter but the SNP leadership knows the more aggressive nationalists have damaged the cause in the past and a party based on Wings would only heighten the problem. Yes, any Wings party would only be an outer limb of the Yes movement, but political poison could spread quickly through the bloodstream.:Labours Tom Watson: Scottish indyref is not the answerThe Wings party would also do something  damaging: it would draw attention to the dis-satisfaction within the Yes movement ndash indeed, the ision appears to be one of the reasons Mr Campbell is considering starting up the party in the first place.In his blog discussing the idea for example, Mr Campbell said SNP supporters didnrsquot want to vote for ldquoextreme radical fringe parties like the Greens because they donrsquot want to ldquofill womenrsquos changing rooms and toilets with male rapists. This, of course, is a reference to his opposition to the proposals to allow trans people to identy their own gender, but itrsquos only one of the SNP policies he dislikes.You might say: who cares about these disagreements over policy as long as everyone agrees on the bigger aim of independence  But part of the success of the yes movement in  in growing so rapidly was that the dferent groupings more or less fell in behind Alex Salmond. A new Wings party, on the other hand, could provide a mouthpiece to those within the independence movement who are unhappy with Nicola Sturgeon over a range of issues: among them, trans rights, the timing of a second referendum, and the swing towards austerity, as some see it, that was signalled with the Growth Commission. If the yes movement is, and looks, ided ndash particularly over the economy ndash voters will fear a Brexit-style debacle and will be more likely to vote no.And, finally, we have the image problem: what would a Wings Over Scotland party actually look and sound like  Famously, David Cameron once dismissed UKIP as a bunch of fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists and therersquos a real danger that a Wings party would attract people from the extremities of the independence movement in a similar way.You know the ones I mean. The ones who are blatantly anti-English. The ones whose arms ache from waving saltires. The ones who believe Mr Campbell didnrsquot really lose the defamation case against Kezia Dugdale. And the ones who suggested that the women who accused Alex Salmond of sexual assault might have ldquothrown themselves at him. Presumably some of this bunch would stand for the Wings party and what a sight that would make.I appreciate, of course, that none of this may happen in the end, but the success Mr Campbell has made of his blog would suggest therersquos a decent chance of him making a success of a party too.The problem is that, in real politics, the megaphone hersquos been pointing at people who think like him will be turned on an entirely dferent audience: voters who need to be convinced therersquos a coherent, rational and calm plan for Scottish independence.Those kind of voters are unlikely to be impressed by Mr Campbellrsquos aggressive style.

Internal features such as stone benches have also been found along either side.The hall is oriented towards the sea and finds include steatite , pottery, a bone spindle whorl and a fragment of a Norse bone comb.The find provides tantalising evidence of the earliest phases of inhabitation on this farm and settlement mound which may well have been inhabitated for over , years.It provides another piece to the ,-year jigsaw along this archaelogy rich stretch of coast as Westness in Rousay — described as the #Egypt of the North#.A team of archaeologists from the University of the Highlands and Islands Archaeology Institute, Rousay residents and students have been digging at the site for a number of years, investigating the later stages of the farm complex and its waste heaps with a particular focus on past diet, farming and fishing practices.Although only partly uncovered at this stage, the Skaill hall has parallels with other Norse halls excavated in Orkney, such as Snusgar, and where in Scotland.The excavation is part of the Landscapes of Change — Archaeologies of the Rousay Clearances and Westness Estate project which is exploring the Skaill farmstead.The present farm at Skaill dates to the th and th centuries and was part of the Rousay clearances during the mid-th century.The name Skaill suggests the site was home to a Norse hall or drinking hall, and was a high status site.Westness is mentioned in Orkneyinga saga as the home of Sigurd, a powerful chieftain, so it was always likely that a Norse settlement was located somewhere at Skaill.Earlier structures have been found below the present farm during previous seasons, and this season explored more of the Norse phases of the site.Three dimensional models of the farmstead can be found here.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Now, licensed sellers from Orkney will have a chance to develop the market for their product and people can try goose for themselves, on Orkney, and across Scotland.“Wild geese are an important part of Scotland’s nature, but their rapid rise in numbers has been challenging for farmers and crofters. Striking the balance between conservation, farming and hunting can be dficult. Our goal is to give farmers and crofters the tools they need to safeguard their crops, enabling them to control goose numbers sustainably, and sell goose meat for profit.”Until now, meat generated by the Orkney resident greylag goose project could only be sold locally by retailers based on Orkney.SNH is working to secure longer-term arrangements for the sale of resident greylag goose meat in Scotland.

The Scotsman believes Mr Brown to be entirely correct.Prime Minister Boris Johnson campaigned for the UK to leave the EU on the promise that the process would be straightforward and the benefits great and bounteous. Only those in the most profound state of denial can still believe that.Mr Brown warns that the UK is now sleepwalking into oblivion. This may be true of those who continue to believe the fairytales peddled by pro-Brexit politicians but those who are leading the charge for the UK to crash out of the EU, without even the mitigation of a deal, know precisely what they are doing. Rather than sleepwalking, they are wide-eyed and energised. Those who have voted Labour in the past - indeed, anyone who believes in the value of a decent and thoughtful politics - may find it rather depressing that Mr Brown has had to fill the intellectual void on Brexit created by the current leader of the opposition, Jeremy Corbyn.It is Mr Corbyn who should be making the case against a No Deal Brexit but his career-long Euroscepticism and his lack of political acumen mean he is a completely ineffectual figure in this debate. In fact, he barely registers as a participant in these must turbulent of times.In Mr Corbyn’s absence, Mr Brown warns that the ideals of an inclusive outward-looking Britishness could not survive the isiveness and chaos of a no-deal Brexit and insists that No Deal Brexit must be stopped in its tracks.However, eventhe will to stop the UK crashing out of the EU without a deal exists in the House of Commons, they may be unable to act,The Institute for Government warns that MPs may have limited opportunities to stop a No Deal scenario. It looks increasingly likely that the UK’s exit from the EU will be brutal and messy. The Scotsman believes this will represent a catastrophic act of recklessness on the part of the Prime Minister and his acolytes.

But now that Lord Ashcroft’s poll has confirmed that the feeling ismutual, there’s been a tidal wave of influential opinion pieces from the English left, urging Scots to launch the leboats and save ourselves. According to Matthew Norman in the Independent: “Were I Scottish, I would be mad for independence. I’d say sod the crude oil price [and] sod the Barnett formula.” Last week John McDonnell’s surprise revelation that Labour will not block a second independent referendum prompted the ’s John Harris to promise: “If another independence vote materialised … I would be back there [Scotland] in a flash, to seeat least one part of these islands can leave behind the current wretchedness, and find something better.” Yesterday the Observer carried a long piece from Aberdeenshire, where  per cent voted No in . Harriet Sherwood observed: “In Inverurie’s market square, most willing to express a view appeared to favour independence. But many who declined to discuss their political leanings may be supporters of the Union.” That’s perfectly true, but Sherwood’s piece is full of quotes from No voters ready to publicly admit they’ve changed their minds or at least are open to argument. Simon Jenkins’ no-holds-barred Comment is Free column last week was the most widely circulated on social media. Clearly no heartfelt supporter of independence, Jenkins surveyed the long history of English indference to first Irish and then Scottish Home Rule campaigns, compared Scotland’s flatlining GDP with that of soaring Denmark and suggested “separatists” should thank Boris and Brexit for hammering the final nails into the Union’s coffin: “If I were a Scot, I would vote for independence tomorrow. I would want nothing more to do with the shambles of today’s Westminster Parliament.”Scots-born Times’ columnist Iain Martin insists the end of the Union isn’t preordained but admits the “most ominous news for unionists” was that only  per cent of Ashcroft’s poll sample thought Scotland would vote to stay in the UK in a second independence poll. Actually the truly ominous news was probably already known. The UK Government’s private polling has remained unpublished in Scotland for obvious reasons – but Boris Johnson would be well aware of its contents. So, everything from the “do or die” Brexit declaration to the ridiculous  pence coin “celebration” has occurred in the full knowledge they are driving Scots towards independence. Clearly the Minister for the Union believes that’s a price worth paying. Martin’s solution has already been outlined by others without the capacity to enact it: “A commission devolving maximum powers across Britain, on taxation, for example, and something closer to a federal collection of states, pooling defence and foreign affairs [with] an elected replacement for the Lords in the shape of a Britain-wide senate.” Friend, it ain’t gonna happen and everyone knows it. Gordon Brown’s weekend intervention ironically confirms that the F-option is stone dead. Five years after his fateful Vow, the former Labour leader insists that, “to prevent the rise and rise of dysal nationalism, the first step is to stop no-deal in its tracks”. Really.Quite apart from the Ashcroft poll’s revelation that  per cent of Scottish Labour voters also back “dysal nationalism” , SNP politicians have been highly visible in the legal action that won the right for MPs to revoke Article  and will be part of this week’s court bid to stop Johnson suspending parliament. Despite taking pelters for their troubles, Nicola Sturgeon and her MPs are trying to stop no-deal in its tracks far more constructively than the party Brown once led. In fact, his stale rhetoric only serves to remind voters that “a system of government as close to federalism as you can have” never materialised. Instead the Brexit power grab and new Westminster plans to spend cash directly in Scotland mean the Vow is meaningless and its architect is lost in time. Still, the intervention of the English Left and prominent Remainers is strange, given that Scotland’s departure would leave them with a near-permanent Tory majority – or whatever worse fate awaits once Brexit delivers economic disaster. Are they motivated by a selfless “you go, because we can’t” sentiment or by enlightened self-interest – “you create a sane, social democracy because we may need escape north soon” A friend went south last month to visit English relatives who were quite hostile to independence first time around. Now they want to knowtheir kids will get passports in the new independent statethey attend Scottish universities now. It certainly seems that many English people are surprisingly clear-sighted and decisive about independence – either from a “glad to see the back of the whining Jocks” perspective or from an honest acknowledgment that Scots “didn’t vote for this mess”. My guess is that important strands of English opinion have never been sentimental about the Union. It’s just been an arrangement that has now run its course – in the view of prominent players on both sides. South of the Border, the Union has been a calculation, not a calling – however overwrought English politicians sometimes contrive to appear.Former Labour MP Tom Harris told Radio Scotland last weekend that the “hard Left” of his party “always regarded the Union as a colonial construct. That’s why Jeremy Corbyn stayed at home on his allotment when Labour MPs came up in .”Perhaps. In Scotland, though, that colonial construct has been much more than a calculation. It’s been cloaked with sentiment, studded with power and fuelled by the chronic fear of failure that bedevils the disempowered. Thanks to Johnson and Brexit, that cloak is slipping to reveal the intractable problems that blight the once gilded Union path. Opinion here is taking a while to turn, but that’s understandable.Folk are detaching from the authority of Westminster and considering the idea of a new independent country without a blueprint to hand. But make no mistake. Quiet consideration is a crucial part of any change process. A final decision needs a final focus – a deadline. And several are fast approaching. ©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"tragic british student was swept out to sea watching south african sunrise","story":"A British university student who went to witness the sun rise on a South African beach died after a powerful wave swept her from a rock and out to sea, an inquest heard.Sinead Moodliar, , a philosophy student at Anglia Ruskin University in Cambridge, was on holiday over the Christmas period last year.She went to see the sun rise at Umhlanaga Rocks, a beach area near Durban, on Boxing Day when she was involved in a \"catastrophic accident\", a hearing in Huntingdon was told on Monday.Cambridgeshires senior coroner David Heming said: \"This is a tragic, catastrophic accident.\"Sinead had gone to a beach area to witness the sunrise.\"While standing on a rocky area, a powerful wave washed her into the sea.\"People on the beach reported hearing screams at .am. - These are the  areas in Scotland with the highest levels of house break-ins Miss Moodliar was dragged from the water by leguards and paramedics resuscitated her, but she died in hospital on December .The inquest was attended by her parents Bob and Noeleen Moodliar, of Wilburton near Ely.Mr Moodliar said he spoke to his daughter while she was in a restaurant on Christmas Day and she \"seemed well and bubbly\", and she later went to the beach.He said he took a flight from the UK to South Africa as soon as he heard his daughter was involved in an accident, but she died before he could arrive.Mr Moodliar said his daughter had been standing on a rock when the wave took her.\"She was just allowing the sea to wash over her feet when this happened,\" he said.\"One wave came and engulfed her and the backwash took her into the sea.\"He said that a witness reported seeing his daughter struggling  metres out when another wave took her.He said leguards were due to start their sht at am but had arrived early as they were expecting large numbers of people on Boxing Day, so were able to rescue his daughter.\"Christmas and Boxing Day, lots of people sleep on the beach even as its their summer so am is quite bright,\" he said.He said the leguards would not have allowed anyone in the sea as it was \"so rough\". - Scottish athlete Eilish McColgan hits out at body shaming trolls Coroner Mr Heming, examining a photograph of the sea on another occasion, said: \"The swell on that is truly frightening.\"He said the \"ferocious turbulence of the sea\" washed Miss Moodliar from the rock.A post-mortem examination, conducted in Durban, recorded Miss Moodliars medical cause of death as complications following near drowning.It noted a head injury consistent with striking a rock as she fell, and lung damage.Mr Heming, extending his condolences to the family, said: \"These are unforeseen incidents that nobody ever caters for.\"He recorded a conclusion of accidental death.Father-of-three Mr Moodliar, who operates a franchise of Subway restaurants, said after the inquest: \"We absolutely miss our daughter.\"We cannot come to terms with the fact shes no longer here.\"He said the family feel asshe is still on holiday.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"edinburgh council leader and partner to become dads for the first time","story":"Cllr Adam McVey will welcome two boys with his partner later this month and will take a six-week break from his busy council duties to look after the new arrivals.The -year-old SNP councillor for Leith is thought to be the first council leader to take adoption leave.He said: ldquoIrsquom very excited that my family is expanding later this month as we become dads for the first time to two amazing boys.ldquoIrsquoll soon be taking adoption leave to start the hardest and most rewarding job Irsquoll ever have.No decision has been taken yet as to who will temporarily take over from Cllr McVey ndash but proposals will be tabled at the next meeting of the full council on Thursday  August and could involve an SNP councillor being given additional duties.Cllr McVey added: ldquoIrsquom acutely aware of my duty to the people of Edinburgh and I look forward to ing to City Chambers to continue delivering the change our future generations demand of us.ldquoIn the meantime, Irsquoll be asking the council to approve cover arrangements while Irsquom on six weeks of adoption leave to cover my responsibilities.

The results are projects which genuinely improve the lives of today#s residents # as well as visitors # and leave a legacy for future generations. What is even more remarkable is the fact these projects are achieved with very little access to loans. The good work of the community trusts is achieved through dogged determination to raise funds within the community combined with seriously clever navigation of the minefield of grant applications. By steadily securing the funds from a myriad public pots and local activities the trusts ensure each project is not only affordable now, but sustainable for generations to come.In Staffin # home to the iconic Old Man of Storr # the local community trust has raised over £, to upgrade existing footpaths and create new ones. There will be new parking, #welcome# structures and interpretation boards at all sites. The whole project will result in what the trust is calling #Skye Ecomuseum# which will encourage visitors to spend more time and therefore more money in Staffin.In the north west of Skye, the Glendale Trust covers a huge area that attracts , visitors a year # many travelling the long and winding single track road to the top five hotspot of Neist Point.The trust, under the leadership of Tim Hunter-Davies and three new directors, is working hard to develop sustainable facilities for the community and tourists. They have taken ownership of Meanish Pier and the foreshore, creating opportunities for local residents and regional businesses alike. It will be run commercially and provide income to enable the Trust to invest in further sustainable community projects.Glendale # which was the subject of Scotland#s first community buyout back in  # is rich in history and the trust is also looking to develop projects that preserve and share the story of the area, as Tim Hunter-Davies explains: #As well as being instrumental in land reform in the last century, Glendale has a rich heritage stretching back through the centuries. A steamer used to sail daily from Loch Dunvegan and was used as a point to transport many people away from Scotland during the Highland clearances. We want to preserve and share our history with the community and visitors.#In south Skye is the Sleat Community Trust. It has been working hard to provide and improve leline services for the community that also benefit visitors arriving and leaving Skye on the Armadale Mallaig ferry.The SCT currently provides shop, post office and fuel services in two buildings no longer fit for purpose. Over £, has been raised from public and private sources to build a new shop with a community #social# space and offices for the employees of the Trust. They hope to open the new shop in early summer .In addition, the purchase by the Trust of the -hectare Tormore Forest in  continues to create additional sources of income, including selling housing plots as well as an attraction for the community and visitors alike. As trust business development manager Mike Shucksmith explains, the success is based on a combination of commercial and voluntary activity.He said: #To maintain the forest, we have to generate income so we sell split logs to the community, create woodchip for biomass boilers and are developing a micro-hydro scheme. At the same time, we have a vibrant volunteer culture in Sleat who have created a network of paths, social areas and a polytunnel where local school children can help grow saplings to regenerate the forest. The trust also operates #Skyenet # a community broadband network # a community transport scheme, Tormore Explore Forest School and the Visit Sleat tourism group, which promotes the area as a destination of choice for visitors.#From the Sleat Peninsula to the gateway to Skye in the south where a new access route to the island is being created by the members of the Broadford and Strath Community Company. They are developing a cycle path all the way from Kyle of Lochalsh to Broadford. One of the project pioneers is keen local cyclist, Andy Neison.#I used to commute from Teangue on Sleat to Kyle by bike,# he said. #I was really unnerved by the road from Breakish to Kyle with a high volume of fast-moving traffic. When friends told me about the old road from Broadford to Kyle I started exploring sections of it. It#s a good starting point and will become a pioneer project for the highlands.#After receiving a grant of £, from Sustrans, a sustainable transport charity, to fund engineering and traffic surveys, the Trust is now working to secure funding for a project officer to take the Skye Cycleway to the next phase. The community is heavily invested in the project with volunteers coming out in all weathers to clear sections of the old road, but this is a long-term project with hundreds of thousands of pounds ultimately needed to complete the full route from Kyle to Broadford.Over the Skye bridge, the Kyle and Lochalsh Community Trust is creating a vast community and visitor experience on a piece of land known as the Plock.Securing funding from the Scottish Land Fund enabled the Trust to take ownership of the Plock and the old Skye Bridge toll office and develop a masterplan for these two community assets. On the Plock itself, there will be a hub building with cafe, carpark and toilets, a network of accessible paths, a #pitch and putt# course, a Viking living village, accommodation pods, a watersports centre, wildle hide and a for thrill-seekers a huge zipline across the bay.Jo Wawrzyczek of the trust expects the Plock to attract , visitors a year. #This is an ambitious project that will cost almost £million,# she said. #However, it is very important for local people and businesses as it will help to create a great community space as well as keep visitors in our community for longer.#The trust also owns and manages the public toilets and pontoons in Kyle which will be a source of income for the project. With the aim of making the project self-sustaining, the Trust plans to lease the café and watersports centre on the Plock as well as generating income through the accommodation pods. Inspired by the success of other community-driven harbour developments such as Tobermory on Mull, Portree and Braes Community Trust want to maximise opportunities for local people and visitors through taking ownership of the harbour and improving facilities.The trust is currently in talks about relocating the oil tanks at the pier head which would be a breakthrough for the project and open up commercial opportunities. They are also considering a new road from the south to improve access and ert traffic away from the town centre. But according to development officer Fiona Thompson a new breakwater and pontoons will be the real game-changer for Portree.She said: #There have been aspirations for improvements to facilities at the harbour for over  years with little major investment.The harbour group are now closer than ever to realizing the community#s vision for a new, vibrant, welcoming port. A breakwater will allow us to provide overnight berths and efficient, comfortable transfer for cruise ship passengers, while a visitor centre will provide a warm highland welcome to visitors from across the globe. This project will be transformational for Portree and surrounding areas.#The community trusts of Skye and Lochalsh all have several features in common. They have vision, ambition, energy and drive and they are full of volunteers who are committed to bringing long-term projects to fruition for the benefit of their community # and their visitors # for decades to come."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Skye-Bridge-2018-winners.jpg","title":"skye bridge 10k race to kick start kyleakin gala","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe first bridge k was held  years ago, and since  hundreds have taken on the challenge in an event which has helped raise thousands of pounds for good causes based in Kyleakin and surrounding areas.back again.Online entry — which is discounted — will be open until Friday th August, or runners can register on the morning of the race for £.

He said around  per-cent of pupils use the canteen and added: \"We source our own supplies and in the last year we have introduced a very successful healthy eating programme. \"One example of this is the childrens chip intake having dropped by two-thirds. \"We have found thatyou offer a range of food thats attractively presented and well prepared the children will eat it and given a little bit of time they will become more adventurous.VARIETY \"We had a meeting last week of a group of school bursars and they said they had never been in a school canteen which served such a iety of food.\" Mr Agnew said the school canteen did not serve fizzy drinks and had non-chip days. \"This is something we have initiated ourselves because we are more concerned with the children eating healthy food than engendering funds. \"But providing processed food is cheaper than purchasing and preparing healthy food, which is harder work for canteen staff and those purchasing our supplies. \"The Government would need to put a bit more money into helping schools provide healthy meals.\" of the cheapest airports to fly from in the UK Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\" St Patricks College principal Donal McCann said he welcomed the junk food ban, but feels it cannot be implemented overnight. \"I think it will have to be a gradual process with a need to educate the children about the benefits of healthy eating,\" he said. \"Having said that we adopted our own healthy eating policy  months ago and removed all vending machines. \"We dont have any fizzy drinks, we have opened a salad bar in the canteen and we are finding that children are interested in eating healthy food. \"Food in the salad bar is made to order, while we also have more traditional school dinners available as well.\"COST Mr McCann said one problem was the extra cost of providing healthy food. \"We have been approached by children asking why we cannot provide the healthy food at the cheaper prices,\" he said. \"But that is not our decision and all we can do is try to use our influence with the Board to seethat can happen. \"Its fair to say that school meals are not funded to the extent they should be.\" Two years ago Banbridge High School became involved in a health promoting schools initiative.

The book states that “being the nineteenth century of the Redemption of mankind” the then Pope, Pius XI, had proclaimed  a “Holy Year”.“These facts have prompted the publishers to devise and reproduce this beautul and artistic Album containing the fourteen ‘Stations of the Cross’,” it states.“The primary purpose of the work of Irish Art is to provide a most appropriate and lasting souvenir for the Catholic home, in honour and commemoration of Holy Year.”It also reveals that the artworks are “exact replicas of the celebrated and valuable set in the Church of Mount Alphonsus, Limerick”, which belonged to the Redemptorist Fathers, who gave permission for their reproduction.According to the Redemptorists in Limerick, the Stations of the Cross in their church date back to  – just four years after the church was officially completed.Explaining his find, Fred said: “I bought it in a massive market in Kildare. I’m  now, so I would say it was about  years ago, maybe more.“I liked it because it was the Stations of the Cross and I thought it maybe would be worth a few bob in a lot of years’ time, but I never tried to sell it or do anything with it. It was exactly like that when I bought it so it was a good few years old then.“I just found it up in the attic of the house. I was clearing the attic out because we’re changing over from oil to gas and I came across it again.”He continued: “I just want to see what’s what with it. I thought back then that it was an oddball of a thing to be getting sold. The only person I took it to was Father Hanna down in Clonard Monastery last week. He looked at it and said it was very, very good, it’s very nice, but he couldn’t give me an opinion of where to go to see about it. Then somebody told me to bring it up to the Andytown News.”He added: “If it turns out to be stolen or anything then I would give it back to whoever owned it, but I don’t think it is.”If you have any further clues or information about the book or its contents, please contact the Andersonstown News."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/bmg-advert-banner-classified-v01.png","title":"shock at sudden passing of reds legend breslin","story":"THE local football community was plunged into mourning last night at the sudden passing of Cltonville legend Tommy Breslin at the age of .The former Reds player and manager died while on a family holiday in Spain.Breslin famously guided Cltonville to back-to-back Irish League titles in  and  and won eight trophies in a hugely successful four-year spell at Solitude.In the summer of , he was at the helm when Cltonville took on Celtic over two legs in an historic Champions League Qualier.He ed to the club on an interim basis following the departure of his successor Gerard Lyttle at the end of the  campaign while he was also a revered midfielder in his playing days at the club.Social media was awash with tributes last night as fans and rival supporters alike paid tribute to one of the game’s most affable and popular figures.Having updated their social media feeds to include a picture of their iconic former boss, Cltonville posted a statement which read: “Cltonville Football Club are devastated to this evening learn of the sudden and untimely death of Tommy Breslin.“While the club will naturally pay a fuller tribute to Tommy very soon, at the moment in time our thoughts are very much with the Breslin family circle and all of his many friends, to whom we extend our deepest sympathy.”Lyttle, who was also part of Breslin’s backroom team before taking over the Cltonville hotseat, tweeted: “Shocked and saddened to hear – one of the nicest men I’ve ever known.

Ill be quite honest, it started getting a bit dangerous in terms of public safety and indeed officer safety and it was going in a dficult direction.\"It was my view we were moving towards disorder [ the band was removed from the parade].\"[The band] were showing no reason, not working with us, not engaging and not being balanced in any way and indeed, the fact that they were displaying the symbol walking through the city that somebody  might respond to them - I had to reduce the risk of them walking through the city centre.\"Assistant Chief Constable Alan Todd, who was the overall commander in charge on Saturday, rejected claims the police operation was \"heavy handed\".“I see no grounds for using that description,” he said at a press conference in Belfast.Our engagement before, during and after the parade were by way of discussion and negotiation and it confounds me how anyone can describe that as heavy handed. It was proportionate, responsible and constructive – to style it otherwise, I don’t share that assessment.Assistant Chief Constable Alan ToddEarlier a Sinn Fein delegation met with the PSNI to discuss the incident.After the meeting, Sinn Fein MP for Foyle Elisha McCallion said: “The failure of the Apprentice Boys to adhere to an agreement that there would be no provocative displays on the parade has caused a huge deal of anger in the local community and sets back the positive progress which this city has made over recent years in terms of dealing with contentions parades.“There was a specic agreement in place that there would be no ‘Soldier F’ or Parachute Regiment symbols given the clear hurt and offence this would cause to the Bloody Sunday families in particular.“The fact that this agreement was broken in a deliberate attempt to antagonise victims demands rigorous investigation by the PSNI in addition to immediate action from the Apprentice Boys.\"SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said he is seeking a meeting with the Apprentice Boys to highlight the \"deep hurt\" that has been caused by band members wearing the Parachute Regiment emblem.Mr Eastwood said the band had \"caused deep hurt and distress to many victims in Derry\".\"The Apprentice Boys need to understand how people feel about this - they need to listen to the voices of those who have been hurt,\" he said.Police are also investigating an illegal protest staged by dissident republican group Saoradh during the Apprentice Boys event."},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland couple create stunning sea of","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The businesses in Portglenone are delighted as its brought a lot more people into the town.\"It doesnt take that long to sow the seeds,\" said Damian, who works at the local DLF Seeds company and knows what it takes to bring the field to le. \"It was just a couple of hours of walking up and down shaking the fiddle, but after that its out of your hands as to whether everything comes good.\"This year Damien and Karen, with their three children Cara , Ryanand Therese , have crafted another masterpiece. Visitors are greeted by scenes reminiscent of a Monet impressionist painting with a touch of Van Gogh, all on the edge of Seamus Heaney country.\"We live in a very green country with lots of rolling meadows, but people seem to like a splash of colour too. Its dferent and we like to think its a very romantic setting,\" said Damien. \"We had three marriage proposals in the field last year, wedding parties coming for photographs, plenty of fashion photo shoots, buses stopping off on tours of the country and, of course, plenty of photographers. There were also a couple of music videos filmed.\"The families who have come along are getting back to nature. Its so good that people are getting out into the fresh air and appreciating natural beauty. Kids are running around the path spotting butterflies.\"Thats an added bonus this year, with a neighbour lending an extra acre-sized field where Damian has created the perfect haven for butterflies, and when work commitments allow, he is only too happy to take visitors on a guided walk through the wildflowers.\"Its worked so well,\" he said. \"Were getting plenty of guests! \"Weve seen some of the rarer types, like painted ladies and peacocks. Youd almost think they were looking at you as the patterns on the wings resemble eyes. Its lovely to see them coming into their natural habitat.\"Obviously were relying a lot on the weather, but its been warm enough so far this year to allow the sunflowers to come out. They are a tropical plant, so heavy rain can take its toll, but theyve survived so far andwe can manage to get a couple of decent sunny days, even more of them should come out. Were at around % right now, and they thrive on direct sunlight.\"Karen and her kids, plus an army of young people from the town, have all been roped in to keep the meadow in tip top shape, and she expects the field to be open to the public for the next few weeks.\"Obviously theres a limited time span for when the sunflowers are in bloom, soanyone does want to take a stroll through, forget all about everyday le and lose themselves in a natural world, the next two to three weeks will be the best time to experience it,\" she said.\"In the meantime, were only too happy to have people as our guests, bring a picnic or a flask of tea and enjoy it while it lasts.\"This year, Damien and Karen are raising money for Macmillan Cancer Support. Entry is £ or £ for  to -year-olds. Under s go free.

Some of the features retained in the house include a stone floor that is over  years old and a Royal Mail postbox that dates back to Queen Victorias reign. The unusual detail of the thatched house with its steep roof, eaves gutter and tall chimney is unique in Northern Ireland, according to the Department for Communities.This means the house appears to the passer-by as two dwellings, each with a front door, but it is in fact a single dwelling which for most of the past century has been home to the Maccombe family.Please log in or register with belfasttelegraph for free access to this article.Sign InNew to Belfasttelegraph  window.gigyaIntegration  window.gigyaIntegration  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand.push gigyaIntegrationLoginScreenSet gigyaIntegrationRegisterScreenSetMurray Maccombeis the third generation of his family to live in the magnicent dwelling, which sits on a three-acre site.Speaking to the Belfast , Mr Maccombe said he has fond memories of the house going back to his early years.He said: \"My grandfather Robert Henry Maccombe bought this house around  and it has been in our family since, but the original owner was a man called Hugh McCullagh.\"At the time my grandfather bought it, it was a farmhouse but also a grocers shop hardware store and it stayed like that until  when he opened a shop separate from the house.\"I have very clear memories of visiting my grandparents and obviously living there when my father Alan took it over.\"My father passed away in  but my mother stayed on, on her own.\"I moved in with my own family in  and I will be sad to leave the house, but really it has outgrown my we and I. \"Our two daughters are away at university and the reality it the house is too large for us to upkeep, especially the gardens, but it will be a great buy for someone.\"The house is being sold for Mr Maccombe by Donnybrook Estate Agents in Derry for offers over £,.Stephen McCarron said he expects that the house will attract a lot of interest.He said: \"We are delighted to have this magnicent property on our books for sale and there has been interest shown already from people in the UK and further afield. \"It is a property steeped in history but also comes with so much potential for development and I am optimistic it will have a new owner before long.\"Further details and an appointment to view can be arranged through Donnybrook Estate Agents on   "},{"url":null,"title":"revealed five schools share the top spot in gcse league table results","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Derry motocross racer is one of many patients who are grateful for the rapid response of the Air Ambulance.Eoghan Kerlin from Dungiven was taking part in a quad motocross event in Cookstown in September  when he required medical assistance. He was out on the track and unfortunately went over a jump at the same time as another competitor and collided at speed.Eoghan came off his quad in the air, landing on his right-hand side as he attempted to clear the jump. His we Kerrie, who was at the event, immediately rang .Due to the nature of this incident and the high index of suspicion for potential injuries, the air desk paramedic who was monitoring this call spoke directly with Kerrie to gain further information. The air desk paramedic dispatched the air ambulance on the knowledge that Eoghan was badly injured and required immediate pre-hospital critical care interventions.A road ambulance was deployed and arrived shortly before the air ambulance. Eoghan had a seizure and was sedated by the HEMS team at the scene before being transferred by the air ambulance to Royal Victoria Hospital.The Dungiven man’s injuries were all down the right side and he had an open fracture in his leg, his femur was shattered, and he had broken ribs and a bruised lung.Speaking about the accident, Eoghan’s we Kerrie said: “Standing on the side-lines and watching the accident was one of the worst moments I’ve ever experience, I really thought Eoghan was going to die.“Eoghan had a seizure at the scene which was incredibly frightening but when I saw the air ambulance coming into land my anxiety reduced. Within minutes of the HEMS team arriving, all the craziness seemed to calm, and I just felt so much more at easy as the team were so professional.”As part of his recovery, Eoghan visited the air ambulance base, and the home of the Air Ambulance Northern Irelandcharity, in Lisburn to meet the team who had helped him.He updated them on his recovery, saying: “I’m still undergoing treatment for my injuries and will have to have surgery on my kneecap which has unfortunately been damaged beyond repair. But I’m here and I’m on the road to recovery and every week there is further improvement.“I owe a great deal to all of the medical professionals who helped, and continue to help, me and I’m feeling positive about the future.”Kerrie added: “As a family, we know just how important the air ambulance service is and in recognition of this, we held a fundraiser in November last year and raised £, for the charity. We wanted to extend a heartfelt thanks to every single person who contributed in any way to help.“We are forever grateful for what AANI has done for us and couldn’t imagine what the outcome may have beenthey were not available.”The charity, AANI in partnership with the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service , provides the Helicopter Emergency Medical Servicefor the region and responds to seriously ill or injured patients, seven days a week, for twelve hours a day.AANI requires £, per day to keep this vital service going, meaning £million must be raised each year.You can support the charity by joining Club AANI, an exclusive members club, for a weekly donation of £.

And, a charity called Think Pacic provided the young woman with the vehicle to fulfil her ambition.“I’ve always wanted to go away to help people, because my degree involves quite a degree of caring for people. One of my friends at university did it last year, so I spoke to him about it and then we had a talk about at university and I looked at the Think Pacic website as well. Then I had a phone interview and got accepted for it.“After I was accepted into the programme, I just read up on it and became more interested in doing something,” Orlaith said.Think Pacic allows volunteers to sample le at the heart of remote Fijian villages far removed from what normally passes as backpacking trips in students gap years. Each team of volunteers stays in a dferent community and they are immersed into every aspect of the le of the country’s customs, values and traditions.“We had a welcome ceremony when we entered the village and were given a traditional Fijian drink called Kava. It’s a sedative drink derived from the pepper plant and it’s used for ceremonial occasions.“The Fijian’s believe in sharing everything so no one ever goes without. They are a very traditional people and we had to dress very modestly so as not to show any disrespect. Our shoulders had to be covered and we had to wear long dresses called Bula dresses and skirts called Sulu’s,” Orlaith continued.The charity was founded in the early s and adopts a bespoke approach to its volunteer work in the South Pacic country. Often, teams of volunteers are the first top have ever worked in the communities they visit because the trips only take placea Fijian community agrees to invite them there in the first place. Rather than focussing on just a single school or location it means that Think Pacic can reach thousands of children each year and spread the message of education, sport and health.This model means that the overall project is sustainable, especially as volunteers train local leaders to carry on the work after they have departed. It’s also a programme that has been fully embraced by the Fijian Government.Orlaith, a former student at Lumen Christi says that Think Pacic have taken specic steps to avoid what’s become known as ‘voluntourism’. The term refers to the growing phenomenon of iniduals travelling to developing countries to carry out volunteer work. Recently, there have been increasing concerns about voluntourism and in particular gap year projects that some have suggested that can cause more harm than good to host communities.Primary concerns are that some charitable organisations are running volunteering trips along business lines and can result in the institutionalisation of children.Orlaith Duffy’s month long stay in Fiji was on the country’s main island Viti Levu at Muanaira village- a remote rural setting around two hours from the national capital Suva.Orlaith told the Derry News: “Think Pacic have moved away from voluntourism because they know that a lot of organisations take students money and students are staying in hotels and then spending a small amount of time helping people.“So, it’s a bit contradictory. Think Pacic want you to live with villagers then every day from am until pm we would go to the school. We would teach from am until pm they do sports in the afternoon.”In fact, teaching in the in the village school where the pupil’s age range runs from six to -years of age is a vital component of the volunteering workOrlaith continued: “Think Pacic have dferent key learning aims. Schooling in Fiji is very basic, so I noticed that children at the same age over they compared to our own children here had very dferent levels of education.“Their education is so far behind because teachers just don’t have enough time or resources to focus on the children that are falling behind. We would have sat in the classroom and noticedthere were particular children falling behind. Then we would take them out and do one on one’s with them. We tried to strip it back to basics and do basic maths with them before moving on to the more dficult stuff that they were getting taught in class.“We also did a lot of letter phonics with their sounds and their grammar because sometimes they didn’t understand why certain words were put in front of other words and sentences. And we did a lot of work with past and present tenses because they weren’t sure about that either. We got to choose what age group we wanted to work with as well so the one on one sessions would have been with primary one’s up until primary sevens. So, I chose ‘kindi’, like nursey, which was five-year-olds. They were learning their alphabet and numbers and arts and crafts. We did a dferent letter with them each day. They would practice how to draw the letter and practice their numbers.”In the classroom the children are expected to converse in English-something which presents another educational challenge.Three main languages are used in Fiji-English, Fijian and Fijian Hindi. Fijian is spoken by most indigenous Fijians who account for almost  per cent of the country’s population. Fijian’s of Indian descent make up another  per cent of the population and mainly speak Fijian Hindi.The English language is a remnant of British colonial rule and was the sole official language until . English is widely used in government, business and education circles, but business is also widely carried out in Fijian, especially in rural areas.A small number of other Indigenous West Fijian and East Fijian regional languages are spoken on the islands, standard Fijian belonging to the East Fijian group. Chinese and Rotuman are also spoken by immigrant populations.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshOrlaith said: “In school it’s all English. The younger children find it more dficult and the teacher would speak Fijian to the nursery children-so half in English, half in Fijian. But everything  is done in English.”Viti Levu is the largest island in the Republic of Fiji and is home to  per cent of the entire population-around , people. The island is just over  miles long and  miles wide. Its rugged terrain is explained by the fact that it was created largely as a result of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.Territorially, the island is ided into roughly equal halves by a mountain range running from north to south. The island’s centre is covered by forest and is dominated by Fiji’s highest mountain-Mount Tomanivi which stands at , feet.The eastern side of the island experiences heavy rainfall, while the western side, also called the \"burning west\" is noticeably drier in the ranges rain shadow. Similarly, sugar cane production thrives in the west, while a dairy industry is being built in the east. Fijis biggest cattle ranch is at Yaqara, with  head of cattle on its , acres.Orlaith Duffy said: “Living with the villagers gave us a better idea of the culture. Living standards are very basic-a lot of mornings there would be no running water to wash or brush teeth. The water pressure was a lot better at night. The houses only had a single tap so the man of the house would spend time filling a lot of buckets with water so that would be used for cooking. The shower we had was a bucket with holes in it, so we just used that to wash ourselves.“In Fiji as well, the diet is very carb heavy and very sugar heavy. There’s a need to encourage children to brush their teeth so we took toothpaste and toothbrushes out there. The school I went to was already quite well developed in that way so that was good to see.“There was a man in our village and because he had severe diabetes he had to have his leg amputated. So, we carried out a health workshop and spoke about strokes and heart attacks and how to spot the signs, prevent them and what to doyou see someone taken one. We also did basic teaching on how to clean cuts and not to leave them exposed. We left first aid kits behind in the village as well.Like the domestic dwellings Orlaith said that the school buildings were also basic consisting of concrete and corrugated roofs.“If there isn’t enough room to accommodate all of the children they would add on a couple of Portacabins.“Some of the villages are remote, so people make their living from fishing. But where I stayed, because it was around two hours from the capital, I noticed that a lot of the Fijian’s who are my age where at university. When we lived with a family, we referred to the parents as our mum and dad.“My Fijian dad was in the military, so it was interesting to talk to him because he was very well travelled. The mum has a degree in accounting, but she has given it up because she’s looking after the children. But, a lot of the islanders don’t work at all because they were the ones that fell behind at school.“Luckily, our school was only a  minute walk from the village but I know that other school’s are about  minutes or an hour’s trek every day. I also noticed that sometimes the children just aren’t encouraged to go to school by their parents because some of them would have just stayed in the village during the day. I think us being there did make attendance better and the teacher noticed that the behaviour was a lot better too,” said Orlaith.The Derry News put it to Orlaith that she could have easily spent her summer backpacking in the region as opposed to volunteering-so why did she become involved “I just thought whenever I was reading on it that it made feel how lucky I was to come from here and because Cardf University gave us the chance to go and do something-I just really wanted to help then.“Some of my friends went to Africa this summer to test eyes, but I couldn’t do that because they are a year ahead of me in their studies. When I looked into Think Pacic I thought that it would be a good idea and I can always go back thereI want to because now that I’ve volunteered there will be an opportunity to go back as a leader next year.“So, I could lead a group of people that were in my position this year. Then you can go on to be a project manager and oversee a few dferent teams.“When I got there at the start I thought ‘what am I doing here on the other side of the world ’ There was no Wi-Fi, barely any signal to call home. I actually bought a ‘brick’ phone so I could call home, but it was very limited, I had to stand in certain parts of the area to get a signal.“But, once I settled in that you saw how rewarding this was because the children improved each day and the people are so friendly. They have nothing, but they never complain or never in a bad mood. The people are very community based soI was walking through the village at night dferent families would be calling me in to eat dinner with them.“It was very rare for my and my family to be eating dinner alone because there was always loads of other people in our house eating with us because they invite everyone in. Even when we were getting a bus to the village,you shout ‘bula’ that means hello, but it also means ‘be given le’.“Everyone says hello to everyone . I thought it was quite similar to home because we say hello when we walk past someone in the street, but at university in Cardf people don’t do that. They put their heads down and walk on. I found that the Fijians are quite similar to Irish people because home and family are close to them, but they take it to the next level by inviting everyone it and checking how people are.”Anyone wishing to volunteer for Think Pacic must be between the ages of -. You can apply when you’re  but must be  before your expedition begins.

This can result in many dficult policing decisions. That was the situation we found ourselves in on Saturday in Derry Londonderry. “The vast majority of the people who arrived in Derry Londonderry at the weekend to participate in the parade did so within the law and with due regard to that context.“One band, chose to take an approach which we believed would have interfered with our legitimate purpose of keeping the peace and keeping people safe. On that basis we engaged with them and sought their cooperation to address that in a constructive way they chose not to do so. We sought to engage the involvement of the Organisers and their Marshals to assist us in that and they were unable to do so. googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“With a large number of people delayed for a signicant amount of time, where some people were parading on the Cityside and other people were waiting on the Waterside area of the City, instead of persisting in that delay with the risks that entailed, we chose to make other operational arrangements to help ensure that people were kept safe and prevent a breach of the peace or a likely breach of the peace for the remainder of the parade.“Once the parade was finished we took steps to seek to identy those within the band so that we could fulfil our duty to put the matters and facts before the Public Prosecution Service in order that they might determinethere was any liability on the part of those people responsible. That is a legitimate policing purpose and was done so professionally. Once those details and assurances were given to us those people were free to travel on their way. “As a policing service we have a professional responsibility, and a legitimate purpose, to maintain the peace and keep people safe. These were the objectives of our decision making on Saturday. The event passed off peacefully, people were kept safe, no one was hurt and nobody was unduly inconvenienced by police actions. “Derry Londonderry has for a long time been considered the model for parades and protest. Efforts must now turn to dialogue to ensure that the that the good work of years gone by can be continued.”"},{"url":null,"title":"welshpool hand cyclist raises","story":"Andrew Paddison from Welshpool and his Lands End to John OGroats hand bike chaltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtrity ride..Picture bltspan classtruncate-full-screengty Phil Blagg..PB--.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Welshpool hand-cyclist raises over K for charityAndrew Paddison in training for his Land’s End to John O’Groats hand bike chltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtarity ride.

That total and then some was passed in no time and has now risen above the pound, mark which has delighted Jeff.ldquoMany thanks to all the sponsors, supporters, players, umpires and scorers, Jeff enthused.ldquoThanks also to Liz Byrne, Jackie Wilson and Dave Crudgington who ran the refreshments and food made by chef Ryan Finnegan. We just couldnrsquot have achieved our target without the help of a lot of people and I can never thank them enough, he added.Sunday was an emotional day for Jeff and he was at times reduced to the odd wee tear.ldquoRodney Hassardrsquos tribute had me close to breaking down, but I was able to hold it together. I got my wish of playing alongside a lot of my former team-mates and I am indebted to them all for turning up and sharing the occasion with me.In the first challenge game of the day Dundrumrsquos current first team took on a squad of former Dundrum players that included Alan Mills and Darren Oldroyd, from Drumaness, Mark Yeates, from Downpatrick, and Byron Woodruff, from Saintfield.The game was competitive to say the least and thanks to decent knocks from Terry Hutley , Stuart Campbelland Sean CameronDundrum posted .Yeates sent the stumps cartwheeling on two occasions with Oldroyd also picking up two wickets. Harry Hitchins got the prize wicket of first team captain Ian Wright.The golden oldies rolled back the years in reply with Rodney Hassardshowing his undoubted class in his first game in five years.Woodruff made , including two big sixes off Cameron and Shilliday danced his way down the wicket, as used to be the norm, for a quick fire . Oldroydand Yeatescompleted the job with five wickets to spare.The second game saw some excellent ball striking and decent bowling from an NCU Select team.Saintfieldrsquos Byron Woodruff and the best young prospect in County Down,  year-old Adam Reid, treated all the bowlers with contempt as the runs flowed quicker than the refreshments.Man of the match Reid hit  not out in only  balls including eight boundaries and one massive six that went out of the ground.Superb all rounder Woodruff showed his old team-mates what a talent he is, hitting  in  balls with four big sixes and the same in boundaries.If both had not retired they would have scored centuries and the Dundrum bowlers were happy to clap them off. Ricky Owens then rolled back the years with a splendid , including three big sixes and three fours, the NCU side posting .It was perhaps fitting that Alan Mills, the oldest player on the pitch and still ultra competitive, finished  not out.Dundrum fought back well after the early onslaught with good fielding catching and astute field placing by captain Gavin McNerlin.Wickets were shared around with Chandar Shekhar the pick of the bowlers, taking  for  of three overs. Shilliday was again on the money and finished with  for . McNerlin, Keba Butler, Neil Reilly and Peter Calvert all got one wicket apiece.Dundrum got a steady start from Greg Hutleyand Rodney Hassard before Drumanessrsquo Neil Gelston removed them both. Oldroyd then hit the middle stump with successive deliveries leaving Dundrum on  for .McNerlin hit Gelston straight over the scoreboard in his  before Stuart Campbellwas run out by Woodruff. Saintfieldrsquos T McCavera picked up two wickets with CIYMSrsquo Steven Hughes and Woodruff also getting in on the act.The last wicket partnership of  between Neil Reillyand Keba Butlergot Dundrum closer than it looked as the NCU side ran out comfortable winners.The match ball sponsors were Bao and Bento and Pizza Palazzo, Newcastle..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Downpatrick railway’s first afternoon tea event is runaway success  ","story":"THE Downpatrick and Co Down Railway got out the best china when it hosted its very first afternoon tea event recently.The experience started with guests boarding the train at Downpatrick town station and taking a relaxing journey, travelling in a comfortable s carriage, to Inch Abbey by steam train.They then boarded the buffet carriage where guests were welcomed by the volunteers with a glass of prosecco, wine or a soft drink, before being directed to their allocated tables to enjoy a mouthwatering selection of freshly handmade sandwiches, luxury homemade scones with jam and cream and mini French patisseries.Guests were also offered bottomless teas and coffees, or their own pot of luxury specialist tea.Railway chairman Robert Gardiner, who was one of the servers, said: ldquoThis is something wersquove wanted to do for some time, and itrsquos always been a very popular treat on heritage railways in Great Britain.ldquoNerves may have been a bit jangled as with all first events.

If something does not happen soon we are finished, he said.ldquoTo be owed something like pound, by a public body like the Housing Executive is scandalous and someone should step in to sort this mess out.The crisis has been sparked off by staff shortages and industrial action in the accounts department of the Executive.A spokesman for the Executive said they were extremely concerned at the situation and had brought it to the attention of the Government.ldquoThere have been a number of vacancies in the department and we are unable to fill them because of the Government ban on recruitment to the public service. The result is that we cannot porocess these settlements as quickly as we normally do.He added: We are trying to do all we can to help the smaller contractors who are always much more vulnerable in such a situation.NEWCASTLE mdash A verdict of accidental death has been ed on Newcastle motorcycle ace Tom Herron, who died at the North West  earlier this year.Thirty year-old Herron, ranked third in the world, came off his bike at mph and smashed into a lamp post just  yards from the finishing line in the cc race. He died in hospital two hours later.The inquest at Coleraine heard how Herron had ridden in the race with an injury to his thumb and arm, but the pathologistrsquos report could not determine whether this would have interfered with his ability to control the bike at high speed.Two police constables, who witnessed the accident, told the inquest that the bike scraped the ground and the rider then lost control.The coroner, Mr Robin Wray, discounted suggestions to close the Portrush circuit and said that the racing gave a great deal of pleasure to a lot of people. He added that he had seen Herron race many times and always had a great admiration for him.DRUMANESS mdash Fresh hope for the old Drumaness Mill, which was becoming something of a white elephant, emerged this week with the news that Irish Waste Services have long term plans to develop it into an industrial estate.This week a spokesman for the company confirmed they had already moved on to the site. The long term plans for the , sq ft red brick building involve the setting up of an industrial estate with potential for several hundred jobs. The firm will advertise shortly for tenants and the spokesman explained that there was a real need for small factory premises providing employment in the area.The story of the mill since it closed down when owned by Hurstrsquos as part of the Ulster Weaving Group, when at one stage it provided work for  people, has been a long saga of disappointment.The mill was sold to Irish Waste for around pound, recently. This figure falls far short of the original asking price at a public auction held in Ballynahinch last year, which was believed to be around pound,.The news of employment hopes for Drumaness was welcomed by the chairman of Down Council, Mr Eddie McVeigh, who said it was ldquogood news indeed.He added: ldquoI would welcome anything which would bring jobs to the Drumaness area and I hope that this is not one of the many disappointments which we have suffered over the last few years.BALLYNAHINCH mdash Plessey Telecommunications in Ballynahinch was closed on Monday when more than  production workers walked out as part of a national campaign to obtain shorter hours and more pay.The strike action will be repeated on the Monday of the next two weeks and the production workers are also refusing to work overtime.Their demands are for a basic skilled rate of pound, a reduction in hours to an eventual  hours a week and two extra daysrsquo holiday.A spokesman for the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions said: ldquoWe would have prefer to have obtained our realistic claim by mutual agreement with the employers, but unfortunately we are left with no other alternative.STRANGFORD LOUGH mdash A strong plea is being made to boat owners on Strangford Lough to combat the nuisance caused by inexperienced owners of large fast powerboats.It comes from Mr T W McKee, of Sketrick Island, a noted yachtsman with more than  yearsrsquo sailing experience behind him.He is annoyed by a recent ldquomafia-type display of outrageous aggressiveness by a powerboat owner and would like to find an authority with the power to control such ldquoblatant abuse of delightful waters, not to mention the risk to innocent people and their boats by sea-borne thugs.In a letter to the Recorder, Mr McKee describes how his -foot yacht was rocked from side to wide so viciously by the wash of the powerboat, which buzzed around it, that his family and grandchildren were lucky not to be seriously injured as they were flung back and forth across the wheelhouse.He has passed the complaint to the Coastguard in the hope that they can have action taken, but understanding that use of Strangford Lough as a navigable waterway is free to all who wish to use it, he does not expect any success.PORTAFERRY mdash A public meeting is to be held in Portaferry next week to protest about plans for sewage disposal in the town.The meeting has been called by the local development association, which is concerned that the scheme about to be launched will be inadequate.Councillor Paddy Doherty, a member of the development association, appealed for the support of townspeople to support the meeting so that plans can be drawn up to combat the scheme by Ards Borough Council.Mr Doherty said the council originally proposed a filter bed scheme, which would pump treated sewage into Strangford Lough, but then abandoned the filter bed idea.LOUGHINISLAND mdash It was a historic day for the community in Loughinisland when Paddy McFlynn, the president of the GAA, declared open their new Macartan Park on Sunday.The weather certainly could have been kinder for the biggest day in the history of the club, but nevertheless there was a good crowd to witness the opening, as well as the football and hurling games.Mr Vincent Doran, the chairman of the club, welcomed the distinguished guests and said Loughinisland was one of the oldest clubs in East Down.

A few weeks ago Clonduff would have been regarded as red hot favourites to progress against their Division  opponents.However, it is uncertainthe Hilltown outfit will be at full strength as several of their players headed off to the USA a fortnight ago.Clonduff were beaten - to - on Friday night by Burren and given half a chance, Pat Havern and Daniel McCarthy could take full advantage of Clonduffrsquos misfortunes and lead Saval to a surprise win.The curtain-raiser for this game is the IFC encounter between Drumaness and Glasdrumman at .pm. Drumaness are expected to progress as the Quarter Road outfit have yet to win a game this season and seem certain to be relegated from Division .A Gary Murdock-inspired Drumaness beat Glasdrumman - to - at the start of July and they will be intent on repeating that result.There are two IFC games also down for decision over at Fontenoy Park when Drumgath face Darragh Cross and Teconnaught clash with St Johnrsquos.Darragh have been involved in a tense battle for promotion into the top flight, but recent defeats to Carryduff and Longstone have dented their aspirations.However, they are a championship team and in Shane Murray, Michael Monan, Joe McKinney, Matty Hardy and Anton McGrattan they have players capable of going all the way this year and Drumgath, who lie in second place in Division , will do well to get a result.The Teconnaught v St Johnrsquos derby should be a nice opener for the Drumnaquoile side who are more than holding their own in Division  with John Clarke, Conor Morgan, Marty Keenan and the Flanagans all in good form.Teconnaught, who won the JFC title last season, will rely on Paddy Grant, Jack Larkin, Ciaran Carville, David Kelly and Tony Davis to keep them competitive.Friday night sees another four games take place mdash two in Burren and two in Newcastle.A lot of focus will naturally fall on the SFC game between Kilcoo and An Riocht in Burren.Kilcoo have made no secret of the fact that they are determined to regain the Frank OrsquoHare Cup after losing out to Burren in last yearrsquos decider.They have blooded several new faces this season and are well in the running for the ACFL Division  crown, but they will not be taking An Riocht lightly, despite theirindferent season in Division . The Branagan, Devlin, Laverty and Johnston brothers will ensure Kilcoo go into the game in the right frame of mind.At the same venue, Shamrocks clash with Tullylish with the outcome hard to predict.Tullylish have fallen from grace in recent months and have been cast adrt at the bottom of Division . Shamrocks are in the top half of Division , but it looks asthey have missed out on promotion yet again.The game of the night should be in Newcastle where Carryduff lock horns with Castlewellan in the SFC.D J Morganrsquos Carryduff side seem destined for Division , while Castlewellan are battling to avoid relegation to Division .Carryduff have really made their mark this season with James and Daniel Guinness, Owen McCabe, Ronan Beatty, John McGeogh and Josh Connery all to the fore.Castlewellan are just now starting to get a few of their walking wounded back in action and Sean Dornan, Liam, Donal and Gareth McKibbin, Colly Flanagan, Rory Burns and Daniel Morgan could prove a handful for a young Carryduff side.The curtain-raiser to this game is the IFC encounter between Annaclone and Atticall.Ciaran Branniganrsquos Annaclone have been blazing a trail of glory at the top of Division  and it is unlikely that Atticall, who are  points behind them in the table, will inflict their first defeat of the season on them.Annaclone were held to a - to - draw by a fast-improving Ballymartin side on Friday night, but they still should have too much firepower for Atticall.Saturday sees another four games take place.Top billing goes to the Loughinisland v Longstone SFC clash in Castlewellan.Loughinisland have taken Division  by storm since theirthis season and are riding high in third place after Friday nightrsquos - to - win over a good Warrenpoint offering at Macartan Park.Longstone, on the other hand, are embroiled with Carryduff for an automatic promotion place at the top of Division  and now that Ambrose Rogers and Mark Poland are back to full fitness, this should be a cracking affair.Absolutely nothing separated the sides when they met in Division  last year and the same should be the case on Saturday.Loughinisland will rely on their big hitters Dan Gordon mdash still good enough to be playing county football mdash Jonny Flynn, Rory Mason, Stefan Mason and the McClements brothers and they should progress.This game will be proceeded by the Saul v Bosco IFC encounter.Saul,they can reproduce the sort of form they showed a fortnight ago to beat Carryduff, will be expected to ease past their Division  opponents, but championship football doesnrsquot always work that way.Bosco fell to a narrow - to - defeat away to Clann na Banna on Friday night while Saul were soundly beaten - to - by Bredagh.However, Donnan Ritchie will have his charges pumped up for this encounter with the Arnold, Harney and Mahoney brothers prepared to take the game to Bosco.It will be a short trip down the road to Kilcoo for the next two games on Saturday.Glenn play Liatroim in the IFC at .pm and Bryansford take on Bredagh.Neither Glenn or Bredagh have been causing a stir this season, but now is the time to turn it on. Liatroim should be at full strength with the McCrickard connections finally finished with their county hurling commitments and the Fontenoys might just cause an upset.The big game on Saturday night is the Bryansford v Bredagh game in the SFC.Bryansford have been plagued by injuries to key players all season long, but in Davy McKibben, Ruairi Wells, Danny Savage and Conor Maginn they have the men for all jobs and I would expect them to see off Bredagh.Brendan Masonrsquos outfit hammered Saul on Friday night and in Donal Hughes, Tommy McElroy, Eoin Costello and Conor Francis they have players capable of mixing it with the best, but last yearrsquos IFC winners might find Bryansfordrsquos physicality too much to handle.There are another three games to be played on Sunday.Ballymartin face Clann na Banna in the IFC at Mayobridge at pm before Warrenpoint take on Ballyholland and Burren lock horns with neighbours Mayobridge at Pairc Esler.Ballymartin seem to have turned the corner after a few disappointing results, but they are now operating at full strength again and warmed up for the championship with a draw against runaway Division  leaders Annaclone on Friday night.Clann na Banna are sitting in a comfortable mid-table position, but I donrsquot think they will give Ballymartin too much to worry about.The Ballyholland v Warrenpoint game should be another close encounter.Ballyholland may lie bottom of the Division  table, but Warrenpoint are only four points above them. The lsquoPoint have potential match winners in the Boyles and Ross McGarry with Ballyholland looking to the Murphy brothers, Tiarnan Rushe and Seamus Loughran.The Mayobridge v Burrren game is the tie of the round.Paddy OrsquoRourkersquos side, the defending league champions and Frank OrsquoHare Cup holders, will not relinquish their grip on both trophies without a fight.They have been a little bit inconsistent of late, but bounced back to their best on Friday night with a comfortable - to - victory away to Clonduff, while Mayobridge were beaten - to - by Kilcoo.In Kevin McKernan, Donal OrsquoHare, Liam Kerr and the McAvoy brothers, Burren have the perfect blend of youth and experience, while Maybridge will look to Corey Quinn, Shane Annett and the combative Conor Garvey to keep them interested.Downpatrick and Rostrevor bring the curtain down on the first round of fixtures when they clash in Hilltown on Monday night.The sides met last Friday night in the league at Petit Park with Rostrevor winning - to -. However, Caolan Mooney, who was literally unplayable in that game, is unable to play in the championship and that could well hand the initiative to the Hoops.Downpatrick will again look to big performances from their big game players and they donrsquot come any bigger than Gerard Colllins, Michael Magee, Conor McGrady, Jarlath Branagan and the Turley brothers.Without Mooney, Pete McGrathrsquos side will look to Conor Doyle, John Connolly, Shan Parr and Piras Kane for inspiration..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Great turnout for multi cultural event in Ballynahinch  ","story":"HUNDREDS of people attended the multi-cultural family friendly celebration at The Square in Ballynahinch on Saturday.The Connecting Cultures Event was held to help promote community cohesion and encourage acceptance and understanding of other cultures.In addition to music from all over the world, there were dancers entertaining the crowd, face painting, an exotic petting farm, stilt walkers, circus skills and cuisine from ious parts of the world.The African drumming proved particularly popular, with people of all ages keen to take part.

I would be happy to see Orangemen being able to express their cultural identity in Dublin through a marchthey wanted to do so and that’s something that I would certainly respect.”Referring to the Orange Order’s strong links to Dublin and Sir Edward Carson having been born in the city, Mr Varadkar said: “There would have been a lot of Orange lodges in Dublin and Wicklow at a time – and all over the country – sowe’re serious about respecting each other’s identities, each other’s valueswe’re serious about parity of esteem, it’s not the sort of thing you can pick and choose.”The Orange Order has an annual parade in the Co Donegal village of RossnowlaghSeven years ago, during a ground-breaking speech to the Seanad, the then Orange grand secretary Drew Nelson said that Orangemen in the Republic would love to parade in their capital city, although he said that the institution recognised the “challenges” that may pose.The Fianna Fail leader in the Seanad, Darragh O’Brien, responded that he would like to see a day when there could be an Orange Order parade in Dublin “in a non-triumphalist way”.Mr Nelson, whose speech was greeted with warm applause, told senators: “In the Republic we have about  parades each year. For the reasons, which we all understand, these parades have been pushed to the margins of society.“There has not been an Orange Order parade in a major town in the Republic since before the Troubles. There was one planned in Dublin a few years ago but it was unable to proceed.“Our members in the Republic would welcome the opportunity to hold a parade in their capital city. As an institution we completely understand, however, the challenges which such a parade would pose.”However, in response to the taoiseach’s support for a Dublin parade, Mr Nelson’s successor as grand secretary, the Rev Mervyn Gibson, last night sounded more cautious.He said: “The Orange brethren who reside in the Republic of Ireland, as Leo Varadkar points out, parade in Rossnowlagh each year. They currently have no plans for a parade in Dublin.How embracing the great outdoors pulled Kelly back from the brink of despair Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“There needs to be a purpose to any planned parade – such as a commemoration, celebration or parading to a church service. The Orange Institution does not simply parade for the sake of it.”And, although some Dublin Orangemen want to parade through central Dublin, not all agree.Chris Thackaberry, a middle-aged Dublin Orangeman who travels to Belfast to march on the Twelfth, told the News Letter that Orangeism was about more than simply “a parading culture”.Emphasising that he was speaking in a personal capacity, he said: “As a Dublin Orangeman, I have no interest in parading in my city. Because of our county structure, Co Cavan and the wider border counties have made no move in that direction.“Furthermore the focus for Dublin Orangemen is in highlighting the Orange heritage that can be found in the roots of Irish society through the arts and politics.”He added: “As Dublin Orangemen and custodians of Orange heritage in the city and the Republic we get no support from state bodies ... this week is heritage week – what better opportunity to have our hall opened for view and discussion “But no interest from the city council.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners.

He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people. If there are issues we will try to work through those issues.ldquoSometimes we will have to make decisions that not everyone is going to be happy with.ldquoWe have to be honest with people. We have to say these are the facts and whether we like it or not we will have to do some things dferently or not at all.Cllr Burnett added. ldquoBut we have to be honest about the levels of pressure on local government.ldquoOur priority has to be services to the most vulnerable.The Labour-led coalition includes members of the former Conservative cabinet, which quit the party when former leader John Thomas was deposed as leader of the Vale Tories. The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for. It will be realistic and fair for everybody.School improvementsThe new cabinet says delivering on major new school buildings is a priority for the new administration.Developments in the pipeline include new builds forPencoedtre and Whitmore High Schools, and expansion and refurbishment of Ysgol Gymraeg Bro MorgannwgAgeing schools in the Vale are set to get a pound. million cash boost for repairs.Llancarfan Primary SchoolLlancarfan Primary School was set to be lsquoclosedrsquoand moved to a new pound million facility in Rhoose.The previous cabinet had approved the plans despite protests from parents and campaigners.Cllr Moore said Llancarfan School move was ldquopremature - but did not commit to scrapping the plan entirely.ldquoIf itrsquos justiable itrsquos justiable, he said. ldquoIf itrsquos not, we will look at alternatives.ldquoItrsquos not an easy decision to take. Itrsquos something we have to take some time about.ldquoWhat Irsquom not going to do is jump or kowtow to people who shout the loudest.Cllr Burnett has previously tweeted the closure of Llancarfan ldquowouldnrsquot be happeningLabour were running the council.New roadsWork continues on outline business cases for two major new roads being proposed ndash the A to M link around Pendoylan and Dinas Powys Bypass between Barry and Cardf ndash but no decision has been made whether either will actually go ahead.The future of both roads rests on whether Welsh Government and the council deem them viable, and whether ministers cough up the cash to fund them.But Cllr Moore said he doesnrsquot think Welsh Government will find the money required for the Dinas Powys Bypass.ldquoItrsquos out of our hands, he said.IncineratorCllr Moore said he believes Welsh Government will order the Barry Biomass incinerator to carry out an environmentalimpact assessment.Cllr Moore, who has previously attacked what he termed ldquoscaremongering and lies around the biomass plant, said he did not want the facility in Barry Docks.He said: ldquoWe opposed it vehemently, both as a council and as a party and personally. It shouldnrsquot be there.ldquoBut now it is there it has to operate within legal parameters.ldquoIf it does, therersquos nothing anyone can do about it.The council refused the original planning permission for the facility, but a planning inspector allowed it in  following an appeal. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was clear there was potential to design a scheme that would honour the buildingrsquos character and heritage, while creating something new and contemporary for future generations to enjoy.Features include double height windows in the duplex and both private and communal outside spaces. A full floor penthouse has a roof terrace to the front and back with panoramic views.Dorothy Foulkes, daughter of Stanley Sadler, who designed and built the distinctive building and ran his business from there for many years, still lives in Penarth and recently visited the site of the development.She said: ldquoI have many memories of the garage over the years. Having stood empty for many years, I am delighted it is being given a new and exciting future.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong.

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does. So I will look for something a bit far out or invent my own and usually try and document them on video.All the proceeds from the day will go towards the charityrsquos Harefield Transplant Appeal, to raise funds for organ care systems to allow more patients to receive le-saving transplants.If yoursquod like to support Mr Glover in his marathon challenge his Justgiving page is: https:www.justgiving fundraising muscleworld article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The paper, which examines the negative impact of a ‘no deal’ EU exit, warns the “Northern Ireland Civil Service’s assessment remains that a ‘no deal’ would have a profound and long-lasting impact on NI’s economy and society”. Among its key points, it says a ‘no deal’ “could lead to a sharp increase in unemployment, with at least , jobs at risk, based on EU export exposure”. “The impact of EU tarfs could reduce NI’s exports to Ireland by % and the inclusion of non-tarf barriers could see a decline of %,” it says. Once again, it raises serious concerns over the agri-sector in particular, meat in particular, and beef especially, in regards to “increased vulnerability to low cost non-EU imports in the GB or NI market”. Its not just the physical goods, though as it says Northern Irelands IT sector is facing the cost of exporting services increasing, by an average of .%. And regarding foreign direct investment– one of the big business buzzwords here over the last few years – it says “under a ‘no deal’ exit, NI’s FDI attractiveness would be negatively impacted”. “A ‘no deal’ would see losses in the medium to long run of % per annum in the case of the number of FDI projects and of .% for FDI-related new jobs.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/hamilton_hotel.jpg","title":"new  bedroom hotel for titanic quarter","story":"Posted on Monday  July  by John Mulgrew Belfast looks set to get a new -bedroom hotel amid freshly submitted plans for a development across from Titanic Belfast.

A statement, signed by  business organisations and trade bodies, says that “two and a half years on from the collapse of the Executive, and now approaching the likely conclusion of the Brexit process, the Northern Ireland business community is deeply concerned at the continued absence of a ing administration and is calling on political representatives to redouble their efforts to reach agreement to get the Assembly and Executive working again”. “There has seldom been a time when strong and effective leadership has been more necessary, both to deliver on the domestic agenda and also to speak up for Northern Ireland in the Brexit process. “We need a fully ing administration to agree and deliver a Programme for Government that will build infrastructure, reform our health service and education system, ensure we have a strong economy, and create opportunities for our young people. We also need effective representation in the Brexit discussions, even at this late stage in the process, to ensure that the economy is protected through whatever changes arise and that all necessary mitigations are sought and secured. “The business community will give encouragement and support to those politicians who stretch themselves to reach a compromise. Without such a commitment and associated action from our elected representatives, we risk irreparable damage to our economy and our society for which future generations will judge us harshly.””  The letter has been signed by the following organisations: Belfast Chamber Causeway Chamber of Commerce CBI NI Centre for Competitiveness Construction Employers Federation NI Federation of Small Businesses Northern Ireland Freight Transport Association Hospitality Ulster IoD NI Londonderry Chamber of Commerce Manufacturing NI Mineral Products Association NI Newry Chamber of Commerce  Trade NI Grain Trade Association NI Hotels Federation NI Tourism Alliance Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry Northern Ireland Food and Drink Association Northern Ireland Retail Consortium Retail NI Women in Business NIView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/qub_1.jpg","title":"ulster business top  sees sales rise by ","story":"Posted on Monday August  by Ulster Business Michael Neill, head of office, AL Goodbody Belfast, sponsor of the Top , Flavio Malnarcic, chief financial officer, Moy Park and Ulster Business editor John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s largest businesses have seen sales rise by .% to more £.bn, the Ulster Business Top  Northern Ireland Companies list  has revealed.The list, sponsored by AL Goodbody, showcases the successes of the biggest firms from right across Northern Ireland.

Editor John Mulgrew looks at the numbers, the analysis and the once household names no longer with us The tattered corner of the Ulster Business Top  list from  probably isn’t the worst way to analogise the then state of the Northern Ireland economy, and a precursor to what was around the cornerWe’ve come a very long way in a decade, and while there are some big and familiar names on the  Top  list, there are firms which have fallen off it entirely, and resigned to the history books post-recession.In former editor David Elliott’s intro to the magazine, it references the fact that most of the accounting periods in the list were just as the downturn was starting to gather pace.Economist John Simpson, writing in the edition, says the “big recession of  and  did not impact evenly across the economy, and recovery will be best seen as a sequence of dferent proportions”.There are some positive things to take from it – including a large glowing image of Victoria Square, which in the more than  years since it opened in the heart of Belfast has become part of the retail fabric of the city.Topping the list at the time was Viridian Group, which owned Northern Ireland Electricity and now includes Power NI as a subsidiary, with turnover of £.bn. However, it made a loss of £m during that period.Second on the list is a business familiar to many. Quinn Group, headed by Co Fermanagh businessman Sean Quinn, posted turnover of £.bn for the year ending    but incurred a loss of more than £m during the same period. There have been enough column inches written about the business in the years since then to fill many a book – and they have.Among those no longer on the list is developer David Patton  SonsLtd, Armaghdown Creameries Ltd and Ballyrogan Holdings.Many others on the list have since been acquired by some of the now giants in their respective industries.Moy Park is an interesting one. Back then it was still a large player in the poultry sector with turnover of £m.Those fortunes have evidently changed dramatically since then, as the company has held the top spot on the list for the last eight years, and now posts big profits and turnover of £.bn.Meanwhile, WR Barnett is on the  list in position , with a turnover of £m and pre-tax profits of £m. In the last  years, it has climbed the list to comfortably take the number two spot with sales of almost  times that of those a decade earlier.As far as employment goes, it was Tesco topping the list in , followed by Bombardier – which at the time had a workforce of around , people – with Royal Mail and Queen’s University following in third and fourth position.A lot has happened in the years since that list. The economy has slowly but surely gotten back on its feet. Growth has been gradual, and in the last year or so has been sitting at around %, while employment levels and unemployment levels are at their respective positive record levels. However, we are amid the most challenging time for business in a generation and some of the signs, and whispered conversations, are far from positive. As I write this, we still sit on the precipice of whether we secure an agreement on Brexit, or shuffle off the edge without a parachute. Let’s hope it’s the former.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/flav_1.jpg","title":"top  moy park takes number one spot","story":"Posted on Thursday August  by Ulster Business From a purely editorial perspective it would be refreshing to have a dferent company head up the Ulster Business Top  Northern Ireland Companies list.But Moy Park has now made it to the top for eight consecutive years, as the poultry processing giant continues to expand both its workforce, global sales and pre-tax profit – firmly setting its place at Northern Ireland’s biggest business, with a workforce of more than , here alone.In the last year, it has grown turnover to just over £.bn, up from £.bn a year earlier, while pre-tax profits have surged by % – rising to £.m in its latest set of accounts, ending December .The business supplies Moy Park branded and own label chicken products to leading retailers and foodservice providers throughout the UK, Ireland and Europe.In numbers, Moy Park processes six million fresh chickens each week, , turkeys a year, along with , tonnes of other ‘added value products’.London-born Chris Kirke replaced long-serving boss Janet McCollum in , less than a year after Craigavon-based Moy Park was taken over by new US owners Pilgrim’s.And around a year ago, Flavio Malnarcicjoined the business – then as executive business director – before taking over as the firm’s chief financial officer.He was formerly business director at JBS Global, and has a senior leadership background as executive director of the poultry and export business in Seara, also as chief financial officer and chief executive at Tyson do Brazil and finance roles in Cargill.“There has been a consistence in the performance. We have been growing volumes… we got to six million birds each week, which is about a third of the UK market. For the UK, it is a signicantly big company.“Looking year-over-year, our performance was very consistent in the last few years.”“For people working there, working for a company which is the largest employer in a country, the top company, it is a source of pride for us.“But I don’t think that drives the behaviour of the team. We are more interested in making sure that our performance is sustainable in terms of margins.“It is nice that we arebut that is not our main goal. We are making sure that we are sustainable, work on quality, safety. There are lots of other things. It’s making sure that we fit our customer needs.“We have a lot focus on that, and we need to be competitive.”And as for growth, expanding turnover isn’t necessarily the main focus, according to Flavio“A lot of the efforts in the last year have been to consolidate the management tools they have in Pilgrim’s. They are very keen on efficiency, so that’s one of their strategies. “ a lot of focus in improving our performance, it’s how we can be more efficient, focusing on a portfolio that feeds our customer base, how we deal with our customers.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
