The hut is used by his family for holidays where he enjoys a great time sailing with his children and grandchildren. To own a hut you have to become a member of the management company for the site. John has received no complaints from neighbours about anything.\u0027 Land Registry records confirm that Labour\u0027s Shadow Chancellor and his wife paid £135,000 in cash in December 2013 for the two bedroom leasehold property in the popular holiday village of Potter Heigham. The average salary in Norfolk is £23,295 and the average first time property buyer price is £185,587. It is believed that the chalet is now worth around £170,000 as they have carried out improvements to it and prices in the area have soared by more than 18 per cent in the last five years according to property website Zoopla. But some villagers have been left less than impressed by McDonnell\u0027s revelation this week that Labour planned to target Britain\u0027s 2.7 million private landlords in its project to redistribute the nation\u0027s wealth. McDonnell said he wanted to offer private tenants the same right to buy their home for a bargain price as council tenants, meaning that landlords would lose out by being forced to sell for less than the market price. The controversial policy would not affect second home owners like McDonnell and his wife who do not rent out their additional property.  One near neighbour of McDonnell said: \u0027When I saw the news about him banging on about punishing people for being private landlords, I thought, \u0027Hang on a minute, he\u0027s a second home owner himself.\u0027 \u0027It seems a bit hypocritical and duplicitous for him to be targeting landlords when he and his wife have their own second home.        The chalet (pictured) is now believed to be worth around £170,000 as they have carried out improvements to it and prices in the area have soared by more than 18 per cent in the last five years according to property website Zoopla         The wooden property has its own jetty and a quayside on the banks of the River Thurne as well as a smart garden with a double swinging seat, a dining table and chairs, and a pergola with climbing roses         McDonnell (pictured with his wife) sparked outrage this week when he said Labour planned to target Britain\u0027s 2.7m private landlords in its project to redistribute the nation\u0027s wealth. He said he wanted to offer private tenants the same right to buy their home as council tenants, meaning that landlords would lose out by being forced to sell for less than the market priceSome of the policies he has been reported as coming up with are very, very Marxist. \u0027At least half the bungalows on the riverbanks here are rented out as holiday homes. McDonnell could probably make £350 a week in the winter and up to £700 a week in the summer if he rented his place out – but he does not do it. \u0027He and his wife just keep it for their families. They come up here quite regularly for weekends, especially in the summer.          One neighbour in the village of Potter Heigham accused socialist politician McDonnell of hypocrisy over plans to target second home owners when he owns one himself\u0027McDonnell\u0027s son finished university last year and came up with three or four friends for a week. They created bedlam, making a lot of noise and jumping in the river. They even bashed his boat into the staithe at Potter Heigham. \u0027I know one of the neighbours called McDonnell\u0027s wife to tell her what the hell was going on at their property \u0027I have seen him relaxing in the garden in full view of all the holidaymakers going past on their boats. Nobody seems to recognise him, but the people who have homes around here all know who he is. \u0027Members of his wife\u0027s family also stay here, and I have seen a guy who looks just like McDonnell. I am guessing he is his brother.\u0027  McDonnell\u0027s chalet cannot be accessed by car and is nearly half a mile walk away from the nearest car park on his side of the river. The neighbour who asked not to be named said McDonnell paid for an annual parking permit in a car park on the opposite side of the river. He added: \u0027When he is coming up here, he calls his handyman who runs a water taxi service. The handyman then takes his boat to the other side of the river to pick him up. \u0027If he wants to go somewhere when he is staying here, he can take his boat across to the other side, moor it up, and then go off in his car. \u0027I remember seeing him early in the morning, dressed in his suit and red tie as he rowed across the river to get to his car. Then a few hours later I saw him on TV on one of the political shows. \u0027The local handyman does a really good job of looking after their place. Last year I think he replaced all the wood on their jetty, their quay heading and their decking. It would probably have cost around £2,000.\u0027 The neighbour revealed that McDonnell sold his 17ft long Skipper 17 yacht with a cockpit big enough for four crew, for around £1,000 last year. He now has another similar sized, but slightly scruffy yacht, with an outboard engine and a mast which can be lowered to get under bridges. The yacht is moored at McDonnell\u0027s own jetty, just a short distance away from a small rowing boat with its own outboard engine on his quayside. A third rowing boat was seen lying upturned on the jetty today. McDonnell and his wife bought their property with 63 years remaining on its lease.          McDonnell has long standing links with Norfolk, having grown up in Great Yarmouth. His mother worked at British Home Stores in the town for 30 years, and his father was a branch secretary of the Transport and General Workers UnionThe freehold of the land is owned by the Environment Agency. In common with all other leaseholders in the area, they are shareholders in the Thurne Bungalow Management Company which manages their homes. Neighbours said that they had to pay a service charge of around £200 a year, entitling them to have their rubbish collected once a week by a rubbish collection boat.  McDonnell has long standing links with Norfolk, having grown up in Great Yarmouth. His mother worked at British Home Stores in the town for 30 years, and his father was a branch secretary of the Transport and General Workers Union. McDonnell and his wife are known to regularly pop in to the BridgeStones restaurant and tearoom at Potter Heigham for tea and snacks. One regular at the café said: \u0027He is a nice guy. He comes to Norfolk to relax. Nobody around here bothers him.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Venice council calls gambling social scourge demands removal slot machines pubs","story":"Share this article          The Rialto bridge in Venice, the city is spread across 118 small islands which are separated by canalsMr Venturini said they had always been worried about gambling but in recent months, there had been a \u0027worrying\u0027 increase in the number of gaming rooms and installation of slot machines in many commercial businesses.\u0027We immediately started to launch a series of measures capable of counteracting this alarming proliferation and protecting the health and integrity of the most fragile people and of the family heritage,\u0027 he said.A ban on such machines anywhere near schools was already being adopted by other cities, he added.The council is praising pubs and bars which take the decision to either remove slot machines or not have them in the first place and say their social responsibility is commendable.  Venice considers banning smoking outdoors as the Italian city continues its crackdown on tourists behaving badlyVenice is considering banning smoking outdoors in efforts to clean up streets Rialto Bridge and St Mark\u0027s Square would be first places to become smoking freeMayor is also considering giving smokers portable cigarette butt containers Italian city has already issued more than 100 Daspo orders fining \u0027rude\u0027 tour By Bryony JewellVenice is considering banning smoking outdoors as the city\u0027s crackdown on badly behaved tourists continues.Mayor Luigi Brugnaro said that during a trip to Tokyo he was impressed with non smoking areas in the busy city and would like to have a similar system in his own.If the ban goes ahead it will first be implemented at historic and crowded areas such as the Rialto Bridge and St Mark\u0027s Square, reports the Telegraph.         Venice has already introduced Despo exclusion orders and fines in a crackdown on badly behaved tourists. Mayor Brugnaro said he was inspired to consider a smoking ban after a visit to Tokyo where there are areas people cannot smoke in (file picture)The Italian city has already started handing out \u0027Daspo\u0027 exclusion orders which fine tourists around £300 for anti-social behaviour.Since the bans were introduced on June 19 more than 100 have been issued, including one to a Canadian woman who sunbathed in a bikini. Locals have also recently succeeded in winning a decades-long struggle to ban cruise ships from docking in Venice, saying they ruin the city\u0027s skyline. The decision came after a cruise ship collided with a small tourist boat along one of Venice\u0027s canals in June.Banning outdoor smoking in Venice, which is visited by around 30 million holidaymakers a year, would help keep the streets clear of cigarette butts.The move would also help cut down on tourists and locals breathing in second hand smoke while enjoying the city. Mayor Brugnaro explained how he would start with the more \u0027delicate\u0027 historic areas of the city, such as the Rialto Bridge and St Mark\u0027s Square.  Mayor Brugnaro said: \u0027I\u0027m speaking as someone who enjoys the occasional cigar, but I always try to avoid smoking when there are lots of people around, even if I\u0027m out in the open.\u0027         Venice is considering banning smoking outdoors. Mayor Luigi Brugnaro explained that the ban would first happen in more \u0027delicate\u0027 historic areas such as the Rialto Bridge (pictured)He revealed that the city is also considering giving smokers portable cigarette butt containers.He said: \u0027Smokers would be asked to be more respectful of the environment and not to throw away their cigarettes.\u0027   It is not yet clear how people will react to the new proposal, but when the Daspo orders were introduced many tourists slammed them.Some called the rules \u0027ridiculous\u0027 while others threatened to boycott Italy and find somewhere to go on holiday.However Mayor Brugnaro\u0027s mind could not be changed and he said: \u0027Venice must be respected. \u0027Those rude people who think they come to the city and can do what they want must understand that they will be taken, sanctioned and removed.\u0027The Daspo fines are usually around £300, plus another £80 for the issue of the order. The time duration for the bans can range between two days and two years.               After a decades-long battle, residents in Venice succeeded in getting cruise ships banned from docking there as they ruined the city\u0027s skyline (file pictures)Two German tourists from Berlin, aged 32 and 35, who made coffee at the foot of the Rialto Bridge, were fined around £800 for their actions. While three French tourists, in their early 20s, were fined for bolting their bikes to the railings of a side street. Last month two Norwegian women, both 28 and from Bergen, were fined €450 each after they went swimming in the Rio di Cannaregio canal.Venice – which was once known as La Serenissima, or the Serene One – has also  suffered damage to its ancient wooden foundations from the bow waves of enormous ships bringing in tourists.When cruise ships were banned from docking in the city in June, it was estimated that 30,000 visitors were dropped off during the peak summer months.The city\u0027s population of 55,000 claimed the ships are threatening to overwhelm them and claimed that of the 60,000 tourists who descend each day, less than half stay the night. "},{"url":null,"title":"The moment cyclist topples pond reporter broadcasts live BBC News","story":"          Suddenly he tips off his bike and raises his arms in the air - almost in a comical way - as he falls beside a small pond outside the Scottish Parliament building         Clouded in darkness it is not possible to see the man clearly but his silhouette enters the frame as the reporter talks about the impact a general election will have on ScotlandSuddenly he tips off his bike and raises his arms in the air - almost in a comical way - as he falls beside a small pond.Putting his hood up and turning his back to the camera the man seems to try to play it cool as he saunters away.And the reporter doesn\u0027t react to the fall at all as she seamlessly continues the broadcast in Holyrood.Charlie Knowler recorded the moment the man fell and posted it on Twitter with the caption: \u0027Man falls off bike into river live on BBC News.\u0027       The man cycles behind the broadcaster as she speaks about the impact an early general election could have on Scottish votersThe moment came after MP\u0027s voted to rule out a No Deal Brexit.

It is particularly stressful when his behaviour stops you gaining access to the outside world and you feel trapped in your own home.\u0027Some of his behaviour has been disturbing and he has demonstrated an underlying obsession. It seems he holds an underlying and worrying hatred for us. Since we got the police and courts involved he has shown no contrition at all. We expect the outcome of this to remedy the situation and prevent further incidents in the future. And punish him for his offending over several months.\u0027         Mr Charnock (pictured leaving Manchester Magistrates\u0027 Court) suffered mouth ulcers due to stress over the harassmentComerford denied causing his neighbour harassment, but was convicted following a two-day trial.Prosecuting Zoe Earle said: \u0027This defendant pursued a course of harassment against his neighbours Mark Charnock and his partner Michelle Lynch. Over the last 18 months the defendant stopped them from accessing their home address by parking across a road they both share. This was the only way the victims could access their home.\u0027Both parties initially viewed it as a civil issue but matters eventually escalated and the police became involved. The defendant during this period deliberately blocked access to their home in a way that stopped them getting access to their home. He parked his vehicle in front of their gates in an attempt to upset them.\u0027It got to the point that the victims struggled to cope with the harassment. Both struggled to cope with every day life. The victim has had significant stomach pains. He was referred to a specialist and they thought it may be cancer but turns out it is an ulcer he feels is related to the stress caused by this.\u0027In mitigation defence lawyer Anne Deakin said: \u0027What instigated all this was an application permission. Mr Comerford suspected that the electric gates built by Mr Charnock may have been constructed illegally and the defendant feels he has the right of use of the whole driveway.\u0027Mr Comerford sought legal advice and through solicitors sent Mr Charnock a letter. This was not a criminal matter and should be dealt with by the civil courts. There have been various reports made by both parties to police.         Pictured: The drive in Salford that Comerford insisted on blocking in a parking \u0027war of attrition\u0027\u0027The prosecution\u0027s case is that this took place over an extended period but there are significant gaps in the behaviour. Six or seven months at a time where nothing is reported. Mr Comerford has has never been before the courts before and he will not be again. He is extremely ashamed this has happened. These matters have been reported in the press and his reputation has suffered a backlash.\u0027He is a businessman and this has had an impact on that in terms of his reputation. It has impacted him financially. He has had to pay for private counsel for a two day trial. In hindsight, reflecting upon his behaviour he has been able to concede the interpretation his neighbours had. The lesson has been learned.Comerford was also ordered to complete a 12 month community order, 120 hours unpaid work and pay £705 in costs and surcharges.He was also issued with an 18 month restraining order banning him from contacting Mr Charnock and his wife Michelle unless through a lawyer. The order stars he cannot cause obstruction and interfere in any way direct vehicular or pedestrian access to and from the Charnocks\u0027 address.At an earlier hearing Comerford accused Mr Charnock of waging a vendetta and said: \u0027We started building our forever home but he objected to three of the planning applications. First the double garage, then the change of fence, and then I wanted to raise the roof by one metre.\u0027He had previously knocked on my door and was aggressive, he was saying: Move your car, move your car. \u0027The first time I was aware of the harassment allegation was when the police turned up at my door. There was no other place to park my car at that moment in time. Only one occasion did Mark ask me to move my car.

But since Tuesday, readers have been posting images on Twitter of their freshly delivered copies, a week before the novel’s official release on 10 September. understands that despite the measures that had bookshops promising to store copies of the novel in a secured area until publication day, around 800 orders were shipped early, but only in the US.In a statement, The Testaments’ publisher Penguin Random House said the cause was “due to a retailer error which has now been rectified”.“We appreciate that readers have been waiting patiently, in some cases for more than 30 years, for the much anticipated sequel … In order to ensure our readers around the world receive their copies on the same day, our global publication date remains Tuesday 10 September,” it said.Amazon UK declined to comment on the leak, forwarding queries to their US counterparts.The leak angered independent booksellers, who took to social media to complain about the lack of repercussions for Amazon. When dealing with an inidual bookshop that has broken an embargo, publishers often delay future deliveries in order to punish them by denying them a rush of first day sales. Publishers Weekly reported on Wednesday that several booksellers had contacted PRH representatives to complain about Amazon’s mistake and demand that they sanction the retailer for violating the embargo.Rachel Cass, of Harvard Bookstore in Massachusetts, told Publishers Weekly that she had signed PRH’s “very strict, very clearly stated affidavit” and, like many bookshops, had not received her copies yet.“It makes us look bad,” she said. “This is bigger than just this book. Customers will see that people who ordered online got their books. They will come into our store and see that we don’t have it yet. They won’t know or care about embargoes they will just see that Amazon can supply them a book and we can’t. They might not come in next time.”The breaking of the embargo means the novel’s contents are are reaching the public domain, with glowing reviews published online on Wednesday. Calling the novel a “fleet-footed sequel” in which Atwood’s “sheer assurance as a storyteller makes for a fast, immersive narrative that’s as propulsive as it is melodramatic”, the New York Times review revealed that the novel explores the “intertwined fates” of Offred, narrator of The Handmaid’s Tale, two young women called Daisy and Agnes, and the disciplinarian figure Aunt Lydia.An extract from the novel published by the  unveils further details of Atwood’s three narrators: Aunt Lydia, who tells us that “over the years I’ve buried a lot of bones now I’m inclined to dig them up again – if only for your edification, my unknown reader”, and two young girls.One, who is adopted and lives within the dystopian state of Gilead, has “a hazy memory of running through a forest with someone holding my hand”. She reveals details of her life under the regime, where girls must have “arms covered, hair covered, skirts down to the knee before you were five and no more than two inches above the ankle after that, because the urges of men were terrible things and those urges needed to be curbed”. The other lives outside Gilead and discovers on her 16th birthday that “I was a fraud. Or not a fraud, like a bad magician: a fake, like a fake antique. I was a forgery, done on purpose.”Atwood, who will take part in a live event screened across hundreds of cinemas around the world next Tuesday to mark The Testaments’ publication, has so far made only one public statement about the novel: “Dear Readers: Everything you’ve ever asked me about Gilead and its inner workings is the inspiration for this book. Well, almost everything! The other inspiration is the world we’ve been living in.”On Wednesday it was also announced that streaming company Hulu and MGM will be developing The Testaments for the screen. In an interview with Atwood for the new book, Time reported that Bruce Miller, showrunner for Hulu’s award-winning adaptation of The Handmaid’s Tale, is currently in talks over how to handle the new material in the sequel. Hulu or MGM are yet to confirm whether the events in The Testaments would be worked into the existing show, starring Elisabeth Moss as the handmaid Offred."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ba013b255e88b50f1e1d3031704109e326691c7/0_591_7583_4549/master/7583.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1d990fbbe6c00eafc217d4c9d217a8fb","title":"the testaments by margaret atwood read the exclusive first extract","story":"Set more than 15 years after The Handmaid’s Tale, Atwood’s Booker prize-shortlisted sequel revisits her dystopian republic GileadOnly dead people are allowed to have statues, but I have been given one while still alive. Already I am petrified.This statue was a small token of appreciation for my many contributions, said the citation, which was read out by Aunt Vidala. She’d been assigned the task by our superiors, and was far from appreciative. I thanked her with as much modesty as I could summon, then pulled the rope that released the cloth drape shrouding me it billowed to the ground, and there I stood. We don’t do cheering here at Ardua Hall, but there was some discreet clapping. I inclined my head in a nod.My statue is larger than life, as statues tend to be, and shows me as younger, slimmer, and in better shape than I’ve been for some time. I am standing straight, shoulders back, my lips curved into a firm but benevolent smile. My eyes are fixed on some cosmic point of reference understood to represent my idealism, my unflinching commitment to duty, my determination to move forward despite all obstacles. Not that anything in the sky would be visible to my statue, placed as it is in a morose cluster of trees and shrubs beside the footpath running in front of Ardua Hall. We Aunts must not be too presumptuous, even in stone.Clutching my left hand is a girl of seven or eight, gazing up at me with trusting eyes. My right hand rests on the head of a woman crouched at my side, her hair veiled, her eyes upturned in an expression that could be read as either craven or grateful – one of our Handmaids – and behind me is one of my Pearl Girls, ready to set out on her missionary work. Hanging from a belt around my waist is my Taser. This weapon reminds me of my failings: had I been more effective, I would not have needed such an implement. The persuasion in my voice would have been enough.As a group of statuary it’s not a great success: too crowded. I would have preferred more emphasis on myself. But at least I look sane. It could well have been otherwise, as the elderly sculptress – a true believer since deceased – had a tendency to confer bulging eyes on her subjects as a sign of their pious fervour. Her bust of Aunt Helena looks rabid, that of Aunt Vidala is hyperthyroid, and that of Aunt Elizabeth appears ready to explode.At the unveiling the sculptress was nervous. Was her rendition of me sufficiently flattering? Did I approve of it? Would I be seen to approve? I toyed with the idea of frowning as the sheet came off, but thought better of it: I am not without compassion. “Very lifelike,” I said.That was nine years ago. Since then my statue has weathered: pigeons have decorated me, moss has sprouted in my damper crevices. Votaries have taken to leaving offerings at my feet: eggs for fertility, oranges to suggest the fullness of pregnancy, croissants to reference the moon. I ignore the breadstuffs – usually they have been rained on – but pocket the oranges. Oranges are so refreshing.I write these words in my private sanctum within the library of Ardua Hall – one of the few libraries remaining after the enthusiastic book-burnings that have been going on across our land. The corrupt and blood-smeared fingerprints of the past must be wiped away to create a clean space for the morally pure generation that is surely about to arrive. Such is the theory.But among these bloody fingerprints are those made by ourselves, and these can’t be wiped away so easily. Over the years I’ve buried a lot of bones now I’m inclined to dig them up again – if only for your edification, my unknown reader. If you are reading, this manuscript at least will have survived. Though perhaps I’m fantasizing: perhaps I will never have a reader. Perhaps I’ll only be talking to the wall, in more ways than one.That’s enough inscribing for today. My hand hurts, my back aches, and my nightly cup of hot milk awaits me. I’ll stash this screed in its hiding place, avoiding the surveillance cameras – I know where they are, having placed them myself. Despite such precautions, I’m aware of the risk I’m running: writing can be dangerous. What betrayals, and then what denunciations, might lie in store for me? There are several within Ardua Hall who would love to get their hands on these pages.Wait, I counsel them silently: it will get worse.You have asked me to tell you what it was like for me when I was growing up within Gilead. You say it will be helpful, and I do wish to be helpful. I imagine you expect nothing but horrors, but the reality is that many children were loved and cherished, in Gilead as elsewhere, and many adults were kind though fallible, in Gilead as elsewhere.I hope you will remember, too, that we all have some nostalgia for whatever kindness we have known as children, however bizarre the conditions of that childhood may seem to others. I agree with you that Gilead ought to fade away – there is too much of wrong in it, too much that is false, and too much that is surely contrary to what God intended – but you must permit me some space to mourn the good that will be lost.At our school, pink was for spring and summer, plum was for fall and winter, white was for special days: Sundays and celebrations. Arms covered, hair covered, skirts down to the knee before you were five and no more than two inches above the ankle after that, because the urges of men were terrible things and those urges needed to be curbed. The man eyes that were always roaming here and there like the eyes of tigers, those searchlight eyes, needed to be shielded from the alluring and indeed blinding power of us – of our shapely or skinny or fat legs, of our graceful or knobbly or sausage arms, of our peachy or blotchy skins, of our entwining curls of shining hair or our coarse unruly pelts or our straw-like wispy braids, it did not matter. Whatever our shapes and features, we were snares and enticements despite ourselves, we were the innocent and blameless causes that through our very nature could make men drunk with lust, so that they’d stagger and lurch and topple over the verge – The verge of what? we wondered. Was it like a cliff ? – and go plunging down in flames, like snowballs made of burning sulphur hurled by the angry hand of God. We were custodians of an invaluable treasure that existed, unseen, inside us we were precious flowers that had to be kept safely inside glass houses, or else we would be ambushed and our petals would be torn off and our treasure would be stolen and we would be ripped apart and trampled by the ravenous men who might lurk around any corner, out there in the wide sharp-edged sin-ridden world.That was the kind of thing runny-nosed Aunt Vidala would tell us at school while we were doing petit-point embroidery for handkerchiefs and footstools and framed pictures: flowers in a vase, fruit in a bowl were the favoured patterns. But Aunt Estée, the teacher we liked the best, would say Aunt Vidala was overdoing it and there was no point in frightening us out of our wits, since to instil such an aversion might have a negative influence on the happiness of our future married lives.“All men are not like that, girls,” she would say soothingly. “The better kind have superior characters. Some of them have decent self-restraint. And once you are married it will seem quite different to you, and not very fearsome at all.” Not that she would know anything about it, since the Aunts were not married they were not allowed to be. That was why they could have writing and books. “We and your fathers and mothers will choose your husbands wisely for you when the time comes,” Aunt Estée would say. “So you don’t need to be afraid. Just learn your lessons and trust your elders to do what is best, and everything will unfold as it should. I will pray for it.”But despite Aunt Estée’s dimples and friendly smile, it was Aunt Vidala’s version that prevailed. It turned up in my nightmares: the shattering of the glass house, then the rending and tearing and the trampling of hooves, with pink and white and plum fragments of myself scattered over the ground. I dreaded the thought of growing older – older enough for a wedding. I had no faith in the wise choices of the Aunts: I feared that I would end up married to a goat on fire.The pink, the white, and the plum dresses were the rule for special girls like us. Ordinary girls from Econofamilies wore the same thing all the time –those ugly multicoloured stripes and grey cloaks, like the clothes of their mothers. They did not even learn petit-point embroidery or crochet work, just plain sewing and the making of paper flowers and other such chores. They were not pre-chosen to be married to the very best men – to the Sons of Jacob and the other Commanders or their sons – not like us although they might get to be chosen once they were older if they were pretty enough.Nobody said that. You were not supposed to preen yourself on your good looks, it was not modest, or take any notice of the good looks of other people. Though we girls knew the truth: that it was better to be pretty than ugly. Even the Aunts paid more attention to the pretty ones. But if you were already pre-chosen, pretty didn’t matter so much.I didn’t have a squint like Huldah or a pinchy built-in frown like Shunammite, and I didn’t have barely-there eyebrows like Becka, but I was unfinished. I had a dough face, like the cookies my favourite Martha, Zilla, made for me as a treat, with raisin eyes and pumpkin-seed teeth. But though I was not especially pretty, I was very, very chosen. Doubly chosen: not only pre-chosen to marry a Commander but chosen in the first place by Tabitha, who was my mother.That is what Tabitha used to tell me: “I went for a walk in the forest,” she would say, “and then I came to an enchanted castle, and there were a lot of little girls locked inside, and none of them had any mothers, and they were under the spell of the wicked witches. I had a magic ring that unlocked the castle, but I could only rescue one little girl. So I looked at them all very carefully, and then, out of the whole crowd, I chose you!”“What happened to the others?” I would ask. “The other little girls?”“Different mothers rescued them,” she would say.“Did they have magic rings too?”“Of course, my darling. In order to be a mother, you need to have a magic ring.”“Where’s the magic ring?” I would ask. “Where is it now?”“It’s right here on my finger,” she would say, indicating the third finger of her left hand. The heart finger, she said it was. “But my ring had only one wish in it, and I used that one up on you. So now it’s an ordinary, everyday mother ring.”At this point I was allowed to try on the ring, which was gold, with three diamonds in it: a big one, and a smaller one on either side. It did look as if it might have been magic once.“Did you lift me up and carry me?” I would ask. “Out of the forest?” I knew the story off by heart, but I liked to hear it repeated.“No, my dearest, you were already too big for that. If I had carried you I would have coughed, and then the witches would have heard us.” I could see this was true: she did cough quite a lot. “So I took you by the hand, and we crept out of the castle so the witches wouldn’t hear us. We both said Shh, shh” – here she would hold her finger up to her lips, and I would hold my finger up too and say Shh, shh delightedly – “and then we had to run very fast through the forest, to get away from the wicked witches, because one of them had seen us going out the door. We ran, and then we hid in a hollow tree. It was very dangerous!”I did have a hazy memory of running through a forest with someone holding my hand. Had I hidden in a hollow tree? It seemed to me that I had hidden somewhere. So maybe it was true.“And then what happened?” I would ask.“And then I brought you to this beautiful house. Aren’t you happy here? You are so cherished, by all of us! Aren’t we both lucky that I chose you?”I would be nestled close to her, with her arm around me and my head against her thin body, through which I could feel her bumpy ribs. My ear would be pressed to her chest, and I could hear her heart hammering away inside her – faster and faster, it seemed to me, as she waited for me to say something. I knew my answer had power: I could make her smile, or not.What could I say but yes and yes? Yes, I was happy. Yes, I was lucky. Anyway it was true.They say I will always have the scar, but I’m almost better so yes, I think I’m strong enough to do this now. You’ve said that you’d like me to tell you how I got involved in this whole story, so I’ll try though it’s hard to know where to begin.I’ll start just before my birthday, or what I used to believe was my birthday. Neil and Melanie lied to me about that: they’d done it for the best of reasons and they’d meant really well, but when I first found out about it I was very angry at them. Keeping up my anger was difficult, though, because by that time they were dead. You can be angry at dead people, but you can never have a conversation about what they did or you can only have one side of it. And I felt guilty as well as angry, because they’d been murdered, and I believed then that their murder was my fault.I was supposed to be turning sixteen. What I was most looking forward to was getting my driver’s licence. I felt too old for a birthday party, though Melanie always got me a cake and ice cream and sang “Daisy, Daisy, give me your answer true,” an old song I’d loved as a child and was now finding embarrassing. I did get the cake, later – chocolate cake, vanilla ice cream, my favourites – but by then I couldn’t eat it. By that time Melanie was no longer there.That birthday was the day I discovered that I was a fraud. Or not a fraud, like a bad magician: a fake, like a fake antique. I was a forgery, done on purpose. I was so young at that moment – just a split second ago, it seems –but I’m not young anymore. How little time it takes to change a face: carve it like wood, harden it. No more of that wide-eyed daydream gazing I used to do. I’ve become sharper, more focused. I’ve become narrowed.Neil and Melanie were my parents they ran a store called The Clothes Hound. It was basically used clothing: Melanie called it “previously loved” because she said “used” meant “exploited.” The sign outside showed a smiling pink poodle in a fluffy skirt with a pink bow on its head, carrying a shopping bag. Underneath was a slogan in italics and quotation marks: “You’d Never Know!” That meant the used clothes were so good you’d never know they were used, but that wasn’t true at all because most of the clothes were crappy.Melanie said she’d inherited The Clothes Hound from her grandmother. She also said she knew the sign was old-fashioned, but people were familiar with it and it would be disrespectful to change it now.Our store was on Queen West, in a stretch of blocks that had once all been like that, said Melanie – textiles, buttons and trims, cheap linens, dollar stores. But now it was going upmarket: cafés with fair trade and organic were moving in, big-brand outlets, name boutiques. In response, Melanie hung a sign in the window: Wearable Art. But inside, the store was crowded with all kinds of clothes you would never call wearable art. There was one corner that was kind of designer, though anything really pricey wouldn’t be in The Clothes Hound in the first place. The rest was just everything. And all sorts of people came and went: young, old, looking for bargains or finds, or just looking. Or selling: even street people would try to get a few dollars for T-shirts they’d picked up at garage sales.Melanie worked on the main floor. She wore bright colours, like orange and hot pink, because she said they created a positive and energetic atmosphere, and anyway she was part gypsy at heart. She was always brisk and smiling, though on the lookout for shoplifting. After closing, she sorted and packed: this for charity, this for rags, this for Wearable Art. While doing the sorting she’d sing tunes from musicals – old ones from long ago. “Oh what a beautiful morning” was one of her favourites, and “When you walk through a storm.” I would get irritated by her singing I’m sorry about that now.Sometimes she’d get overwhelmed: there was too much fabric, it was like the ocean, waves of cloth coming in and threatening to drown her. Cashmere! Who was going to buy thirty-year-old cashmere? It didn’t improve with age, she would say – not like her.Neil had a beard that was going grey and wasn’t always trimmed, and he didn’t have much hair. He didn’t look like a businessman, but he handled what they called “the money end”: the invoices, the accounting, the taxes. He had his office on the second floor, up a flight of rubber-treaded stairs. He had a computer and a filing cabinet and a safe, but otherwise that room wasn’t much like an office: it was just as crowded and cluttered as the store because Neil liked to collect things. Wind-up music boxes, he had a number of those. Clocks, a lot of different clocks. Old adding machines that worked with a handle. Plastic toys that walked or hopped across the floor, such as bears and frogs and sets of false teeth. A slide projector for the kind of coloured slides that nobody had anymore. Cameras – he liked ancient cameras. Some of them could take better pictures than anything nowadays, he’d say. He had one whole shelf with nothing on it but cameras.One time he left the safe open and I looked inside. Instead of the wads of money I’d been expecting, there was nothing in it but a tiny metal-and-glass thing that I thought must be another toy, like the hopping false teeth. But I couldn’t see where to wind it up, and I was afraid to touch it because it was old.“Can I play with it?” I asked Neil.“Play with what?”“That toy in the safe.”“Not today,” he said, smiling. “Maybe when you’re older.” Then he shut the safe door, and I forgot about the strange little toy until it was time for me to remember it, and to understand what it was.Neil would try to repair the various items, though often he failed because he couldn’t find the parts. Then the things would just sit there, “collecting dust,” said Melanie. Neil hated throwing anything out.On the walls he had some old posters: LOOSE LIPS SINK SHIPS, from a long-ago war a woman in overalls flexing her biceps to show that women could make bombs – that was from the same olden-days war and a red-and-black one showing a man and a flag that Neil said was from Russia before it was Russia. Those had belonged to his great-grandfather, who’d lived in Winnipeg. I knew nothing about Winnipeg except that it was cold.I loved The Clothes Hound when I was little: it was like a cave full of treasures. I wasn’t supposed to be in Neil’s office by myself because I might “touch things,” and then I might break them. But I could play with the wind-up toys and the music boxes and the adding machines, under supervision. Not the cameras though, because they were too valuable, said Neil, and anyway there was no film in them, so what would be the point?We didn’t live over the store. Our house was a long distance away, in one of those residential neighbourhoods where there were some old bungalows and also some newer, bigger houses that had been built where the bungalows had been torn down. Our house was not a bungalow – it had a second floor, where the bedrooms were – but it was not a new house either. It was made of yellow brick, and it was very ordinary. There was nothing about it that would make you look at it twice. Thinking back, I’m guessing that was their idea.• © Margaret Atwood 2019.

The general secretary, Brian Strutton, said: “We are clear that we want to settle the dispute and bring about a change in Ryanair for the better.“Pilots in Ryanair are seeking the same kind of policies and agreements that exist in other airlines – our demands are not unreasonable. We want to address issues like pensions loss of licence insurance maternity benefits allowances and harmonise pay across the UK in a fair, transparent, and consistent structure.“Ryanair should stop dragging its feet and get back to the negotiating table.”The airline described the strikes as “pointless and failed”. It said it had operated all 820 flights on Tuesday without cancellation as well as the first wave of flights on Wednesday morning, the last day of the current walkout.It has been embroiled in disputes with cabin crew and pilots across Europe since agreeing to recognise unions last year. A planned strike by Irish pilots, which would have made it far harder for Ryanair to cope with the Balpa walkout, was stopped by an injunction granted by courts in Ireland.Ryanair said: “We call on Balpa to return to talks to resolve any issues of genuine concern for our UK pilots, where Balpa’s strikes have totally failed.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7d8bfe8cb92679296c6d0be1d545feb97955e6b2/0_256_5906_3543/master/5906.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=909f3a2fbcadb7fefcce414034a1387c","title":"the guardian view on tory purges a historic betrayal","story":"The intensity of the current political crisis can dull the impact of events that would, in quieter times, be explosive. Until recently it was hard to imagine Ken Clarke’s political affiliation as anything other than Conservative. He has served in government under four Tory prime ministers. But Mr Clarke and 20 parliamentary colleagues have been driven into exile from Boris Johnson’s party. Their offence was supporting a cross-party bill to prevent a no-deal Brexit.The bill passed its second Commons reading on Wednesday by a majority of 29. Mr Johnson’s aggressive tactics, withdrawing the whip from dissenters, emboldened their rebellion.This is evidence not of the rebels shedding their Tory values but of the party abandoning its roots. Mr Johnson’s eagerness to shred the UK’s relations with its closest neighbours is one symptom of that change. His readiness to defy conventions that underpin democracy is another. Conservatives have harboured suspicion of the European project since the UK joined in 1973, but the party has mutated into something more extreme than was ever advocated by orthodox Tory Eurosceptics. Brexit is no longer a conservative programme for economic or constitutional reform. It is a faith-based revolution in the way the UK is governed.The prime minister himself may not see it in those terms. He has no constant belief, aside from confidence in his own entitlement to high office. Brexit happens to be the most powerful vehicle he could find at an opportune moment in pursuit of his ambition. But he is not the driver. Mr Johnson is a hostage to the same ideological sect that besieged, captured and destroyed Theresa May’s administration. The current Tory leader is unlike his predecessor in style and temperament, but he has made the same fundamental misjudgments: that support from his party’s radical English nationalist wing can be borrowed on a temporary basis that the hardliners can be placated, co-opted or controlled.Mr Johnson says his preference is for Brexit on orderly terms but his preference hardly matters when he has mortgaged his office to people who see any accommodation with Brussels as treason. He signals capitulation to that ethos by referring to the rebels’ plan to avoid no deal as a “surrender bill”, an insidious device to present legitimate democratic opposition as collusion with an enemy. He has also decried pro-European MPs’ “collaboration” with Brussels.This belligerent idiom is certain to resonate with the far right, although Downing Street would never admit to cultivating that audience. When it suits him, Mr Johnson presents himself as a social and economic liberal in the “one nation” Tory tradition. Maybe he even believes it. But his Brexit stance has alienated the voters who would be attracted to such a candidate. He cannot appeal to remainers, and liberal leavers are a niche constituency. Electoral logic thus requires that Mr Johnson appeal to supporters of Nigel Farage. He needs to reassemble the voter coalition that delivered referendum victory for the 2016 leave campaign. Naturally, he defers to that campaign’s mastermind, Dominic Cummings, a restless revolutionary with no respect for or attachment to historic political institutions, including the Conservative party.Mr Johnson won the Tory leadership by posing as the candidate who could deliver Brexit and win an election. He did not say that his method involved purging the party of dissenters, despising its pluralist history, reinventing it as something anti-conservative and risking its destruction in the process.He has already engineered the loss of the Tories’ majority in the Commons and surrendered control of the legislative agenda to opposition MPs. His discomfort in parliament on Wednesday was palpable, although he tried to mask it with the usual repertoire of bluster. In one awkward peroration, the prime minister declared: “Britain needs sensible, moderate, progressive Conservative government.” Even by Mr Johnson’s standards it was a moment of exquisite hypocrisy, identifying precisely the Tory tradition that his agenda and methods seem certain to extinguish."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/adb386b60d34f63ee5d24b9385bf2bc3f79560c1/0_148_3957_2375/master/3957.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a1ad1482fc5e8e812139a3605be61b7e","title":"chris o dowd interview state of the union rosamund pike nick hornby stephen frears","story":"He’s cracked Hollywood. Now he’s playing a manchild in a warring couples comedy by Nick Hornby. The IT Crowd favourite talks delta males – and ‘depraved’ British rulers‘There are very few alpha males,” whispers Chris O’Dowd, “but plenty of delta males. They’re not very masculine, they’re slightly ageing and they have lots of feelings of inadequacy. Delta males – it’s a term that’s very relevant to a lot of people in my life.”In State of the Union, the 39-year-old star of The IT Crowd and Bridesmaids plays just such a character. Tom is a London-based Irish music critic made redundant by the rise of social media. His last active engagement with the world was to get British citizenship in order to vote for Brexit and thereby annoy his wife’s -reading remoaner friends.His wife Louise, played by Rosamund Pike, has his number. “You were out long before Brexit,” she says. “Friends – out. Marriage – out. Life – out.” He’s withdrawn from everything, but saddest of all from sex, crashing out with no deal into unsplendid isolation.About to air on BBC Two, this unexpectedly funny, sweet and touching Emmy-nominated series, written by Nick Hornby and directed by Stephen Frears, takes place over 10 weeks, each 10-minute episode unfolding in a pub in Hammersmith, London, as the pair steel themselves for weekly couple-counselling. They’ve started therapy because Louise had a brief, regretted affair. “In an ideal world,” she tells Tom. “I’d only want to have sex with you.” But this isn’t an ideal world. At night, instead of making love, he scorns her choice of bedtime reading: “How many Scandinavian women are there left to kill?”Tom is a man in arrested development, a theme Hornby has been writing about for decades in books that became films: the obsessed Arsenal fan of Fever Pitch, played by Colin Firth the list-making record-shop geek of High Fidelity, played by John Cusack the kidult of About a Boy, played by Hugh Grant.But most of all, Tom is a reworking of the role O’Dowd played last year in the film Juliet, Naked. His Duncan was professor of television studies who microanalysed The Wire for a living and was besotted with the lame oeuvre of a 90s indie rock star played by Ethan Hawke. No wonder his long-term girlfriend, portrayed by Rose Byrne, was so bored with their relationship.While O’Dowd was funny, some felt the character he played was cartoonish and his predicament too fanciful to be believed. State of the Union is much more nuanced. Tom’s no cipher and Louise is as culpable as him for their problems. You probably know a couple like them. You may even be them.“I mean, she’s Rosamund Pike, so she could clearly do better,” says O’Dowd self-deprecatingly, speaking by phone from California. “But could she be bothered?” Actually, what’s more likely is that Louise wants to rebuild a connection with the man with she loved and whose conversation she enjoys: their dialogue sparkles throughout, even as it expresses all their pain and resentment. “I think that’s right. These guys are better together.”Who will watch State of the Union? “Anybody who’s ever been in a relationship,” says O’Dowd, who was born in County Roscommon, Ireland, but has lived in LA for 10 years. “The interesting thing about it being short-form comedy is that one of the biggest audiences will be commuters. It’s just the thing to watch on your phone for 10 minutes.”If Hornby’s males are often boys trapped in men’s bodies, his women are rarely so confined. Byrne played a museum curator, Pike is an NHS gerontologist (someone who studies ageing). In Hornbyland, women do grownup jobs while the men remain disappointing scions of the patriarchy, piggybacking on their spouses emotionally and, in State of the Union, financially.O’Dowd believes that women aren’t the only losers in a patriarchal society. “I feel a lot of men haven’t benefited either. I know that men have coasted too long in power – but come on! Having to be aggressive? Despising showing your feelings? All that’s hopeless.” Men will benefit from the #MeToo movement, he says. “To be elevated above our protective side is going to be really good for men. Equality is going to be great for everybody.”Charm itself, O’Dowd only gets cross once in our interview. With many Britons trying find enough Irish ancestry to qualify for a passport with a harp on it, Tom may well be the only Irish person who opted to become British to back Brexit. Is he like Tom in that respect? The line goes rather quiet.“It seems oddly fitting to the people of Ireland,” he says finally, “that Brexit is coming down to the backstop. The suggestion that the British government is making – that they won’t fuck us over – is laughable. That’s what they have done for 800 years. People growing up in Britain won’t have much sense of that. Their history books don’t really dwell on the depraved way Britain has treated its closest neighbour. What do I think will happen? Irish prosperity and peace are going to be completely usurped by Westminster. Again.”Otherwise O’Dowd is very much like Tom, a delta male struggling towards middle age. “I’m turning 40 very soon. I was thinking the other day, ‘I’ll be middle-aged!’ And then I thought, ‘I’ve felt middle-aged for a while.’” This year, he says, has been all about taking stock of his life: “What do I want to do with the rest of it?”He loved playing sad-eyed basement geek Roy in The IT Crowd with his catchphrase: “Have you tried turning it off and on again?” And he got a Hollywood break as the sweet cop who puts out for troubled Kristen Wiig in 2011’s Bridesmaids. He now has a regular turn in the TV adaptation of Elmore Leonard’s Get Shorty as a mob muscle aspiring to become a movie producer. We will next see him alongside Melissa McCarthy in The Starling, the two playing a couple who have lost a child in what is billed as comedy drama.While he has thrived in LA, O’Dowd is prone to misgivings. “It’s easy just to follow the work and not think too hard about where you’re going.” He never had huge expectations of his career, but is keen to have “a bit more creative control and more time at home”. He hopes to write again following the success of his book Moone Boy: The Blunder Years, a spin-off from the Sky series of the same name, based on his childhood and filmed in his home town of Boyle.When O’Dowd married the TV presenter and writer Dawn Porter in 2012, she changed her surname to O’Porter. They have two sons, Art and Valentine. He recently tweeted something that Tom could do with taking on board: “Marriage can be tricky and parenting is no walk in the park. What makes both easier is doing them with the best person you know. Happy anniversary my love.” O’Dowd is the youngest of five siblings. His dad Sean is a sign designer, his mum Denise a psychotherapist. What did she make of State of the Union? “She really enjoyed it – she saw a lot of very familiar troubles dramatised in it.” Not least the fact that it’s generally the man who is most sceptical about therapy. Upset that their shrink is a woman, Tom says to his wife: “Why do we have to do all our dirty washing in her launderette?” The shrink’s gender will, he says, make one thing inevitable: “I’m going to get slaughtered.” Why? “Because of feminism.”By the end of season one, Tom and Louise may have worked out some of their problems but I suspect there’s still more than enough material for a second season. “Maybe,” says O’Dowd. “They both need to be stripped of their illusions if they’re going to have a future together. She wants their marriage to be constant rapture. Maybe this idea that marriage is nothing but a joyous experience is nonsensical. I certainly think it is. The truth is that it’s OK to be unhappy.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/389c68006cbf8f9d86bbce718185fb3ea00ac124/0_109_4961_2977/master/4961.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=921add6929cb879cef80db4f1c11ce6d","title":"new wellcome gallery celebrates what it means to be human","story":"London gallery intended as celebration of what it means to be human in 21st centurySome say it smells of modelling clay. Others that it has the vague aroma of talcum powder mixed with vanilla. Or perhaps a freshly painted room.Members of the public will be able to decide for themselves when they rub a scented sculpture designed to evoke the smell of human breast milk. The bronze artwork, which goes on display on Thursday, is a celebration of bifidobacteria and part of a new permanent gallery at the Wellcome Collection in London exploring what it means to be human in the 21st century.Curator Clare Barlow said the gallery was a celebration of the fact “we are all different, but also all connected. We all have an impact, both on each other and on the world around us. Each of the objects raises questions and brings in different perspectives.”She hopes the 50 artworks and objects will encourage visitors “to think more deeply about things, to be surprised by things. We want people to encounter extraordinary research and ideas and art”.There are a number of interactive artworks, including the breast milk bronze by Tasha Marks of AVM Curiosities. She has titled it 5318008 any bored teenager with a calculator will tell you what that spells upside down.Elsewhere is an interactive panel called Resurrecting the Sublime, which, when rubbed, produces a floral, herby smell. It is in fact the lost scent of the extinct flower hibiscadelphus wilderianus, which grew on Mount Haleakalā in Hawaii before its habitat was destroyed by colonial cattle ranching.Music on a jukebox controlled by the public plays songs that relate to epidemics, such as The Streets’ He’s Behind You, He’s Got Swine Flu Tan Tan B and Quincy B’s ebola awareness-raising State of Emergency and LaTour’s HIV-related People Are Still Having Sex.The new gallery, designed by the Turner prize-winning collective Assemble, is ided into four sections – genetics, minds and bodies, infection and environmental breakdown.It contains a number of artworks commissioned by the Wellcome Collection, including Refugee Astronaut by Yinka Shonibare, a life-size sculpture of a galactic explorer carrying a ramshackle collection of earthly possessions.“It is an extraordinary commentary on where we are and where we might be in the future,” said BarlowThese are counterbalanced by less delightful works. Top of the list must be a display that includes eye wash, VapoRub, KY Jelly, a blender and a sieve, which the gallery says “is everything needed for a faecal transplant: where poo from a healthy person is swallowed or inserted into the gut to increase the variety of bacteria”.Barlow said: “It is not something we recommend but at the same time it is a cultural phenomenon. One that says something about the symbiotic relationship we have with our gut bacteria.”• The Being Human gallery at the Wellcome Collection, London, opens to the public on Thursday 5 September"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/707e8319d13174ceef875113cfff37c375fb83e2/0_72_4272_2563/master/4272.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b7faffe9d3ae2d865c6e02e6ea602037","title":"paris tutankhamun ancient egypt","story":"Paris’s Tutankhamun exhibition is a record-breaking hit – but scarabs, pharaohs and man-eating monsters have been thrilling us for centuries Paris’s current mania for Tutankhamun should come as no surprise. The Grande Halle de la Villette exhibition of 150 objects found in the tomb of the ancient Egyptian pharaoh is now France’s most-visited exhibition ever, having attracted over 1.3 million visitors. Many of the objects on show – “wonderful things”, in Howard Carter’s words, including mini-coffins, a gilded bed and a calcite vase – have left Egypt for the first time for the Treasures of the Pharaoh exhibition, which will move to London’s Saatchi Gallery in November.The exhibition’s popularity echoes the wave of “Tut-mania” that swept the west almost 100 years ago when Carter first discovered the boy-king’s tomb. Suddenly everyone seemed interested in Egyptology, evident in the fashions, arts, culture and advertising of the time, and most enduringly in art-deco architecture such as the Chrysler building in New York – especially its distinctive elevator doors – and the Carreras Cigarette Factory in London, with its line of sleek black cats guarding the entrance. US president Herbert Hoover named his dog King Tut, and there were calls for the extension of the London Underground’s Northern Line that linked Tooting and Camden Town to be named Tutancamden.There had been a similar wave of interest in the 19th century following Napoleon’s military campaign in Egypt and Syria, which included a group of scientists and other experts – one of whom discovered the Rosetta Stone during the trip.I can well understand this fascination an Egyptian exhibition in London in 2010 transformed what became my novel The Weighing of the Heart. The book’s narrator, Nick, is a young British man who steals a work of art from the study of his rich landladies on New York’s Upper East Side. The stolen piece is an ancient Egyptian scene, and as the stress of the theft starts to work on Nick and his girlfriend Lydia, its imagery starts to come to life around them, although it’s unclear whether this is really happening or is all in Nick’s head.But originally the artwork they steal wasn’t an Ancient Egyptian scene at all it was a piece of 1960s pop art. Not long after I had started working on the book I visited an exhibition at the British Museum called The Ancient Egyptian Book of the Dead, about what the ancient Egyptians believed happened to you when you die, and had a moment of inspiration.The Egyptians believed in a ceremony called “the weighing of the heart”, similar in some ways to the Christian idea of St Peter standing at the gates of Heaven, deciding whether or not you have lived a worthy enough life to come in. In the Egyptian version, Anubis, the god of embalming, presides over a set of scales with the heart of the dead person on one side and a feather on the other. If the heart is in balance with the feather, you go to Heaven, which the Egyptians called the Field of Reeds. But if your heart is heavier than the feather, you get eaten by a the Devourer, a creature with the head of a crocodile, the body of a lion and the back legs of a hippopotamus.The Ancient Egyptians believed the heart – not the brain – was the home of a person’s mind and conscience and memory. One thing they were afraid of was that the heart would try to grass you up during this ceremony – that it would speak up and reveal your worst sins to Anubis. You could prevent this from happening by keeping hold of a little “heart scarab”.I was spellbound by this ornate mythology. I loved the way it was so familiar in its overall concept but so strange in its details. And I suddenly realised that the painting Nick and Lydia should steal should be an image of this ceremony, the weighing of the heart. It was fitting because the book is essentially about guilt and innocence it’s about you weighing up as a reader how much you trust Nick as a narrator, and it’s about the people around him weighing up how much they trust him. I hope that I found a way to knit all that imagery into the book effectively.Once I’d settled on this, there was a strange coincidence – only slightly less dramatic than the so-called “curse of Tutankhamun”, the mysterious deaths of a number of people connected with the pharaoh’s tomb. When looking for someone to create the book’s artwork, I discovered an artist named James Puttnam who used to work for the British Museum and had become quite well-known for his reproductions of ancient Egyptian scenes. I ended up basing my artist, Edward Hazlemere, partially on him.And at one point in The Weighing of the Heart Nick recalls a school trip to the British Museum, suggesting he may have stolen one of protective heart scarabs from there. I wanted to get the details right, so I looked through the British Museum’s collection of scarabs on their website and identified the one that best fitted the bill. I went to the museum to take a look at it in person. But when I got there and found the case where this scarab was supposed to be, the space for it was empty. Instead of the object itself there was just a note on the wall that said: “Heart scarab (lost)”. Just like in my book, the scarab was gone.I’ll be at the Treasures of the Pharaoh exhibition when it arrives in London to see if the one buried with Tutankhamun has fared any better."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5408cd0b3ca8b88ff00d3de7f4a018f2bb969acb/0_36_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=82a79484ada0c2aa6065d9479bf217d5","title":"richard ayoade webchat","story":"The director, actor, author, presenter and overachiever is joining us for a webchat on 5 September at 12pm BSTIs there another actor who could deliver the line, “I came here to drink milk and kick ass, and I’ve just finished my milk” with as much deadpan aplomb as Richard Ayoade?Before he became a flipping household name as the painfully geeky Maurice Moss in The IT Crowd, the world has owed the actor, writer, director and flaneur a great debt. Since 2000, in fact, when he and Matthew Holness created spoof horror author Garth Marenghi, who’d transition from Edinburgh stage to Channel 4 show (all the while penning books like Afterbirth, in which a mutated placenta attacks Bristol, and Black Fang, which asks the question: what if a rat could drive a bus?)Ever since, Ayoade has appeared in everything from The Mighty Boosh (as the belligerent shaman Saboo) to Danger Mouse (an evil snowman). He has presented every TV show, from the rebooted The Crystal Maze to his celebrity adventures on Travel Man. He has also directed everything from music videos (for bands like Arctic Monkeys, Radiohead and the Yeah Yeah Yeahs) to feature films (his 2011 debut Submarine and a film of Dostoevsky’s The Double in 2014). And now the pinnacle of his career: joining us for a webchat on Thursday 5 September at 12pm BST.His latest project is a book called Ayoade On Top, a sort-of-memoir-cum-ode to the film Gwyneth Paltrow once called the worst she’s ever been in: View From the Top, in which Ayoade argues for the canonisation of “this brutal masterpiece”.

Lemon juice or vinegar for the marinade? Here’s the definitive way to make this Greek version of kebabSouvlaki’s name derives from the medieval Greek for skewer, but grilling meat on sticks was a practice taken from the Muslim cooks of the near east. As the Oxford Companion to Food notes, these days they’re often made of “un-Islamic pork”. Often, but not always, you will find chicken and lamb versions (indeed, in Australia, where post-pub souvas are an institution, lamb is apparently the default).But the consensus on Twitter seems to be that pork is the classic iteration in souvlaki’s homeland, albeit consumed in very different ways depending on where you are – wrapped in bread or on a plate on its own or with chips, salad, onions, pickles, herbs, and a whole array of sauces or simply eaten straight from a pointy piece of wood by the side of the road. But what’s the best way to make it at home?Harley cuts the meat into very small pieces for her mini kebabs, but if you keep them a little larger, they’ll stay juicier during cooking.Buxton’s recipe, as used at the Real Greek chain, is quite a different beast: the sticky, aromatic marinade of orange juice, honey, mustard, paprika, cinnamon and fennel seeds reminds us (not unhappily) of Chinese roast pork rather than souvlaki. This comparison is encouraged by the fact it’s cooked in the oven, rather than on a grill, and so lacks the char that, my testers say, is vital for transportation-back-to-Greece purposes.Memories of Greek holidays also prompt my decision to go for dried oregano, rather than Hayden’s fresh herbs, delicious though they are. My guinea pigs, one of whom follows a largely vegetarian diet, rate them as more interesting, but say the oregano is the thing that sings to them of Greece. We all love the garlic though, so I’m going to keep that, and use lemon juice rather than vinegar as you can squeeze the other half over the salad.Some recipes, including Kiros’, brush the marinade on the meat just before cooking, but you’ll get more flavour if you leave them to mingle for a little longer – I wouldn’t recommend more than three or four hours though, lest the acid in the lemon juice begins to toughen the meat.Hayden gives two serving suggestions for her souvlaki: “The more traditional Greek way, with round fluffy pitta breads, chips and mustard sauce” and “the Cypriot way: in oval pitta breads, with shredded cabbage and griddled olives”.Intrigued by the mayonnaise-based mustard sauce, and tempted by the chips, I opt for the former, but her creamy tzatziki is so very good that most testers opt for that instead. “I’d have to alternate,” the lapsing vegetarian says through a mouthful of meat, “I can’t taste them both together.”Petretzikis is the only one to add vegetables to the skewers themselves, in the form of red onions and peppers. They are a good combination with the charred pork – “like a home barbecue from the 80s!” Martha says joyfully – but are very much an optional extra. It’s easier, I think, to serve the skewers with a tomato salad, perhaps with some thinly sliced red onion and chopped parsley, as most recipes recommend. (Like Kiros, I prefer to soak my onions for a milder flavour, but if you’re less of a wimp, feel free to ignore this step.)Chips are, of course, always a possibility, but bread is a must. Oval Arabic pitta are the most widely available here, but if you’re lucky enough to have access to a shop selling fluffier, round flatbreads (I got mine from a Turkish greengrocers), they’re much easier to roll up around the meat, and better at soaking up the juices too. Or, if you’re more of a sourdough sort, Harley suggests using slices of “country bread” as a plate.I’ll leave the last word on souvlaki to Hayden, a woman practically weaned on them: “Be sure to finish with a sprinkle of paprika”.For the skewers600g pork tenderloin200g pork shoulder2 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed100ml olive oilJuice of ½ lemon1 tbsp dried oregano ½ tsp fine saltTo serve½ red onion, peeled4 large tomatoesJuice of ½ lemon1 small bunch flat-leaf parsley, roughly chopped4 flatbreads200g tzatziki1 pinch paprikaCut the tenderloin and shoulder into cubes of roughly 2x3cm. Whisk together the crushed garlic, oil, lemon juice, oregano and salt in a container large enough to hold all the meat, then add the cubes and turn until well coated.Cover and leave to sit in a cool place for between one and four hours.Soak four wooden skewers in water, if using.About half an hour before you want to eat, slice the onion very thinly. For a milder flavour, put in a bowl of cold water and leave to soak for 20 minutes.Meanwhile, slice the tomatoes and arrange on a plate. Season and sprinkle with lemon juice, then scatter with the drained onion and the parsley.Prepare a barbecue, or heat a griddle pan until smoking hot. Thread the meat on to the skewers, pushing it together so you can’t see any skewer between the pieces. Griddle on all sides until well browned and cooked through. Meanwhile, warm the flatbreads in another hot pan or a low oven.Sprinkle the skewers with paprika and serve with salad, tzatziki and bread.

Grease three 18cm cake tins and line the bases with greaseproof paper.Stir together the flour, sugar, sieved cocoa powder and baking powder in a large bowl. Add the buttermilk, oil, eggs and vanilla and whisk until just combined. Add the boiling water and mix again until combined and glossy. Pour into the cake tins and then bake for about 40 minutes, or until a knife inserted comes out clean.While the cakes are baking, make the buttercream. Add the butter, icing sugar and vanilla to a bowl and whisk until fluffy and almost white. Add the orange rind and whisk in. Add the milk gradually to loosen the consistency a little. Cover and set aside for now. Roughly chop the stem ginger ready for later.When the cakes are ready, leave them to cool in the tins for five minutes, then run a knife around the edge and turn out on to a wire rack to fully cool.Meanwhile, turn the marzipan pink by kneading in just a touch of gel food dye, then craft the marzipan pigs. Paint on eyes and nostrils using black food dye mixed with a little vodka or gin.When cool, stack the cakes, separated by layers of buttercream with stem ginger. Then crumb-coat the sides with a thin layer of buttercream. Chill in the freezer until firm, then apply a second layer of buttercream, this time using a smoothing tool to create smooth sides and a clean edge. (Tip: heat a metal smoother a little to get a better finish.) Place the cake back in the freezer to chill again.Make the ganache drip. Put the chopped chocolate in a heatproof bowl. Put the cream in a pan over medium heat. Take it off the heat as soon as it bubbles and pour over the chocolate. Leave to sit for two minutes, then stir until melted. If any solid chocolate remains, just return the mixture to the pan, stirring over a low heat.When the ganache is of a nice dripping consistency (test it on the side of a glass), use a tablespoon to create carefully controlled drips down the side of your cake, then fill in the top with more chocolate, and arrange the pigs so that they are playing in the mud.Baking with Kim-Joy: Cute and Creative Bakes to Make You Smile is published by Quadrille.

Reed said Boothroyd’s new deal was in train before he returned to the FA and that to take it away before the tournament would have been counterproductive in terms of motivation.“What is more important is that we accept it wasn’t an acceptable performance from the squad and why,” Reed said. “Was it Aidy? No it wasn’t. It was a number of things that collaborate to end up with that and they are things we need to identify so we can put them right.“We had a lot of feedback from the boys. They hanged themselves out and said they underperformed. It wasn’t Aidy. The question now is what you’re going to do about it inidually. The other side of it is that two or three of them are now in Gareth’s thoughts. It’s about turning what were negatives into positives.”Reed namechecked Mount and suggested that the decision of his club, Chelsea, to trust more in English academy products this season – partly as a result of their transfer ban – might open the eyes of other clubs. Frank Lampard, the Chelsea manager, has also selected Tammy Abraham, another young English talent.“It’s not because Chelsea haven’t got the money to spend. They can’t spend it but they’ve introduced two or three players who have held their own,” Reed said.“Those kind of things will change the mindset. Hopefully it gets a bit of impetus and more and more will get that opportunity."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d188745cae32df9d373ee3fc525b4b22c3e74adf/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0672bb872c0ea1e0c5749c5b8f703de4","title":"ten of the best value for money signings around europe this summer","story":"Two Ajax youth products, a Dutch goal machine and players turned down by Arsenal and Liverpool feature on our listThe Lyon playmaker almost signed for Liverpool last summer, only for fitness concerns to scupper a £53m deal. Fears over Fekir’s durability may have reduced his price but he was still expected to attract interest from Europe’s elite after impressing in the Champions League. Instead, mid-table Real Betis lured him, in the summer’s biggest shock move. At 26, Fekir is approaching his prime – and if he can help Betis break the top four, he will have handsomely repaid his fee.Ajax’s team of young talents took Europe by storm last season, but Dolberg flew under the radar. The Denmark international failed to score in the Champions League and lost his place to Dusan Tadic, a revelation in the false nine role. Domestically, Dolberg was far more impressive, with 11 goals and five assists. Nice, recently taken over by UK-based company Ineos and managed by Patrick Vieira, may be the perfect place for the 21-year-old to develop. Don’t be surprised if his next move comes at a far bigger price.Last season PAOK Salonika won the Greek title unbeaten. Koulouris was the league’s top scorer with 19 goals – while on loan at another club, Atromitos. The youth product looked set to bolster the champions’ options but Toulouse swooped for a player with one extraordinary scoring season (25 goals in 35 games) behind him. The 23-year-old, dubbed the “Greek Benzema”, has started well in France, scoring on his debut and adding a memorable counterattacking goal against Amiens.Frankfurt, having sold Luka Jovic to Real Madrid and Sébastien Haller to West Ham, let Ante Rebic leave for Milan on deadline day, and three players with 57 goals between them last term were gone. Adi Hütter has reinvested Jovic’s €60m fee to bolster all areas of his squad, with André Silva (on loan) and Dost the key attacking recruits. The Dutch forward may not be a glamour signing, but he scored 76 goals in 84 appearances in Portugal. The 30-year-old is such a natural finisher he went a calendar year scoring exclusively with his first touch.Part of the Ajax team that reached the Europa League final under Peter Bosz, Sinkgraven found his opportunities limited by injuries before Bosz, now Leverkusen’s manager, brought him to the Bundesliga. Primarily a left-back, Sinkgraven can also play in midfield and as a winger, and completes a useful summer for the Champions League returnees, who also recruited PSG winger Moussa Diaby and Hoffenheim midfielder Nadiem Amiri at reasonable prices.After Lille’s surprise second-place finish last season, Europe’s big spenders began circling, with Arsenal signing Nicolas Pépé and Rafael Leão joining Milan. The Ligue 1 side have replenished their squad with the next wave of young talent, including Bayern outcast Renato Sanches and Turkish playmaker Yusuf Yazici. Osimhen was allowed to leave Wolfsburg last summer but a 20-goal season in Belgium with Charleroi earned him a chance in Ligue 1 – and the 20-year-old has four goals in his first four appearances.From Lionel Messi to N’Golo Kanté via Serge Gnabry, Arsenal have a history of letting superstars slip through their fingers. Bennacer didn’t make the grade there and left for Empoli in 2017 – with a buy-back clause allowing Arsenal to match any bids. When Milan offered €16m after he shone at the Africa Cup of Nations with Algeria, Arsenal got their chance – and politely declined, instead paying a rumoured £12m to loan Dani Ceballos for one season. Bennacer, a holding midfielder capable of creative bursts, could prove to be the latest star that got away.As a Czech international keeper at Rennes, Koubek drew inevitable comparisons with Peter Cech. Although the 27-year-old has not reached those heights, his heroics helped Rennes stun PSG in this year’s Coupe de France final, and drew interest from Porto. It was a surprise, then, to see Koubek shown the door weeks later, after reportedly falling out with the club’s hierarchy. He has landed with Augsburg, where a safe pair of hands are urgently required – they conceded a Bundesliga-high 71 goals last season.The deadline-day deal for Kent is Rangers’ biggest outlay since their financial collapse. Hardly a cut-price fee, then, but the 22-year-old could be crucial if Rangers are to maintain a title challenge. Kent made 43 appearances on loan last season, earning the PFA Scotland young player of the year award. His swashbuckling style earned praise from Jürgen Klopp in pre-season, but he left Liverpool minutes before the window shut.William Carvalho (M), Sporting–Betis, £13.3m: The holding midfielder made 43 appearances in a quietly impressive first season in Spain.Alban Lafont (GK), Toulouse-Fiorentina, £6.75m: The highly rated young keeper failed to settle at Fiorentina and has returned to France, joining Nantes on loan.Juan Bernat (D), Bayern-PSG, £13.5m: The versatile Spaniard featured regularly in Ligue 1 but made the biggest impact in Europe with three Champions League goals.Robin Olsen (GK), Copenhagen-Roma, £7.6m: Sweden’s No 1 failed to fill the gap left by Alisson and has been loaned to Cagliari after the arrival of Pau López.João Moutinho (M), Monaco-Wolves, £5m: Played a pivotal midfield role as Wolves finished seventh in the Premier League, securing a return to Europe.Danny Ings (F), Liverpool-Southampton, loan with £18m obligation: Scored eight goals in his first season but continues to struggle with injury problems.Paco Alcácer (F), Barcelona-Dortmund, loan with £21m option: The striker has been reborn in Germany, his goalscoring form convincing Dortmund to seal a permanent deal early.Hamza Mendyl (D), Lille-Schalke £6.3m: Struggled for first-team chances and has been loaned to Dijon by Schalke’s new manager, David Wagner.Fabian Schär (D), Deportivo-Newcastle, £3m: Became a key member of a reliable defence under Rafa Benítez, and chipped in with goals, too.Saman Ghoddos (F), Östersund-Amiens, £3.4m: The Iranian was signed from under the noses of Huesca, but spent several weeks out with appendicitis, and has been banned for four months after the Spanish side complained to Fifa."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2b6b221112e2ba38a6e03809f920261988ff498a/0_633_4785_2871/master/4785.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fe99eeeb7da909397d1e4612d2de9352","title":"tyrone mings england st marys southampton bulgaria kosovo","story":"Tyrone Mings has said he holds no grudges against Southampton for releasing him as a teenager but would consider it fitting to make his England debut at St Mary’s Stadium next week.The Aston Villa defender hopes to celebrate his rise from non-league football to a first international call‑up with an appearance in England’s Euro 2020 qualifier against Bulgaria at Wembley on Saturday. His family will be present and, if an England debut does not materialise at the national stadium, his next opportunity will come against Kosovo at St Mary’s on Tuesday.Mings was released from Southampton’s academy as a 16-year-old because of concerns over his height. That setback led to a career in non-league football with Yate Town and Chippenham Town but the 26‑year‑old, now an imposing 6ft 5in tall, insists there is no resentment over Southampton’s decision.“I don’t hold any grudges against Southampton for the decision they made,” he said. “It was fully justified at the time. I wasn’t big enough at the time and not physically developed as I needed to be to go into the under‑18s professional set-up. I respect their decision fully. There were people probably better equipped to go in at that moment. Southampton weren’t doing too well with their first-team and with their budgets and were probably fully justified.“It would be fitting if I made my England debut at St Mary’s Stadium but it wouldn’t make it more or less special than making it at any other stadium.”The former Ipswich and Bournemouth defender worked as a mortgage adviser for London \u0026amp Country in Bath, earning £15,000 a year, while playing non-league. He admits time outside the professional game, including a childhood that involved time living in a homeless shelter with his family, has given him greater appreciation for the call-up to Gareth Southgate’s squad.“Back then I couldn’t imagine playing for England at all,” Mings said. “I had other goals at the time I was a mortgage adviser and different goals when I was playing non-league football. Playing for England seemed a world away and I just needed to get back into the professional game at that point.“I can’t say that while I was sat at my desk cold-calling or trying to help people remortgage that playing for England was a real achievable goal. But I’ve worked with great coaches and have been able to play for some great clubs and everything has culminated together to get me to this point.“At times I’ve had to reassess my goals, going through injuries, but it makes this all the more sweet.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d8d6d83db3f4027fb0b46ad276404d988154533f/0_325_4875_2925/master/4875.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c80e218793993e07cdad554d223c696d","title":"from delhi street child to acclaimed photographer vicky roy in pictures","story":"Vicky Roy has gone from surviving in a railway station on food scrounged from a train to an award-winning career in photography.

(If you’re wondering why the song only became so popular recently, it’s because it was featured on the Netflix romcom Someone Great, which came out in April.)So did she steal Mina Lioness’s tweet? Not according to Lizzo. When confronted about the meme in early 2018, the singer tweeted: “Ive never seen this before in my life…But u know…The odds of multiple people having the same idea are VERY high.”Shortly after that, however, Lizzo tweeted Mina Lioness and explained:The 2018 back-and-forth didn’t get much attention. However, the controversy flared back up again last week after Mina Lioness discovered that Lizzo, now a mega-star, had filed a trademark application. “What I cannot get over is how brazen Lizzo and her team have been in ignoring my whole presence,” Mina Lioness tweeted on Saturday. “They’re doing it because they know I have no capital to address her. I’m just the poor Black girl from London that don’t have a dog in the fight.”Here’s the thing: even if Lizzo did take Mina Lioness’s tweet, it doesn’t really matter when it comes to intellectual property (IP) law. Simply tweeting a phrase doesn’t grant you any legal rights.Deborah Peckham, an IP specialist at Boston-based law firm Burns \u0026amp Levinson, notes that if Mina Lioness had commercialized her tweet by, for example, printing it on T-shirts, or using it as a tagline for services, then she might have grounds to contest Lizzo’s trademark application. However, “merely saying a short phrase or word in public doesn’t give you a legal monopoly over it”.Mina Lioness isn’t the only person to have found this out the hard way. Speaking over the phone, Matt Schimkowitz, senior editor at Know Your Meme (the Wikipedia of memes) notes that “Peaches Monroee has claimed for years now that she got unfairly treated in the ‘on fleek’ trend, when people were putting it on T-shirts without crediting her.”To refresh your memory: Monroee, whose real name is Kayla Newman, popularized the phrase ‘“on fleek” in 2014 when the teenager uploaded a Vine of herself saying “eyebrows on fleek”. The short video got over 20m views in five months and it wasn’t long before brands had appropriated it for marketing tweets, like Ihop’s “pancakes on fleek” tweet.Nicki Minaj also used the phrase in her hit song Feeling Myself, and took credit for introducing it to the world. Minaj even called out singer Christina Milian for printing “On Fleek” on T-shirts, joking that she was waiting for her percentage of the royalties. It seems like the only person who didn’t monetize the meme was the young black woman who created it.Kids getting exploited for their unpaid viral labour is, of course, how the digital economy tends to work. Schimkowitz notes that “a lot of people who are creating memes are teenagers” who don’t automatically protect their viral creations with trademark applications. And while monetizing memes may be a modern phenomenon, Schimkowitz points out that “marketing people taking trends from teens is not a new thing – that’s being happening since they invented teenagers”.This isn’t to say that young meme-makers never profit from their viral frame. However, it does seem that the kids who get credit for their creations tend to be white, while the kids who have their work appropriated tend to be black. In 2016, for example, a teenager called Daniel Lara shot to international fame after a video of his friend yelling “Damn Daniel, back at it again with the white Vans” went viral. Lara got a lifetime supply of Vans, was invited on Ellen, and trademarked the phrase Damn Daniel through the company Damn Daniel LLC.Danielle Bregoli, who went viral in 2016 for saying what sounded like “Cash me ousside” and “how bout dat” on Dr Phil, has also cashed in on her 15 minutes of fame. She trademarked both phrases and has threatened legal action against companies using them. Bregoli now has a $1m publishing deal with Pulse Music Group and a $900,000 partnership with CopyCat Beauty. All thanks to going viral when she was 13.Now, let’s say you’ve just fired off a hilarious tweet and are watching it transform into a viral meme in front of your eyes. If you call up a trademark lawyer quickly enough, are you going to be laughing all the way to the bank? Not necessarily.Sometimes memes or phrases become so ubiquitous that they are impossible to trademark. Peckham notes, for example, that that US Trademark Office declined to register applications to trademark OCCUPY WALL STREET (yes, I regret to inform you people really tried to trademark OCCUPY), explaining that “the more commonly a phrase is used, the less likely that the public will use it to identify only one source and the less likely that it will be recognized by purchasers as a trademark”.Ultimately, says Peckham, there are two big lessons to take away from the Lizzo trademark dispute. First, “if you want to protect or leverage your great idea or catchy phrase, you should act fast before it goes viral”.Second, the internet always wins in the end. “Even if the law isn’t on the side of the original writer of the tweet, the power of the internet might still ensure that a second user (Lizzo) cannot cash in by getting a monopoly on the phrase either. The internet will likely own it in the long run … which means we can all go on claiming we are all that bitch.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f20f920f5ed52e0403de8d4812f40b4c69dc83ba/449_312_917_550/master/917.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e454c78ecc22cc87c41ec54937db71ce","title":"you never forget the first time how i lost my investment virginity","story":"Many of us have the sense that our money could be doing more than sitting in a savings account, albeit with some apprehension about what else to do with it. But for Danielle Graph, becoming a first-time investor was less scary than it seemedI’m a control freak. It isn’t my most endearing quality, but it does mean that when it comes to things such as life admin and money matters, I try to heed the girl scout motto and be prepared for every eventuality. But, for some reason, I’ve never tried investing before.I’m lucky enough to have a few work-based pensions, which will apparently provide me with a grand sum of £365 per month to help me heat my home and fill my shopping trolley, once I’m of retirement age. And because I’m constantly thinking and worrying about the future, whenever I’ve found myself with any financial headroom, I’ve been diligent about saving.At the moment, though, I’m finding that, week-by-week, I’m just getting by. I work for a website part-time and my husband is in the luxury goods market, which has been hit by the recent economic uncertainty. Plus, our cost of living just seems to keep on rising – our car, our kids’ after-school clubs, even our cats seem to be getting more expensive.So I’ve decided to try to improve our financial future by dipping my toe into the big wide world of investments. This is completely new territory for me. My only experience of investment pretty much extends to watching Damian Lewis in Billions. Indeed, when people tell me that they “invest”, I can’t help picturing a 1980s yuppie in pinstripes and braces, shouting “loadsamoney” into a brick mobile phone. Can this really be for me?I start researching investments online: the words float across the screen like a different language. I wonder to myself why I’ve never tried investing before? Perhaps it has something to do with my control-freak tendencies? And yet, deciding to invest actually feels like taking control. So, undeterred by some of the jargon I encounter online, I take £1,000 out of our stagnant savings and resolve to try and make it grow. Watch out Wall Street, this twice failing maths GCSE pupil is coming for you.No matter how much I psych myself up, however, the shameful truth is I still have no idea where to really begin. So I turn to my bank, HSBC, and phone its investment helpline. I kick off my chat with the super helpful specialist by asking her to explain everything as if she’s talking to a five-year-old. I tell her I have £1,000 to invest, where do I start? (Though it’s worth noting that you can start investing in some places from only £100.)For a Joe Average like me, the specialist explains that this isn’t some get rich quick scheme, but instead to think about this for the long term – at least a five-year timeframe. Mentally, I start planning a family holiday to Disney World five years down the line. She then checks that I’ve got an emergency fund in place for dealing with any unexpected expenses. Next, we chat about how I might make the best decision for me, where I’d feel most comfortable putting my money and about the various investment options that are available. I make notes – lots of notes. It’s a lot of information to absorb, but once I have the basics, I hang up the phone and bolster what I’ve just been told with information from HSBC’s website, where everything is clearly covered. Then I phone back the helpline with further queries. This approach seems to work best for me, and gives me the best of both worlds: the personal touch over the telephone, plus the chance to supplement what I learn in my own time and at my own pace. Helpfully, everything I’ve discussed with the specialist is available online, including a timely reminder that, when it comes to investments, I may not get back what I put in – along with a brilliant jargon buster which has found itself a special place in my bookmarks toolbar.I focus on three distinct investment options. The first involves opening an account to buy shares in inidual companies – companies whose shares are publicly traded in the stock market. I keep visualising shares as if they’re slices of one giant pizza – the publicly-traded companies get sliced into so many pieces, and you then can buy a slice, or a few slices. Of course, it would have to be the world’s biggest pizza given the sheer number of shares that are typically issued. Plus, it starts making me hungry. The second option involves putting your money into a fund-based investment. A fund is basically a group of investors who collectively put their money together in one basket, and that money is spread out, across a whole range of investments.Thirdly, you can invest in a portfolio, which is basically a collection of different funds.All of these options can also can be undertaken via a stocks and shares ISA (Inidual Savings Accounts). The benefits of an ISA are that you don’t pay income or capital gains tax on what you earn, but you are limited to a maximum of £20,000 investment per year. You can split your ISA allowance between stocks and shares, and cash – a cash ISA being similar to a savings account that offers instant access to your money. A stocks and shares ISA could potentially earn you more money than the alternative, however, there is a greater risk attached, as your money is invested in stocks and shares, which can go down, as well as up.As one of my cats peers over the top of my laptop, meowing for yet more food, she reminds me of all our day-to-day expenses and why I need to try and secure a better financial future for my family. Taking in two kittens from a cat shelter seemed like the best idea at the time, but I had no idea they’d bump up our monthly costs by a rather massive £100, for cat food, litter and insurance.Now that I’m armed with decidedly more knowledge than when I started, I brew a strong cup of Earl Grey, crack open a packet of shortbread and mull over how I want to lose my investment virginity. I decide I don’t want any additional tax worries (who does?) which is why I’m going down the ISA route. I’m also looking for an investment that doesn’t require any work on my part, which is why I opt for something HSBC calls a “managed” solution, which means they take care of managing my funds and keep me updated in regular statements. I choose a stocks and shares ISA which invests in funds, rather than the alternative which invests in shares on the stock market. For the final step, I go through an online process using HSBC’s My Investment tool, which involves answering multiple, intricate questions about my finances, assessing if I can afford to invest, and delving deeply into how I feel about risk. The depth of the questions reassures me rather than puts me off – and it’s been written in a plain, easy to understand language. The tool processes my answers and conclude that I’m a person who’s comfortable with risk – so I opt for the high risk portfolio it recommends.The cost of setting up my ISA is £7.50 with an estimated* £4.50 per annum account fee. It’s been surprisingly straightforward and I bask in the positive feeling of having taken some control over my money. In fact, when I log in to my online banking app moments later, there sits my ISA account, holding my £1,000. I take a mental picture of the moment. After all, you never forget your first time.To invest or access investment advice through HSBC you must be and existing HSBC UK current or savings account customer.

Alex Ledsom unearths its treasuresHike Cannes’ beachesAfter the Romans departed in the 5th century, the Lérins Abbey and its monks controlled this entire coastline, harvesting wine under a vow of silence. Nowadays, they live off the coast of Cannes on Île Saint-Honorat, an inexpensive ferry hop away. The island of Sainte-Marguerite, next door, is where the Man in the Iron Mask was held prisoner. Taste the wine on a tour of the cellars and hike the wild coves and beaches.Discover impressionism among Nice’s leafy Roman suburb, CimiezThe Romans founded the city of Cemenelum in the hills above modern-day Nice (the amphitheatre ruins are a great picnic spot), and Queen Victoria holidayed here centuries later. Visit the Musée Matisse, close to where French painter Henri Matisse lived, and a few streets away, fellow impressionist painter Marc Chagall’s museum, of whom Picasso said: “When Matisse dies, Chagall will be the only painter who understands what colour really is.” Entry is free to both museums with the French Riviera pass.Ride the oceanside train from MonacoThe major towns on the Côte d’Azur are linked by a coastal train route, which for a few euros offers unrivalled views and avoids the traffic – it takes just 25 minutes from Monte Carlo to Nice (the same again to Cannes), and only 15 minutes from Nice to Antibes. Take in some literature as you rumble through the region think Francois Sagan’s Bonjour Tristesse (set on the Côte d’Azur and one of Le Monde’s 100 best books of the century) or F Scott Fitzgerald’s Tender is the Night, which used the majestic Hôtel du Cap-Eden-Roc in Antibes as a backdrop. Pick up some fritters from the stalls at Condamine market in Monte Carlo for your journey they’re called Barbajuan (uncle John), named after the man who supposedly fried his ravioli when he couldn’t find any sauce to accompany them.Discover traditional fishing life at Port de l’OlivetteThe Grimaldi family’s 14th-century chateau forms the cultural heart of Antibes’ old town, and houses the Picasso museum, where he painted for six months in 1946. Traditional fishing still happens at Port de l’Olivette, on the other side of the bay. Have a drink, watching the sailors come and go on wooden boats.Swim in Billionaires’ Bay at Cap d’AntibesThe 5km hike from Plage de la Garoupe winds its way gently up and around Antibes’ headland, over rocky outcrops and through the scent of wild herbs. Stop for a swim in Billionaires’ Bay, admiring some of the most expensive houses in the region from the turquoise waters below.Tuck into street food at Nice’s flower marketLocal farmers have been selling their wares under the striped awnings of Nice’s Cours Saleya market since 1897. Just like Marché Forville in Cannes, it’s a great place to people-watch and become acquainted with tasty street food. Legend has it that the batter for the local chickpea pancake, socca, was poured on the heads of invading Turks in the 16th century. It was later served up to peasants throughout the 19th century, as an afternoon snack or merenda. Socca is cooked like a crepe, costs next to nothing and is beloved by renowned chefs such as Yotam Ottolenghi. The region is also home to pan bagnat, a sandwich made from wheat bread called pain de campagne (literally “bread from the countryside”), rubbed with garlic and olive oil. It’s filled with the contents of salad niçoise – boiled eggs, succulent local tomatoes, fresh tuna, anchovies (optional) and Provençal olives – and drizzled with vinegar.Cool off on Nice’s Castle HillNice’s Colline du Château once housed an impregnable fortress, which was taken down and redesigned as a park in the early 19th century for the influx of European visitors. Take the tourist train from Promenade des Anglais, ride in the lift or climb the steps (the park is 93 metres above the Baie des Anges), cooling off next to the impressive manmade waterfall, built from bricks taken from the castle’s dungeon.Visit Cannes’ medieval fortress and fishing quarterIn the 12th century, the monks built a coastal fortress called Musée de la Castre, which today houses an eclectic art collection. Climb its 109 steps for sublime 360-degree views over the small fishing village of Le Suquet, which grew over the course of 400 years into present-day Cannes.

However, the Bank’s governor pointed to several developments completed earlier this year, including a simplified procedure for customs checks and the publication of an emergency UK tariffs regime for EU imports.Carney said “the impact of that has been to reduce, in our judgement, the worst-case scenario”, but added: “There is more preparation that can be done.”Carney has previously suggested efforts to limit the impact of a no-deal Brexit would help cushion the blow to the economy, saying in March that preparations would help to pull back some of the losses in economic output.Answering questions on Wednesday, the governor suggested he would not intervene in the currency markets to protect the value of sterling under a no-deal Brexit. The pound has slumped in recent weeks, close to the lowest levels in 34 years.He said: “I would underscore that we never have done it.

Momentum, the grassroots Labour campaign, is to focus on a target list including Boris Johnson’s own constituency of Uxbridge and South Ruislip.Cat Smith, the Labour MP who has been tasked with examining voter registration systems in other countries with a view to reform, said: “We will be working hard to encourage young people to register to vote, setting out our policies such as scrapping tuition fees and tackling the housing crisis.”Meanwhile, the National Union of Students (NUS) is launching a voter registration campaign in partnership with the Electoral Commission next week and will be visible at campus “welcome weeks” around the country. Alongside the “Got 5” campaign, the union will also be launching social media videos tailored to inidual student communities to explain the importance of registering to vote.Others have independently been encouraging voter registration by sharing links to the government website. Describing the 48-hour increase as “great news”, the actor and comedian Rob Delaney tweeted: “No-deal Brexiteers’ greatest fears are new voters and young voters.”Also mobilising are a range a of non-partisan groups, such as the charity My Life My Say, which, over the coming days, will be relaunching a nationwide programme of “Democracy Cafes”. In partnership with Starbucks, the cafes aim to be focal points for debate and also voter registration.The work comes as a debate has taken place among academics and others about the extent to which a “youthquake” occurred at the 2017 general election. On the one hand, figures such as Dr James Sloan at Royal Holloway University argue that, beyond the issue of electoral turnout, there was a step-change in youth political participation, as young people were attracted in large numbers to Jeremy Corbyn’s message.Dr William Jennings, professor of political science and public policy at the University of Southampton, agreed there had been a youthquake in 2017 but described its broader impact on the election result as more of a “ripple”.“We’ve seen a historical rise in young voter participating in recent years and Labour have been the beneficiaries, but the overall result and what it did for Labour was quite small. Tens of thousands of students could make the difference across some marginals, but it’s important to remember that turnout is still at a much higher rate among older voters.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/51cb1a0e7e4ea21b069cd128373876bb7af10121/0_173_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d3fc26377457e854fb8d99099f23ab50","title":"no deal brexit food shortages brc","story":"October worst time to stockpile as warehouses full of Christmas goods, says retail bodyRetailers have warned that there will be shortages of fresh food coupled with potential price rises if there is a no-deal Brexit.The body representing supermarkets and other chains told MPs that they could not understand why Michael Gove had claimed otherwise in a BBC interview over the weekend.Fresh food travelling into the UK from the EU will not be subject to checks, but delays caused by checks on the French side could mean perishables such as tomatoes, lettuce, cabbage, cauliflower and cheese could all be hit by delays.“It will affect fresh food in various ways, availability, shelf life and potentially cost,” said Andrew Opie, the director of food and sustainability of the British Retail Consortium.“We modelled that with our members who have told us there will be disruption to fresh food.”He said the original March Brexit date was bad, but October was “probably the worst time to face a no-deal Brexit” with stockpiling capacity limited because warehouses would have long been booked up for Christmas stock.“Logistics are already at full stretch, warehousing is at full premium,” he told MPs.Opie said the consortium had warned the government and every MP of the risks as far back as January.He also warned that there was a basic infrastructure problem, with a shortage of the heat-treated wooden pallets required by the EU to move fresh food across the border.Asked if the government was stockpiling pallets, Opie said no, but they had been told that talks were under way with manufacturers to produce more.The MPs said the French authorities had told them that truck drivers could be delayed for up to eight hours in Calais if they did not have the right paperwork.The committee also heard that Calais and Eurotunnel ports would be “clogged up” in a no-deal Brexit, even in the best-case scenario.She revealed that the French authorities had told HMRC that they “might hold those trucks for between two and eight hours” if they did not have the correct customs declarations documents.Many small businesses “might still leave it to the wire to prepare” and would be caught out.Applying for a special EORI number for exporting to the UK would take “two minutes” but the real issue was the customs declaration itself.It was typically so complex that businesses hire a customs agent to help them deal with the thousands of commodity codes and rules of origin, Wheeler told MPs. “Not something that Joe Bloggs would normally be able to do.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e6f6ef2e3a2549d39d32ef85a682d8b220e8e4a/114_0_3256_1955/master/3256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2425f67af17e73acc199022fbddcb2ec","title":"sajid javid promises decade renewal sets out post brexit spending","story":"Chancellor announces £13.8bn of extra expenditure and vows to build a ‘global Britain’Sajid Javid has promised the largest increase in public spending in more than 15 years as he outlined a £13.8bn package ahead of a possible general election.Announcing the spending review in the House of Commons, he said the cost of government borrowing had fallen to historic lows, giving the government further room to increase annual budgets. “We will bring about a decade of renewal. We will build a global Britain where we will walk tall,” he said.During the statement, Javid was interrupted twice by the Speaker, John Bercow, and ordered to limit his speech to the spending review after the chancellor devoted the early parts of his appearance to attacking Labour’s policy on Brexit. But Javid quickly came under fire from Labour for exaggerating the impact of spending increases after nine years of budget cuts. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said: “The government seems to be spending the money they said was needed to cope with a no-deal Brexit. This is just another stunt and doesn’t in any way show the government is involved in long-term planning.”The Institute for Public Policy Research accused the government of using a “mirage of figures” that would fail to reverse austerity. The left-leaning thinktank said: “The public shouldn’t be taken in by today’s spending review. It does not reverse a decade of austerity and chronic underinvestment in our society and economy.”The tax and spending thinktank the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said that once health was excluded from the calculation, the extra funds barely reversed a quarter of the cuts to spending departments since 2010.The IFS director, Paul Johnson, also accused the chancellor of making commitments using out-of-date economic forecasts by the Office for Budget Responsibility, the government’s independent forecaster, that dated back to the spring and which had since worsened.He said: “By making major spending decisions without having the most up-to-date forecasts for the economy and public finances, the chancellor is taking a gamble. As it stands, there looks to be a very real risk of having to choose between tax increases or missing his current fiscal targets come the budget later this year– even with a smooth departure from the EU.”Javid said a combination of a £11.7bn increase in inflation-adjusted day-to-day spending and a £1.7bn rise in capital spending would push up public budgets next year by £13.4bn. If some 2019-20 funding to prepare for a no-deal Brexit is included, it shows that the government is planning to increase day-to-day budgets across the two financial years by £13.8bn. The spending increase in percentage terms is the biggest since 2003-04. He said the government would set aside £2bn in addition to the £6bn already allocated for preparations related to leaving the EU without a deal. There will be an extra £6.2bn next year for day-to-day spending on the NHS.Briefing journalists after the chancellor’s statement, Treasury officials insisted that the spending round had been carried out within the government’s fiscal limits. “This spending round is delivered in line with our existing fiscal rules, and the existing forecast from the OBR. We said we would do that, and we have delivered that. In the coming months, we will review the fiscal framework, ahead of the budget.”An official pointed out that at Philip Hammond’s final budget earlier this year, he set aside “headroom” of £27bn against the rules, and the uplift in spending set out by Javid was £13.8bn.However, £12bn of student loans must be included in government borrowing from this month, and Hammond made clear that the cushion would be more than used up in the event of a no-deal Brexit – which Boris Johnson insists remains an option – on 31 October.Hammond said in June that he had “no doubt whatsoever” that all of that money and more would be needed to respond to the immediate impacts of the disruption caused by a no-deal exit. “And that will mean that there is no money available for longer-term either tax cuts or spending increases,” he added."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/afff69d59e8ef780aff1ffcea792755d56b67153/0_448_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=49a6978ae91e5e2c84b62a11098b17e1","title":"tories turning into brexit party philip hammonds constituents weybridge","story":"Many in Weybridge, where Philip Hammond has been MP for decades, share his anger at Boris JohnsonHours before his sacking from the Conservative party, the former chancellor Philip Hammond claimed his purpose was to “defend my party against incomers, entryists, who are trying to turn it from a broad church to a narrow faction”. It was a sentiment many of his constituents in affluent Weybridge in Surrey, where Hammond has been the MP for 22 years, seemed to share.“I don’t like the bullying tactics of Boris. He’s trying to get rid of people who voted against him – that’s not right,” said Mick Rogers, 72, over poached eggs and toast in Cafe One on Wednesday morning.Sinasi Ozkan, who owns the cafe on the town’s Georgian-designed and union flag-lined high street, felt similarly sympathetic towards Hammond. “I like him, I think he’s good,” said the 60-year-old, who is originally from Turkey.“He’s involved with the community here,” he said, noting that Hammond had visited the nearby Weybridge centre for elderly and disabled people on several occasions. Like Rogers, Ozkan felt disillusioned with the Tory party more generally: “They messed up with Brexit, it’s come to a point where nobody knows what they want or what they’re doing.”But, outside Stoneleigh’s traditional family butchers, Luisa Maccali said she was going to vote against the Conservatives for the first time. The Italian, who has lived in Weybridge for 15 years, has become exasperated by the government’s stance on the UK’s departure from the EU.“It has affected my life and split up my family,” said Maccali, who added that the bank her husband worked for had moved his job to Paris. “For Philip Hammond to try to get a deal is good. I was happy here and now I’m just waiting to move.“I won’t vote for the Conservatives anymore because they are turning into the Brexit party. I might vote for the Liberal Democrats, or one of the other smaller parties.”Not everyone is turning their backs on the Tories. Soraya Anderson, 56, and Lisa Challis, 60, looking at the lunch menu outside a Spanish restaurant opposite the butchers, both said they supported the government.Anderson, who works for an equity group, said Hammond “should have backed Boris because he needs all the support he can get. Somebody had to do something drastic to get us moving.”Theo Siddons, 22, is a relative anomaly among many of his generation in being a Tory voter, but like many of his peers he said he felt disillusioned with the turmoil in Westminster.“I think politics are important but it’s difficult to keep faith sometimes. I don’t really see a benefit to things like Brexit,” said the mathematics student from Byfleet.Having voted for the Conservatives in the first two general elections in which he was eligible to vote, Siddons said he would vote for the Lib Dems if Britain were to go to the polls in October. “A lot of people I know feel the same,” he said.Although the government has repeated its claims that it is prepared to leave the EU with or without a deal on 31 October, the events of this week seem to have given people such as Siddons renewed hope that other eventualities are possible.He said he was looking forward to the prospect of a general election, “if it can change the outcome of Brexit and if we can get a deal. I know it’s probably not possible but it’s great to think we could not leave at all.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a5645aef0f35dc3721bc3c8a8d431dafc142cbc8/0_178_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=72db51359a86485d1a8c4de5cbff74fd","title":"parliament returns for brexit showdown today in focus podcast","story":"Jonathan Freedland joins Anushka Asthana to discuss a pivotal week ahead in British politics.

The idea is that any surplus energy can be fed back into the system to power people’s homes.The repowered refuse vehicles, which have zero carbon emissions, are part of Sheffield’s drive to clean the city’s air. Sheffield and Westminster have illegal levels of air pollution, with Sheffield city council declaring a climate emergency in February and pledging to become carbon neutral by 2030.Councillor Mark Jones said the project, which uses local firm Magtec to fit the electric engines, puts Sheffield and the region at the forefront of green technology.“Using local expertise, we are piloting a new repowered 26-tonne bin lorry which is powered by the electricity produced by the waste it collects. We believe we are the first local authority ever to do this, putting Sheffield at the forefront of the green energy revolution.“Our city is working hard to deliver clean air and green jobs.

But the 29-year-old Mexican insists that the hunger still burns inside him, and that he is intent on proving everyone wrong for a second time.“I know Anthony Joshua is coming hard, and I know he is going to be preparing really good,” Ruiz said in a press conference in Diriyah, on the outskirts of the Saudi capital Riyadh.“But so am I. I’m really hungry. A lot of people saying that I’m not training, that I’m not taking it serious. Come on, I got all these belts. There’s a lot of responsibilities to this. And I’m going to win here in the same fashion as I did on 1 June. And I’m going to prove everybody wrong.“I don’t want to just have 15 minutes of fame. I want it to last. I want to be a champion for more years. He’s going try to try to take these belts but we’re going to be training really hard for 7 December.”Ruiz admitted he was likely to face a tougher test in the rematch in Saudi Arabia, which has been criticised by groups such as Amnesty International because of the country’s appalling human rights record. But the Mexican also pointed out he would be much better prepared too given he only had five weeks’ notice for the first fight.“He’s more hungry,” Ruiz said. “He wants his belts back. I want to train even harder, you know, because he’s training even harder too. I only had a month and a half to train for the first fight. This time we have a whole camp so it benefits me as well. It’s going to be an explosive fight, two big heavyweights punching each other in the face. It’s going to be exciting.”Joshua, meanwhile, promised that Ruiz’s reign would be a short one. “I’m really looking forward to the challenge,” he said. “Andy is the champion right now, but that will last until 7 December until he has to put his titles in the air.

Having passed 50 for a record eighth Ashes innings in a row, the headache that is this gifted right-hander has returned for Joe Root’s side.Stuart Broad did continue his stranglehold over David Warner and knocked over Marcus Harris cheaply in the morning and there was a wicket for the returning Craig Overton when he bowled Marnus Labuschagne for 67 and broke a stand of 116 with Smith.But overall it was a tough day for the bowlers after Tim Paine won the toss, with 40mph crosswinds sending crisp packets and inflatables flying across the outfield, forcing a period of play without bails on the stumps and forcing run-ups to be aborted regularly. Jofra Archer experienced his first subdued outing as an England player.Overton said: “Smith is obviously a world-class player and he’s back as the Test No 1. He’s always going to be difficult but we’ve got our plans and we’ll try to keep going to them. Hopefully we get him out tomorrow. Conditions really didn’t suit running into bowl. It’s just the rhythm of the run-up – you feel like you’re getting to the crease and all of a sudden the wind hits you and it pushes you forward.Overton’s first Test wicket on home soil mirrored the one that opened his account on debut in Adelaide in late 2017, the only difference being it was Labuschagne – fresh from his fourth successive half-century – rather than the more prized Smith.The 6ft 5in right-armer followed a string of outswingers with one that ducked in and clattered the top of off stump. The groundstaff at Old Trafford had earlier hammered nails into the bails for additional weight to prevent them being blown off by the gusts but they fell to the ground regardless.Explaining the words he offered Labuschagne after the breakthrough, Overton said: “The over before he cut me for four thinking it was the inswinger but I told him it wasn’t. Then I bowled him the inswinger and it worked out quite well. It wasn’t a send-off, it was just saying: ‘That one was the inswinger make sure you keep an eye on it.’”This was a strong comeback from Australia after the galling nature of their one-wicket defeat in Leeds. Labuschagne, speaking after play, explained how the tourists have not bought into the idea of England coming into this Test with any additional edge.The newly promoted No 3 said: “We’ve talked about that not being an issue for us at all. We’re just focused on the process of winning a Test match and not necessarily the overall series.“We haven’t been getting too far ahead when we’ve been doing well and we haven’t been getting too far down when we’ve been doing poorly. I think that’s probably the key to not letting momentum take its course.”On batting in a Test with Smith, the man he replaced at Lord’s as a concussion substitute, Labuschagne said: “It was good fun to sort of spend some time with him. I’d never batted with him before and it was an experience to learn from him.“We were constantly talking out there. You can see when different bowlers come on he changes, with different guards or movements. That’s what makes him the best in the world. He’s always kind of one step ahead, not being reactive but proactive.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2831b26f7fa67efd3e512d9ee0f83b7a164b7b9c/0_0_2400_1439/master/2400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8d5648a1859ae4e9535f48b112af8b8c","title":"the 10 best plays about politics","story":"As Hansard opens at the National Theatre and drama heats up in Westminster, our critic picks his favourite political theatreWhose side is Shakespeare on? As always, it is difficult to tell. Coriolanus is an arrogant military patrician who proves indispensable to the state. The people’s tribunes have a legitimate grievance against a hero who has sanctioned civic starvation, while themselves being devious manipulators. Claimed as both an incitement to revolution and a piece of quasi-fascist hero-worship, the play is magnificently ambivalent.This is world drama’s “I am Spartacus” moment. When a brutally rapacious military commander is killed, the inhabitants of a Spanish village are tortured to disclose the name of his murderer. Their joint cry of “Fuenteovejuna did it” is a momentous tribute to the power of collective action. Yet Lope’s ultimate endorsement of monarchical authority suggests that even popular protest, here led by women, is tinged with historical irony.No one understood better than Schiller the devious machinations of politics. On the face of it this is a romantic tragedy about two warring queens, Elizabeth I and Mary Stuart. But the greatest scene shows Elizabeth beset by contradictory arguments about Mary’s fate. Some argue for execution, others for clemency, while Leicester ingeniously suggests that Mary should live “in the shadow of the axe”. This is power in action with each case reflecting the tactical acumen of the speaker.Any number of Brecht plays would qualify but this is the one that has proved most distressingly relevant to our times. Brecht tells the story of the rise of Hitler, from his beginnings to the occupation of Austria, in terms of Chicago gang warfare. Arturo is one of the great roles in modern drama, and when the actor who plays him finally turns to the audience and says of the hero, “the bitch that bore him is in heat again”, we hear a chillingly accurate prophecy.Miller’s historical drama about the Salem witch trials of 1692 was inspired by Senator Joe McCarthy’s House Un-American Activities Committee and its persecution of suspected communists. Yet the play has unexpected resonances today. It is about a community plagued by guilt, suspicion and fear. As Yaël Farber’s 2014 revival at the Old Vic reminded us, the politics includes an older man’s abuse of his power over a young girl.One of the great neglected modern plays. Griffiths’ theme is the reasons for the failure of revolution in Britain. His chosen form is dialectical debate. An LSE lecturer, a Glaswegian Trotskyite and a northern playwright all put their case with Shavian fervour in the drawing room of a leftwing TV producer. But the key line belongs to the hard-headed old Trot who argues: “You enjoy biting the hand that feeds you but you’ll never bite it off.”Can you have feminism without socialism? That was the question posed by Churchill in this haunting, formally inventive play. Written when Thatcherism was in full flow, it shows the dynamic head of an employment agency denying her working-class roots – and her own daughter – in the pursuit of power. Only at the end does Churchill’s protagonist realise the dubious bargain she has made in adopting inherited masculine definitions of success.A high-ranking government official confronts three of his imprisoned torture victims. We think we know where we stand. But Pinter, with immense subtlety, shows that the power-wielding Nicolas, while relying on a righteous belief in the family, the state and religion, is a deeply flawed and insecure figure who cannot grasp either the instinctive personal loyalties or the principled morality of the people at his mercy.It may seem hypocritical to include this, since I was one of the many critics who attacked Kane’s play on its first showing. While I still think the piece has flaws, repeated viewings have convinced me of its moral and political force. Showing a civil war erupting into a Leeds hotel room, it passionately argues there is an umbilical link between the pain people inflict on each other and the brutality of public violence.Mixing documented fact with imaginative speculation, Hare’s play examined the political process that drove the United States, with British support, to go to war with Iraq. Everything we have learned since has justified Hare’s arguments: that the Bush administration was preoccupied with regime change, that it cynically used 911 as a pretext for invasion and that it relentlessly crushed internal opposition. Perhaps the timeliest lesson today is the reckless folly for the UK of being permanently tied to American coat-tails."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc714d9e0943963391a9b2a7c112f15b4c2c2ddb/77_17_830_498/master/830.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cc953fc9c27b1419fe0538f2d14b9a50","title":"android 10 released everything you need to know about google update","story":"Big update adds gestures, dark theme, smart replies, emoji, privacy and parental controls Google has released its big new update to Android 10, and for the first time it is available for more than just a couple of Google-made smartphones.Announced in May, Android Q – known as Android 10 – ditches the pudding-based names that have been used for versions of Google’s software for the past 10 years including Marshmallow, Nougat, Oreo and Pie.But that’s not the only modernising shift in Android 10.

The back button has been replaced by a swipe from the left or right sides of the lower portions of the screen.The new gestures are fast, smooth and make using large-screen phones much easier, particularly the back swipe gesture, which no longer forces a reach to the bottom left of the phone to tap the back button.Many Android manufacturers have implemented their own dark themes, including Samsung, Huawei and OnePlus. But now Google has added a full dark mode baked into Android 10, which can be enabled all the time or through a schedule. It joins the dark theme added to a variety of Google and other apps available on Android.For those with OLED screens, such as those used on higher-end smartphones, enabling the dark theme can help prolong battery life as only the pixels that are not black consume electricity. But most people will enable it for aesthetic reasons.Smart replies have been expanded from a very limited number of Google apps to most messaging apps, which uses on-device machine learning to provide you with one-tap replies to messages straight from the notification area.It can also open the appropriate app for things like an address, URL or video straight from the messaging app without having to copy or paste anything, such as giving one-tap access to navigation directions in Google Maps.To help reduce notification overload, Android now has the choice of: general alerts as they always have been, which make a sound or vibration silent alerts, which do not make a sound and are held in a cluster out of the way at the bottom of the notification shade or no notification, which blocks an app from showing particular types of notifications or all notifications if you do not want to be bothered by them.Silent notifications are useful for things such apps for accessories that you have attached to your phone requiring persistent notifications to work (sports watches are a good example) or mundane but useful things such as the weather.Google is making great strides to give users greater control over the data they share with apps on their phone, catching up with many of the protections Apple employs in iOS. Android 10 introduces a raft of new controls including the ability to share your location information with an app only when you are using it. Android will also remind you that an app you do not use is accessing your location so you can stop it if you wish.Privacy controls including an app permission manager, personalised ads, location history and Google account activity are now more easily accessible in the settings menu too, so it’s more straightforward to see what kinds of data is being collected and stop it.Google is beefing up parental controls on Android using its Family Link feature, which will now be built into the Digital Wellbeing settings app on Android 10. Parents can set up a new phone or device for their child, link it to their account and take control over screen time limits, app installs, track their child’s usage and set a things like a bedtime when the phone shuts off.The state of Android security updates, which are delivered by Google once a month but do not always reach other manufacturer’s phones in a timely manner, is getting better, with most devices getting at least bi-monthly updates.In Android 10 a new system allows Google to push out crucial security and privacy fixes straight from the Google Play store. That means users won’t have to wait for their phone manufacturer to release a full Android system update to make sure their data is protected. Faster and more frequent security updates are becoming more and more critical as our phones are tempting targets for hackers and thieves the world over.Android 10 includes a large collection of new emoji including gender-inclusive designs, such as gender non-specific representations of professions with the option of specifying male or female models if you’d like.Focus mode, which temporarily silences specific apps you find distracting, is available in beta with a full rollout expected this year. Live Caption, which uses on-device machine learning to put real-time captions on videos, podcasts, audio messages and recordings in any app, will also roll out in the autumn, on Google’s Pixel devices at first."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/291fd3f4a7cd0d6ae33faec5eaeb62928d914a94/269_0_4029_2418/master/4029.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b003660b9fd0c40a5762a5f2208f8dda","title":"a glimpse behind the scenes of gizas grand egyptian museum","story":"Egypt’s vast, much-delayed museum is scheduled to open in 2020. But while Tutankhamun’s treasures are being readied for tourists, some critics see the building as a vanity projectIn the vast, shade-dappled atrium of Egypt’s new Grand Egyptian Museum, construction work surrounded a colossal statue of Ramses II, his left foot striding forward and fists clenched in readiness.Staff welcoming visiting journalists doled out assurances that the towering ancient sculpture was safe from the ongoing building works. On its journey to the new museum last year, the statue was accompanied by 11 horsemen in military dress, amid the sounds of the Egyptian national anthem.If promises of the museum’s imminent completion hold true, the 83-tonne depiction of the third pharaoh of the 19th dynasty of Egypt, also known as Ozymandias, will be the first sight that greets visitors as they enter the 500,000 sq metre museum next year. At more than nine metres tall, the statue almost reaches the vaulted ceiling of the cement structure that is expected to house 100,000 objects, many of which will be displayed for the first time, as well as a 250-seat 3D cinema and children’s museum. It will also have a panoramic view of the Great Pyramids of Giza. But when will it open?The $1bn museum has been plagued by delays since it was first scheduled to open in 2015, a decade after it was conceived. As construction workers filled the atrium and put finishing touches to intricate lattice-work panels that form the building’s front flank, officials said the project was almost finished. Local media recently extolled official claims that the museum will open by 2020.“The Grand Egyptian Museum is a gift from Egypt to the whole world,” said minister of antiquities, Khaled el-Enany, echoing a slogan used to promote the opening of a second Suez Canal channel in 2015, amid claims the mega-project would revitalise Egypt’s economy. Officials said they hoped the Grand Egyptian Museum would attract five million visitors every year, helping to boost tourism and, in turn, the country’s finances.The project’s engineers claim the insulated concrete design overcomes the challenge of desert temperatures, where the roof can easily heat up to 70C, keeping the interior and its precious contents at a stable 23C.The building will supersede the world-famous Egyptian Museum, sometimes called the Museum of Cairo, which was built in the centre of the city in 1901 and currently houses the world’s largest collection of Pharaonic antiquities, including the iconic gold funeral mask of Tutankhamun.The new museum will contain 7,000 sq metres dedicated to the boy-king, with the 5,400 objects retrieved from his tomb (discovered by Howard Carter in 1922) displayed together for the first time, including his three coffins and the funeral mask.One large gold-plated coffin was removed from Tutankhamun’s tomb in Luxor’s Valley of the Kings in July for the first time since its discovery, and trucked to Cairo for vital restoration work before display.“It was a delicate project, as the coffin is very fragile,” said El-Enany, stood in front of the gilded sarcophagus where it lay inside the conservation laboratory adjoining the museum. “We expect that it will take eight or nine months to reach a good enough state to display it by 2020.”Not everyone is impressed by the museum’s grand promises. “It’s a vanity project from the Hosni Mubarak regime,” said Egyptian archaeologist Monica Hanna, in reference to the former president who was deposed in 2011. “But we’ve inherited it, so now we have to live with it.”Mubarak’s Cairo 2050 plan, launched four years before his overthrow, envisioned displacing 7,000 citizens to build a wide tree-lined boulevard linking central Cairo to the pyramids and tourist attractions, including the Grand Egyptian Museum.“Tourists will come if we give them a different experience – we have the highest rate of non-returning tourists. Changing this means reducing harassment, proper public transport and clean bathrooms,” said Hanna. In 2018, a reported 11.3 million tourists visited Egypt, down on the pre-revolution high of 15 million in 2010.Officials remain hopeful that the new museum will gloss over Egypt’s recent troubles, including a car bomb outside a Cairo hospital in August and a roadside bomb that injured 17 when it struck a bus of tourists close to the museum site in May. British Airways provoked the ire of Egyptian ministries in July when it suspended flights to Cairo for a week, citing unnamed security concerns. Egypt’s minister of civil aviation also decided to levy a $25 service fee on all passengers departing Cairo airport beginning in November 2019, in addition to a $25 charge imposed in 2014.Yet Egyptian officials are hoping the fanfare to accompany the museum’s opening will draw visitors. “It will be an event you’ll never ever forget for the rest of your life,” promised Mostafa Waziry, head of the Supreme Council of Antiquities.Looking for a holiday with a difference?

The production team this year substantially increased post-show support in a bid to support contestants after they leave the programme, which will now be aired twice a year.Somerville said the real challenge was not appearing on the reality show itself but adjusting to the level of social media fame and press intrusion that came once he had left the programme: “No matter what you do there’ll be a story about it.”The occasionally bizarre parliamentary hearing included a moment when the MPs studied a video clip from this year’s series of Love Island in which the female contestants donned Playboy-esque bunny outfits while jogging on running machines and attempting to eat a carrot without using their hands.“The gym bunnies routine, some people might say it portrayed a certain stereotype of female beauty, having the girls dressed in bunny costumes,” said committee chair Damian Collins. “Do you feel sometimes the show crosses the line in terms of how it portrays women in particular?”“No, I don’t think I’ve ever thought about it,” replied Biala. “Most of the challenges we do are just really fun, we appreciate getting out of the house. I’ve never sat down and thought about how it reflected women in any type of way or form.”Somerville added: “Even the boys, we have to wear speedos. I wouldn’t usually wear speedos – it comes back to confidence again. They put people on there who are up for having a laugh and having fun.”Although MPs pressed the two witnesses on their treatment by the show’s producers, both witnesses were mainly upbeat about their experience, pointing out that they had benefited from appearing on the show and there was no attempt to get them drunk on camera – with contestants limited to two glasses of wine a day. Biala said that during the 2019 series welfare staff would come on to the set for an hour a day and make sure contestants were well: “They’d come in and they became our friends. We felt comfortable speaking to them.”She also said there was not the high level of behind-the-scenes manipulation that is traditionally associated with the reality TV genre: “I don’t think the producers have a heavy hand in how you do things and what you say. There are instances where if I was having a conversation with someone else, one of the producers could come up and say ‘well if you feel like that would you not speak to that person?’ Things like that have to happen so the public can understand me better and the situation better.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d860d1d12bb7a9d4d32712e272ce382e6b083f2/292_31_3212_1927/master/3212.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b3eaff7181552776517fd18a40444c1e","title":"jeffrey epstein unsealing more documents judge","story":"Unnamed people will be allowed to object to the release of the documents following review, US district judge saidSealed court records contain the names of hundreds of third parties who were mentioned in a civil case involving sexual abuse allegations against the late financier Jeffrey Epstein, a federal judge said in New York on Wednesday.The unnamed people, including a man identified only as “John Doe”, will be allowed to object to the release of the documents following a painstaking review of the materials, the US district judge Loretta Preska said.“In some of these documents there are literally a thousand people” mentioned, Preska said, referring to a tranche of filings that includes more than two dozen depositions.Epstein took his own life last month while awaiting trial in New York on sex trafficking charges.The records also include hundreds of pages of investigative reports, said Jeff Pagliuca, an attorney for Epstein’s former girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell, the daughter of the late British press baron Robert Maxwell.“There’s some work involved in this,” he said of the process the attorneys will follow in determining which names to black out.Preska scheduled Wednesday’s hearing after an appeals court in New York ordered her to review the records and release “all documents for which the presumption of public access outweighs any countervailing privacy interests”.While it is not clear who is named in the records, an attorney for“John Doe” warned that the documents may contain “life-changing” disclosures against third parties not directly involved in the litigation.The attorney, Nicholas Lewin, requested the opportunity to be heard on the matter, citing his unnamed client’s “reputational rights”.The second US circuit court of appeals has already made public more than 2,000 pages in the since settled defamation lawsuit.Virginia Giuffre, one of Epstein’s accusers, filed the case against Maxwell, accusing her of recruiting young women for Epstein’s sexual pleasure and taking part in some of the alleged abuse, all of which Maxwell has vehemently denied.The first release of court records unsealed the day before Epstein’s jailhouse suicide in Manhattan in August contained graphic claims against Epstein and several of his former associates.Giuffre alleges she was trafficked internationally to have sex with prominent American politicians, business executives and world leaders.Giuffre filed the lawsuit in 2015, alleging Maxwell subjected her to “public ridicule, contempt and disgrace” by calling her a liar in published statements “with the malicious intent of discrediting and further damaging Giuffre worldwide”. The lawsuit sought unspecified damages.About one-fifth of all documents filed in the case were done so under seal, a level of secrecy the second circuit ruled was unjustified. However, the appellate court, in unsealing the records, issued an unusual warning to the public and the media “to exercise restraint” regarding potentially defamatory allegations.

But those in power are showing signs of acceptanceDoreen Auciello, 63, was finishing a continental breakfast in a hotel in Daytona Beach, Florida – home of the famous speedway races.As she sat with her good friend Gene, who recently lost her husband, their conversation and that of everyone else in the room revolved around Hurricane Dorian, just offshore.Floridians are used to dealing with hurricane season. It’s hard to deny that the storms are getting stronger, although there is plenty of disagreement as to why.Scientists have been warning that warmer ocean temperatures and higher sea levels are expected to intensify the hurricanes’ impacts.Auciello is retired and lives alone. Her 1967 vintage mobile home, which she bought for $8,000, is all she owns. She knows it could suffer damage and she has no insurance.“No one would insure a 1967 mobile home,” she said. “I don’t know what I’m going to do if it’s destroyed, I’ll be homeless.”She came to Daytona to be close to her sister and indulge in the idea of Florida being paradise.“Florida is like the dreamland. Until you’ve gone through a major hurricane, you don’t know what it’s really like here,” she said.She accepts the facts of the climate crisis. “It’s just not the same as the years go by, all of these storms are just getting worse and worse. Nobody is really taking it seriously and it’s way too late now. You can’t reverse it – the damage, you know.”Auciello had lined herself up a coffee, an orange juice and a strawberry smoothie to get through the day.Regardless of the widespread news coverage of how vulnerable the state is to storm damage, the dream endures: it’s estimated that more than 900 people move to Florida every day.Dorian’s eye was approaching Daytona Beach on Wednesday but the Carolinas now expect the brunt of the storm.Stacy Givens, a Daytona local, believes God is trying to tell us something. “He’s shaking up the world,” she exclaimed, as rather terrifying waves surged up to the sea wall. Rather than a climate crisis spurred by human action, Givens thinks the increasingly frequent monster hurricanes are all part of a ine plan.Like those of many Floridians, his views on climate science can best be described as conspiratorial. “Organizations that want to have control over other people are trying to make more out of the global warming so that they can dictate how business is run and how we use our vehicles,” Bordain explained.Florida is a transient place. People often come to escape their past lives or to seek a comfortable retirement.James Bagwell, 41, has lived in Daytona Beach since 2011. He remodels homes and is struggling financially with being out of work for five days. He thought Dorian was “taking too long” to play out.As the storm paused, catastrophically, over the Bahamas on Labor Day, nerves were fraying in north-east Florida.“I have a little bit of money set aside for emergencies, but not enough for more than five days,” Bagwell said.He sees this extreme weather as part of the cycle of life. “It’s probably nature. If you look at the dinosaurs, they were wiped out by something,” he says. “Maybe it’s close to the time for humans to be wiped out by something and start the next evolutionary ladder.”According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa), five of the 10 strongest Atlantic storms have occurred in the last 10 years. Yet many citizens of Florida are confused when it comes to the origins of hurricanes, and how the human-caused climate crisis is steadily making them more dangerous.Florida has a long political history of climate science denial, which culminated in the former governor Rick Scott, now a US senator, allegedly banning the words “climate change” from any internal government communications. Scott is evolving, however.Now, an unwelcome serving of reality is being delivered to those in power, and it’s becoming increasingly hard to sustain the delusion. The Florida senator Marco Rubio, a sharp skeptic in the past, has called recommended actions in scientific reports are “alarmism” but now admits that climate change is a “real problem”.As a result of these policymakers and their predecessors, the Sunshine state still gets far more of its power from burning coal and natural gas than from renewables, and mass transit systems have struggled to gain traction.But the ever-stronger hurricanes and rising seas affect everyone, regardless of political persuasion, so the center ground of the discussion is finally shifting, forcing even science deniers to make statements acknowledging global heating is happening.The recently elected Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, has hired the state’s first chief resilience officer. Her job is to “prepare Florida for the environmental, physical and economic impacts of climate change, especially sea-level rise”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/112b215e93614838cfbe7d87d9c9f4913db273df/274_0_3047_1829/master/3047.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=469d1e70327a25d3117a7077fe390669","title":"matteo salvini replaced by migration specialist in new italy coalition","story":"Pro-European government seeks to draw line under crisis sparked by far-right leaderA career civil servant and specialist in migration policy has succeeded the far-right leader Matteo Salvini as Italy’s interior minister in a new left-leaning pro-European coalition government aimed at drawing a line under a crisis sparked by Salvini’s populist League party.Luciana Lamorgese, a 38-year veteran of the interior ministry, has in recent years been in charge of planning refugee and migrant reception centres in northern Italy and is known for promoting integration events and policies. She was also the first female security chief, or prefect, of Milan.Her appointment should mark a break from the era of Salvini, whose hardline immigration measures included the closure of Italian ports to NGO rescue vessels and the abolition of key protections for asylum seekers.The coalition assembled by the prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, between the centre-left Democratic party (PD) and anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S) also includes Roberto Gualtieri, an influential PD member of the European parliament, as economy minister. The M5S leader, Luigi Di Maio, will be foreign minister.The new government is expected to be sworn in on Thursday.During the coalition negotiations, the PD repeatedly asked the M5S to abandon the migration policies of the previous government, in which it was in coalition with the League. The key was the abolition of a Salvini-drafted security decree that provided for the seizure of NGO rescue boats and fines for vessels that brought migrants to Italy without permission.Dozens of captains of rescue boats and volunteers subsequently ended up under investigation, with at least eight in the last three months.Prosecutors in Ragusa on Tuesday placed the German captain and the mission chief of the Eleonore rescue ship, operated by the NGO Mission Lifeline, under investigation on suspicion of encouraging illegal immigration. The captain had declared a state of emergency onboard and defied the entry ban, landing more than 100 migrants in Pozzallo, Sicily.Last week Italian officials handed a €300,000 (£270,000) fine to the Mare Jonio, operated by the Italian NGO Mediterranea, which saved more than 100 migrants, including 22 children under the age of 10.Although the number of migrant arrivals in Europe has practically halved in the last two years, hundreds of asylum seekers continue to attempt the crossing from north Africa. Last week, at least two known shipwrecks were registered, according to aid groups, with a total of almost 70 people drowned, while at least two boats have been completely lost.In recent weeks, NGO vessels have saved more than 600 people in total. A French passenger ferry headed to Marseilles from Algiers on Monday rescued 18 people off the Balearic Islands.Campaigners and aid groups hope that, with the new government and above all with the new minister of the interior, Italian policy on the migration crisis can finally change.Graziano Delrio, the PD leader in the lower house, said on Wednesday that a new immigration law has been included in the new government’s political agenda.Carlotta Sami, a spokesperson for the UNHCR in Italy, said: “There is a humanitarian crisis for which everyone must feel responsible: the search and rescue at sea and the common management, at European level, of landings.“There is a chance to carry out inclusion policies towards refugees, policies that consider them a resource and not a problem. There is a lot to do, but we hope Rome will resume the central and crucial role it deserves in these issues.’’On Tuesday M5S members overwhelmingly backed a coalition with the PD in an online vote, giving the final backing to a deal between traditional foes.“This turning point is good. Now it’s time to change Italy,” said the PD leader, Nicola Zingaretti. “We have stopped Salvini and the mere announcement of this phase is making Italy a protagonist again in Europe.”Salvini, who pulled the plug on Conte’s last government on 8 August seeking snap elections he hoped would boost his party, described the new pro-European coalition as “a government born between Paris and Berlin and from the fear of leaving their posts, without dignity and without ideals, with the wrong people in the wrong place.“They won’t be able to dodge the judgment of the Italians for too long. We’re ready … in the end it is us who will win.”The new ministers will face confidence votes starting on Monday. By this time next week, the new government could already be settled in Rome, with Salvini forced to watch from the opposition benches."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/68b3d9a6aa363c7aca5b147cf0bf36bbe1ed50ee/0_0_5167_3100/master/5167.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5ebbc79378443f35de032a1204d4b84d","title":"us iran french initiative economic pressure brian hook","story":"Hassan Rouhani confirmed Iran would be taking step away from 2015 deal after US envoy questioned existence of French proposalThe US state department has shrugged off a French initiative aimed at defusing tensions with Iran, and stepped up economic pressure once more, offering a reward for information that helps disrupt Iranian oil smuggling.A few hours later, Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani, said that the country would expand its development work on new centrifuges for enriching uranium, in a third phased step away from compliance with a 2015 multilateral nuclear deal, likely to escalate the standoff with the US even further.France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, had sought to mediate in the standoff, and tried at last month’s G7 in Biarritz to persuade Donald Trump to accept a confidence-building proposal, by which Iran would return to compliance with the 2015 deal in return for partial relief from US oil sanctions, and a $15bn credit line to finance oil sales.Trump responded positively in Biarritz, suggesting he would accept the scheme if the US did not have to contribute to the credit line.However, on Wednesday, the state department’s special representative for Iran, Brian Hook, called into question the very existence of the French proposal. Asked about the initiative on Wednesday, Hook said: “There is no concrete proposal. We have no idea if there will be one. So we’re not going to comment on something that doesn’t exist.”Hook announced a ratcheting up of the Trump administration’s “maximum pressure” campaign against Iran, offering a $15m reward for anyone offering information that led to the disruption of oil smuggling the US says is being carried out by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).The state department also imposed sanctions on 16 entities and 10 iniduals it accused of being part of an IRGC network smuggling oil to the Assad regime in Syria and Hezbullah in Lebanon, “and other terrorist actors”.As he was making the announcement, the Financial Times reported that Hook had personally emailed the captain of a tanker carrying Iranian oil, and offered him millions of dollars if he would steer the ship, the Grace 1, to a country where it could be impounded.According to the account, which was confirmed by the state department, the first email was sent 11 days after the ship (now renamed the Adrian Darya 1) was released by Gibraltar, where it was temporarily held on suspicion of shipping oil to Syria.“With this money you can have any life you wish and be well-off in old age,” Hook, the head of the state department’s Iran Action Group, emailed the ship’s captain, . It warned him: “If you choose not to take this easy path, life will be much harder for you.”After the captain did not respond, he was placed under US treasury sanctions. Hook emailed or texted “roughly a dozen” captains in recent months to cajole or scare them out of helping Iran evade oil sanctions.“We have seen the Financial Times article and can confirm that the details are accurate,” the state department said in a statement. “We have conducted extensive outreach to several ship captains as well as shipping companies warning them of the consequences of providing support to a foreign terrorist organization.”The story was retweeted by Iran’s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif.“Having failed at piracy, the US resorts to outright blackmail – deliver us Iran’s oil and receive several million dollars or be sanctioned yourself,” Zarif said. He had previously claimed he was threatened with sanctions if he did not go to the White House to meet Trump.“Sounds very similar to the Oval Office invitation I received a few weeks back. It is becoming a pattern,” Zarif added.Hook made clear that the US was focused on closing any remaining loopholes in the oil embargo on Iran, not opening new ones.“There will be more sanctions coming. We can’t make it any more clear that we are committed to this campaign of maximum pressure and we are not looking to grant any exceptions or waivers,” Hook said.Less than four hours after Hook’s announcement, Rouhani confirmed that Iran would taking another step away from the 2015 deal, in which it had accepted strict curbs on its nuclear programme in return for sanctions relief. Trump took the US out of the deal in May 2018 and the US has stepped up sanctions in phases since then.In response, Iran has stopped complying with different elements in the deal, in phases. It has increased its stockpile of low enriched uranium, and boosted the level at which it enriches uranium. On Wednesday, Rouhani announced a third phase, in which Iran would ignore restrictions on its research and development on new models of centrifuges used in the enrichment process.“We will take all necessary steps to protect the Iranian nation’s rights and interests ... Our third step involves the development of centrifuges.

He even said a special prayer for everyone and then, just before he left, he turned around and kicked them where it hurts.It came as a shock.Like pulling out all the stops for a much-anticipated visitor to your home and thinking it has been a great success until somebody discovers he shat on the new carpet in the spare room, the one you bought specially for him.US vice-president Mike Pence met President Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar on Tuesday during an official visit. His Irish hosts, up to their oxters for the last three years in Brexit worry, hoped to impress upon him Ireland’s fears about the consequences of a no-deal Brexit for the country.He could, maybe, stick in a supportive word for us in his talks with Boris Johnson in London – his next port of call.Pence, after all, is Irish American and wastes no opportunity to go misty-eyed about his love for the “Old Country” as he lards on his Mother Machree schtick on both sides of the Atlantic. He couldn’t praise Ireland enough on Tuesday – “deeply humbled” and “honoured” to be going to the hometown of his mother’s grandmother and so on.Strong endorsementBut, after he said all these nice things about the “Emerald Isle” and how much his boss Donald Trump – he sent his best wishes, by the way – appreciates us and all we do to help American security in Shannon, he delivered a very strong endorsement of Boris Johnson and Brexit.No room left for doubt. As Pence read from the autocue and Irish eyes definitely stopped smiling, it was clear he was channeling His Master’s Voice. Trump is a fan of Brexit and of Boris.And this, after such a lovely morning, with Pence and his mother meeting the Taoiseach and his mother.His Irish mother, as Mike calls her. He dotes on Nancy. So he should have known that any Irish mammy will tell you if you can’t say anything good, say nothing at all.Instead, he veered off his rather gushing statement following his meeting with the Taoiseach into some crunching Brexit remarks about our duty to do right by Boris Johnson and the UK.As the air in the steamy ballroom turned decidedly frosty, Pence urged Ireland and the European Union “to negotiate in good faith” with the new British prime minister.The local crowd raised eyebrows and wondered what he thinks the aforementioned EU has been doing for the last three years, if not negotiating in good faith with the UK.Varadkar’s expression didn’t change. He stood on the platform beside the vice-president and hardly flinched, smiling politely.Even when Pence made it worse by not only mentioning “good faith” and “Boris Johnson” in the same context but by also requesting his hosts to have “respect for the UK’s sovereignty”, Varadkar maintained a stoic courtesy.He had to. It’s in the job description for normal prime ministers.Same goes for Higgins, even though it would be true to say that Michael D and Mike Pence do not sing from the same hymn sheet.But international diplomacy is what it is and in the context of going about their nations’ business, everyone has to be seen to get along.But for all that, Michael D’s sprayed-on smile when the US vice-president came to visit him in Áras an Uachtaráin was a joy to behold.The Áras was bedecked with flowers from the garden for the visit of the anti-gay-rights Pence. All the flowers were in shades of pink. The only other colour was lavender.Huge entouragePence arrived with a huge entourage. Higgins escorted him through the Áras and into the ballroom where he invited his guest to sign the visitors’ book. Michael D looked ahead a lot of the time. “Can I invite you to sign. . . ” he motioned towards the book.Pence sat at the table and began to write. The President stood to one side, saying nothing apart from the occasional whisper to his wife, Sabina. The VP kept writing as the silence got louder. Still writing. Michael D looking into the distance.Finally, thank God, Pence stopped writing, which was a relief all round. There was another photo opportunity then the party retired next door for tea. A picture was released of the two groups sitting on either side of a long table – two tables together.The sort of thing when more guests than expected arrive. “Quick, run out next door and ask Assumpta for the collapsible table they got in for Mossie’s wake. Your man from America is only after arriving with half of Indiana. Where’s the big tablecloth?”The talks between the President and the vice-president didn’t take long. Soon, they were waving goodbye from the portico. The dogs didn’t put in an appearance.He didn’t call the vice-president a “w*****r”, which is what he did when he had a row many years ago on radio with a famous American conservative commentator. Michael Graham was his name. Michael D might easily have become confused, because Mike Pence is an adherent of the “Graham rule”. This is where he doesn’t stay alone in a room with a woman who is not his wife so as not to give rise to bad thoughts and the like.Static courtesyAt Farmleigh House, Varadkar’s static courtesy was equally impressive. But then, the Taoiseach has dined before in Pence’s presence.“We are all God’s children,” Leo pointedly told him when they met for breakfast last March in Washington. Just to be clear, they met for breakfast in a roomful of other people. The two men weren’t dining alone, perish the thought.It was a very pleasant event. This was when Leo invited his American host to Ireland and told him to bring along his mother too. It would be a grand trip for her and, in an emergency, if Mike’s wife was otherwise detained, mammy could sit in as chaperone should the VP have found himself unavoidably alone in a dining room with our gay Taoiseach.You can never be too careful. In the end, Pence brought his wife, his mother and his sister to the Old Country, where it seems a lot of the natives have turned alarmingly heathen in the generations since his ancestors left our shores.His morning began with a trip to the Phoenix Park and a courtesy call on the President.To look at Mike Pence, with all smiles and handshakes, you’d hardly think he isn’t very keen on the gays at all.Brave Mike sat down to lunch with the Taoiseach and his partner Matthew and managed not to choke on his Dublin Bay prawns. The VP’s wife Karen, who recently took up a part-time teaching position in a school which bans LGBT pupils and staff, kept her fillets of venison down despite the company.The next prime minister the couple will meet on their trip will be the serial philander Boris Johnson. He’s pretty experienced on the extramarital and premarital sex front, which they abhor.On Tuesday, to be on the safe side, nobody was left alone with the US vice-president in case it might upset him.“We have both been blessed with Irish mothers,” Pence told the Taoiseach when they met the press. He didn’t say anything about Indian fathers (in Leo’s case) but there you go.“I carry Ireland with me wherever I go,” said Pence, speaking of an old Ireland, one his ancestors left generations ago.Still, his visit was a great example of ersity in action. President Trump, who recently visited, is very hands-on with women and likes to grab them in all sorts of places. And his second in command is the opposite. He won’t stay on his own with a woman who isn’t his wife."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4007540.1567598961!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"secret report undermines uk s backstop alternatives","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t A sign on the Northern Irish side of the River Finn in Strabane: The Government and the European Commission have insisted that any proposals they have seen are either completely inadequate and insufficiently secure or technologically unproven. Photograph:   Dan KitwoodGetty ImagesThe campaign by Brexiteers and the British government against the Northern Ireland backstop has been sustained for up to two years with claims that they have a viable alternative that can do everything required of the backstop itself.It goes by the name of “alternative arrangements” and consists in a collection of technological and administrative fixes that would supposedly do away with the need for controls on the Border.The Government and the European Commission have insisted that any proposals they have seen are either completely inadequate and insufficiently secure or technologically unproven.The report, which is marked “official-sensitive” and has been prepared for the UK’s EU Exit Negotiations Board, is dated August.It looks at the challenges involved on the Border in a no-deal situation and summarises the work of multiple subcommittees and the NI Department of Agriculture Environment and Rural Affairs (DAERA) in assessing a variety of “alternative arrangements” (also referred to as “facilitations”) as a basis for preparation of a UK negotiating position.The report’s authors warn that it should not be released – “we and other departments have cautioned against this given the potential negative impacts on the renegotiation with the EU and we understand No 10 are in agreement . . . ”Not least, no doubt, because the report so clearly undermines public claims that the UK has in its negotiating back pocket a straightforward alternative to the backstop: “It is evident that every facilitation has concerns and issues related to them. The complexity of combining them into something more systemic and as part of one package is a key missing factor at present.”The “concerns” are technical capacity (much is beyond available technology), the administrative burden (particularly on small business), and political. \u0026nbspSmall businessesSmall businesses, for example, may simply not have the capability to share the required data and are likely to be most reluctant to share commercially sensitive data necessary for “smarter risking”, data-based\u0026nbsp calculations \u0026nbspof\u0026nbsp traders’ likely compliance to reduce the need to check them.And the creation of a common all-Ireland veterinary and phytosanitary zone (SPS), seen as among the most attractive, deliverable and negotiable options, raises “many of the challenges of the backstop” – “democratic accountability, eastwest implications , and implications for international trade”.The common SPS zone would require customs declarations on all cross-border goods and checks on the Irish Sea.The idea of using mobile SPS checks away from the Border was seen as “attracting very poor negotiability” and as the “most untenable facilitation”, impractical, and involving high security risks. And the report warns that as most food consignments are chilled or frozen, physical inspection would require unloading “to maintain the integrity of the cold chain, this would need to take place in a temperature controlled fixed facility.” All over the countryside?EU regulations mandate SPS inspections “at the point of entry”.Onboard vehicle technology which could track the location, weight and temperature of goods is also considered risky if a lorry might suddenly be taken out of service and goods offloaded into a non-registered vehicle.Physical goods checks through mobile units could take weeks and involve lengthy periods of quarantine, the report found. The units could also be vulnerable to “targeting” and staff could be at risk, the report said.Assessments of the potential of artificial intelligence and the internet of things, a new “border code” set of rules for all, and new industry-based regulatory approaches need further work, the report warns.Trusted traders“Trusted trader” schemes, widely touted as being capable of removing the necessity for checks on the bulk of regular trade, are seen as having potential but requiring elaborate administration.But even if adopted, the necessity of border checks on a minority of goods, and particularly of SPS controls, mean that border-based controls cannot simply be wished away – a challenge not just for the UK authorities, but for those in the South who have long insisted that the UK’s alternative arrangements are simply not practical or remotely ready for use.With little prospect of any viable UK backstop alternative emerging ahead of a UK election, and the prospect of a no-deal Brexit looming larger, Dublin is understood to be quietly but intensively preparing for the inevitability of some form of hard border controls.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

With Google Play system updates, important Security and Privacy fixes can now be sent directly to your phone from Google Play, just the same way all your other apps update. So you get these fixes as soon as they are available.As part of the new update Google also introduced dark mode - a highly-anticipated feature among Android users in recent years.The new Dark theme is designed to take it easy on your eyes when using a smartphone in low-light conditions. Google claims it will also help prolong a device\u0027s battery life.Other new features in a sound amplifier to boost sound and filter out background noise, as well as gesture navigation to move between apps using swipes.This last feature means the back button, which has been a staple of\u0026nbspAndroid operating systems in recent years, has now been removed.Instead users will need to learn how to get around with a swipe and a pull. Google claims this new system is designed to be quicker and more intuitive, though it is already proving controversial among Android users.Finally, Android 10 comes with support for folding phones, meaning its interface can seamlessly transition between different screen shapes.Both Samsung and Huawei plan to release folding smartphones later this year in the form of the Galaxy Fold and the Mate X, though their launch has been delayed due to issues with the mechanism.Their delayed launch means they could come already shipped with the new operating system.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Sterling has tumbled almost 19 per cent since the EU referendum in June 2016.The government’s defeat by a margin of 328 to 301 on Tuesday leaves Mr Johnson’s Brexit strategy in tatters by potentially robbing him of the threat of no-deal, which he has repeatedly said is essential to obtain concessions from the EU.Responding from the despatch box immediately after the result, the prime minister said he would table a bill to trigger a general election, with a vote expected to take place soon after the anti-no deal bill completes its passage through the Commons on Wednesday.But Mr Johnson’s plans seemed doomed to failure after Labour said it would not back his election motion, which requires a two-thirds majority and is therefore dependent on opposition support to pass through the Commons, until the legislation to stop no-deal is passed.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Analysts said there was little prospect of the industry recovering in the last quarter of 2019 and September’s data was likely to be even bleaker.The UK’s manufacturing output slumped to a seven-year low last month as the sector shrank at the fastest rate since 2012, the industry’s PMI showed on Monday.Economists will be closely watching Wednesday’s data for the services sector, which accounts for about 80 per cent of UK output and posted unexpected growth in July, for an indication as to the health of the wider British economy.A poor performance\u0026nbspfor August\u0026nbspwould raise serious questions about Britain’s ability to bounce back from an overall economic contraction in the second quarter of this year. A second contraction in the current quarter would signal a recession.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Set building begins on Waterloo Place in Edinburgh ahead of filming for Fast and Furious 9Members of the Royal Southern Yacht Club and the Island Sailing Club take part during the annual cricket match between the clubs, which takes place on the Bramble Bank sandbank in the middle of the Solent at low tideAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate at Whitehall in LondonOne of the iconic \u0027Girl with Balloon\u0027 artworks by anonymous street artist Banksy is carried near one of the original locations the artwork appeared at on the Southbank in LondonThe sun rises over the sculpture The Couple by artist Sean Henry, at Newbiggin-by-the-sea in NorthumberlandA person wearing a Boris Johnson \u0027head\u0027 digs a grave at the foot of a tombstone during a protest organised by Avaaz and Best for Britain, outside Downing Street in LondonNat Lofthouse statue is covered in flags at the University of Bolton Stadium, BoltonPerformers take part in Notting Hill Carnival.

Total sales were flat, despite the summer’s BBQ-friendly\u0026nbspweather providing a small boost to food purchases, according to the British Retail Consortium-KPMG sales monitor.“August proved to be yet another incredibly disappointing month for retail,” said Paul Martin, KPMG’s UK head of retail. “With a budgetary spending review, the Brexit crunch point looming and potentially a general election on the cards, it’s clear that the only thing that is certain in the coming months is further uncertainty.”The British Retail Consortium warned the UK high street was likely to suffer further store closures and job losses and called on the chancellor\u0026nbspto “fix the broken business-rates system”,\u0026nbspwhich firms have warned stacks\u0026nbspthe odds in\u0026nbspfavour of\u0026nbsponline shopping companies.Signs of a wilting economy also raise the stakes for Boris Johnson, who is preparing to face off against MPs seeking to block a no-deal Brexit this week and has indicated he could call a snap election.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

A reading below 50 indicates contraction, while higher than 50 shows growth.Duncan Brock, group director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply, said the sector had “clung on by its fingertips this month” as overseas clients “abandoned spending in favour of a wait-and-see approach and the political environment became increasingly murky”.He added: “There’s only so much companies can do to absorb costs before UK consumers notice the impact to their wallets, and only so much Brexit indecision the sector can take before it is tipped into contraction.”Recession fears grow as construction firms and retailers sufferBusiness confidence about the next 12 months in the service sector dropped in August to its lowest point since July 2016, the month after the\u0026nbspreferendum on membership of the European Union\u0026nbsp(EU).Similar surveys earlier this week showed the UK’s manufacturing sector was suffering its worst downturn for seven years and the construction industry had shrunk for the fourth month in a row.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe combined PMIs for services, manufacturing and construction give a reading of 49.7 for August,\u0026nbspdown from 50.3 in July and indicate a decline across the overall private sector.\u0026nbsp“Such weak\u0026nbspPMIs\u0026nbsphave never been seen before in over 20 years of history in the absence of either recent or imminent Bank of England stimulus,” said Mr Williamson.Taken together with the all-sector PMIs for July and June, the readings suggest a\u0026nbsp0.1 per cent\u0026nbspcontraction in GDP over the last three months.Britain’s economy shrank 0.2 per cent in the second quarter of 2019, so a contraction in the third quarter would mean the country is in recession.The PMIs are closely watched by the Bank of England as early indicators of moves in the wider economy, but some analysts say the surveys tend to overstate the extent of upturns and downturns.Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist\u0026nbspat\u0026nbspPantheon Macroeconomics, said the chances of a second consecutive drop in GBP were “remote”. He added: “The PMIs are excessively influenced by business sentiment and have given a misleadingly weak steer during the past 12 months of heightened political uncertainty.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Also, six more launches of 60 satellites needed for minor coverage, 12 for moderate.A minimum of 1,000 Starlink satellites will be needed for the space-based internet to be economically viable, he added.Shortly after the launch of the first 60 satellites, star gazers in the Netherlands reported seeing UFOs passing across the night sky.\u0026nbspLangbroek captured the spectacle shortly after SpaceX\u0027s Starlink launch (Marco Langbroek)The ESA\u0026nbsprevealed that it performed 28 collision avoidance manoeuvres in 2018, though noted the vast majority were the result of dead satellites or fragments from previous collisions.Avoidance manoeuvres are very rare between active satellites but the space agency warned that such incidents will become more common with the arrival of\u0026nbspmega constellations such as those sent by SpaceX.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Sterling has tumbled almost 19 per cent since the EU referendum in June 2016.The government’s defeat by a margin of 328 to 301 on Tuesday leaves Mr Johnson’s Brexit strategy in tatters by potentially robbing him of the threat of no-deal, which he has repeatedly said is essential to obtain concessions from the EU.Responding from the despatch box immediately after the result, the prime minister said he would table a bill to trigger a general election, with a vote expected to take place soon after the anti-no deal bill completes its passage through the Commons on Wednesday.But Mr Johnson’s plans seemed doomed to failure after Labour said it would not back his election motion, which requires a two-thirds majority and is therefore dependent on opposition support to pass through the Commons, until the legislation to stop no-deal is passed.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Mobility made it possible for animals to make an unmistakable footprint on Earth, both literally and metaphorically,” said lead researcher Shuhai Xiao, a professor of geosciences with the Virginia Tech College of Science.The animal that made the latest prints would have looked like a millipede and was around a quarter of an inch wide and four inches long. It would have dragged its body across a muddy ocean floor and rested along the way, leaving a trail that is 23 inches long.\u0026nbspIt would have been made up of 50 or more\u0026nbspbody segments, a back and belly, and head and tail, researchers say.Tiny 4.2m-year-old monkey discovery casts new light on evolutionChimpanzees caught fishing for crabsGlobal CO2 levels rise to highest point since evolution of humansThe find also marks what could be the\u0026nbspfirst\u0026nbspexample of decision-making among animals. The trail suggests an effort to move towards or away from something, which indicates the animal could have had a sophisticated central nervous\u0026nbspsystem.\u0026nbsp“Animals and particularly humans are movers and shakers on Earth. Their ability to shape the face of the planet is ultimately tied to the origin of animal motility,” said Professor Xiao.\u0026nbsp“We are the most impactful animal on Earth.

She landed on her neck and the extent of her injuries saw production on the film shut down for eight weeks.It\u0027s been rumoured for decades that Ed Harris punched James Cameron in the face while filming the watery 1989 drama The Abyss, but here\u0027s reportedly why: Cameron failed to tell Harris that his oxygen tank would run out before cameras stopped rolling on a particular scene, leaving the actor gasping for air. At the time of filming Apocalypse Now in 1979, Martin Sheen was drinking heavily and using drugs - so much so that, unbeknownst to the crew or his director Francis Ford Coppola, he had a heart attack in the middle of the jungle. Sheen was forced to crawl for approximately half a mile before finding somebody who could treat him.Jackie Chan is famous for many things and performing his own stunts is one of them. This has left him with his fair share of injuries in the past, some of which came on the set of 1986 action comedy Armour of God. The actor, attempting to slide down a tree, fractured his skull after falling 25 feet and hitting his head on a rock. Chan was immediately rushed into surgery and, to this day, he has a hole in his skull that he covers with a plastic plug.Michael J Fox famously came close to dying on the set of Back to the Future Part III in 1990. It was during a scene in which his character, Marty McFly, is hanged by the neck - something the crew permitted Fox to act out himself on the condition that he knew exactly where to place his hand when the noose was around his neck. Fox miscalculated, choking himself before passing out and was cut down after someone realised the actor was close to death.637 The kids in The Brady BunchWhile filming a 1973 episode of The Brady Bunch titled The Cincinnati Kids, the child stars of the hit TV show reportedly almost got caught up in a horrendous incident. As they were about to shoot a scene riding a rollercoaster - fit with a camera mounted to the front of the carriage - Mike Brady actor Robert Reed insisted crew carry out a test run. It\u0027s a good job he did - when the rollercoaster was in motion, the camera came loose and flew into the position the kids\u0027 heads would been had they been on board.Breaking Bad star Aaron Paul cheated death while filming the first season of Breaking Bad in 2008. Having asked for permission to move positions for a scene, the actor was left shaken after a boulder fell off the roof of a nearby RV directly onto the spot where he had just been standing. Halle Berry was filming a fight scene on the set of 2013 thriller The Call when she whacked her head on the concrete floor and knocked herself clean out. Fortunately, she had a speedy recovery.After suffering a minor cut to his leg on the set of 2000 drama Cast Away, Tom Hanks ended up contracting a potentially deadly staph infection and found himself hospitalised for three days. If untreated, the infection can prove fatal.Gerard Butler had a close call while filming 2012 film Chasing Mavericks at a Northern California surfing spot renowned for its dangerous waters. The actor was knocked off his paddle by a powerful wave and submerged underwater until someone eventually came to his aid.  Doctor Who legend Elisabeth Sladen had a near-miss while filming the original series\u0027 four-part serial Revenge of the Cybermen, which aired in 1975. After driving a boat into a whirlpool, she was forced to e into the water after the boat lost control. Stuntman Terry Walsh came to her rescue.In the words of Tom Cruise\u0027s Edge of Tomorrow co-star Emily Blunt, speaking on US chat show Conan, about a car chase scene the duo filmed in 2014: “I hear Tom under his breath as I approach the right-hand turn, going \u0027Brake, brake, brake. Oh God. Brake, brake, brake. Brake it hard.\u0027 I left it too late, and drove us into a tree. I almost killed Tom Cruise.”British actor John Hurt was under so much prosthetic playing Joseph Merick in David Lynch\u0027s 1980 historical drama The Elephant Man that he almost suffocated. He was told to remain upright while wearing the makeup and would continually forget, almost losing his life in the process.British action hero Jason Statham escaped death on the set of 2014 action sequel The Expendables 3 after the brakes on a truck he was driving stopped working. He had no choice but to jump from the moving three-tonne vehicle seconds before it went into the Black Sea.Daniel Day-Lewis went into full method actor mode for his role as Buffalo Bill in Martin Scorsese\u0027s 2002 period drama Gangs of New York - so much so that he contracted pneumonia after refusing to wear clothes that didn\u0027t exist in the 19th century. In fact, he was so dedicated to the role that he reportedly refused medicine that didn\u0027t exist at the time of his character, but acquiesced when he was told by medics he could die if he didn\u0027t. Bob Denver, who played the titular Gilligan on 1960s TV series Gilligan’s Island, found himself in mortal danger after getting trapped inside a hut with a lion that pounced on him. In a lucky twist of fate, his mauling was prevented when the bed the lion was perched on broke, distracting the creature and leaving enough time for the lion\u0027s trainer to tackle it to the ground.Kristen Chenoweth was cast in legal TV drama The Good Wife for its fourth season in 2013, but on her first day on set, a light fixture fell and hit her in the face. She was rushed to hospital having had her skull fractured, nose broken and teeth cracked, not to mention injuries to her spine and ribs. Chenoweth decided not to return to the show save for a cameo appearance in a later episode.Lorenza Izzo almost drowned while filming an escape attempt scene on the set of Eli Roth\u0027s 2013 horror film The Green Inferno. She was pushed downstream and the film\u0027s crew didn\u0027t realise her screams for help were real until it was almost too late. Roth reportedly used some of this footage in the finished film.Oscar-winning star Jennifer Lawrence was required to run through a tunnel on the set of 2012 young-adult novel adaptation The Hunger Games. However, a malfunction with a fog machine saw the enclosed area fill with so much smoke that Lawrence had to escape and came dangerously close to suffocating.Performing his own stunts as usual, Tom Cruise found himself in trouble on the set of 2003 film The Last Samurai when a mechanical horse he was required to jump on malfunctioned, leaving a blade held by his co-star Hiroyuki Sanada inches away from his neck. Johnny Depp was thrown from a horse on the set of Disney adventure The Lone Ranger (2013) and saw his life flash before his eyes after it proceeded to trample on him. Fortunately, it left him with mere bruises.While filming the last ever episode of Lost in 2010, Matthew Fox - who played Jack Shephard - was almost stabbed by a knife after a retractable one was replaced by a real one. The plan was to use the real knife for a fight sequence, right up until the moment of penetration as a collapsible one looked too fake. Somehow, the knives weren\u0027t swapped and Fox was saved by protective padding he\u0027d put on at the very last minute.Dylan O\u0027Brien nearly met his maker on the set of Maze Runner: The Death Cure. During a stunt that required him to jump from the top of one car to another, the actor was dragged under the vehicle and suffered lacerations and fractures to his cheekbones and orbital sockets. His injuries were so serious that the film was delayed for an entire year and was eventually released in 2018.Brendan Fraser nearly died on the set of The Mummy in 1999 due to an incident that saw a hanging scene go terribly wrong. According to his co-star Rachel Weisz, the actor stopped breathing and was in need of resuscitation as a result.Isla Fisher got stuck in a water thank for a scene in the 2013 heist thriller Now You See Me, with fellow cast members believing her screams to be the actions of her character. Luckily, she was pulled out - after a terrifying three minutes.Jim Caviezel had a tough time of it on the set of Mel Gibson\u0027s controversial 2004 film The Passion of the Christ. Due to the intense filming conditions, he suffered from pneumonia, hypothermia and a lung infection - and even survived getting struck by lightning while filming the Sermon on the Mount scene. I was lit up like a Christmas tree, said Caviezel, who also dislocated his shoulder on set.As well as suffering a nasty injury on the set of Kill Bil Vol 2 due to a car malfunctioning, Uma Thurman had a near miss in a separate incident - also involving a car - while filming 2010 fantasy film Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief. After a crew member forgot to apply the brakes to an unmanned van, the vehicle started rolling towards Thurman, who was completely unaware.

He confirmed that Labour would back an early election under any circumstances if Boris Johnson were to call one.\u0026nbspWithin hours, the sounds of gears being thrown into reverse could be heard in Westminster. Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, a lawyer who understands small print, realised there was a danger of the Labour Party walking into a trap designed by the prime minister.\u0026nbspThen after Tuesday night’s vote, when Johnson indicated he would call for an early election, Corbyn told him: “Get the bill through first in order to take no-deal off the table.”The Labour leader knows that a vote of parliament for an early election under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act leaves the date of the election under the control of the prime minister.\u0026nbspIf the Commons votes for Hilary Benn’s bill to block a no-deal Brexit on Wednesday night, Johnson is set to ask MPs to vote for an early election immediately afterwards. He will say that he intends to hold the election on 15 October, but the Act merely requires MPs to vote, by a two-thirds majority, for a motion saying: “That there shall be an early parliamentary general election.”If they vote for it, it is then up to the prime minister to advise the Queen on the date of the election. It would be extraordinary for Johnson to go back on his word in parliament, but there would be nothing to stop him naming a different date. He could, for example, ask Her Majesty to issue a proclamation for an election on 7 November.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Protesters take to streets after Boris Johnson suspends Parliament  Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Anti Brexit protesters march on WhitehallMany of the protesters carried placardsThe protesters also marched to Trafalgar Square, where they blocked trafficJohn McDonnell addressed crowds in Whitehall.A small group of Brexit supporters attempted to stage a counter protest in central London.Three people were arrested in London, including a woman who sat on the road near Trafalgar Square.In Oxford, locals and students gathered outside Balliol College, Boris Johnson\u0027s alma mater, to protest.Thousands of people gather in central Glasgow to protest against the prime minister.Jeremy Corbyn spoke to protesters in central Glasgow.Anti Brexit protesters march on WhitehallMany of the protesters carried placardsThe protesters also marched to Trafalgar Square, where they blocked trafficJohn McDonnell addressed crowds in Whitehall.A small group of Brexit supporters attempted to stage a counter protest in central London.Three people were arrested in London, including a woman who sat on the road near Trafalgar Square.In Oxford, locals and students gathered outside Balliol College, Boris Johnson\u0027s alma mater, to protest.Thousands of people gather in central Glasgow to protest against the prime minister.Jeremy Corbyn spoke to protesters in central Glasgow.That would mean there would be no parliament sitting on Brexit day, 31 October, which would mean that the UK would leave the EU without a deal by automatic operation of EU law.\u0026nbspSo Labour MPs have been lobbying their leader to refuse to support the prime minister’s motion for an early election, and different Labour spokespeople have been saying different things about the party’s position.\u0026nbspTwo Labour MPs, Phil Wilson and Peter Kyle, have written for The Independent explaining why they are opposed to an early election: they say that Brexit must be decided first.\u0026nbspJeremy Corbyn hoping to block no-deal Brexit and trigger electionHow Jeremy Corbyn handles this week will be his legacySharon Osbourne lashes out at Jeremy Corbyn in violent, scathing rantJohnson is pushing anti-Brexit liberals into the embrace of CorbynBut I understand that Corbyn’s close advisers argued that Labour cannot afford to be seen as shying away from an election.

He gave two reasons: one was the danger of the election date being set after 31 October the other was that Labour would lose, making a no-deal Brexit more likely.\u0026nbspIf the shadow cabinet did urge Labour MPs to vote against an early election on Wednesday night, Johnson would not have a two-thirds majority. He may then try to pass an act amending the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, setting the 15 October date in law, which would need a simple majority to pass.\u0026nbspIf Labour MPs still refuse\u0026nbspto vote for it, they will be accused of being afraid of losing, because there would certainly be time to stop a no-deal Brexit after the election – if Corbyn won it. And the government might even win the vote with the help of the Scottish National Party, which thinks it can win back a lot of the seats it lost two years ago.\u0026nbspMuch more high politics ahead.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Analysts said there was little prospect of the industry recovering in the last quarter of 2019 and September’s data was likely to be even bleaker.The UK’s manufacturing output slumped to a seven-year low last month as the sector shrank at the fastest rate since 2012, the industry’s PMI showed on Monday.Economists will be closely watching Wednesday’s data for the services sector, which accounts for about 80 per cent of UK output and posted unexpected growth in July, for an indication as to the health of the wider British economy.A poor performance\u0026nbspfor August\u0026nbspwould raise serious questions about Britain’s ability to bounce back from an overall economic contraction in the second quarter of this year. A second contraction in the current quarter would signal a recession.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Set building begins on Waterloo Place in Edinburgh ahead of filming for Fast and Furious 9Members of the Royal Southern Yacht Club and the Island Sailing Club take part during the annual cricket match between the clubs, which takes place on the Bramble Bank sandbank in the middle of the Solent at low tideAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate at Whitehall in LondonOne of the iconic \u0027Girl with Balloon\u0027 artworks by anonymous street artist Banksy is carried near one of the original locations the artwork appeared at on the Southbank in LondonThe sun rises over the sculpture The Couple by artist Sean Henry, at Newbiggin-by-the-sea in NorthumberlandA person wearing a Boris Johnson \u0027head\u0027 digs a grave at the foot of a tombstone during a protest organised by Avaaz and Best for Britain, outside Downing Street in LondonNat Lofthouse statue is covered in flags at the University of Bolton Stadium, BoltonPerformers take part in Notting Hill Carnival.

A figure below 50 represents contraction.Duncan Brock, group director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement \u0026amp\u0026nbspSupply, said: “The sector fell deeper into contraction as continuing uncertainty and a weakened UK economy took a sizeable bite out of this month’s construction activity.“Inevitably business confidence followed suit, dropping like a brick to its worst since December 2008 and close to the lowest depth seen in the previous recession.Pound tumbles as election speculation mounts“As Brexit creeps closer and confusion still reigns, this will undoubtedly heap more pressure on the UK government to create much-needed clarity in the market.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Total sales were flat, despite the summer’s BBQ-friendly\u0026nbspweather providing a small boost to food purchases, according to the British Retail Consortium-KPMG sales monitor.“August proved to be yet another incredibly disappointing month for retail,” said Paul Martin, KPMG’s UK head of retail. “With a budgetary spending review, the Brexit crunch point looming and potentially a general election on the cards, it’s clear that the only thing that is certain in the coming months is further uncertainty.”The British Retail Consortium warned the UK high street was likely to suffer further store closures and job losses and called on the chancellor\u0026nbspto “fix the broken business-rates system”,\u0026nbspwhich firms have warned stacks\u0026nbspthe odds in\u0026nbspfavour of\u0026nbsponline shopping companies.Signs of a wilting economy also raise the stakes for Boris Johnson, who is preparing to face off against MPs seeking to block a no-deal Brexit this week and has indicated he could call a snap election.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

A reading below 50 indicates contraction, while higher than 50 shows growth.Duncan Brock, group director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply, said the sector had “clung on by its fingertips this month” as overseas clients “abandoned spending in favour of a wait-and-see approach and the political environment became increasingly murky”.He added: “There’s only so much companies can do to absorb costs before UK consumers notice the impact to their wallets, and only so much Brexit indecision the sector can take before it is tipped into contraction.”Recession fears grow as construction firms and retailers sufferBusiness confidence about the next 12 months in the service sector dropped in August to its lowest point since July 2016, the month after the\u0026nbspreferendum on membership of the European Union\u0026nbsp(EU).Similar surveys earlier this week showed the UK’s manufacturing sector was suffering its worst downturn for seven years and the construction industry had shrunk for the fourth month in a row.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He added: “The PMIs are excessively influenced by business sentiment and have given a misleadingly weak steer during the past 12 months of heightened political uncertainty.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Hubert Minnis, the prime minister, urged Bahamians to show love to come through the ordeal suffered by their country, while aerial video recorded over the Bahamas’ Great Abaco Island showed mile upon mile of flooded neighbourhoods and smashed buildings.In the US, meanwhile, authorities in Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas were on high alert, as they watched for indications the storm may make landfall in their states.\u0026nbspEarly on Tuesday, Dorian was downgraded by a single notch to a category 2 storm, with sustained maximum winds of 125mph. At the same time, the size the hurricane covered increased, as did the speed at which it was moving.“The headline for this #Dorian advisory is NOT that the wind speed has slightly decreased,” the National Hurricane Centre said of an update\u0026nbspit issued on Twitter. “The combined wind, surge, and floods hazards are the same or even worse since the hurricane has become larger.”Created with Sketch.Huge damage as record Hurricane Dorian hits Bahamas: In pictures Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A road is flooded during the passing of Hurricane Dorian in Freeport, Grand Bahama.Hurricane Dorian\u0027s eye taken by Nasa astronaut Nick Hague, from aboard the International Space Station.

A total of nine counties issued mandatory evacuation orders, including\u0026nbspDuval County, which includes Jacksonville, one of Florida’s two biggest cities, and some areas in Palm Beach County, home to President Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort.The governors of Georgia and South Carolina also ordered evacuations of some coastal counties. Forecasts suggested the storm will move northwards, hugging the coast of Georgia and potentially making landfall in either North or South Carolina by the end of Thursday. Late on Tuesday, North Carolina governor Roy Cooper also announced evacuations for his coastal residents, while recognising the inconvenience. “When you weigh the cost of losing lives, this is something you need to do,” he told CNN.He added: “These impacts, including flooding, structural damage, storm surge and serious beach erosion in our coastal communities cannot be understated.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The decision must be for the common sense of the British people.”That decision was duly taken in the biggest single-issue democratic vote in British history.Hammond has been fighting ever since to turn it on its head.This is the real constitutional outrage. A defeated rump of Remainers, egged on by blatantly biased Commons Speaker John Bercow, is using every Parliamentary trick to destroy Brexit.Some threaten to occupy Parliament until dragged out by police.Left-wing class warriors will infuriate voters by blocking bridges and highways and stopping them getting to work.John Major and meddling Gina Miller have launched a Supreme Court bid to block No Deal.These are petulant tantrums. And they will fail.There is no chance Brussels will budge on the backstop, says chief negotiator Michel Barnier. In which case we simply drt across the October  deadline and out of the EU forever.There will be an election and Boris Johnson will win.The Tories already lead Labour by - per cent in the polls. Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party commands  per cent.Once Britain leaves on October , Nigel will fold.“The Brexit Party would be happy to make Boris a hero,” he says. In , Farage deserves a peerage.Added together, his votes would give Boris an -seat majority. In the actual campaign, with a vote-winning Budget and Boris in fully fired-up election mode, that could turn into a landslide.At which point, we can wave good riddance to John Major, Ken Clarke, Michael Heseltine, Anna Soubry, Dom Grieve and Uncle Phil Hammond and all.And get on with the job of repairing the wreckage they leave behind.The question nobody has asked is why Chancellor Sajid Javid appointed her as his media adviser in the first place.“Special advisers are a minister’s Praetorian Guard,” says one Cabinet figure. “They must be completely loyal.

The message is clear: Useful work is no longer done here.If Remainer MPs block Boris Johnson’s Brexit plan this week, we should place similar signs around the Palace of Westminster.Parliamentarians will have turned the place into a toxic waste ground which no longer fulfils a decent .It will have become an eyesore, a municipal liability, an assembly which no longer represents its voters and has become a poisonous threat to them. It will stand as sad testament to the misjudgement of its management in latter days.If Speaker John Bercow, former Chancellor Philip Hammond and other dead-set Remainers such as Sir Keir Starmer refuse to enact the  referendum result, the British Parliament — supposedly the fount of modern parliamentary democracy — will have lost its centuries-old claim to give voice to the people. The consequences of that would be enormous.The word “Parliament”, first used in these islands in the early s, comes from the French “parler” .The th Century Parliament was where leading men of England could let the king know how they felt about his laws and taxes. Kings did not always take much notice but the principle was established: That the people of England would be heard by their ruler.Over the ages, the people slowly became the boss. Until now.Sometimes you will hear the Commons derided as a talking-shop but that, correctly, is what it is. Talking can prevent violence.There is a reason modern heads of government are not, by and large, stabbed in their beds like poor King Duncan in Shakespeare’s Macbeth.That reason has been the parliamentary process and the comforting knowledge that when push came to shove, parliamentarians would be on our side.Our side, please note. Not on the side of rival countries.There developed a quiet understanding that on issues of conscience , MPs need not slavishly follow their constituents. They were not quite delegates.But as representatives, they would be expected to follow broadly the sympathies of their electors and the policies of their parties. Otherwise they could just lie at election time then do the opposite once they had won their seats in the Commons.In his address outside  Downing Street last night, Boris left people in no doubt of his intentions to see us out of the EU after October .But when MPsto the Commons this afternoon, you will hear Remainers complain that “Parliament has been bypassed” in the Brexit process. This is tommyrot.As can happen in modern politics, it is the very opposite of the truth. I’m afraid they’re lying. They are ignoring you — the electorate — and they think you are too busyto notice.The EU referendum in  was set up by the Commons.The Commons approved the Article  process under which we told Brussels we were off. All well and good.David Cameron would not have won the  election had he not promised a referendum.Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn would not have attracted millions of votes in the  election had they not promised to respect the Leave result.But now that our departure is imminent, Remainer extremists such as Hammond, Bercow, Gauke, Grieve, Soubryplan to try to stop it.They have already bent the rules doing so and will possibly do so again today.Please, guys: Spare us any bleating about “constitutional outrages” by Boris. Your behaviour has been far worse.These swivel-eyed Europhiles have decided that the Leave vote of  — the biggest exercise in British electoral history — must be neutralised.The plebs got it wrong. Computer does not recognise. Reboot time. All past data has been lost.Just look at that warped figure Tony Blair, who treated Parliament with open contempt when he was PM.Yesterday he was throwing up his soft hands in horror at the idea of a new General Election to break the Westminster deadlock. He opposes an election because he knows it could result in a big win for an on-fire Boris. All this from the same Tony Blair whose regime helped kill hundreds of thousands of Iraqis in the name of, er, democracy.Instead, Blair wants a second referendum, whose wording would be decidedby the current, pro-EU, electorate-defying Parliament.We used to laugh at communist assemblies in countries such as North Korea, which were stuffed full of identikit dummies.We mocked minnows such as Ireland, which were forced by Brussels to re-run referendums that produced “wrong” results.We thought our democracy was more authentic because Parliament was connected to its constituents and because our politicians accepted the electorate’s verdict.We won’t be able to make such boastsWestminster’s Remainers have their way.What is the point of a parliamentit ignores the electorate  None. Many of these Remainer MPs seem readier to take their cue from Twitter users than from their own voters.

Drinking beers round the pool, the group joked about at their hotel before descending down to the strip for a few nights of carnage.It was the final day when it all went wrong, says David, now . I had a premonition that night that something was going happen.They headed down to a busy bar where after knocking back the beers, one of his pals was knocked back by a barman walking past. A brawl erupted and David says the bouncer was bottled in the eye by his mate, who angrily kicked out at him instead.All I wanted to do was get up off the floor, but every time I did I got about  kicks in the face, he says.I thoughtI keep trying Im going to die. Id done nothing to him hed kicked the wrong guy.David was hauled to court, and after two days was charged with grievous bodily harm.Worse still, while the rest of his group had escaped arrest and flown back to the UK, he found himself living for months awaiting trial in Mallorcas Palma jail, which was stuffed with the doorman’s angry mates.Locked into the prison’s barbers one day, he was sucker-punched by a raging lag.“I feared for my le,” he says. “You have these little punch ups and think this its how its going to be. Im never going to snitch.“I shared cells with murderers. One Spanish guy had chopped his brother up and put him in a freezer. Im watching telly and hes on it, and Im in a cell with the guy.”Le took a darker turn still when one day, visiting his mate in a cell, David found him swinging from the ceiling and blue-faced, having hanged himself to death.The tragedy and thought of missing his son growing up was taking its toll on David, but after six months he received a glimmer of hope.“My friend confessed to my dad, broke down in tears and said ‘I was the one who did it, not Dave’,” he says. The pal then flew out to Spain to be picked out in a fresh line-up by the bouncer.But the nightmare was just beginning as the doorman pointed at David. Threatened with paying £, in damages or spending  years in prison, he says the bouncer was fearful of changing his story and even drove his pal out of the country by threatening his le.“I can see why he fled, but I was left in the sh*t. I spoke to him on the phone and saidI get the main court, will you say it was you  He said ‘Im never coming back’.”David’s le was thrown into crisis. He lost his job while his dad was forced to take out a bank loan and “sell pretty much everything he’d got” to fork up the £, so his son could take a shorter sentence.“Youre pushed into saying that youre guilty,” he says. “They pushed me because youre offered more yearsyou dont.”Having raised the money, he pushed to serve the rest of his sentence in England. He spent two months in a Madrid jail before transferred to Wandsworth and Peterborough prison - finally let out after a gruelling three years.His pal eventually paid his father back £,, but the scars may never heal.He says: “Ive got a message for the doorman: you got the wrong guy and totally ruined my le. I dont knowI could ever forgive you.” David’s ordeal isn’t the only drinking disaster in the episode – as Nick Bass gets into trouble for too much clowning around.After a hundred-shot beer challenge, the Sheffield lad found himself cuffed Down Under when he ran riot through a circus, trying to ride an elephant and stealing a £, clown costume.Meanwhile, when Kai Sing, , from Warwick overstayed his visa in China, he feared an impromptu drug test would see him locked up for le.Slammed in a bedless cell and threatened by shank-weilding inmates, his incarceration was instead a rare insight into the country’s bizarre propaganda and ingenious ways of fooling the British embassy.Earlier this year, we revealed how Magaluf ‘mafia’ gangs are targeting ‘up to  drunk tourists a night’ with ‘bearhug’ robberies in a fresh crime wave.Young, Dumb and Banged Up in the Sun airs on Star at pmOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Suddenly, the all-encompassing full-time job into which you poured all your time and effort becomes harder to juggle with what’s going on at home.Ruth Davidson is the case in point, after tendering her resignation as leader of the Scottish Conservatives because, among other reasons, the thought of getting on the road to fight two elections in  months would have once fired her up but now fills her with dread.Ruth, who will remain as an MSP, adds: “Additionally, I fear that having tried to be a good leader over the years, I have proved a poor daughter, sister, partner and friend. The party and my work has always come first, often at the expense of commitment to loved ones. The arrival of my son means I now make a dferent choice.”It was a similar story when former sports minister Tracey Crouch revealed she recently turned down the chance toto Government because of her three-year-old son Freddie.She’s still an MP but says: “I may or may not ever get the chance again to join the Cabinet, but I definitely won’t get this time back with Freddie.”And therein lies the rub for any Government, or indeed corporation, trying to inflate the number of women appointed to jobs that pay extremely well and, consequently, often involve great responsibility and super-human levels of commitment.As I have frequently suggested in this column over the years, the paucity of women in the Cabinet and certain boardrooms isn’t necessarily down to sexism, it might also be because women have chosen not to be there.We have the wombs, therefore we have the babies. That’s unlikely to change any time soon.Some manage — with the help of nannies or wider family — to juggle a high-powered job with motherhood, somechoose the route of flexible working and somechoose to stay at home.

If I have to do that - and its not a decision I would want to take - I would ensure, as I have done previously and I will continue to make sure I do, is balance.

While no one is perfect, we all have a responsibility for our own inidual impact.The question is what we do to balance it out.Prince Harry, who had flown to Amsterdam on a commercial flight yesterday, encouraged people to be more conscious about their travel as he launched his initiative Travalyst, which he has been working on for three years.Harry admitted I am not a tourism or business expert, but added: Sometimes the scale of the conservation crisis feels overwhelming and that inidual actions cant make a dference.Ive certainly felt that - but Ive learned that we cannot dismiss the idea of trying to do something, just because we cant do everything.A royal source previously admitted it has not been lost on him that the criticism he has faced over his own travel could overshadow the campaign - the first for the new Sussex Foundation.Yesterday Piers Morgan blasted the prince preaching about eco-tourism - despite jetsetting on private planes over the summer.Figures released last year showed the royal households carbon emission from travelling for business almost doubled last year.Buckingham Palace declined to comment, but the Daily Mail reports an aide said Harry had used a figure of speech when he cited the  per cent figure.They added some unknown private travel would have been taken commercially.Harry and we Meghan Markle, , had been snapped in the South of France last month after enjoying a break at Sir Elton Johns palatial £million pad.The Duke and Duchess of Sussex flew on a -seater Cessna plane, which would have cost more than £, to hire, that generates seven times the emissions per person when compared to a commercial flight.And earlier in August, the couple flew to Ibiza to celebrate Meghans th birthday in style with a six-day trip.Prince Harry also headed to a super secret Google Camp event in Sicily on July , giving an impassioned barefoot speech about climate change to celebs believed to include Leonardo DiCaprio, Naomi Campbell, Stella McCartney and Harry Styles.The new dad was previously defended by high profile celebs including Elton John - who revealed he had paid for the couples trip to France and made the flight carbon neutral.Prince Harry said yesterday: Ive always offset my CO, I think part of the group discussion we had earlier was, What is offsetting CO  There are so many people out there that hear about it, dont know about it. In my mind its the right thing to do and we need to make it cool, but it cant just be a ticking-the-box exercise.Somehow we have to connect people to where that little bit of extra money is actually going and, the moment you have that connection, you feel you have a bigger purpose in le, and you can actually see the dference youre making, and I think thats acceptable.It comes after Meghan Markle hired a crisis management firm that once represented Harvey Weinstein in a bid to improve her image.She has hired Sunshine Sachs — a firm whose clients included the late pop star Michael Jackson, who has been accused of paedophilia.In a massive break with royal tradition, the Duchess went behind the backs of Buckingham Palace advisers to hire the company, known for using the so-called “dark arts” of public relations to improve the celebs’ reputations."},{"url":null,"title":"woman smuggle baby usa philippines","story":"Jenner Talbot, , from Ohio, had checked in for a flight to the US when airport officers in Manila discovered the undocumented baby inside an oversized belt bag around her waist.She tried to get through Ninoy Aquino International Airport security and immigration checks but police pounced as she sat in the departure area this morning.Talbot is now being questioned by police while they check the identity of the infant and how she came to have him.Bureau of Immigration deputy spokesperson Melvin Mabulac said the baby boy, believed to be a six-day-old Filipino, does not have proper documents or a plane ticket.He said that staff from Delta Airlines alerted airport police when Talbot had checked in.Talbot was held by the Bureau of Immigration and later turned over to the National Bureau of Investigation for questioning.The undocumented baby was taken to the Department of Social Welfare and Development while investigations are on-going.Immigration chief Melvin Mabulac said: American citizen was supposed to leave the country for the United States when airport officers at Naia Terminal  discovered the undocumented infant in her bag around : a.m.Mr Mabulac said the baby was hidden in an oversized belt bag and was not declared nor presented to the immigration inspector during departure formalities.Mr Mabulac said they could not confirmTalbot is the mother orof the baby since authorities did not find any travel document to indicate the infant’s information.He added: The suspect was not able to provide any documents showing she had the authority to take the baby onboard the plane.The baby was in good health and medics are now carrying out checks to confirm the nationality and exact age.Talbot has been detained for questioning.Mr Mabulac added: We cannot identy the child because there is no travel document so other departments will investigate this.

I think the fact that you have at the heart of Number , as the Prime Minister’s senior adviser, an unelected, foul-mouthed oaf throwing his weight around is completely unacceptable”.Former Scots Tory leader Ruth Davidson tweeted: “How, in the name of all that is good and holy, is there no longer room in the Conservative Party for @NSoames ”Members of the Young Conservatives also protested the decision outside the Tories’ Westminster HQ yesterday evening.In yesterday’s charged No Deal Commons debate, the Tory rebels sacked from the party on Tuesday night launched a passionate defence of their actions.Ex-Chancellor Philip Hammond said he would rather “boil my head” than hand power to Jeremy Corbyn – and insisted it was the PM who was heightening the risk of a Labour government.An emotional Sir Nicholas Soames, Winston Churchill’s grandson, claimed it was Boris Johnson and other Brexiteers “serial disloyalty” under Theresa May that proved the rebels’ inspiration.He said: “I have always believed that the referendum result must be honoured and indeed I voted for the Withdrawal Agreement on every occasion, which is more than can be said for the Prime Minister, the Leader of the House and several members of the Cabinet, whose serial disloyalty has been such an inspiration to so many of us.”And Sir Alistair Burt, Theresa May’s former Foreign Minister, warned other Tories they could be next to be “purged” by Downing Street.He earned applause from opposition benches as he defended his rebellion on Tuesday and said: “I leave here looking at the sky, rather than down at my shoes”.Earlier Labour’s Hilary Benn insisted his bill to block No Deal was nothing more than an attempt to prevent a “crash out” Brexit – and buy Britain more time to negotiate a deal.Speaking in the House, he said: “If someone says you can jump off a clf in a couple of weeks’ time or we could put it off a few months the sensible course of action is to put it off.“I accept we need to find a way forward, but that is not the purpose of that today.”But Tory MPs lined up to demand he be “honest” with the public about his intentions.Conservative backbencher Steve Double stormed: “Can we be clear – this Bill does not stop No Deal, it simply prolongs how long we take to leave.“If you want to stop Brexit, revoke Article  and be honest with the country.”And Labour ‘leaver’ Caroline Flint – the MP for Don Valley - said her Europhile Labour colleagues bore as much blame for the “crisis” in the country as arch Tory Brexiteers.Referring the  Referendum vote, Ms Flint said: “A decision we delegated to the British people has been dominated by a lack of compromise.“Hardline Leavers and hardline Remainers have turned this into a crisis and are eroding the trust of the British people.”Former Attorney General Jeremy Wright also hit back at his former colleagues – insisting that while Vote Leave hadn’t campaigned for a No Deal in the Referendum, “neither was it put to the electorate that we would only leavethere was a deal with the EU”.He added: “The truth is that Parliament set out the rules for the referendum in the referendum act and we stressed it was the public’s decision to make.“I’m afraid on this fundamental point I cannot agree that we do not have a mandate for no deal.”"},{"url":null,"title":"corbyn dimwit liar and chicken brexit","story":"Every day he and his arrogant Marxist mob sneered “Bring it on!” Until the moment they were finally offered the chance to stand before the electorate.Corbyn and his greasy sidekick Keir Starmer have concocted wafer-thin excuses for this monstrous U-turn.  The public won’t buy them.Boris Johnson has reluctantly accepted that voters must now decide whether to go ahead with Brexit, deal or No Deal, on October .Or whether Labour and treacherous ex-Tories should be able to enforce an aimless further delay, condemning an exhausted public to more bitter ision and costly uncertainty.Labour isn’t as scared of No Deal as it is of a ballot-box reckoning.

Corbyn is chicken.Labour knows its Brexit “policy” — “we’ll negotiate a new deal, then campaign against it” — is comically ridiculous. It knows it is grievously wounded by its anti-Jewish racism, its ruinous economic policies, its fondness for tyrants and terrorists and its idolising of collapsed Latin American dictatorships.It fears Boris’s Brexit-backing Tories, no matter how weak they now appear.Corbyn was always an unpleasant dimwit and a liar.

They’re not all “champions”, or possibly even the best each respective part of the Cowell empire has to offer.That goose was cooked the moment SuBo, Diversity, Dennis Egeland almost everyone  with a signicant career or talent declined to appear.There was a certain curiosity value to BGT: The Champions, though, I’ll admit, as it featured several performers doing the one thing everyone in their country should arguably be forbidden from even attempting.Indian salsa, Ukrainian sand-painting, Australian stand-up comedy, Indonesian magic, British dog dancing.This last one was  winner Ashleigh Butlerwho began by revealing that, moments before Pudsey died: “He lted his head and had a little look at me.That was him saying ‘Goodbye’.” Or  him saying: “You’ll be going through the same motions, with some hyperactive little impostor, in two years’ time, mark my words.”I got the impression everyone  at the show thought it might just be “a bit too soon”, as well, which may not entirely explain The Champions’ in-built British bias.But the line-up was certainly front-loaded with other familiar faces, Paul Potts, Boogie Storm and Connie Talbot, who’s doubled in size since we last saw her, with Piers Morgan, in . So’s Piers Morgan, for that matter.The great unknown factors were the foreign acts, though, who proved to be a pretty forgettable bunch apart from America’s “comic daredevil” Bello Nock, whose wheel of death t***tery, with daughter Annaliese, was almost as terrying as his appearance,which was described perfectly, by David Walliams, as “Jedward’s dad”.It was certainly enough to hypnotise the Wembley arena audience into voting him the winner.If all this exotica and the set were designed to make us think we were watching something on the scale of Eurovision, though, it failed. The Champions is nothing like as good.Nor is it even as original as Going For Gold, with Henry Kelly, for the simple reason BGT has been welcoming foreign acts for years.All this adds up to is Britain’s Got Talent minus the best bit, the auditions. We also don’t get a chance to vote, either.That came down to a golden buzzer Amanda Holden went for the Ukrainian sandpainter and the arena vote for Bello Nock.Quite something, isn’t it, when we can’t even win such a heavily loaded show and, I have to tell you, Paul Potts took it pretty badly. Simon Cowell, though, had some words of comfort for Ashleigh.“Pusdey’s in dog heaven, looking down on you now, thinking . . . ” “I was the talent. I was the bloody talent.”DIVA Forever’s Gemma Collins landed in Los Angeles last Wednesday night on ITVBe with all the charm and subtlety of a jolt from the San Andreas Fault.Take comfort, though, from the fact our gain is very much Calornia’s loss.Because within five minutes of arriving she’d already decided, “I ain’t going back to England”, and was using her new catchphrase to describe everything.Hamburgers  “Next level.” Hollywood Hills mansions  “Next level.” The Beverly Wilshire hotel  It’s next friggin’ level. She seemed to have her priorities right, though.Before going anywhere near a green card applicationshe got pretend friend Jonathan Cheban to take her to cosmetic surgeon to the stars, Doctor Simon Ourian: “Because I want a facelt while I’m here.How long will I need ” How long have you got, Gemma  It’s next level.FINAL word on Celebs Go Dating belongs to ­brilliant narrator Rob Beckett.Lauren Goodger: “Everyone’s, like, ‘Did you find love, did you meet anyone ’And I’m, like, yeah I did.

And theof greatest ever breakfast television duo Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid to GMB.Cos I don’t mind telling you, I’ve really missed the hoary old cricket anecdotes, that unfeasibly small yet hyperactive mouth and all three of those le-insurance-risk chins. And Piers as well. IF this fth series of Peaky Blinders achieves nothing , then Irish actor Brian “Jimmy McCavern” Gleeson’s attempt at a Scottish accent has certainly highlighted the problems of frictionless borders.Back and forth it pings between Dublin and Belfast.With the odd stop-off in downtown Hyderabad, before settling at something closer to Hercule Poirot Belgian rather than the leader of a depression-era Glaswegian razor gang thug he’s meant to be.It has a knock-on effect as well. Notice one thing that’s wrong with the show, you’ll probably notice everything  as well.Like the fact it’s all over the place historically, Paul “Arthur” Anderson is over-acting so badly the estate of Yosemite Sam should sue and Helen McCrory doesn’t look foxy dressed up as Janet Jackson. She just looks ridiculous.Underneath all that baggage and the obtrusive soundtrack, there is, I think, a serviceable enough plot involving Oswald Mosley, the IRA, the UVF, even though they weren’t formed until , and all sorts of carnage involving gypsies and Glasgow’s infamous Billy Boys gang, which our friend Brian Gleeson attempted to put into sharp focus at the end of Sunday night’s episode.“Zo, Tummy ­Shell-beee, it’s wuuuurgh yur wunt, it’s wurgh you zjall ’ave.” No, me neither.THIS week’s winner is BBC Breakfast presenter Dan Walker and Beaker from The Muppets.Compiled by Graham WrayJONATHAN Ross, in , to producer Andy Davies, on the subject of his -year-old neighbour: “I think you should, just for charity, give her one.”Jonathan Ross, in August , to Judge Rinder, on the subject of Brazilian President Bolsonaro’s disparaging remarks about Emmanuel Macron’s we: “I’m team Macron.It’s the most pathetic and most misogynistic thing they could say.

Jeremy Corbyn ordered Labour MPs to abstain in tonightaposs historic vote on whether to hold a snap poll on Tuesday  October.The Prime Minister said the vote was essential to reset Brexit talks with the EU, after MPs punctured his threat to crash out with no deal. He taunted Mr Corbyn, claiming he was the first Labour opposition leader to refuse the chance of an election and vote confidence in a Tory PM. But furious Mr Corbyn - who was not present for the result - said backing an election tonight would have been like taking Snow Whiteaposs poison apple.    Instead he said Labour would back an election as soon as the Bill blocking no-deal Brexit was signed, sealed and delivered to the Queen. Under special rules the election needed  MPsto be approved, but just  voted for it.   MPs from a cross-section of opposition partiesvoted directly to block an election. That includes  from Labour,  out of  Lib Dems, all  MPs from the Independent Group,  Plaid Cymru and  Independents. More than half of all MPs, mostly from Labour, abstained in the vote. So they werenapost actively voting against an election, but they werenapost supporting Boris Johnsonaposs push either. Even though in this case, abstaining had exactly the same effect.

The Tory leader brought his signature chaotic style to the House of Commons duel with Labouraposs leader - hours after losing his majority. He branded the Labour leader Caracas over his backing for Venezuela in a recycled joke, and he swore in Parliament to distract from his own problems, branding Labouraposs policy s*** or bust. As you might expect, amid all the bluster and buffoonery there were some claims which, well, were flatly untrue. Here are  things the Prime Minister said that make us question his relationship with the truth.  Attacking Jeremy Corbyn, the PM declared: He wants a tax on homes and heaposs calling incessantly for a general strike. Weaposre not aware that the Labour leader has been calling for a general strike at all in recent months, let alone incessantly. Backbench Labour MP Lloyd Russell-Moyle did call for one last week in the Mirror, saying it looks more and more like the only way forward to stop our country falling into the hands of the undemocratic right. More signicantly, shadow cabinet office minister Laura Smith called for a general strike at an event in . But at the time of the comments, Shadow Business Secretary Rebecca Long Bailey insisted a general strike was not Labour party policy. Ms Long-Bailey said in September : Well thataposs not our position. Laura is an absolutely amazing MP, sheaposs one of the North West MPs with myself, sheaposs so full of energy and enthusiasm, but weaposre certainly not advocating general strikes as Labour Party policy.  Jeremy Corbyn told PMQs : At the weekend [ Michael Gove ] said food prices will go up under no deal. Mr Johnson swiped back: The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said absolutely no such thing, I can tell him. The preparations for no deal thanks to his good offices and thanks to his efforts are very far advanced. So what did Michael Gove say  He told the BBC: There are a number of economic factors in play. Some prices may go up. Other prices will come down.” Itaposs true that Mr Gove said may rather than will. But itaposs a bit rich to say Jeremy Corbynaposs account of his comments was absolutely untrue. . aposI donapost negotiate in publicapos  Jeremy Corbyn demanded to know details of the fruitless quest to abolish the Irish backstop clause of the Brexit deal. Boris Johnson replied: As [ Jeremy Corbyn ] knows very well, you donapost negotiate in public. Thataposs the same Boris Johnson who said earlier this week: Or that tomorrow MPs will vote - with Jeremy Corbyn - for yet another pointless delay. I don’t think they will. I hope that they won’t Butthey do they will plainly chop the legs out from under the UK position and make any further negotiation absolutely impossible And so I say, to show our friends in Brussels that we are united in our purpose, MPs should vote with the government against Corbyn’s pointless delay. He also said: I want everybody to know – there are no circumstances in which I will ask Brussels to delay. We are leaving on  October, no s or buts. Yep, definitely keeping his cards close to his chest on strategy there. . aposDelaying Brexit will cost £billion a monthapos  The Prime Minister said in a comment:[Jeremy Corbyn] would squander a billion pounds a month of taxpayersapos money on staying pointlessly in the EU this government is getting on with running a sound economy. But will delaying Brexit cost £billion a month  The Full Fact fact-checking website says this cost is only when compared to a no-deal Brexit in which the UK refuses to pay any orce bill. It also doesnapost include money the UK gets back out of the EU, Full Fact said. Donapost forget Boris Johnson is insisting heaposll get a Brexit deal, which could of course involve a continuing relationship with the EU. . aposI donapost want an election - or do I apos  Okay, so this final example seems to be one of Boris Johnson accidentally telling the truth. He told the SNPaposs Ian Blackford: I want to have an election... He then immediately corrected himself: Iaposm willing to have an election[Jeremy Corbynaposs] terrible Bill [to stop no-deal] goes through.

The budget for Discretionary Housing Payments will rise by a quarter in England and Wales next year - from £m this year to £m in  . The extra £m will be used to tackle affordability pressures suffered specically by private renters, todayaposs mini spending review confirmed. The hike sparked fears the Tories are offering a sticking plaster to problems in the benefit system, including Universal Credit which has previously been blamed for rent arrears.A study by the Residential Landlords Association last month claimed more than half of private landlords who let to tenants on UCsaw them fall into arrears, mostly after the tenant moved to UC. David Smith, the associationaposs Policy Director, said today: Increasing discretionary payments are a sign of a system that is not working.    Rather than responding to emergency situations as they arise, the Government should be preventing them in the first place. It is therefore disappointing that the Chancellor said nothing about boosting the supply of homes to rent to improve affordability, provided no pledges to end the Local Housing Allowance Freeze and was silent on the need to end the five week wait before Universal Credit claimants can receive their first payment. DHPs are stop-gap funds to help struggling claimants who donapost have enough cash to pay rent. They are dished out by councils, and claimants can include people hit by the Bedroom Tax or Benefit Cap. They are not specic to Universal Credit. After complaints the Department for Work and Pensionsintroduced several measures to soften the blow of the five-week wait for UC.    They include two weeks of aposrun-onapos payments of housing benefits, and advances that can be worth a full monthaposs benefit.But campaigners criticised Chancellor Sajid Javid today for not doing more to fix UCaposs brutal rollout.Emma Revie, chief executive of foodbank charity the Trussell Trust, which runs hundreds of food banks across the country, said: This Spending Review was a lost opportunity. As the country looks to the future, we need our Government to put policy ahead of politics. Increasing living costs, inadequate benefit levels, and the five-week wait for Universal Credit are all leaving people without enough money in their pockets for the most basic costs. Jon Sparkes, Chief Executive of Crisis, added: “Right now there are thousands of people homeless up and down the country and even more in vulnerable circumstances, on the brink of homelessness. While the additional funding announced today is a welcome step, today’s Spending Review is ultimately a missed opportunity for Government to be serious in tackling the fundamental issues that cause homelessness in the first place. “Every day through our work we hear from people whose Housing Benefit simply doesn’t cover the cost of their rent, leaving them under immense financial pressure and at genuine risk of homelessness.

The no-deal legislation is expected to clear the House of Lords by this Friday - and get royal assent on Monday.  This would then clear the way for another vote on a general election which Mr Corbyn is likely at that stage to support.    His spokesman said: “The bill that is going to parliament today needs to pass. It needs to pass all its stages.  “It needs to go through and have royal assent – and once we’re confident they can’t crash out and no deal is taken off the table for  October, we will support a general election.” He added: “We want to have a general election as soon as possible and we believe that is the best way to settle not only this issue, but all the issues facing the country.” But many Labour MPs are concerned that holding an early election would leave the door open to crashing out of the EU on October . They fear Mr Johnson could campaign on his Brexit “do or die” pledge andhe won a majority could ram through a no-deal departure.   They were told at a meeting of backbenchers this morning that the party would back a post-Brexit general election as a result.    Shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer told them: “We need to implement the bill- which necessarily means going beyond October”.  He later suggested at the despatch box that Labour would not back an election until the bill was enacted. “I can confirm we will not be voting with the Government tonight, and we will keep the focus on the task in hand, which is to ensure that we do not leave the EU without a deal, and that requires the passing and implementation of this act,” he said. This would mean MPs voting for an election after October th - the date when a three month extension would be agreedthe Prime Minister has failed to agree a new deal with Brussels. Senior Labour figures including shadow chancellor John McDonnell are said to be relaxed about allowing Mr Johnson to “limp on”.    They believe that the PM would be politically damaged - and therefore beatable -he was unable to deliver on his Brexit by October  “do or die” pledge. The Tory party could lose Leave voters to the Brexit Party as well as Remain support to the Lib Dems. Mr McDonnell warned Mr Johnson was an “extremely slippery customer” who could not be relied on to stick to a general election date.  “We want to get the legislation secure [with] royal assent but we are not going to be tricked or conned by Johnson, so we are looking at every way in which, having secured the legislation, that he can’t wriggle out of abiding by the law and implementing it,” he said. “The range of options that Keir and the others are looking at include whether is it a matter of triggering an election after the royal assent and will that give us the security, so we are checking with the lawyers on that.  “Or, is it implementation and again we are checking the law on that.” Labour MP Clive Lewis added: “The sensible thing to do will be to say, ‘OK, we’ll have a general election, but we’ll do it after we have got the extension signed and sealed at the European Council [on October ]. “In the meantime, let the Tories stew in their own juices, and implode.”    Mr Corbyn’s spokesman was asked why the Labour leader did not just wait to vote for an election to guarantee that no deal would be taken off the table and at the same time inflict damage on Mr Johnson.  He suggested that Labour expected to be able to avoid a no deal departure by winning the election.  “We’re confident the position of the Prime Minister is far more unstable in Parliament and in the country than he and his supporters seem to think,” he said.  But many Labour backbenchers do not share his optimism - believing the party’s ambiguous Brexit position could lose it votes.  One senior MP told the Mirror: “The strong  majority view is that an early election would allow Boris Johnson to pick the timing and tactics. To go now on his terms would see Labour lose - and lose badly”. Mr Corbyn held a meeting with fellow opposition leaders this morning at which he told them he would support a general election – but only after the threat of a no-deal Brexit had been removed.The Labour leader is also coming under pressure from the SNP , the third biggest party at Westminster, to push on with a vote. SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon tweeted: “It’s starting to feel like Labour doesn’t want an election at all... and leaving this PM in place knowing he’ll try every trick in book to get what he wants would be irresponsible.

And he boasted no department will be cut next year as he vowed to tear up fiscal rules ahead of the next Budget to turn the page on austerity, after nearly a decade of swingeing cuts.

The event came hours after Mr Johnson lost his Commons majority by taking the whip from  Tory rebels who voted to stop a no-deal Brexit. Moments after the Spending Round, MPs began debating a Bill in Parliament to prevent Boris Johnson crashing out of the EU on October .And on the same night Mr Johnson would hold a debate on holding an early election on October . But Labour were due to vote against - because they wanted to ensure no-deal is blocked first.   Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said the pathetic sum for departments on their knees after nine years of Tory austerity was adding insult to injury. He branded the statement an opportunist one-year spending review and said social care was receiving only a sticking plaster with no long-term reform. And he said the statement was a distraction from a government with no mandate, no morals and no majority, adding: A government not just callous but uncaring as well.

That appears to include a £, personal development budget over  years for every nurse, midwe and allied health professional.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe Tories have quietly confirmed plans to increase the main portion of council tax by up to % next year - in a bid to fund crippled social care.Sajid Javid trumpeted the increase in cash for the struggling sector as part of his limited spending round.But the money is not all coming from the government but from hard-pressed taxpayers. Of the £.bn for social care, £m has to be raised by councils rather than funding from government. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell branded the move a stealth tax and said the Chancellor had smuggled it into the budget. Tory cuts have hit funding by an average of % per person since  leaving the system close to collapse. And charities and experts dismissed the extra funds as a sticking plaster. The Shadow Chancellor said: Sajid Javid should have been more straight forward in how it was announced and about how we are going to fund social care overall.  It will go down like a lead balloon in local authorities. Struggling families have already been hammered with years of above-inflation council tax rises after the government forced town halls to fill the gap left by Tory cuts.The average Band D home in England saw a total council tax rise of £ in April this year. Todayaposs announcement could push that average even higher in April . The main precept rose by up to % for two years in some parts of the country - followed by a further % for some residents in  . That is because councils that run social care - who make up most of your council tax bill - have for the last three years been allowed to raise bills by up to .%. They were then allowed to add up to % or % on top in inidual years, dedicated to social care. Director of the Resolution Foundation Torsten Bell agreed that the promised money would have limited affect on the crumbling system.He said: On social care this is more of the same ie short term sticking plaster of cash now and a promise of a real plan tomorrow. That record has been playing for  years...Social care has proved a huge political headache for the Tories. Theresa May was accused of kicking the can down the road after she repeatedly delayed plans for a ‘green paper’ on social care.Her blighted social care plans in the  general election campaign were dubbed a “dementia tax” and blamed for the Tories losing their majority in the  general election. During the Tory leadership contest, Boris Johnson said he had a reform plan ready to go once he arrived in office. But charities say the promises announced today and that funding for one year did not give the sector enough certainty.Jeremy Hughes, Chief Executive of Alzheimer’s Society, said: “We’re disappointed that the Government hasn’t done enough today to deliver the change so desperately needed by people with dementia and their families.Our pleas for an NHS Dementia Fund have yet to become funding commitments, despite the backing of hundreds of MPs and over , campaigners in the letter the Prime Minister received on Monday. £ billion can only stave off the utter collapse of our social care system, neglected by successive Governments for so long.  “On Monday the Prime Minister assured us that he will sort out dementia care, once and for all. He agreed that people with dementia must be treated the same as those with other health conditions.We now need to see concrete plans for reform that address the unfair and catastrophic care costs for people with dementia, and the daily battle that they and their families face to get the care and support they so badly need. “The MS Society dismissed the money as a stopgap measure that will just paper over the cracks.Genevieve Edwards, Director of External Affairs at the MS Society, said: Until we see a long-term funding solution, people with MS will continue struggling without basic care to eat, wash or dress. While there are no more planned welfare cuts next year, the support people have already lost from PIP continues to have a devastating impact, costing the Government more than they save – so it makes no financial sense to keep denying this support. “MS is relentless, painful and disabling, and thousands have been driven to misery during this decade of cuts.Both social care and disability benefits are vital lelines that must be a priority for the Government. Macmillan Cancer Support expressed concern at the short term announcement.

Comerford deliberately hogged the parking space he shared with his neighbour in the y battle. The man, who runs an architectural design practice, claimed he had right of way on the pairaposs shared drive in Salford, Greater Manchester, when he began building works on his £, house. The project saw numerous work vans attending outside Mr Charnockaposs home next door and whilst the workmen agreed to move their vehicles upon request, Comerford kept blocking the space with his own car so his neighbour could not access to his house, located at the end of the driveway.    And in the -month feud, Comerford blocked the pathway on  dferent occasions, making it impossible for former lawyer Mr Charnock to park outside his property. But Comerford was convicted of harassment after Mr Charnock and his partner Michelle Lynch kept a record of the disruption. The businessman must now complete a -month community order,  hours unpaid work and pay £ in costs and surcharges. He was also issued with an -month restraining order banning him from contacting Mr Charnock and his partner unless through a lawyer. The order states he cannot cause obstruction and interfere in any way direct vehicular or pedestrian access to and from the Charnocksapos address.    In a statement read to Manchester Magistratesapos Court, Mr Charnock said: This whole series of events including the legal proceedings has taken a lot out of me but it was bad enough that we felt we had to. It has caused me constant stress when your nearest neighbour wages a war of attrition against you. It is particularly stressful when his behaviour stops you gaining access to the outside world and you feel trapped in your own home. Some of his behaviour has been disturbing and he has demonstrated an underlying obsession. It seems he holds an underlying and worrying hatred for us. Since we got the police and courts involved he has shown no contrition at all. We expect the outcome of this to remedy the situation and prevent further incidents in the future. And punish him for his offending over several months. Comerford denied causing his neighbour harassment, but was convicted following a two-day trial.  Zoe Earle, prosecuting, said: This defendant pursued a course of harassment against his neighbours Mark Charnock and his partner Michelle Lynch. Over the last  months the defendant stopped them from accessing their home address by parking across a road they both share. This was the only way the victims could access their home. Both parties initially viewed it as a civil issue but matters eventually escalated and the police became involved. The defendant during this period deliberately blocked access to their home in a way that stopped them getting access to their home. He parked his vehicle in front of their gates in an attempt to upset them. It got to the point that the victims struggled to cope with the harassment. Both struggled to cope with every day le. The victim has had signicant stomach pains. He was referred to a specialist and they thought it may be cancer but turns out it is an ulcer he feels is related to the stress caused by this. Comerfordaposs lawyers argued the matter wasnapost a criminal case.

The stone-built homes were built on a plot in the West Pennine moors near Bolton, but have fallen foul of officials. Finishing works have been halted after it was discovered they had not been built in line with approved planning permissions. The buildings - known as Grundy Fold - had been put in dferent positions on the development than those agreed and some were bigger than they were supposed to be. Specically, the footprint and total floor areas are larger than approved and the height of three houses is higher than permitted.    The footprint of one property was sqm over what was agreed with the council while the height of another property saw an increase of .m. The owners tried to broker a deal with local planners after being told that the properties - which they have never lived in - would have to be torn down. They offered to demolish and then rebuild two homes and alter one other at a cost to themselves of over £m but this was rejected last week. Bolton Council planning committee decided the houses were still too big and far away from each other.    It also ruled that it represented inappropriate development within one of the most prominent greenbelt sites in West Bolton. The local authority first issued an enforcement notice to flatten the entire development last year following an impasse with the developers Sparkle Developments. The enforcement notice to demolish the properties - each sold by the developer to the homeowners on a freehold basis - is currently on hold as the decision has been appealed by the developer. But the latest setback last week means the homeowners are now going into a three-day inquiry to hear the appeal in November facing the prospect of losing their properties altogether. The Bolton News have reported how homeowner Elan Raja told councillors during the meeting about the immense challenge he and the other plot owners have faced.  During last weekaposs committee meeting, he said: Given the plots are our homes, the unfolding of ious twists and turns of all applications, itaposs been nothing short of a living hell. There have been big implications of all areas of our daily lives. The financial burden, the threat of loss, the emotional impact, theyaposve all stacked up. And with that, we wish to bring matters to a successful conclusion. Speaking after the meeting, Mr Raja added: We remain committed to working with the local planning authority to find a compromise in line with the officeraposs report and in line with what Cllr Bob Allen had stated about coming back with a new application. The site previously comprised the farmhouse to Grundy Fold Farm, three large metal clad buildings, one large stone barn, two brick and breeze block built buildings and numerous small temporary buildings and structures.

More than  critically endangered Desertas wolf spiders have been bred at Bristol Zoo Gardens, boosting the worldaposs dwindling population. The tiny creepy crawlies are just mm in diameter at the moment - but will grow much bigger. It is expected that the spiders will measure cm across by the time they are adults. The birth was also signicant for another reason. Keepers had to incubate a clutch of the critters after one of the mothers died. Invertebrate curator Mark Bushell said: This is such a huge achievement for everyone involved.    Weaposve learnt so much about the care and conditions required for breeding from our first generation of wolf spiders and to now have welcomed a second generation is a massive success. All spiderlings are eating well and have begun dispersing from their burrow. A large number are still on their motheraposs back, where she has carried them since they were in the egg sac.    It wonapost be long before they start to fend for themselves. The eggs that were produced by the mother who died are being cared for by Markaposs team. The process requires careful management of the tiny eggs, which are no bigger than a grain of cous cous, including separating eggs that get stuck together and turning eggs to ensure their conditions mimic those that the mum would provide, he added.

The hate for Thatcher was pure and the depth of feeling surged through concerts and rallies.He says with a chuckle: “Them were the days.“We thought it was bad then, but everything can get worse, as we see now. It’s a case of careful what you wish for.“I don’t get involved in politics now, like I say when didn’t anyone complain about politicians “Can you point me to a golden era where# everybody liked being ruled  F***ing never!“But there are some real creeps nowadays. But then again I expect the worst from any politician.”So what can fans in Dundee expect when John rolls into town for his show at the city’s Gardyne Theatre on Saturday October  Without missing a beat he fires back: “A right f****** good night!“And they can expect more of the same#and then some. There will be a few classics and there will maybe be a few extra poems.“Then I will add a bit of fun and I can guarantee – solid, copper-plated guarantee – that everybody is going to leave with a smile on their face.”John has fond memories of Dundee and spoke of savouring the atmosphere of a waterfront hotel and added: “I love coming to Scotland and Dundee. I’ve been many times and the reaction of the crowd is great.“I was here last year and saw the VA which is fabulous. I know of DC Thomson and the Sunday Post, the Beano and the Dandy plus Oor Wullie.“Maybe I will buy one of those sculptures.”Posh hotels and venues seem a world away from the clubs and student venues of the s with smoke-filled rooms and plastic tumblers full of warm beer.He used to travel to the shows on public transport and chuckles at the memory.John said: “Yeah, long time ago now, mate. Now I have a driver and I am too old for public transport.“But I still love doing live gigs. It’s smashing. Anywhere where there’s people is greatI’m doing my stuff.“I am working on my book of poems right now. It’s called ‘The Luckiest Man Alive’ and I’m also working on the memoirs. vw, px\"  “I am thinking of calling that ‘I Wanna Be Yours’ after the Arctic Monkeys. I just hope to live long enough to finish it.“But I am not finishing up any time soon. I have never even thought about that. I am not retiring, not yet and not in the foreseeable future.”John has the tour to contend with first and is also lining up some television work.And at the age of  there is definitely no holding him back.

It would also have long running ramications as Devlin would miss the League Cup final loss to Celtic and would eventually be ruled out for three months.Now, after a fresh injury set back, Devlin is back and is offered the chance to impress.Reid, capped  times for his country, insists late call-ups can provide the catalyst for a successful international career.He said: “For myself, I went to the World Cupand I was not even in the original squad.“Injury meant I went and I was the first substitute on in the first game against Cameroon.”Reid is confident Scotland can cope with the defensive injury withdrawals against Russia and a Belgium.He said: “There is no question we can still deal with that and there’s still a lot of quality there throughout the pitch.“Hopefully those that do get an opportunity come the Russia and Belgium games take their chance.“Our job as a staff is to get the ideas how we approach a game and how we play and get them organised pretty quickly.“It is about cramming as much information, detail, videos and work on the training pitch as possible to get them as prepared as possible for the games.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/08/5d668a497e6b59.78887505-651x564.jpg ","title":"adopt a pet harley basil and dexter and dakota are looking for a new home can you help","story":"Are you looking to get a new pet  Why not adopt one of these adorable pets from Mrs Murray’s Cat and Dog Home.This cheeky girl is  months old.

We do at the moment have a dentist and fully qualied staff and are happy with their work.Rumour has it that the aforementioned dentist and staff will be taking on patients from Mid Argyll Hospital, which I presume they tend to already.But the practice is to lose its local NHS patients, so they will deal solely with patients who require dental treatment from the hospital. I think this situation leaves the NHS patients in limbo.I am sure we would rather that the current dentist and all of her staff be given a chance to voice their opinions on this matter as much and as well as the local populace.Yes, it will be brilliant to have both dentists in the town. There is the possibility that those on the local list who are currently treated well by the dental department at the hospital maybe still seen by the dentist and her staff, but I would like this to be confirmed by the local NHS trust.Brian MacDonald, CrinanSir,Hundreds of people across Scotland have been helped through their exam results by a local group of Skills Development Scotlandcareers advisers.Based across the north of Scotland, the advisers were part of a team taking calls at the SDS Exam Results Helpline from am on results day.The helpline is a vital service, supporting young people and their families at what can be one of the most stressful times of their lives.Expert advice and guidance is available all year round, not just on results day.Our professionally qualied careers advisers are working in every state secondary school in Scotland and from our network of high street centres across the country.In schools, careers services are delivered one-to-one, in classrooms and at school events across all year groups, supporting young people to develop the skills to make informed career decisions throughout their lives.

The deadline was broken on  minutes when Lee MacLean broke from midfield and managed to beat the offside trap, his cross from the left channel was met by the in-form Stuart MacLean whose shot beat Martin to give Star the lead.Tarbert looked to commit bodies forward in a bid to get back into the game which made for a more open contest, however the Star defence of Coll McCallum, Ricky Reid and Kyle Selfridge coped well throughout.Red Star should have made the closing stages a lot more comfortable for themselves with Gregor Peacock going close with a couple of opportunities and Aaron Moore having a shot well blocked but in the end Stuart MacLean’s goal was enough for a hard-fought but deserved win.On Saturday August  Star welcome Dunoon to the joint campus for their final game of the group stage, where a victory for the Lochgilphead side will see them progress to the quarter-finals.The kick-off time will be announced on the club’s social media pages during the week."},{"url":null,"title":"easy like summer busking","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe music club designed for everyone continues its summer of busking on Wednesday August .Get along to Lochgilphead Resource Centre for an evening of music from the much-missed Danny Kennedy with bagpipes, percussion and plenty of chances to sing along to the music.The event starts at pm and is free other than donations.

These songs were associated with the Tlell River on Hai Gwaii in Canada. These tracks, with a selection of later collaborations, make up River to Sea from Tlell to Tiree. The title documents Sheila#s journey from the coast of Canada to Tiree, where the track All You Really Need is the Sea was written.This artist is probably best described as a folk blues singer. She has the sharply observing, descriptive eye of the classic singer songwriter troubadour and while her voice is given gravitas and character by time, she swings and has the timing of the blues singer.Wild Biscuit#s musical accompaniment gives Sheila#s characterful voice depth and presence. The menacing guitar on I#ve Waited a Long Time and the atmospheric double bass and keyboards on Where the Pebbles Grind and Scrape complement Cameron#s lyrics and singing.Remembering Mr Toast is an atmospheric and evocative, less bombastic or overblown Scottish Jim Morrison, finding real beauty in a melancholic memory. The delicate hesitant guitar and reflective lyrics continue on Don#t Sigh and Go on Then, beautul, bitter sweet country love songs. All You Really Need is the Sea and Deep and Real are spiritual songs, again moving between an intimate relationship to consider the huge landscape and the restorative natural world.Is it blues, country, easy listening, folk or poetry set to delicate sympathetic music  It doesn#t matter. Close your eyes, listen to Sheila#s rich voice, with its cadence and rhythm. Enjoy the flow of words and the pictures they conjure on this warm and captivating set of recordings."},{"url":null,"title":"macalister wins tarbert golf championship","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe delayed fourth and final round of the Tarbert Golf Club championship took place at Glenralloch on Saturday August  in glorious conditions.The greens were freshly cut with captain Smyth choosing some interesting pin positions to test the players# skills.Iain Macalister held a one shot lead over Bruce MacNab and a five shot lead over John MacNab heading into the final round.If there were any nerves at the start of play this was not evident as Iain started with four fours then followed that with an excellent -foot birdie putt at the fth and a chip-in birdie at the sixth.

The two practices are run separately but with many shared resources. We don’t think the time is right to merge the practices completely but we do want a new logo and a name that recognises that we work very closely together.The winning entry will receive a cash prize and will then become the public image of our practices for the foreseeable future. In addition, in recognition of their support and contribution to our community, we are also making a donation to the Lochgilphead High School art and design department.We thank all of our patients for working with us over the past few years as changes have been made which require adjustment on all sides. Your understanding and patience is very much appreciated as we seek to find the safest way to deliver the most effective and high quality health care for us all.We look forward to seeing the talent of our local young people when competition entries close on October  and celebrating that talent when we announce our winner on October .Dr Andrew Strain, Lochgilphead Medical Centre and Furnace and Inveraray SurgerySir,My favourite activity at this time of the year is picking brambles. Now I am not saying this is the simplest or even healthiest of activities. All this crouching, hand staining, pricked fingers and even eye strain.Often when you reach for a large black juicy berry it seems to disappear. It’s like the behaviour of politicians. They offer so much but when you reach for it # it disappears. Do you remember the Scottish government passed a law guaranteeing one would be seen by an appropriate health specialist within a stated limited time  The SNP government daily breaks this law – be it on cancer, accident and emergencies, or mental health.Or what about the promises made to the people of Arran and the Outer Hebrides on improved ferry services. The Scottish government is responsible for Caledonian Maritime Assets, CMal, which own and manage ferries. MV Glen Sannox was intended to commence service to Arran in  but lies incomplete for all to see in the Ferguson Marine yard in Port Glasgow. Part of the delay is because of disagreement over the fixed-price design and build contract for the two vessels.The SNP seems obsessed with this type of contract which has adversely affected schools, colleges and community centres. Worse still, while the SNP ridiculed previous government public private partnerships they have introduced a system clearly no better. What about the £. million each month we the taxpayers have to pay for the unopened Edinburgh sick children’s hospital  Jeanne Freeman, the SNP Cabinet Secretary for Health and Social Care, stepped in so late that she does not know whether this much-needed hospital will ever open.The second part of the bramble experience is the delicious mouthwatering bramble crumble. A crumble which gives joy and stimulation. Not like the crumbling state of the SNP government which has a sour taste and clearly disappoints.Finlay Craig, CoveSir,Your readers may be interested to know that there are currently  people in need of a kidney transplant in Scotland whose diet will be restricted due to kidney disease.It is likely that they will be on fluid restrictions of around just ml of liquid a day # including liquid found in foods like sauces and ice cream. That is roughly the equivalent of only being able to have a small cup of tea and one can of soft drink per day. In addition, they may have to limit the potassium and phosphate in their diet which means missing out on enjoying foods like chocolate, bananas and tomatoes.We want to make the kidney diet about all the things patients can eat and bring enjoyment back into food # which is why we have launched the Kidney Kitchen.We hope that the Kidney Kitchen will mean everyone living with kidney disease in Scotland can enjoy healthy and delicious food with their family and friends.If you are, oryou know a kidney patient, check out www.kidneykitchen.orgEwen Maclean, advocacy officer Scotland, Kidney Care UKSir,The death of a pet cat can come as a shock, and many owners can find it dficult to come to terms with their loss.The death of a pet is not always seen as a signicant loss, leading some people to hide their feelings which can cause them to feel very alone.On Grief Awareness Day, August , Cats Protection is highlighting its free and confidential Paws to Listen support service, so people facing the loss of a cat do not have to feel alone.The service is available on   .

coincide with a full council meeting, and waved flags, shouted slogans and played lsquoMoney Money Moneyrsquo by ABBA on a PA system.Speaking at the demonstration, Willie Thomson, a regional industrial organiser for Unite, said that the dispute could risk the regionrsquos winter maintenance programme.He said: ldquoThe reason why the men are taking action is basically a refusal from Scottish Borders Council to respect the terms and conditions of their employment.ldquoThey have had changes imposed on them that will cost them poundrsquos, and they are not willing to have that done to them.ldquoThe reason they are striking is to send a strong message that the council needs to get back round the table and reach an agreement with the workers.ldquoThe people of the Scottish Borders need to be aware that the council is risking their winter maintenance service.ldquoDuring the winter maintenance service members do a lot of extra hours to keep up with the extra demand.ldquoWersquore now in a position where members will be withdrawing that programme.ldquoThat work is done a voluntary basis and the good will that is required to do that is in short supply.Currently, summer standby for Scottish Borders Councilrsquos road workers is voluntary, but council chiefs are trying to make this mandatory, in line with other sections of the council.Earlier this year, Scottish Borders Council notied the unions that not enforcing the same terms and conditions across the whole council could leave the local authority open to gender pay discrimination claims, as the mainly male roads section of the council is not required to be on standby over the summer, whereas the mainly female care home staff are.Summer standby payment for roads workers is currently pound., albeit it on a voluntary basis, and Scottish Borders Council is offering to up this to pound as long as it becomes mandatory.The two main unions which represent road workers at Scottish Borders Council, Unite and Unison, have been in discussion with the council ever since it informed employees that the terms and conditions would change.However, the talks with Unite broke down, and .% of the unionrsquos members who voted in an industrial ballot voted for strike action. The turn out was %.Scottish Borders Councilrsquos chief executive Tracey Logan,said: ldquoThe council has not changed terms and conditions for this staff group, nor have we failed to consult the trade unions or the staff affected.ldquoIn fact, we discovered some months ago that a small number of staff in this section had been claiming a higher rate of overtime than they were entitled to under the agreed terms and conditions.ldquoThey were also claiming for time to travel to work when working weekend overtime, which again is not in line with the agreement in place.ldquoGiven that Unite agreed to these terms and conditions, I am surprised and disappointed that they now want some of their members to be given more favourable pay rates than others, and for this small group be able to claim additional allowances that their other members cannot.ldquoIt is a principle of fairness and equality for staff across the whole workforce and one which I would expect Unite as representatives of staff to uphold and commit to."},{"url":null,"title":"selkirk-bar-cream-crop-scottish-cuisine","story":"A BAR and restaurant is the toast of Selkirk after winning the Best Scottish Cuisine title at Food Awards Scotland .The celebration of the countrys best restaurants, takeaways, pubs, hotel restaurants, cafes and bistros was held last week in Glasgow.Within the restaurant category it was the The Fleece Bar  Kitchen which was announced as cream of the crop when it comes to presenting Scottish cuisine.Trevor and Tracey Ward, who have owned the historic Selkirk inn since , were delighted with the latest accolade.Tracey told us: \"Wersquore absolutely delighted to have been awarded this accolade which celebrates the very best Scotland has to offer in the hospitality industry.\"To win the category of Best Scottish Cuisine when wersquore a family run restaurant situated in a small Borders town, is testament to the commitment and focus of our staff and the support we have from our customers and the community.\"There were some great, long established restaurants in our category and for us to have come out on top was a welcome surprise!Over the past three years the Wards, along with trainee chef son Ryan, have been rewarded with a regular stream of five-star reviews from delighted customers.And the awards shelf is filling up as quickly as their restaurant diary.Another Borders establishment which was also honoured last week at the Food Awards Scotland was Stewarts Cafe Bistro in Jedburgh.The High Street business was named as the regional Cafe Bistro winner.Creative Oceanic has been organising and hosting the awards for the past six years.CEO Irfan Younis told us: ldquoCongratulations to all winners and finalists at the sixth Food Awards Scotland .\"We welcomed and rewarded some of the best in the Scottish food industry who serve us up some of the tastiest food, enhance our culture, deliver top quality customer service and provide us with some of the best banter around.

The overall revenue budget for the upkeep of parks across the Borders is contained within the budget for neighbourhood services and no savings are projected from this budget as a result of the play programme.ldquoThe removal of old play equipment from playparks, which following appraisal, deemedto be low value facilities, will allow for sufficient resources to be deployed to maintain thenew facilities being invested in by the council through the outdoor community spacescapital project on an ongoing basis.ldquoThe new facilities include more pieces of equipment, widening access and providinghigher play value than the previous, aged, low-amenity, play equipment. Thedecommissioning of the older low value facilities will ensure the revenue impact to the parks and environment service budget is cost neutral.ldquoI would further confirm that no play park will be decommissioned until such times as thenew play park investment in that locality is complete.ldquoMembers should also note that no town or village which currently has a play park will beleft without one following the upgrade process.Tweeddale West councillor Heather Anderson also queried the council leader, asking for an update on the proposed closure of eleven parks in her ward.Councillor Haslam told the chamber: ldquoThe council requested feedback to the programme for decommissioning of play parks with an end date of August .ldquoOfficers will now undertake a review of the feedback and, where appropriate, respond prior to implementing the council decision.ldquoIn announcing a signicant investment in outdoor community facilities the council recognised the need to address the historic over provision of low value playparks, indeed the council is in amongst the largest providers of play parks per  head of population when compared to similar authorities, however when it comes to quality it is amongst the lowest in play value terms.ldquoThe council decision to invest in destination playparks and decommission those play parks which are obsolete does not remove the spaces from fulfilling an important community need in terms of access to open spaces.ldquoThese spaces can be used for informal play and have the potential to help the council address other issues such as its obligation to identy places for community food growing.Scottish Borders Council recently spent pound, on a new playpark at Harestanes Countryside Visitor Centre, near Ancrum, which follows on from new parks built in Galashiels, Oxton, and Stow.The council also opened up a new playpark in Hawick in  as part of the regeneration of WIlton Lodge Park, and Coldstream is set to be next to receive a new playpark with a pound, facility set to open in Home Park at the end of the month."},{"url":null,"title":"driving-legend-jackie-opens-museum-39-great-friend-39","story":"SIR Jackie Stewart praised Jim Clark as a driver and as a friend when he officially opened the refurbished Jim Clark Museum on Thursday in Duns.Clark won two Formula  World Championships, in  and , claiming overall a total of  Grand Prix victories with  pole starts, and also the Indianapolis  in  before he died in a horric crash at Hockenheim in .Sir Jackie, who later was flying off to Spain for the weekendrsquos Grand Prix, recalled his friendship with Clark.And he revealed how he regularly visited the Borders to meet up with his lsquogreat friend.He said: ldquoWhen Jim Clark was racing he was my hero and was certainly the best racing driver I ever raced against.\"We had a great le together and he was an enormous help to me.

There was a lot of spirit and a feeling that a number of towns in Scotland which have been forgotten, like Campbeltown, will not be left behind after independence.#He put the turnout at more than , and added: #The fact that the march extended theof Longrow gives a fair indication of the numbers who were there.He also told the Courier this week that he remained the #legal indentity# of the All Under One Banner group, despite a bitter public row among the hierarchy which looks like splitting the group in two.It was the biggest rally held in the town in recent years with marchers coming from as far afield as Aberdeen and Alloa and as well as Oban, Glasgow and Islay, with many travelling on the weekend ferry from Ardrossan.#It really exceeded expectations and made a big splash in the town, Ron Wilson of Yes Kintyre told The National.#There was a real buzz as people came early and most of the hotels were booked up. The pubs and cafes were busy so it was good for local businesses. Campbeltown is a Yes town and it was brilliant to have all these people come here.

Ryan McConnachie opted to go straight down the middle and evaded the e of the Dunoon keeper.There was a moment of worry at the other end, though, when goalscorer Souden also committed a handball in the Pupils’ box, and referee Peter Laing pointed to the spot. Dunoon halved the Pupils’ advantage, making it -.Then, just  seconds later, the Pupils restored their two-goal lead through Donald McCallum, who met left-sided substitute Kenny Kerr’s low cross to squeeze a shot between the Dunoon defenders and the frame of the goal.Soon after, the Pupils made it -, when Kerr guided another delightful cross onto the head of John McCallum, who guided an effort past the keeper from six yards, but it was the goal creator Kerr who was rightly mobbed by his team-mates.Not content with four, the Feathers-sponsored Pupils scored again, with # stand by # Kerr making it three assists in one match.Played in by McConnachie after some strong play in midfield by fellow substitute Michael McKinlay, Kerr set up young winger Ross Brown, who gladly tucked home goal number five with a close-range finish.With the match drawing to a close, McConnachie sealed his brace # and the Pupils’ sixth goal # with an excellent inidual effort, surging past a defender before rounding the hosts’ keeper and slotting the ball low into an unguarded net, adding gloss to an already emphatic cup win.After a great team performance, the Pupils will be hoping for more of the same tomorrowwhen they welcome a Tarbert side # who last week also defeated Dunoon # in a Kintyre derby.The match is scheduled for a pm kick off at Kintyre Park."},{"url":null,"title":"third round of tarberts golf championship","story":"Former champion Bruce MacNab held a four-shot lead going into the third round but a horror start saw the lead wiped out at the very first hole when Iain Macalister birdied and Bruce had a seven.Iain went on to birdie the second hole as well and despite the windy conditions was very much in control of his game over the first nine holes to be out in .John MacNab was also playing his normal steady game also ing , enjoying birdies at the st and th holes.After nine holes Iain had turned a four-shot deficit into a four-shot lead over Bruce and six ahead of John.Over the next four holes both Iain and John dropped four shots allowing Bruce some breathing space to claw back some of the deficit.When play was complete and all scores checked the totals after round three were as follows: Iain Macalister , Bruce MacNab , John MacNab .In the John Reid Quaich the silverware again headed south to Largieside with Duncan Johnstone retaining the trophy, shooting  nett over the two rounds.

Work is expected to start at the end of the month and should be completed by the send of September.Councillor Frank T. Spears stated that the work would not involve any long-term closure of the main roadway.The #dry bridge#, owned by Lord Margadale, has been the subject of much discussion and minor rows for the past several months. Since Western Ferries Ltd. began their sea service, heavy articulated lorries carrying malt and grain to the island#s distilleries have been unable to go under the bridge. Matters came to a head three months ago when Argyll County Council re-imposed a weight limit on the Glen road # the ersion used by the transporters to avoid the bridge.The bridge owners came quickly to the rescue and allowed the heavy traffic to use their private road at Bridgend for a three-week period, but following local protests and legal consultations the transporters were again allowed to use the Glen road.Leboat saves three on rocksThe crew of a lobster fishing boat were marooned on a partially-submerged rock for more than two hours when their vessel foundered off the north-east coast of Islay on Thursday morning.The ft #May#, owned and skippered by -year-old Mr Lachlan Clark of Port Charlotte # the veteran of several sea-dramas # struck the rocks while they were lting lobster creels.The Islay leboat was called out to rescue the skipper and his crew # Alastair MacDonald, a -year-old fisherman, and Norman Gardiner, a -year-old Colonsay doctor#s son who was making his first trip and deputising for a sick crew member.Following the rescue, the crew # who were unhurt # were landed at Port Askaig.ONE-HUNDRED YEARS AGONational Health Insurance ActA number of contraventions of the National Health Insurance Act were the subject of prosecutions in Campbeltown Sherf Court on Thursday # Sherf MacMaster Campbell on the bench.The first case was that of a Clachan merchant who was charged with neglecting to stamp the card of a female servant.Mr M. Dick, solicitor, who appeared for accused, tendered a plea of guilty, and said the observations he was about to make would apply equally to all the cases subsequently to be heard. These were the first prosecutions of the kind in this court. The Act, as his Lordship knew, was a most voluminous and complicated measure.The sherf observed that some excellent and very lucid summaries had been circulated.Mr Dick, proceeding, asked his Lordship to examine the contribution card. He would find that the part which was the very kernel of the offence was embodied in the middle of Art.  in very inconspicuous type. The employer was there required to stamp the card #not later than the time at which wages are paid# but to read that one required to hold the card at about  degrees.The sherf askedhe was to understand that this was the first occasion on which a domestic servant had been employed by accused  If not, he must have been trained in the use of this wonderful document years ago.Mr Dick said his Lordship must consider this, that in cases of this kind there were two standards of clearness. What was clear to the judicial mind might be very far from clear to the lay mind.It was a matter of common knowledge that there was a very general belief in this part of the country thatinsurance cards were stamped at the time they were run out the Act would be complied with.The card, of course, bore that the stamps must be affixed #not later than the time wages are paid#. He asked his Lordship to consider the phraseology. These cards came into the hands of many rustic employers of labour. Why should it not be stated in bold characters on the card that the stamps must be affixed at the time wages are paid In the country wages were paid sometimes by the half-year, sometimes by the month, and sometimes at irregular periods suitable to the circumstances of the worker.The cards represented not the half-year of the feeing terms, but the calendar half-year. All these circumstances contributed to the confusion of the lay mind, and encouraged the widespread impression thatthe cards were stamped at the end of the period the duty of a citizen was thereby fulfilled."},{"url":null,"title":"leader august 23 2019","story":"The Courier is honoured to deliver news to the community # during the good times and the bad.This week we were delighted to share the news that Campbeltown now boasts the #whisky bar of the year#, according to judges at the Scottish Bar and Pub Awards , who bestowed the title to the Ardshiel Hotel.Since buying the hotel more than a decade ago, Flora Grant and Marion MacKinnon have more than tripled the number of whiskies on offer, turning the hotel into something of a tourist attraction in itself.However, we also revealed that nine jobs have been lost at Campbeltown Creamery.While it is still hoped that a take-over by local farmers is the future for the site, it is terrible for the iniduals who have lost their jobs, some after many, many years.We know there is a market for Campbeltown cheese, and while the number of farms supplying the creamery has fallen over the years, there are still almost .Here#s hoping the future is bright for both Campbeltown#s whiskies and cheeses."},{"url":null,"title":"fun in the sun at first mokfest","story":"India enjoyed herself at this year#s Up The Close event, which included children#s entertainer Funky Chicken and ious fair attractions, and was made all the better by the glorious sunshine.India was joined by her mum Lynsey Mcshannon, who was able to get into the spirit of things this year having been heavily pregnant last year, and her dad Gary Anderson.This year#s Up The Close was a particular hit, with the welcome , after nearly a decade, of indie rockers a new hope "},{"url":null,"title":"more music in store for the wee toon","story":"On Wednesday, September  at .pm, well-known folksinger, entertainer and broadcaster Alastair McDonald will be in concert in Campbeltown Free Church.This will not be Alastair’s first visit to the Wee Toon.

His missionary work took him all over Scotland, including the coastline of the Forth. It is said his arrival at this small natural harbour gave the place its name.Last weekend, artist Andrew Crummy, who lives in the village, organised three lsquosunset eveningsrsquo at the Boat Shore. Local musicians, singers, artists and actors gathered on the beach with an audience of fellow locals to share the sunset.I sadly couldnrsquot attend the first two but was able to make the last evening with some of my children. It was a wonderful mix of music and song, with a very funny short drama, and a setting sun as the backdrop.It was a poignant evening for myself, and I know for some others too a moment of reflection as well as coming together. I had planned to tell a tale about St Kenneth, but I changed my mind just before the event.Instead, I told a tale of a friendship between a tortoise and a butterfly and what sunsets meant to them. In story, anything is possible, and I made this tale to help ease someonersquos sadness in experiencing an ending.I was later askedI could share it, and so here is the story:There was once a tortoise who became friends with a butterfly. On the first day of their friendship, the tortoise invited the butterfly to sit with him on his favourite rock, to watch the sunset.However, Butterfly had no idea what a sunset was, and so when she saw the sun fall gradually from the sky she became concerned.ldquoWhatrsquos happening to the sun  she asked in a worried tone.ldquoItrsquos the sunset, said Tortoise, ldquoitrsquos when the sun goes down and ends the day.ldquoWhat, already! Thatrsquos it  asked Butterfly, horried. ldquoThis is just my first day being a butterfly and my days are over Tortoise smiled: ldquoNo my wee friend, itrsquos not all over. The sun will come back and there will be another day.But Butterfly remained anxious: ldquoHow can you be sure the sun will come back ldquoTrust me, I know. Irsquove seen many sunsets, said Tortoise. ldquoThe sun always comes back. Sometimes it takes longer than others, sometimes you canrsquot see the sun because of clouds, but it always s and makes another day.Butterfly was now reassured and so settled down to watch, as the sun dipped lower, painting the sky. She expected the sun to sizzle and the sea to steam when they touched each other, but of course that didnrsquot happen. The sun slid quietly below the horizon, leaving a trail of bright red and orange.ldquoThat was beautul, wasnrsquot it  Tortoise said.But Butterflyrsquos reply was unexpected: ldquoI think I donrsquot like sunsets very much.Tortoise curled up the wrinkles on his old face in surprise: ldquoWhy not, donrsquot you think it was spectacular, the way it painted the sky ldquoSuppose, but it was sad, really sad, said Butterfly.ldquoSad ldquoYes, because the sunset ends the day and thatrsquos sad. Endings are sad.Tortoise nodded in a way tortoises do when theyrsquore thinking: ldquoYes thatrsquos true, endings can be sad. But everything ends sooner or later. Nothing lasts forever.ldquoBut thatrsquos what I mean Tortoise, itrsquos so sad. I donrsquot want to sit and celebrate the end of something.Tortoise thought for a moment: ldquoAlthough endings can be sad, they also give meaning and value to our time. Without sunsets we would not treasure our days. Our le would become one long blah of sameness.ldquoA blah of sameness ldquoYes, my expression, smiled Tortoise proudly.ldquoBut thatrsquos easy for you to say, Tortoise, because you have more time than me, you will have more days.ldquoPerhaps, but that means your time is more precious than mine. And your sunsets are greater celebrations of your days.Butterfly thought about this. ldquoYou seem quite wise, Tortoise, she said, looking at her friend.ldquoYes, he replied immodestly, ldquoI do have that reputation. I suppose I have a lot of time to think, sitting on this rock.It began to get dark and colder.ldquoNow itrsquos time for our dreams. Soon there will be the sunrise, said Tortoise.ldquoSunrise  Is that when the sun s Tortoise nodded: ldquoYes, you see you donrsquot get a sunrise without a sunset. Although endings can be sad, they open the door to new beginnings. At the other side of a sunset there is a sunrise.Tortoise was indeed wise and Butterfly felt reassured by his wisdom.That summer, the two friends watched many sunsets together. They would share stories about their day as the sun went down. Then one evening, as flocks of geese were flying overhead, Butterfly spoke sadly.ldquoTortoise, I need to go. Itrsquos getting cold. Irsquom off to Africa. Do you think there are sunsets there ldquoIrsquom sure of it, replied Tortoise.ldquoI love sunsets now, said Butterfly. ldquoThey have shown me to treasure and celebrate my days. But I am sad this is our last one together.ldquoMe too, said Tortoise.The two friends sat together on their rock as the sunset commemorated their summer with a blaze of colour. Then they said goodbye.A new dawn now lay ahead for them both, for the end of one story is the beginning of another.And at the other side of a goodbye, there is a hello."},{"url":null,"title":"pensioner-collided-schoolchildren-outside-musselburgh-grammar-school-avoids-driving-ban","story":"Ian Steedman, , had just collected two children from outside Musselburgh Grammar School when he lost control of his car and ploughed into the three teenage pupils.Steedman, of Edinburgh Road, Tranent, believed that his brakes had failed, causing him to strike the schoolchildren, but tests carried out later on his Honda Civic showed no problems with the braking system.The grandad, who owns Bisset  Steedman in Tranent, later realised he had got his foot stuck under the brake pedal, causing him to lose control of the car last November.Steedman had initially pleaded guilty to dangerous driving last month but changed his plea after seeking legal advice.He appeared at Edinburgh Sherf Court today , where he admitted an amended charge of careless driving by driving through a red light and colliding with three children and a vehicle at Musselburgh on November  last year.Fiscal depute Nicole Lavelle told the court that Steedman had collected a young relative and a friend from outside the school at about .pm before making his way onto the townrsquos Inveresk Road.Ms Lavelle said: ldquoAs the accused drove he became aware he could not stop his vehicle and he consequently drove onto the opposite carriageway to avoid two vehicles which had stopped at a red light.ldquoAs the -year-old boy passed halfway across the crossing, he was struck by the accusedlsquos vehicle, lting him up on to the bonnet.\"The vehicle also delivered a glancing blow to two others.ldquoThe accusedrsquos vehicle continued through the crossing and collided with the front near side of a car.The fiscal said two of the school pupils who were struck were  years old and the third was .Ms Lavelle added that the boy who landed on the bonnet of Steedmanrsquos car received a large gash to his upper leg after he ldquoended up between the two vehicles when they collided.Ms Lavelle said the boy then landed on the roadway and was rushed to Edinburgh Royal Infirmary for treatment he spent the night at the hospital.Steedman subsequently had his eyes tested by police officers and the court heard he had ldquoprovided a negative breath test following the incident.Defending solicitor Mary Moultrie said that her client had taken ldquoevasive action by pulling onto the opposite carriageway after realising he could not brake in time.Ms Moultrie added that Steedman ldquobelieved his brakes had failed at the time of the collision but afterwards realised he ldquomust have put his foot under the brake pedal.The lawyer said that Steedman had had a clean driving licence for the past  years and had been driving at a ldquovery low speed when he struck the three children.Ms Moultrie added: ldquoThis a genuine one-off, isolated incident that is very regrettable.Sherf Peter McCormack agreed and sentenced Steedman to a pound fine and placed six penalty points on his driving licence."},{"url":null,"title":"three-reports-hare-coursing-east-lothian-sunday","story":"One incident was reported near to Athelstaneford,another occurred in a field near to Gford Golf Club and a third report was received of a group of peopleseen within a field with dogs near to Lochhouses, Whitekirk.Police are keen to speak to anyone who saw a grey Nissan X-Trail and a blue Subaru Forrestereither parked up near to fields or possibly driving with lurcher dogs in the vehicle.On police attending the incident at Lochhouses, a vehicle drove off at speed and was soon lost to sight, having left three dogs running loose in the field.

One way we can fight back against ecological collapse is to have wilder, unmown, unsprayed spaces around us.

When the corn was eventually gathered in early September, it is said decaying corpses were discovered. They had lain in the fields since August , a day of barbaric infamy in Tranentrsquos history. The dead were victims of the Tranent Massacre, and one of the bodies may have been that of Jackie Crookston or Crookstone.I say lsquomayrsquo for there is ironically so little known about this well-known woman. A statue by David Annand of Jackie on Tranent High Street shows her beating her drum with a clenched fist, defiantly leading the protest against the Militia Act. The plaque by the statue calls her a ldquoresolute woman who joined the protest, and states she was one of those killed by the cavalry.Her heroic reputation is well established in local lore. The th-century historian John Martine called her ldquoa Tranent virago. This word describes a woman of brave, fearless qualities, but it has a sting in its tail. It can also be used to mean a woman who has overstepped her mark, broken cultural rules in relation to her role as defined by gender.And by leading the protest against the Militia Act she most certainly did this.Another th-century historian and collector of traditions, P. MrsquoNeill, was clear on her role: ldquoJackie indeed was the prime mover in the whole affair, he states.We have accounts of her beating her drum and leading the protest with chants of ldquonae militia. She is said to have threatened a captain of the cavalry and declared defiantly that ldquoshe didna care a pin though she were cut in halves, she wad hae nae militia. Another account has her telling a member of the yeomanry to leave or she would ldquothraw his neck, at which he duly rode off.If these accounts are true, she was indeed resolute on that day in defending her family, her neighbours and her community. Jackie was not the only woman on the streets that day, for women took a leading role in defending their families. But she was the most prominent, it seems.The Militia Act aimed to conscript young men into a militia by means of a ballot. It was resisted for a number of reasons, but for the poverty-stricken mining and farming communities of Tranent and the surrounding area, it was seen as an imposition which would take young men of working age away and potentially cripple their families economically.There is no space here to recount the details of the massacre, but much of what happened on that day remains hidden behind a mist of cover-up and official indference.And somewhere in the bloody carnage of August , , Jackie Crookston was killed, along with many others. Yet despite her leading role, her name was not included in the original list of people killed. Eleven deaths were recorded, but no mention of Jackie. ldquoHow her death escaped recording is dficult to explain, reflected P. MrsquoNeill in his book Tranent and its Surroundings.Perhaps an explanation can be found in an eyewitness account written immediately after the massacre. It was a letter from Archibald Roger to his we in Edinburgh.It begins: ldquoDear we, this comes to acquaint you that you need not weary for my ing home, for my sister is to be buried this afternoon at four orsquoclock, and I cannot come away till I see her decently interred. I am sorry to inform you of the cruelties that were committed here yesterday there were six persons shot dead on the spot, of which my sister was onehellip the number of wounded is not yet ascertained, but I am just now informed that  dead corpses were this morning found in the corn-fields and it is not known how many more may be found when the corn is cut.Was Jackie one of those lying undiscovered in a field  It seems so by some accounts. Is that why her death was not on the list  Sandy Mullay in his book The Tranent Massacre says she was shot in the streets, but there is also a tradition which states her body was found well away from Tranent much later in a field, with stab as well as gunshot wounds.Was she initially wounded and then a victim of later retribution  Was she hunted down in an unrecorded atrocity because of her role as ring leader, and a woman who didnrsquot know her place  She will have been easy to identy because of her prominence in the protest.Her death, just like her le, is unrecorded by history. Despite her leadership in the events, she was a woman and she was poor, and history lacks interest in such characters. A tax on the registration of births and deaths at this time meant many poor people lived and died unregistered even in parish records.So who was Jackie  We know she was born in Gladsmuir in June  and was a mother. Perhaps not all her children were registered because of the tax, but it seems she had at least four surviving at the time of the massacre. She was only  when she died, but how do we imagine her le  What was behind her passion in defending her community When I spoke of her to artist Mags Nisbet-Macfarlane, she was inspired to use art to search for the woman behind the historical glimpses.ldquoI felt connected to this woman I did not know, she told me, ldquoshe will have had a le that explains her defiance that day she had so little, but was protecting what was important to her. Magsrsquo image of Jackie tells a story without the need of words.The plaque by the statue in Tranent says there were  killed in the massacre, as Jackiersquos name has been added to the original . But in truth we will never know for sure how many were really killed and maimed that day.There was no prosecution of those responsible, no investigation and no interest by those in authority to allow the truth to be told."},{"url":null,"title":"new-dunbar-area-radio-station-hunt-volunteers","story":"Sescot Radio, previously known as Dunbar On Air, is looking to take to the airwaves and have the community at the heart of its programmes.Andrew Morris, who is behind the proposals, was keen to get people involved, whether that was on air or behind the scenes.He told the Courier: ldquoFirst of all, we are an internet radio station so our catchment area is all around the world.ldquoBut, from a common sense point of view, there is no physical radio covering from East Linton and Dunbar right down the coast to Burnmouth and along to Kelso wersquove got a triangle.ldquoIrsquom keen that these little places that have got two or three cottages are just as involved.ldquoWhat we are doing is covering Eyemouth, Dunbar and Kelso but we donrsquot want to preclude these folk either.ldquoWe want to involve everybody and preclude nobody.Already, the fledgling station has been out in the community and got involved with Dunbar Civic Week earlier this summer.Mr Morris was keen to see the radio station cater to as large an audience as possible.The -year-old was previously involved with both East Coast FM in Haddington and Tranent-based East Lothian FM, which is now Radio Saltire.He told the Courier that he had interviewed a number of East Lothian councillors on air but the focus was firmly away from politics and instead looked at a number of dferent topics.That was something he was keen to consider repeating, with other shows looking at ious genres of music, as well as cooking shows.As well as music, the station would promote local good causes and encourage involvement from schools, charities, clubs and other organisations.Now, Mr Morris, who lives on Dunbarrsquos John Muir Crescent, is calling on members of the public to come forward and offer a helping hand to get the station off the ground.A meeting takes place at Hallhill Sports Centre in Dunbar on Wednesday evening.Mr Morris said: ldquoWe are progressing but a lot slower than I hoped.ldquoWe have got ious applications out for grant money and have been awarded some but we need a lot more before we think about buying the gear that we need.ldquoWe are also anxious to find some suitable premises.In-house training will be provided at the station, which will be run entirely by volunteers.The station also intends to offer work experience opportunities for those looking to find their way into a career in the media.The meeting takes place at pm, when members of the public will be updated on the stationrsquos progress."},{"url":null,"title":"up-and-coming-band-go-first-scottish-tour","story":"Johnny Brown and the Devanties, made up of frontman Johnny Brown, , Erin Ritchie, , Andrew Dobie, , and Struan Blacklock, , will be heading to Aberdeen at the start of next month on the first gig of their headline tour.Johnny told the Courier: ldquoIrsquove been singing and writing music since I was about  years old.ldquoI knew the tour manager for The View so ended up playing a few gigs with them.ldquoIrsquove played the EH festival and once I had the chance to play with Republica.ldquoIn January I reconnected with a few people I went to school with through the music scene and we decided to form the band.ldquoWersquove released one single and our next one, Streetlights, will be released after the tour.Johnny of Edinburgh Road, Cockenzie, met his fellow bandmates while at Preston Lodge High School.He said: ldquoWe had to make sure that we were able to sell out shows before we knew we could tour.ldquoWe sold out about seven gigs in a row, so thatrsquos when we thought we should give it a go.The bandrsquos first single, Brooklyn, was released just after they were first formed in January and garnered good reviews, in particular from Discover Music, Scotlandrsquos Music Blog.As to the future, Johnny said: ldquoWersquore hoping our tour and our new single will do really well, hopefully itrsquoll help us break through.

Other types of so-called surface waves decay more quickly and travel in multiple directions.Dr Tom Mackay, of the University of Edinburghrsquos School of Mathematics, who jointly led the study, said: ldquoDyakonov-Voigt waves represent a step forward in our understanding of how light interacts with complex materials, and offer opportunities for a range of technological advancements.The team identied the wavesrsquo unique properties using mathematical models that incorporated equations developed by Maxwell.Since the mid-s, research on how light interacts with crystals has built on the work of the physicist, who helped to lay the foundations for fields such as special relativity and quantum mechanics.Born in , Maxwell was the son of an Edinburgh advocate.When Maxwell was a child, the family moved to Dumfriesshire when they inherited Middlebie Estate.One early tutor is said to have claimed that he was slow at learning, however he went on to study at the Edinburgh Academy, with his first scientic paper being published at the age of .He then went on to the University of Edinburgh and later Cambridge, where he was presented with the prestigious Smithrsquos Prize.In , Maxwell was elected to a fellowship at Trinity College, but he chose toto Scotland sue to his Fatherrsquos ill-health.He later developed his theory of electromagnetism, which showed that light was electromagnetic radiation. The theory is considered to have paved the way for both quantum mechanics and Einsteinrsquos theory of special relativity.Maxwell died in  after developing abdominal cancer, the disease which had killed his mother  years earlier.The Dyakonov-Voigt study, published in the Royal Societyrsquos physical sciences research journal, was funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council and the US National Science Foundation."},{"url":null,"title":"exhibition-reveal-work-golden-age-horology","story":"In candlelit workshops using precious metals and the cutting-edge technology of the age, they brought time to le in watches and clocks that became status symbols for the rich and showcased their remarkable technical skills.Now the art and skill of the earliest clock and watchmakers will be celebrated in an exhibition which draws together a prized collection of dazzling timepieces featuring intricately engraved patterns and inscriptions, grand clocks and elegant designs with such complex workings that itrsquos hard to believe they are four centuries old and still working.The exquisite timepieces come from the private collection of Dr John C Taylor ndash a prolic inventor whose creations include a thermostat control for use with electric kettles, a device which is reckoned to be used more than a billion times a day around the world.Among the most fascinating pieces in the exhibition, The Luxury of Time: Clocks from  to , will be two highly decorated watches made by Fe-born pioneering watchmaker David Ramsay, Royal Clockmaker to King James VI and the first master of the Worshipful Company of Clockmakers, founded in .One is a striking silver gilt-metal astronomical watch dating from around  and featuring a detailed engraving of the King which, given Ramsayrsquos royal connection, is thought to have been presented to a loyal follower as a sign of the monarchrsquos deep affection.As well as telling the time, the watch features a zodiac clock and shows the phases of the Moon.The other, an intricately engraved oval watch, features a backplate bearing the words ldquoDavid Ramsay Scotus me fecit, reflecting the makerrsquos pride in his Scottish heritage.According to Dr Tacye Phillipson, senior curator of science at National Museums Scotland, the exhibition will highlight the skill of early watch and clockmakers, who combined scientic understanding of the passage of time and its connection to the universe with an eye for design and undeniable skill.She said: ldquoOne thing that stands out is how heavily engraved some of the watches are. They really do have that lsquoblingrsquo factor. ldquoThese were watches that were not made to be hidden away in a pocket.ldquoThey were worn as jewellery ndash rather like todayrsquos watches.ldquoThe exhibition challenges our assumptions about how clocks and watches were once used.It will include  objects which demonstrate the early age of British clock and watchmaking, when owning a timepiece made of precious metal was considered the ultimate status symbol and only affordable for the very rich.Before the th century, clock and watchmaking was primarily the domain of mainland European makers, many of whom had fled to Britain to escape religious persecution.Ramsay initially worked as a goldsmith in St Andrews before learning the art of watch and clockmaking in France.He is said to have been summoned to London by James VI, where he was appointed Page of the Bedchamber and Groom of the Privy Chamber, as well as Keeper of all His Majestyrsquos Clocks and Watches.ldquoIt appears that a mixture of his clockmaking skills and the politics of James VI looking to surround himself with Scots led to his appointment as Page of the Bedchamber, said Dr Phillipson.ldquoThe job description suggests rather menial work but it was a hugely important political role and meant he had direct access to the King.ldquoWhenever he wanted to escape his Privy Council, he would go to his bedchamber, where he surrounded himself with Scots.While th-century watch and clockmakers often worked in silver and gold, most pieces were melted down and their cases recycled, meaning that precious few remain from the era.The exhibition, which will open at the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh early next month, will focus on how the horologistrsquos skill and art developed, telling the story of the scientic and technical advances during periods of extreme turmoil.Examples range from early wrought iron clocks made by blacksmiths to the invention of the pendulum clock and the balance spring which improved accuracy to within a few seconds a day.It will also spotlight some of the collaborations between important makers, and the first example of mass-produced watches, made in the early th century by Thomas Tompion, the ldquoFather of English Clockmaking, who used subcontractors to make the parts and movements of his watches.They were then completed in his workshop by a team of apprentices, with around , eventually rolling off his production line.Despite their grand age, most of the timepieces in the display are in working order and there are plans to show some in operation at selected periods during the exhibition.Dr Taylor is said to have become fascinated with watches while watching his father take one apart and rebuild it at the family dining table.He conceived and funded several public clocks, including the Corpus Clock on the outside of the Taylor Library at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge University, which has no hands or numerals and instead shows the time by opening gaps in the clock face.Dr Phillipson said: ldquoClocks and watches were the first manufactured mechanical objects and itrsquos great to show some early examples in the National Museum of Scotland. ldquoThe innovation produced by these wonderful articles initiated the necessity to protect the intellectual property behind their development ndash something that we take for granted today."},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-sturgeon-launches-bid-get-drivers-take-bus","story":"The First Minister made a ldquoScottish green deal the centrepiece of

This programme is an important part of our response to the climate emergency, containing measures which will reduce emissions while supporting sustainable and inclusive growth.ldquoIt sets out actions which will make a dference for years to come. It meets the challenges of the future, while staying true to our enduring values.The Scottish Greens said the programme was a ldquocheap imitation of their own plans for a new Green Deal to put carbon reduction at the heart of Scotlandrsquos economy.MSP Patrick Harvie said: ldquoMs Sturgeonrsquos version lacks the ambition, scale and courage required of an emergency response.ldquoWe welcome her adoption of the idea that the Scottish Investment Bank should prioritise the climate emergency, but the funding is limited.ldquoThis is not system change. The Scottish Government also seem infatuated with consumer choice and unproven technologies that apparently promise a quick fix - carbon capture and storage, electric aeroplanes and hydrogen trains ndash yet the technology we need to solve the climate crisis is already here.Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said he welcomed climate change being ldquowoven into every aspect of government.Dr Richard Dixon of Friends of the Earth Scotland said: ldquoThis package includes some very welcome commitments but is not nearly enough to address the desperate climate emergency the world is facing.ldquoThe obvious contradiction at the heart of this Programme is its commitment to some new measures in transport, heating and agriculture while continuing to back the offshore oil and gas industry to keep on drilling and destroying our climate.David Liddell, CEO of the Scottish Drugs Forum, said the pound extra for treatment services would be welcomed across the drugs field.He said: ldquoFor decades drug treatment services have operated as Cinderella services.

Its CEO is Shona McLennan, who explains that like many minority languages Gaelic has been in decline, but the mission of Bograverd na Gagraveidhlig is to promote Gaelic language, Gaelic education, and Gaelic culture with a view to reinvigorating the language.ldquoOne of the most effective ways to do this is to provide education in the medium of the language, says Shona. ldquoAlongside education in the language, pupils also need opportunities to use it outside of the classroom. You need activity around the learning such as sports activities, arts and music.As Jim Whannel, Board Member of Bograverd na Gagraveidhlig and Oraidiche Teaching Fellowat the University of Edinburgh, explains, parents in Scotland are fortunate to have an education system where, from Primary One, they can choose education through the medium of Gaelic or the medium of English.ldquoItrsquos a choice that is available in a large number of authorities, he says. ldquoWhen parents make the choice of the Gaelic medium, they will educate a child in two languages. Itrsquos not an issuethe family doesnt have Gaelic, because theres an immersion programme and something in region of % of the children being taught in the Gaelic medium in Glasgow and Edinburgh come from homes where it isnrsquot spoken.There is also criticism levelled that Gaelic learning and education is for the middle-classes, the elite. Again, the figures extinguish that myth.ldquoThe Glasgow Gaelic School Sgoil Ghagraveidhlig Ghlaschu has a very mixed intake, adds Shona McLennan. ldquoIt serves a very broad community in the city. Itrsquos also one of the highest performing state schools in Scotland.Monolingualism isnrsquot the norm across most of the world, and the benefits of being bilingual or multilingual are well-known , but what is emerging is the solid cognitive benefits to learning other languages, but more importantly using other languages.Thomas Bak is a Reader in Psychology at the University of Edinburgh, with particular interest in the interaction between bilingualism and cognitive s, particularly in diseases such as dementia or stroke.Among the many studies he has conducted was one to test whether there can be improvement in cognitiveby learning a new language.ldquoWe needed to test before and after, he says. ldquoWe compared those learning a language with those learning another subject such as history. We looked at attention switching, counting numbers up and down and after a year there was no dferent but after four years there was a marked dference, with the language students performing better.Thomas also saw this in intensive language courses, when he went to the Gaelic college on Skye, Sabhal Mograver Ostaig and tested students at the beginning and end of the course.ldquoWe saw that one week is enough to improve performance, but it needs to be maintained by five or more hours a week in practice using the language. Those who didnrsquot maintain it, went back to their original performance.Thomas adds that the language itself is irrelevant. ldquoWhat is relevant to Gaelic, however, is that the cognitive advantages are not dependent on the number of speakers. One argument commonly used against Gaelic. Is that itrsquos a small language and most speak English anyway.ldquoIf we look at the analogy of going to the gym, that does us good. Thatrsquos learning the language. However,we drive there rather than cycle or walk, it does us less good. The walking and cycling are using that language.Jim Whannel sees bilingualism as an opportunity to have a more global view and rather than Gaelic medium education being insular, itrsquos actually English medium education which is more closed off.ldquoIn Scotland we have this fantastic opportunity to validate and promote an indigenous culture along with English language culture.Of course there are benefits the learning the language without that immersion. The increased awareness of the language from a young age and understanding can often translate into a desire to carry on and learn more as an adult.As Shona McLennan explains there are still challenges. ldquoLike teaching in English-medium there is a shortage of teachers.

For an insight we spoke to Matthew Clark, Regional Director of Orion Grouprsquos Permanent and Interim recruitment isions in the UK and also Managing Director of its specialist Executive Search ision.Q: Could you give us an insight into the process of recruiting at ious levels for organisations ldquoThe first thing we do is ensure that we meet the hiring manager and the key decision makers within the organisation to map out the skillsets and experience required for each role. Itrsquos very important that we get a full understanding of the job brief before we do anything and itrsquos also equally important that we get under the skin of the company to get a real feel for the culture. At this stage, itrsquos also important to rein in and manage expectations. Itrsquos a highly candidate driven market at the moment and candidates are more passive in their job search than they ever have been. The perfect candidate who ticks all the boxes is extremely rare or is very dficult to engage and attract. We work out the lsquomust-haversquo attributes, then begin the work to find candidates that match the desired specication.Whenever possible and depending upon the type of business we are recruiting for, there are occasions when we will spend a day on site with the employer which enables us to be a true partner when searching for senior iniduals to join their business.\"Given the seniority of roles at executive level, there is often a high level of business sensitivity surrounding each assignment. This can lead to the recruitment process being highly confidential for a iety of reasons. There have been many cases when we havenrsquot been in a position to disclose the name of the employer until the very last minute, perhaps once the candidate has been invited for interview. At this stage we would ask each candidate to sign a non-disclosure agreement in order to protect confidentiality but generally a fair amount of discretion is required from all concerned and senior candidates too expect their application to be treated with the very strictest of confidence.\"Our conversations with the organisation before we commence any assignment can also involve salary benchmarking to assess how competitive their salary and benefits package is in comparison to other similar roles or their competitors.\" Matthew Clark, Regional Director of Orion Grouprsquos Permanent and Interim recruitment isions in the UKQ: What would the starting point for a targeted headhunt be \"The starting point is for us to work in close partnership with our resourcing team and the employer organisation to map out the candidate marketplace and discuss and agree specic target organisations where specic candidates will be working at the moment. It is also key that the candidates we headhunt generally have very specic experience and are obviously at the required level of seniority for the role that we are recruiting.\"Our extensive networks we have built up over the last  years allow us to source candidate recommendations from people we trust. This is what dferentiates us. After that the traditional methods of active database searches and job boards would also be employed to ensure that all sources have been fully utilised.\"Q: Are there certain criteria that you look for in senior candidates \"The obvious one is leadership qualities and we also look for positivity and a can-do attitude, backed by experience ndash that can be a powerful combination.The chance for candidates to increase their earning potential and progress their career needs to be also matched by their desire to embrace the challenge thatrsquos on offer. No matter what business discipline the role falls under it is generally always a key pre-requisite that senior candidates have a wealth of PL management. Undoubtedly, senior candidates must have the necessary gravitas and credibility to lead and influence their people. Itrsquos also vital that they have a proven track record and an ability to drive change, as this can very often be the key reason why they are being brought in to do the role.\"Q: How do you go about identying or assessing exceptional talent in candidates \"Technology has advanced but the ldquohuman element of physically meeting each candidate always has and always will be the best way to assess how talented and experienced an inidual is. As part of the executive search process we often use psychometric assessments or personality profiling to probe deeper into an inidualrsquos capability and behaviours. Before we start each assignment, we also discuss a range of key questions or competency based interview questions with the employer so that we can really draw out exactly what strengths they are looking for from each candidate.\"Q: What additional tools are available on the market to facilitate and support recruitment assignments \"The emergence of ious technologies in our industry has been amazing over the last few years. Robotics and automation are making a meaningful impact in the field of recruitment and there are certain parts of the recruitment process that lend themselves to automation. Articial Intelligentrecruitment software is being talked about a great deal at the moment and is perhaps worth considering for certain recruitment processes and for certain roles. I get contacted every other day about all sorts of new and emerging technology products and recruitment software, the most common being video interviewing software. There are some really great video interviewing tools on the market at the moment and it can be a very useful tool to further assess candidates at the front end of the recruitment process. Again, some instances of use are better than others and not every candidate is comfortable answering questions in front of the camera!\"NURTURING TALENTOrion Group also goes to great s to nurture talent within its own business and also look after staff wellbeing. Over the Grouprsquos  year history, there has been substantial changes in the workplace, particularly when it comes to positive mental health and well-being at work, so Employee Welfare management is an area that Orion has been investing in. ldquoIf our employees are happy, they will be productive, but that can only be achieved by treating them well, adds Mr Clark. ldquoIf we succeed at this as an organisation, we can be of greater help in advising clients on what they can do to retain employees.Studies have shown that the more inclusive and erse a company is, the greater potential for success. The wider a company spreads the net across age, genders, religious beliefs, and race, the better they perform, as the best minds and values propel these companies to the top of their industries.ldquoOrion Grouprsquos own mental health study has shown that we are typically very happy with our working environment, adds Mr Clark.As in any high-pressure workplace, managing time and meeting deadlines are consistent forms of pressure but with high levels of self-direction, work satisfaction, and consultation there is strong support for Orion Group to continue promoting mental wellbeing.An encouraging figure of more than % of employees at Orion believe that colleagues and management would provide supportthey had problems with mental health.Of course there are improvements to be made and Orion is continuing the promotion of mental wellbeing, with a working group set up to represent all UK offices. This can be done in relatively simple ways such as promoting policies where there are low levels of awareness.This can be advice on workstation health or making sure that employees know about perks such as the AON discount scheme. It can also make more effort to ensure that available support is much more visible. Reviewing flexible working arrangements is important, as is making sure that employees have support on managing time and deadlines.ldquoHealthy employees work better, says Linda Dickson, Group HR Director at Labeyrie Food Group ldquoit is well recognised that breaks and taking part in other activities help people to achieve their potential.ldquoMore is expected of employers in terms of flexible working hours and welfare at work - and looking at LinkedIn and Glassdoor we have seen that employees are happy to share the positive experiences they have had at Orion Group.A key to retention, Orion believes, is role validation. Managing career paths and providing career management for clients and candidates over the long term.ldquoWe do things dferently at Orion. The flat management structure drives a collaborative, team culture, adds Michael Downes, Divisional Manager for Orion Groups Procurement and Supply Chain ision.ldquoWe also learned from our beginnings in the oil and engineering industry. Contractors would work with us for many years, so we built relationships with oil majors who would keep coming back for more people. We have used what we learned at that time in the expansion into Permanent, Interim, and Executive Search."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-city-council-allow-two-irish-republican-parades-govan-riot","story":"The council decided after police advice not to overturn the decision to permit the parades.Police said that they would still need the same amount of officers on standby at the locations in case people turned up anyway.The decision follows violent scenes last Friday in Govan as loyalist protesters disrupted an Irish Unity march by the James Connolly Flute Band.Police in riot gear had to keep factions separate and bins were set alight.Following the trouble the police provided updated advice on the two upcoming parades yesterday to the City Council.Annemarie ODonnell, Glasgow City Council ChiefExecutive, met last night and today with the organisers of the two parades and with police to discus the latest advice before the council reached a decision.Ms OrsquoDonnell, said: ldquoThe scenes we saw in Govan on Friday were a disgrace and they must not be repeated.

The society now also delivers animal welfare educational programmes, reaching more than , children in .So it’s fair to say that it has come a long way in the last  years.But for all the successes, there are also new issues it has to face – not least thanks to the advent of the internet.Mike explained: “For years, we have looked after all of Scotland’s animals – wild, farm and domestic.“Farming has come on leaps and bounds in the last few decades and we now have very few problems in the industry.“When I was a kid growing up, you used to have pet shops selling cats, dogs, budgies and the like.“Now, thanks to the internet, people have far more exotic animals in their care which all of our inspectors need to know how to care for and handle – from bearded dragons to massive boa constrictors!“We also have to contend with puppy farmers plying their trade online and selling puppies from car boots.“Some of the puppies die within a few days of people buying them, having paid a lot of money for the animal and thousands on vet fees.“Sadly, we also still see things that I saw  years ago such as Dobermans with every rib on their body sticking out.“However, thanks to our education programme, we are reaching the children of today who will be the animal lovers of the future.“And the majority of people our inspectors visit are not harming animals for fun – it’s a case of ignorance and neglect. In those cases, we’re not just helping the animals, but humans too.“Only five to ten per cent of cases every year are intentional cruelty. So Scotland is still a nation which, in the main, loves and cares for its animals.”That care and concern shines through as the public helps fund the SSPCA’s £ million budget annually.That covers the cost of  employees, including  inspectors,  ambulance drivers and the -strong team based at its nine centres across Scotland and its widle sanctuary.The society receives no government funding and relies solely on the public to fund its work.Mike added: “We are really lucky that, from a population of five and a half million, only  people were prosecuted last year for animal cruelty.“We will never be out of a job but the vast majority of people in Scotland are law abiding and animal loving.“And we couldn’t do what we do without their support.”In December, the Society plans to launch celebrations to commemorate the th anniversary that will run throughout .Anyone with interesting anecdotes or memorabilia they’d like to share should get in touch via its website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.The SSPCA is the only animal charity in the UK able to report animal cruelty cases to the Crown, with reports sent to the Procurator Fiscal Service. The charity receives no government funding and relies on donations and grants to continue its work, which costs £ million each year.In , it found homes for  rescued animals, helped more than  wildle casualties and spoke to more than , children.For every pound it receives, p is spent on animal welfare, p on fundraising and promotion and p on administration.So you can rest assured that the bulk of any donation you make will make a huge dference to the animals in the SSPCA’s care.Last year, its animal helpline received almost a quarter of a million calls, the inspectorate attended more than , incidents and more than , animals were cared for across its nine rescue and rehoming centres and at the national wildle rescue centre.

Local charity the Blide Trust put a lot of work into ensuring the gardens are kept up to a high standard and are a peaceful and welcoming place to relax and rewind in. Sadly, there seems to be an ongoing problem of anti-social behaviour in the gardens.“If people hear or see something and are concerned, please noty the police immediately.

The devices were first introduced in Tayside in June this year and they were subsequently introduced in the North East in July.The mobiles will provide apps enabling officers carry out checks and file crime reports. Officers will also be able to type statements directly to the device through the use of its digital notebookPronto which will obtain an electronic signature from victims and witnesses.Chief Superintendent George Macdonald, Highland and Islands isional commander, said: #The introduction of mobile technology is a major milestone which will positively enhance the operational policing approach in the Highland and Islands.#Over the last two years, we have seen a signicant investment and upgrade in our IT systems to enable us to take advantage of technology.#Given the geography of the area, officers do incur signicant travel time between calls and their stations, the mobile device will allow officers to be more visible in the community, spend more time on patrol and hopefully be more accessible within the areas they serve.#Members of the public will see police officers operating their mobile device in public areas. It is important they understand they are not using their personal telephone and that they are working, but be reassured they will always be available to offer help, advice or assistanceneeded.#Cabinet Secretary for Justice, Humza Yousaf  is pleased that the Scottish Government has been able to help Police Scotland invest in new mobile technology, which he believes will enable officers to work in the heart of Scotland’s communities, providing reassurance and increasing their visibility.“This technology is enabling officers to become even more agile and responsive, ensuring the service is better-equipped to meet the modern-day demands upon it,# he said.#Being able to access information at their fingertips will improve the ability of officers in the Highlands and Islands to react promptly to a range of issues they encounter, enhancing the amount of time available to spend in the heart of their communities and keeping people safe.”Susan Deacon, Chair of the Scottish Police Authorityfeels that this is an important and much needed step forward.#The introduction of mobile working will bring real benefits to the police and the public and will make the police service more responsive, visible and efficient,# she explained.#Continued investment in technology is vital to ensure that policing in Scotland keeps pace with changing needs and demands. Communities across Scotland will be better protected as a result of these changes.#The £million Mobile Working Project which was part funded by the Scottish Government’s capital budget allocation will see approximately , of Police Scotland’s unormed officers issued with mobile devices by spring .The devices will be further enhanced over time with the addition of future policing applications, including national systems as they become available.Last year, Police Scotland produced a business case for a major investment in digital, data and ICT over  years to modernise the service. The proposed investment would also generate savings and public service improvements for the wider criminal justice system justice system.David Wallace, BT’s public sector director in Scotland and chair of the BT board in Scotland, said: “We’re pleased to be leading this project, bringing in our EE mobile network – the largest G network in the UK – and our unrivalled resources to help Police Scotland transform the way they work.“By helping our customers take advantage of BT’s investments in innovations and networking, including our launch of G in Scotland, we’ll see opportunities we couldn’t imagine ten years ago come into our lives.”Norman Dixon, Motorola Solutions# Account Director for Scotland added: “The Pronto mobile application replaces the paper notebook and modernises police workflows by giving them access to databases and tools on their mobile device on the beat. It is a world-leading mobile solution for policing. It was developed here in Scotland in partnership with the police service, so it is fantastic to see that it will become available to , Police Scotland officers.“We look forward to working with Police Scotland and are proud to be part of this major milestone in mobile police technology.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Craig Clouston and Callan Jessiman were tasked with anchoring the midfield for Hotspurs, while Rovers lined up in a --, spearheaded by Steven Tulloch and Zack Singh.The opening stages were cagey, as the two teams felt each out. The big talking point of the opening half hour was an agricultural challenge by Scott Drever in the Rovers midfield. He went over the top of the ball on Jordan Low in the middle of the park, an offence referee Mike Cursiter saw fit to issue a caution to the midfielder, with Hotspurs looking for a red.Aiden Drever saw a free-kick go narrowly wide of Davy Leonard#s post after  minutes, while Tulloch might have done better with a half chance just before the half-time whistle. A driven ball from Graeme Horne on the left was nodded on by Singh, but the veteran Rovers striker couldn#t direct his header on target, with Hotspurs appealing for an offside flag.The match remained goalless at the break, with neither team having really got going.The match was soon to kick into le in the second half. After  minutes, Rovers ‘keeper Liam Valentine made a hash of a clearance, booting the ball against Spurs striker Jerry McBeth. With the goal gaping, the Hotspurs striker was just about to pull the trigger when he was tripped by Valentine.Cursiter awarded the free-kick, and after a long consultation with his linesman, deemed the challenge worthy of a yellow card only, despite the protestations of the away side. Joe Wilson#s effort from the set piece was tipped wide by the ‘keeper.Just before the hour mark, Rovers saw their best chance come and go. A long ball found Connan Rendall on the right, who controlled it wonderfully before shuffling inside to the edge of the box. His drilled effort looked every inch a goal until Leonard flung himself down to his left to tip it round the post.Moments later, the breakthrough was to come at the other end, as the match swung from end-to-end.Aiden Drever was penalised for a foul on Logan Peace wide on Hotspurs left. The free-kick was flighted in but cleared out to Joe Wilson. His cross back in found Hotspurs legend Wayne Monkman at the back post, whose header floated over the stranded Valentine for the opening goal. Could Monkman#s goal be the fairytale ending for the defender on his final Hotspurs appearance Rovers now needed to score twice in the last  minutes to win the title, but in truth they found a well-marshalled away defence dficult to break down. Hotspurs had the bit between their teeth, with a first ‘A’ League title since  now tantalisingly close.The hosts# task was made even more challenging when Aiden Drever was sent off for two bookings in quick succession with  minutes to go. From there, Hotspurs saw out the game relatively comfortably.In the th minute, Valentine got caught underneath a high ball into the box, dropping it at the feet of substitute Jack Paterson. As the sub tried to get a shot away, he was impeded by the Rovers goalie, who saw his second yellow card of the evening to ensure his side would finish with nine men.Seventeen-year-old midfielder Jessiman stepped up to coolly slot away the resultant penalty, ensuring Hotspurs would win the  ‘A’ League, and sparking scenes of delight amongst their support on the sidelines.OAFA president Colin MacLeod paid tribute to both sides for a hard-fought league campaign after the match, and invited up Hotspurs skipper Keith Harcus to receive the Brough Cup for his side.Harcus — standing in for the injured Owen Rendall — paid tribute to his centre-back partner Monkman who is set to bow out of domestic football as an ‘A’ League champion and urged his teammates not to go another  years before landing the biggest prize in domestic football.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

There was a time when most of us had no doubt at all about what we should or should not do. We were told what was done or not done. There were Commandments. There were oaths administered by the scouting and guiding movements. There were role models to look up to. There was the expectation that politicians who lied were expected to fall upon their swords, or at least resign. Today, serial mendacity in a politician seems to be disregarded – indeed it might even propel one into high office. Remember Mr Profumo, who after uttering one untruth went off in voluntary exile to do good works in the East End of London for decades before he was welcomed back into respectable society. His exclusion today would be for an afternoon – at the most. O tempora, o mores is the muttered refrain of those who observe how things have changed.And yet, in spite of this seismic sht in the landscape of public le, there are still subtle moral issues that confront us in the leading of our day-to-day lives. One of these is the question of how far we should restrain ourselves in our curiosity as to how our friends and neighbours conduct their lives. How others live is, after all, a subject of abiding interest to most of us, and yet at the same time we are usually aware of at least some restraints on how much we should try to find out about others.: Alexander McCall Smith: Forget Brexit, we should argue about this insteadFor unlimited access to Scotland’s best news, sport and expert analysis, SUBSCRIBE to The Scotsman website hereTake the case of conversations in a restaurant or coffee bar. Should you listen to what is being said at neighbouring tables, or should you deliberately close your ears to conversations to which you have not been formally admitted  These conversations are often fascinating, andyou are by yourself at a table, then the temptation to listen is in almost irresistible. And yet that is an act of intrusion – a form of eavesdropping, which is generally regarded as unacceptable. If one would not listen at a keyhole, then surely the same must be said for other situations where one attempts to hear what is being said.The dference, of course, might lie in implicit consent. If you conduct a conversation in a public place, then you might be said to consent to others hearing what you have to say. Indeed, an argument might be made to the effect that it is wrong to conduct any form of sensitive conversation in public as you have no means of knowing whether those about you actually want to hear what you have to say.A iation on this is the mobile phone conversation. The frustrating thing about such conversations is that we overhear only one side, and again it is not the eavesdropper who is being rude – it is the person on the phone who is showing discourtesy. The polite thing – indeed the right thing – to doyou are having a telephone conversation in public, is to switch to speakerphone mode so that those about you can hear what the other person is saying. Quiet coaches are all very well, but there is a strong case for noisy coaches too, in which those using their mobiles would be obliged to plug them into a public address system so that everyone in the coach can hear both sides of the conversation. That, in my view, is common courtesy.Now for a tricky one. In Edinburgh, where we have a very advanced recycling culture, every householder is given a blue plastic box into which empty bottles and jars can be put out for collection. These come with a frilly plastic cover that can be stretched out over the top of the box, thereby making it impossible for prying eyes to see what is inside. In reality, most people lose these quickly and therefore put out their boxes without any cover. That means thatyou walk along the street you can see exactly what your neighbours have been drinking. This is very interesting information – irresistible to most . But it really is very interesting to count the number of whisky bottles or check up on the vintage of the recycled bottles. And champagne ... who would imagine that so much champagne is consumed in the EH postal code  However, most of the empty bottles I have seen have been very cheap brands.As to other bins left out by neighbours, some people like to look into the food recycling bins that the council provides. Again, that is not something that should be countenanced. Food waste is private, and it is no business of ours what other people consume, fascinating though it may be. Of course that recycling effort is particularly laudable, and those councils – such as Edinburgh – that provide that facility deserve the highest praise. Many people do not know, of course, that the waste in those little grey bins is taken off to a secret council location and processed into food for students. Students don’t know that, I believe, but I am sure that they would be unlikely to object. After all, those who were students some time ago remember the rubbish we ate and it is hard to imagine that this reprocessed food waste is any worse. In fact, it might be healthier. Looking into the recycling bins of neighbours is undoubtedly an unacceptable intrusion, on a par, perhaps, with the reading of people’s postcards. Hold on, you say – a postcard is specically designed not to be confidential: it is an inherently open communication. I am not convinced of that. Admire the picture, yes, but do not read what is written on the other side, or,you must, give it only the quickest of glances.The moral le is not simple. However, nobody can go wrongthey accept the principle of Kant’s Categorical Imperative. That is an idea that has been recycled many times, but remains as powerful today as it was when Kant first recycled it. More of that another time – or times perhaps. ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"an incredible man tributes pour in for lifesaving edinburgh neonatal doctor","story":"Gopi Menon, was a consultant paediatrician specialising in intensive care of the newborn, looking after premature children in the lothians for  years.

The Government remains eager to ensure the UK’s exit from the EU by October . Oppositions parties are eager to ensure this does not happen in a no deal scenario. But developments at Westminster mean an election at some point soon is almost certain. The key question, therefore, what might the outcome of such an election be in such unpredictable times We have considered the results across  polls conducted between November   and August  .All polls contain a combination of information and noise, the latter resulting from errors in sampling, in interviewing and in other factors which are an inherent part of survey methodology. By “pooling the polls” the figure maximises the information and minimises the noise because the samples are very large and rogue polls which happen by chance do not dominate the picture.Conservatives and LabourBoth Conservative and Labour support declined markedly in the run-up to the European parliament elections on May . Since then, Conservative fortunes have partially revived, but party support is only in the low % range – nearly % less than its vote in the  general election.Labour is in even worse shape, languishing in the low to mid-s.

So we are in uncharted territory.The major parties’ poll numbers indicate that, in a two-party contest, the apparent “Boris bounce” in Conservative vote intentions would very likely deliver a majority in the House of Commons.One important reason why Labour has fallen so far behind is the large decline in Jeremy Corbyn’s popularity since the  general election. His approval ratings then were around %. But by August this year they had fallen below % and are now very stable from one poll to the next. A large majority of voters appear to have reached the conclusion that he is not up to the job of being prime minister. Negative public feelings about Corbyn are bound to be a drag on his party’s efforts to close the gap with the Conservatives.Lib Dem ThreatThe real problem for the Conservatives is not Labour but the continuing popularity of the Liberal Democrats and the Brexit Party. The Liberal Democrats are now consistently polling in the high teens – twice what previously had been typical. In the  general election, the Liberal Democrats’ vote collapsed and the Conservatives took  seats from them. While the Liberal Democrats recovered a little in the subsequent  general election, they still only had  MPs.The situation has now completely changed. If the current surge in Liberal Democrat voting intentions holds, there is a good chance that the party will win back all of the seats it lost to the Conservatives in . In addition, the Lib Dems are likely to win extra seats from disgruntled Conservative Remainers who will defect in response to the Conservative’s hard-line stance on Brexit.It is true that the Liberal Democrats will take votes from Labour as well as the Conservatives, but the policy distance between the Lib Dems and Labour on relations with the EU is now much smaller than it is with the Conservatives. The danger for the Conservatives is that Remainers are likely to vote tactically as a result, supporting the Liberal Democrats in seats in the West Country, for example, and Labour in seats in the North-East and Merseyside.What of the Brexit Party There is a narrative which suggests that Brexit Party support will collapse in a forthcoming election much like UKIP’s did in . But this ignores a key dference between Brexit Party and Conservative supporters. In our national survey conducted shortly after the European elections, % of Brexit Party identiers wanted to leave the EU with no deal. This compared with only % of Conservative identiers who wanted this outcome.In a rally in London Nigel Farage committed his party to no deal. He was quick to point out that Johnson had voted for Theresa May’s agreement when it came up for a third time in parliament – and was therefore not to be trusted. The prime minister is taking a very hard line against Conservative rebels by threatening to remove the whip from them, but at the same time he is arguing that he wants a deal with the EU – something which is an anathema to the Brexit party supporters.This lack of trust in the prime minister to deliver a no-deal Brexit puts him in a tricky situation – he needs most of the Brexit Party supporters to produce a no-deal outcome. Given his insistence that he is still seeking a deal with Brussels, Johnson is unlikely to win Brexit Party voters until there is actually a no-deal Brexit.The Brexit Party will not take seats in a snap election, but it could easily stymie the Conservatives’ chances of winning.The prime minister has had to seek an early election since the alternative was to stagger on without a majority and with parliamentary action to stop a no-deal Brexit becoming a reality. The campaign hasn’t formally begun yet, but the posturing is underway. The outcome, though, remains very dficult to predict.Paul Whiteley is Professor, Department of Government, University of Essex.

Peter Morrison and bass player Innes Hutton from Braes # the two constants in the line-up # were joined by Davie Tait, Ali Pentland and Alan Edmunds.Pubs and village hall dances became their early staple, but gradually more adventurous elements crept into their set and the audiences lapped it up.Morrison recalled: #We#d bring in a blues or a reggae sound, and we found it was these things that started to go down best with audiences.#We moved to more of a world music sound around about , but we never expected much to come of it. We were just out to play at pubs and parties and have a bit of fun#.Their first tape # the #Great Ceilidh Swindle# # sold well locally and paid for a demo in Edinburgh, which in turn caught the ear of Greentrax Records, the specialist label in Scottish traditional music.With bands like Shooglenty and Martyn Bennett also arriving on the scene it proved a perfect time to be breaking new ground and the Peatbog Faeries# debut album #Mellowsity# would stay in Greentrax#s top ten for the next decade-and-a-half.Morrison remembers: #Because of our size and sound, bands like us and Shooglenty cost a lot more to record than other folk bands at the time. So there was a worry at the start.#But as soon as we signed to Greentrax, we quite quickly got an agent and we got sought-after slots at Glastonbury, Nomad and Celtic Connections.#We didn#t really notice what was happening, in a way # it felt like one day we were playing in the pub, the next day playing in front of thousands.#There weren#t that many precedents for bands like ours. Most folk bands just played in pubs. There were some accordion bands that were full-time or groups like #Silly Wizard#, but for us coming out of Skye we never thought it would turn into a full-time occupation.#We just went with the flow and luckily for us it proved a lot more popular than we thought it would be.#The band#s line-up has changed several times, and in turn, each addition helped explore new sounds # the most dramatic sht coming when Rick Taylor and Nigel Hitchcock arrived on Skye in the s to add a three-piece brass section.Taylor # who passed away earlier this year # was a revered musician who had toured with Elton John, while in recent years the Peatbog#s fiddler Peter Tickell left the group to take to the road with Sting.The current scaled-back line-up has seen Morrison and Hutton joined by Edinburgh-based Tom Salter on guitar keyboard player Graeme Stafford from Ardnamurchan drummer Stu Haikney and Shetlander Ross Couper on fiddle.For Peter Morrison, the global tours, the record deals and the Glastonbury stage all owe their origins to the chance he got to learn the chanter in the long-since closed Vatten Bridge primary school.He explains: #Every year Norman MacLeod # the teacher#s husband # and John Laing used to pipe us all in to the Christmas Party, so that was where I first heard the pipes.#Every pupil got the chance of learning the chanter at school, and I think nine of us started playing. It was either that or an hour of maths.#I think I was the only one who carried on into secondary school, but I got the bug. I didn#t like the competing part, but I enjoyed listening to the pipes and learning to play them.#My pal Donnie MacAskill from Roag also played the accordion, so I learned to play drums along with him and from about the age of  I was always in bands.#Morrison#s early piping tutor was Cameron MacFadyen, and he received additional help from Nicol Campbell # another well-known local piper and character from Dunvegan, whose memory has been honoured across the globe.Morrison added: #When he passed away Nicol left me his kilt, which has since been worn on stages in Japan, Africa and America.#A joiner to trade, who also worked for aperiod as a hotelier in Dunvegan, Peter Morrison has seen attitudes to traditional music change over the years, and with it opportunities flourish.He still lives in Roag with we Johan and grown-up kids Jenny and Calum, and it#s no surprise to hear him promote the virtues of free access to music tuition in local schools.He continues to be #amazed# at some of the local talent learning traditional instruments, some of whom he can be heard playing alongside at regular music sessions laid on in the Edinbane Inn and the Old Inn in Carbost.#It#s changed a lot since when I was a youngster whenyou wanted to learn music the only real opportunity was the pipes,# he recalled.#Things like the fis movement have been really helpful in creating opportunities. There now seems to be a constant stream of really good young musicians coming out of Skye.#When I started you would never have thought of making a career out of it, but now with some of these youngsters, it seems to be the only thing they think about. #A lot of these kids are now at a standard that in previous years only a handful of people in Scotland were achieving.#In Skye you have the likes of Daimh, Niteworks, Bridghe Campbell # the list goes on and on. #At these regular sessions there are some great young local players going along like Anna Scott, Dugald McKiggan, Archie and Isobel Maclean and Malin Lewis.#Morrison continued: #Recently over in LorientI saw a great act. It was a Sikh beatboxer, accompanied by step-dancer Sophie Stevenson along with Catherine Tinney from Portree singing puirt-a-beul.#This was another Skye person on the international stage, singing to an incredible standard, but she was someone I#d never heard sing before. #In the past, going somewhere like Lorient,there was a person from Skye on stage you would know exactly who it was # they would be an established name. Now you can go somewhere like that and get a surprise.#It shows the strength in depth there is now.#Some of that west-coast musical talent will be showcased at Skye Live this weekend among a ied line-up that will also include some of the country#s top nightclub DJs.Morrison urged the local community to rally behind the festival weekend, which this year starts with a Thursday-night concert to the Waterboys.He added: #We played at the very first Skye Live five years ago and are looking forward to getting on stage at the Lump in Portree again.#It#s an iconic setting, but organisers have kept the festival to a level that is comfortable for the place.#A capacity of , people is about a fth of the population of Skye and is manageable. When you start to go into the tens of thousands it brings pressures, and it#s a risk to go too big without the infrastructure to support it.#Whenever anyone organises a festival there will always be people who might want to pick holes in it or knock it in some way.#But people need to remember that these guys are putting on a  for so many types of music.#It#s something people of all ages can go to and hear some of the best music in Scotland in Portree. I would hope local people can support it in any way they can.#The Skye Live festival runs from Thursday th until Saturday th September. Acts on the bill include Niteworks, Elephant Sessions, Lau, Tide Lines and Peat and Diesel as well as DJs Erol Alkan, Optimoand Leon Vynehall.."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_2094570.jpg--.jpg?1566380480000\n","title":"new stamp celebrates beauty on our doorstep","story":"A much-loved beauty spot just a few miles from the centre of Ballymena has been celebrated on a new set of stamps that show off the beauty of the UKs forests.

Matt Aumlkerfeldt worked as Nikolaj Coster-Waldau’sstand in and body double from  to the show’s grand end this year. Caution - Contains spoilersyou haven’t watched the final season yet!Matt applied to be an extra on the show when it first came to Northern Ireland then ended up landing a full on role.“I did a few days of extra work and then got noticed by the casting staff as I bore a resemblance to Nikolaj, who played Jamie Lannister.“Most of my measurements were the same as him, down to even my hand size which was vital from season three as Jamie has his hand cut off. “I worked about  days a year on the show and then during season eight I was there pretty much every day!”In ‘real le’, Matt, who is , loves working in the Fairhill branch of Cafe Nero’s.  Born in Sweden, Matt moved to Northern Ireland when he was a child with his mum. He has adopted the Ballymena area as his home and says Game of Thrones helped keep him here. He explained: “I would get in before all the other cast and crew and have a rough idea of what scenes were going to be shot that day. I’d then go over them with the director and the camera guys plus the director of photography.“I’d be given some direction and then take part in crew rehearsals. After this would be the full rehearsal with all the extras, so by the time the main cast come on set I’ve probably gone through the scene about  times!“Nikolaj would then come on and get some short notes from the director before I’d also give him notes as I’ve already ran the scene. My face is never actually recorded on camera but I’ve been in every one of his scenes. “Working then as a body double was dferent. When doing this I dressed up in the character of Jamie and picked up the shots.“This even applied to the nude scenes, which I was comfortable with as I’m not really a shy person and don’t get nervous easily!”Although it would be practically impossible to tell the dference between Matt and Nikolaj on screen, Matt said: “I know all the scenes I did and,anything, it’s a bit illusion breaking as I also know what’s behind the scene!”So what was Matt’s favourite moment from the whole Game of Thrones season  His answer was the iconic trial of Jamie Lannister in Season .“All the main cast were together,” Matt explained.“On that day Nikolaj got wrapped early so when he’s not on screen all the actors are actually looking at me and I was delivering his lines to them. “I had this amazing line up of actors looking at me. It was a big moment in the whole series and I suppose I was relatively nervous!“When action is called, it’s like your le stops, you’re no longer in this world you feel you’re actually in Westeros. Then when cut is called everyone is back to normal. It’s amazingnot a little weird!”Being a body double meant that Matt wore the original costumes.“I wore Nikolaj’s costume alot, including the armour which is real.“I had to keep my body a certain shape so as to fit it plus I did have to keep pretty fit to carry it.“When we started working with the gold hand, my own arm was strapped behind my back, which was pretty uncomfortable, but the fake arm was amazing. It looked very real, down to the pours and hair on the skin.”It’s no secret that the last season of Game of Thrones was surrounded in secrecy! So how did Matt handle keeping the secret that almost  million people wanted to know He revealed: “I certainly didn’t tell too many people!“For nine years I kept all the secrets of the show and, especially in the last season it really was such a burden as there were so many consperies. It became hard to not talk about it and I really just wanted to tell someone about it.”Many of the ludicrous rumours about how the show would end were indeed , however Matt did confirm that scripts were destroyed after each scene was filmed.He said: “There were hundreds of people in the crew during the last season so it got to the point that sets were closed.“There was also misinformation circulated. One part of the crew would be told a certain detail about a scene or filming while another would be told something , all just to throw people off the scent of what was really going on.  “On one occasion Nikolaj went to Seville just so as people would think he was filming there when infact he wasn’t.”Final EpisodeThe final episode and season was met with much acclaim but it wasn’t without some negative reviews. Many people thought the ending wasn’t as dramatic as should have been, and some were left disappointed.To a certain extent, Matt agrees.“I think there was alot of character progression over the years that was forgotten about or pushed aside during the final season, and perhaps some characters could have had a more gloried end. “Perhaps the writers were concentrating on dferent projects. “My view was that this was the last season, we should have gone all out!”On Jamie’s last scene, where he died under a pile of rubble in the arms of his sister, Matt has his own philosophy.“In my head I’d like to think that Jamie was actually going to kill Cersei so as he could have a proper future with Brienne of Tarth.”Matt talks fondly of all the cast members, especially Nikolaj.He said: “I love Nikolaj. I obviously spent alot of time with him and I went to the wrap party which was great too.Gwendoline Christie, who played Brienne of Tarth was a lovely lady and I was friends with Jacob Anderson who played Greyworm. I got to know everyone well and generally everyone was really nice.” Le after Game of ThronesThe future is certainly bright for Matt as he aspires to get more recognised as an actor.“Currently I’m working at the Game of Thrones exhibition in Belfast and doing some photography work.“I’ve started a series of YouTube videos going round the Thrones locations in Northern Ireland and explaining them.“I recently did a video from Cushendun caves, which is special to me as it’s actually where Nikolaj and I had our last scene together.“From that I was noticed by a writer, currently writing a movie and was sent the script. So I potentially have the opportunity to be part of the main cast for that upcoming movie. “I don’t have an agent as I need a showreel of me infront of the camera, sothis movie works out I’ll get the showreel then hopefully an agent and we’ll see where it goes from there.“I also really want to keep my job in Nero’s as I love it there!”Looking back, Matt had such a great experience working on Thrones.“It was a great nine years! But when it all aired and all the secrets were out I felt really free. It was like a car had been lted off my shoulders as there was so much information I had to keep to myself!”Matt still hasn’t watched the final season on TV.“I still miss it as it was better than anything I’ve worked on before but I’ll watch it at some point, I know what happens at the end of the day!” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_2228521.jpg--.jpg?1567156924000\n","title":"j p corry site re opens","story":"Local builders’ merchants, JP Corry, officially reopened its’ Ballymenabranch on Monday th August following a devastating fire that closed the site just  weeks ago.

I invite you all to join me in prayer, that God, the Father of all, may consolidate fraternal reconciliation throughout Africa, which is the only hope for solid and lasting peace. #ApostolicJourney #Mozambique #Madagascar #Mauritius— Pope FrancisSeptember , He arrived on Wednesday evening but has no public events scheduled after his brief airport welcome ceremony.The timing of the visit is not coincidental, coming just weeks after the signing of the accord between the ruling Frelimo party and the armed Frenamo opposition and before national elections on October . \" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Pope Francis is welcomed at Maputo airport The vote is considered crucial because a new constitutional amendment has decentralised power so that provincial governors will now be elected directly, rather than appointed by the central government.Mozambique’s -year civil war, which ended with a  peace deal, killed an estimated one million people and devastated the former Portuguese colony. The permanent ceasefire signed on August  was the culmination of years of negotiations to end fighting that has flared sporadically in the  years since.In central Mozambique, Gorongosa National Park warden Pedro Muagura said there are hopes the pope’s visit will strengthen the deal.“In general, people are very, very optimistic that the pope will be a good influence for peace and good elections,” said Mr Muagura. \" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Pope Francis waves to crowds as he arrives at the Apostolic Nunciature in the capital Maputo “In , our peace agreement was signed after the pope’s visit,” he said, referring to John Paul’s historic  trip. “Now there are the same expectations that this pope will bring a positive influence, reconciliation between all Mozambicans. “Those are the hopes of so many people here.”Francis will also reach out to Mozambicans affected by back-to-back cyclones that ripped into the country earlier this year, leaving more than  people dead and destroying vast swaths of crops on the eve of harvest.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Pope Francis, wearing a straw hat, is greeted by a journalist during his flight from Rome to Maputo The unprecedented storms laid bare the impact of climate change on countries like Mozambique, which with its ,-mile coastline is one of the world’s most vulnerable to the rising sea levels, warming waters and unpredictable storms blamed on global warming.Francis has made environmental concerns a pillar of his papacy, linking global warming to the persistent exploitation of the world’s poor by the wealthy.He is likely to raise those concerns in Mozambique, as well as on the second leg of his trip in Madagascar, where deforestation is threatening ecosystems and wildle that are unique to the Indian Ocean island nation.Francis also makes a day-long stop in Mauritius before ing to Rome on September ."},{"url":null,"title":"derry city cemetery series feis ceoil founder magnificent contribution cultural life derry","story":"Last week’s article on Derry City Cemetery made mention of Victorian era engineer Abraham McCausland Stewart who with his brother Charles Edward Stewart were leading engineers in the city and beyond at the height of the Victorian era.However, Abraham Stewarts we also made an invaluable contribution to the cultural le of Derry for many decades by championing singing and music as part of being at the heart of the creation of many of Derry’s annual musical festivals and organisations.AlexandrinaElsner was born at Stillorgan, Co Dublin on June ,  and was the daughter of Frederick Wilhelm Elsner, a renowned German cellist who had come to Dublin from Frankfurt in  as Professor of Violoncello at the Royal Irish Academy of Music.With her sister Pauline, Alex became a pioneer of Lieder – romantic songs, of an intimate and refined nature that were generally for solo singers with piano accompaniment that required a virtuoso technique.  The two young Elsner sisters greatly promoted those type of songs at private musical recitals at their aunt’s house at Wilton Street in Dublin, performing works by Brahms, Peter Cornelius, Strauss and Wolf for very select audiences.Interestingly, Wilhelm’s daughters also ran a kindergarten at the family home in Stillorgan as well as maintaining the school of music long after his death and which was then inherited by his widow Elise. Amongst the pupils at the house which was called Tanus, was a young Samuel Beckett who attended there between the age of five and nine.The school was located on the Leopardstown Road between Foxrock and Stillorgan and in his later years literally giant still recalled that the place had a big lawn where, between classes, he and his brother Frank would play with the other children.Also, whilst they were attending the school, the Beckett’s father acted as a surveyor for a new building that the Elsner’s had constructed at the end of their garden to act as a gymnasium.Having obviously inherited her father’s undoubted musical talent, Alex attended the Royal College of Music in London where she honed her contralto voice and on herto Ireland in  and took part in concerts with many of Dublin’s musical societies and remained an extremely popular choice for private recitals in the fashionable houses of the capital.Later in the s Alexandrina Elsner was travelling north to sing in Belfast and the North West as well. Amongst her first memorable appearances in Derry was a performance as a soloist at a St Columb’s Choral Union concert in February  and at another concert in October  at the city’s new Opera House on Carlisle Road.The stature of the appearance of Miss Elsner at Derry’s Opera House, which had opened in , should not be underestimated since there were very few venues of this stature in Ireland at the time that attracted only the top acts of the time. In fact, the Derry newspapers - the Standard, Derry Journal and Londonderry Sentinel lauded her as one of the most favoured performers of the local audiences.Renowned Italian opera companies regularly visited Derry to perform and such was the popularity of the city’s Opera House that late night train services for audiences were often laid on from Inishowen and in the city late evening tram services allowed audiences to travel more easily to the shows.When she married Abraham Stewart on June ,  Alex Elsner moved to Derry where she wasted no time in throwing herself into the cultural le of a city esteemed for not only for its love of music but its wealth of talent as well.Just two years after her arrival in her new home, Alexandrina had established the Londonderry Philharmonic Society and Londonderry Feis. The Feis, beginning as a single day event on April ,  eventually bloomed into a week-long festival of music and singing by the s and she herself took lead roles in the bi-annual performances of the Philharmonic Society.The budding impresario wisely took counsel from the organisers of the Feis Ceoilin her native city of Dublin and invited a representative to Derry to advise on how to establish a local version. As a result, Derry became the second place in Ireland to establish such a festival, beating Sligoand Belfastto the punch.Initially, there were just a few competitions – for church choirs, factory choirs, school choirs, drum and flute bands, brass bands and for solo singers as well as special medals for songs sung in Gaelic awarded by the Derry branch of the Gaelic League. The interest of budding competitors was immediately taken as the workers of the famed city shirt factories quickly scrambled to form choirs specically for the Feis.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshIn advance of the first year of competition, by February of  three of the factories established four choirs. Welch Margetson  Co and Hogg  Mitchell both entered a choir each, whilst the much larger workforce at Tillie  Henderson entered two choral groups.With the passing decades the Feis gained more and more competitors and its repertoire of competitions expanded as a result not just from all over Ireland but from Scotland and England as well. As its prestige also increased, many of Derry’s businesses were glad to be associated with its success and donated beautul gold and silver cups and medals. Bursary schemes for those intent in pursuing a professional le in music and singing also began.In , just a year after partition, another woman Mrs Edward HenryO’Doherty founded Feis Doire Colmcille along with Fr Joseph McGettigan. The Derry Feis centred more upon Irish music, dancing and singing but despite the obvious cultural dferences, competitors from the Catholic and Protestant communities competed in both feiseanna without exception.Alexandrina Stewarts devotion to the Londonderry Philharmonic Society was equal to her commitment to the feis. Apart from featuring her own distinguished performances, the concerts also featured many distinguished musical names from both London and Dublin.In an era long before manufactured television vehicles, the twice-yearly Derry concerts also attracted talent scouts from far and near seeking bookings for their concert halls and opera houses.And, a major talent was spotted as the result of the Philharmonic Society’s concert in Derry on March , . James Johnston, a native of Belfast was well-known as an amateur singer in his younger days but was practically untrained at the highest level. Instead he concentrated as a career in butchery in his father’s shop and supplemented his income as a semi-professional singer at venues around Ireland.It was after his performance in Derry that he was snapped up by the Dublin Grand Opera Society and so began a huge career as an opera singer. It was after highly memorable performances in Rigoletto in Ireland’s capital in , the globally renowned theatrical director Tyrone Guthrie offered him a contract at Sadler’s Wells where he became principal tenor for well in excess of a decade.During his career Johnston played a wide range of roles which included his Covent Garden debut in La Traviata in  and also appeared with Maria Callas and Joan Sutherland. Johnston retired at the height of his fame in  and simply ed to working in the family butcher’s business in Belfast’s Sandy Row where he lived out the remainder of his le until he died aged  in .Johnston’s success however was entirely based on being spotted in Derry and to the efforts of Alex Stewart’s in establishing the city’s Philharmonic Society. It too sprang from relatively humble beginnings, with having just over  in the chorus and nineteen strong orchestra in . By the s the society accounted for  voices and a  strong orchestra that drew its membership from all classes across Derry.The pinnacle of Alex’s own musical career had perhaps come in March  when she was soloist for the celebrated Halle Orchestra at St Columb’s Hall. The orchestra had been founded in  in Manchester by Sir Charles Halle to perform at the Manchester Art Treasures Exhibition in January . The orchestra exists to this day and has been in residence at the Bridgewater Hall in Manchester since .Abraham Stewart died suddenly in  and as a result, Alexandrina ed home to her family in Dublin, but ed to Derry every year without fail during feis week. The Feis Committee awarded her the honorary title of administrator and offered to pay the fare for herjourney for le.On May ,  Alex McCausland Elsner Stewart died at a nursing home in Dublin and her remains were brought to Derry and buried beside those of her husband in the city cemetery. The couple had two sons and a daughter. Her daughter, also called Alexandrina, had been killed just a few weeks previously whilst on active service in Burma during World War II.Abraham and Alexandrina had lived at the prestigious Crawford Square in Derry and it was there on April ,  that the Ulster History Circle unveiled a blue plaque marking her le and contribution to the cultural le of her adopted city.Commenting on the unveiling of the blue plaque, Chris Spurr from the Ulster History Circle said: “When Alexandrina Stewart embraced Ireland’s city of music, the result was a harmonious partnership founding the first Londonderry Philharmonic Society and the Derry Feis Ceoil.”CAPTION: The Londonderry Philharmonic Society on stage at the Guildhall."},{"url":null,"title":"derry needs gallery art lovers devastated loss ebrington gallery","story":"Art lovers in Derry have expressed their “disappointment” at the loss of an Ebrington gallery space which hosted the most prestigious modern art competition in the UK a matter of years ago.The Derry News exclusively revealed that Nerve Visual is set to close its doors at the end of this week.Artists based in the city say we should “demand” that this space is used to showcase the local arts scene and,properly promoted, it will prove to be a “massive draw” for both tourists and the local community.Since the announcement, people who are passionate about arts and culture have aired their views.National Museum NI curator, Kim Mawhinney, said: “I am devastated to hear this. We worked with Nerve Visual to bring two of our most impactful exhibitions from the Ulster Museum to Derry.”The exhibitions referred to are Silent Testimony and Art of the Troubles. “Derry needs this gallery!” she added.The Nerve Centre reopened the former Turner Prize gallery space as Nerve Visual in June  when it was lauded as a “major new venue for visual arts in the Northern Ireland”.A spokesperson for the Nerve Centre said it has received no core funding and was programmed and funded on a project by project basis.In just over three years it has hosted  successful exhibitions.However, writer and art critic Dominic Kearney said he couldn’t understand why it was so poorly attended, particularly as the Turner Prize was such a success at the same location.Nerve Visual only took over a section of the Creative Hub Building   in  but during the City of Culture year in  the same gallery space hosted the prestigious Turner Prize - one of the best-known visual arts prizes in the world.Mr Kearney believes the location is “terric” and “exactly” what Ebrington needs. “The space is perfect for a gallery and the exhibitions that they had there were very impressive.“The Troubles Art exhibition, Future Artist Makers and the Colin Davidson one was stunning, I’d hesitate to say beautul given the nature of its subject, but it was incredibly powerful.“It’s the only gallery that’s open to the public in Derry that deals with mainstream, accessible, representational art. For this to close is really going to detract from the local art scene, from Ebrington, the Waterside and Derry as a whole. Like a pebble dropped in a pond, the ripple effect will spread out from that building to the outer ring of the entire city.”He added: “It’s such a shame, in six years it’s gone from hosting the most prestigious modern art competition in UK to a couple of empty rooms.“People can only have so many cups of coffee, tourists need something to do when visiting the city. If there was a gallery dedicated to Irish art with links to galleries in Dublin, the Ulster Museum, and maybe Britain. Tourists would definitely want to go there as galleries are the type of thing people look for.”‘Massive draw’Local artists were regularly showcased at the Nerve Visual gallery.Stephen Lewis has lived in Derry for over  years, he’s an artist based at Bishop Street Studios who also works with the arts charities Creative Village Arts and ArtLink at Fort Dunree. He expressed his “disappointment” at the gallery’s closure.“There have been recent initiatives by the Nerve Visual, Tower Museum and An Culturalann to give folk here a chance to see art that is held in their own national collections - but it simply goes back to the inability to keep a space that is equipped to do this open.“People in the North West should not have to travel to Belfast to see their own art - The Ulster Museum often has  or  art exhibitions on at any one time - we built a world class gallery in  and we really should demand that this becomes our space to see our own art collections - properly advertised it could be a massive draw for locals and tourists alike.\"It’s understood there will be plenty of people interested in taking over occupancy of the building but at this stage it is unclear what will be based there.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures 39 wall wall sunshine 39","story":"Berriew Show President and grandfather, Mark Bright, presents cup winner in the ltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtover s fancy dress ltspan classtruncate-full-screengtto Olivia Jonesfrom Berriew.

This will ensure that this important local landmark will be secure for generations to come and visitors to the town can continue to enjoy it as a back.The parishrsquos project convenor, Dennis Constable said: ldquoThis repair work will ensure that people will still be able to visit the church and enjoy looking at the heritage and the wonderful stained glass windows.ldquoThe church also holds many treasures of history that stretch back in Newcastlersquos history and which are relevant to many people.He added: ldquoThe repairs, which include the bell tower  will provide for the church bells, which have been silent for so long, to once again to be rung..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/28th August 2019 Border.jpg","title":"Border Cup set to start  ","story":"CUP action continues to dominate the local soccer scene with the countdown to Christmas joy beginning on Saturday.Thatrsquos when the first round of the prestigious Border Cup takes place with eight local teams in action.Top billing goes to the game at Robert Adams Park between Kilmore Rec and Portaferry.Other ties include Grove United v Killyleagh YC, Drumaness Mills v Greenisland, Holywood FC v Ballynahinch Olympic, Aquinas v Ballynahinch United, Comber Rec v Bangor Swts and Saintfield United v Bryansburn Rangers.

Work to widen Fountain Street to provide on-street parking and traffic calming measures has already been completed, while a pound, project at Collinsrsquo Corner is currently underway.Roads officials have previously suggested the introduction of a one-way system but little or nor progress appears to have been made on this particular scheme.While pleased with the work in Fountain Street and Collinsrsquo Corner, Cllr Curran believes they will not have a positive impact on town centre congestion, prompting his call to meet with senior roads engineers. He is also concerned that no progress is being made to tackle a congestion and road safety issue at Edward Street in the town.His call for talks to discuss solutions to town centre congestion came ahead of a special meeting between councillors and roads officials last night when the Department of Infrastructure presented its annual report which details work that has already been completed on ious schemes and what projects are in the pipeline.Cllr Curran said the annual report contained no ldquoconcrete proposals for addressing town centre congestion, prompting his call to meet with engineers.ldquoA proposed road between Irish Street and St Patrickrsquos Avenue has been shelved due to the cost involved and the minimal impact it would have on tackling congestion, he said. ldquoThat is why we need to get round the table and look at all options moving forward.ldquoCan lessons be learned from other towns which experienced similar problems or what about changing the sequencing of traffic lights  he asked.ldquoIt has been said many times that there is no quick fix solution to Downpatrickrsquos congestion problem and while the layout of the town may pose problems for engineers, surely it is time for some innovative thinking ldquoAll the key players need to get together as years of inaction has exacerbated the congestion nightmare faced by residents, businesses and visitors.Cllr Curran says the time has come to ldquograsp the congestion nettle with the onus on roads officials to finally deliver by taking a critical look at the problems.ldquoWe need to take a critical look at the problem and come up with ideas on the way forward. I suspect that the congestion issue that we have in Downpatrick would not be allowed to go unaddressed in any other major town in the country. We have had numerous reports on the way forward but what people, in particular those in the business community what to see, is action, he continued.ldquoDownpatrick councillors need to join forces and sit down with roads engineers to look at what can be done. Apart from the development of the Saul Way link road, there has been no major traffic development in Downpatrick town centre for decades.ldquoThe congestion problem is getting worse andthe ambitious plans to redevelop the former Irish Street police station base and adjoining buildings are to be a success and attract new commercial and private development, we need to solve the traffic problem.Cllr Curran added: ldquoThe congestion is driving shoppers out of the town and we need to arrest this decline. To achieve this, I believe that we need a brainstorming sessions to come up with a new blueprint on the way forward. There must be an end to a congestion problem blighting the local economy..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/28th August 2019 C Diary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C August 28%2C 1979  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH mdash A young Ballynahinch familyrsquos seven-month ordeal ended yesterday mdash only hours after the Down Recorder took up their case.Thatrsquos how long the McGrory family have been waiting for a new fireplace in the living room of their Housing Executive house at Windmill Gardens.After such a long wait, workmen finally arrived out yesterday afternoon, less than  hours after the Recorder had contacted Housing Executive headquarters about the situation.The problems for the family started three years ago when their fireplace broke up. Housing Executive workmen carried out repairs, but seven months ago the fireplace again broke up. Since then repeated calls to the Executive met with little or no response.ldquoWith winter fast coming we needed this fireplace fixed, said Mr Terry McGrory. ldquoDuring the summer months we managed to make do, but therersquos no way we could face cold nights without a fire in our living room.ldquoSince February wersquove had to do without a fire and it was beginning to look like it wouldnrsquot be fixed at all. Wersquove called on the Housing Executive numerous times and used up all the repair forms at the back of our rent book, but still no-one had it fixed.Mrs Mildred Terry was equally unhappy. ldquoThe last time they came to fix the fireplace three years ago, they simply pushed it back against the wall and plastered it over the wallpaper which we had just put on, she said.ldquoIt became a big nuisance having to hope that friendly neighbours would help us wash our clothes and provide us with baths, because we were unable to heat our water by the use of the fire.BISHOPSCOURT mdash Police are investigating the circumstances leading to the death of an RAF sergeant at Bishopscourt last Tuesday evening. The sergeant was seen running into bushes at the camp and two shots were heard. He was found later with two gunshot wounds to the head. The manrsquos name is not being released until the next of kin have been informed.CASTLEWELLAN mdash The people of Castlewellan paid tribute to one of their doctors, who retired recently, with a special presentation iety concert in St Malachyrsquos High School last Tuesday night.Dr Brendan Moore, who first came to the town in , received several gts from the people after many of the townrsquos top entertainers had put on a rousing concert on his behalf.Dr Moore set up his practice in Upper Square, but later moved to there present residence in Circular Road where he continued to give his valuable help.Mr Patrick McAleenan, principal of St Malachyrsquos High School, introduced the presentations. Mrs Josephine King, on behalf of the people, presented Dr Moore with an inscribed watch and a cheque and Mrs Moore with an inscribed watch, while Miss Una Hardy presented Mrs Moore with a bouquet of flowers.Dr Moore thanked everyone for their generosity and stressed how much he had enjoyed practising in the Castlewellan area for so many years.SAINTFIELD mdash Residents beside a quarry near Saintfield who frequently had windows broken in their homes when blasting took place had their grievances aired at a recent meeting of Castlereagh Borough Council.A local councillor, Mr J A Lowe, raised complaints of householders whose windows are shattered by blasting at Lisdoonan Quarry.Mr Lowe said residents had suffered from broken windows and undue noise on many occasions. He wanted to knowplanning permission covered the size of explosives used in the quarry.He was told that  conditions were attached to the planning permission, covering such issues as the size of explosive charges and the permitted distance from the nearest dwellings.KILLYLEAGH mdash Work on a major housing redevelopment programme in Killyleagh is in danger of grinding to a halt. Speculation is mounting that the main contractors are getting ready to pull out because of unpaid bills by the Housing Executive.Ten houses which have been virtually complete for six months are still lying idle because minor sub-contract work has not been started. Ten families, who were told last December that new homes would be ready by February, are still waiting and the situation is fast becoming a deadlock.The poundm redevelopment scheme at Irish Street was to have been a Housing Executive showpiece. Work began on building  new homes in two phases in . The scheme had been designed to ldquoretain the character and charm of Killyleagh, transforming the old houses into modern housing for some  people.The Housing Executive have flatly refused to comment on the latest developments at the site and they will not go into the many complaints, except to admit that there are problems at the site.Three weeks ago a major row erupted all over the province when a dispute in the Executiversquos finance department caused a backlog of payments to dozens of small construction firms.DOWNPATRICK mdash A group of residents in the Flying Horse housing estate in Downpatrick are campaigning for proper dustbins to be provided.At present residents are supplied with paper bags which they say are too small and do not hold any great weight of refuse. They cannot be use for ashes, which residents must pile up in their back gardens.Their campaign has been taken up by Mr Raymond Blaney, of Republican Clubs the Workersrsquo Party. ldquoWhen it rains heavily the bags fall apart and the rubbish is scattered all over the place.

Brannish Road was reported to be barricaded with branches and supermarket trolleys with young people targeting passing cars with stones.The most disturbing incident occurred on Monday evening when a woman driving alone was left frightened after her car was stoned on the Brannish Road as she made her way to work.Police have confirmed that they are aware of the recent trouble and warned those responsible for the unruly behaviour that their involvement could lead to a criminal record and harm their future university and employment prospects.Officers have also appealed to anyone who can

That whip has now been withdrawn.“If tonight’s motion had been lost, a no-deal Brexit would have been almost inevitable. Probably not a good career move but the right choice.”A source close to the rebels said: “Tonight’s decisive result is the first step in a process to avert an undemocratic and damaging no-deal.“No  have responded by removing the whip from two former chancellors, a former lord chancellor and Winston Churchill’s grandson.

leader Jeremy Corbyn told the Prime Minister: “He wants to table a motion for a general election, fine.“Get the Bill through first in order to take no deal off the table.”Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson said it was vital that the Commons does not “tip our country into an election at a point where there is any risk that we will crash out of the European Union during that election campaign or immediately after”.“We must act responsibly,” she told MPs.Wednesday is set to be a dramatic day in the Commons, with Mr Johnson due to take his first Prime Minister’s Questions at noon before the Chancellor Sajid Javid sets out public spending plans.MPs will then debate the draft legislation put forward by a cross-party group which would require a delay to Brexit unless there was a deal or Parliament explicitly backed leaving the EU without one by October .A vote on a general election could be held later in the day.Meanwhile, a decision is expected at the Court of Session in Edinburgh after a cross-party group of MPs and peers brought legal action aimed at halting the suspension of Parliament.try catch  TrendingTransfer Deadline Day RECAP: Rangers confirm pound.m Ryan Kent signing

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does. So I will look for something a bit far out or invent my own and usually try and document them on video.All the proceeds from the day will go towards the charityrsquos Harefield Transplant Appeal, to raise funds for organ care systems to allow more patients to receive le-saving transplants.If yoursquod like to support Mr Glover in his marathon challenge his Justgiving page is: https:www.justgiving fundraising muscleworld article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Two-year-old Matilda Philpott who has Stickler Syndrome was joined by her two brothers, Oliva and Alfie, four-year-old Alice Haswell who has Goldenhar Syndrome camped out with her sister Scarlet, and -year-old Daisy Stacey who has Vacterl Association attended with her sister Molly.The weekend saw the families take part in a range of activities from archery, crafts and pop rockets to laser shooting, fire lighting, bush craft and raft making.The camp was the first time the referred children have been on a Scout Camp, something leaders have been hoping to achieve since the start of the group.Ruth Weltch, Group Scout Leader said: ldquoThe opportunity to regularly set up camp in the great outdoors is one of the main reasons young people enjoy Scouting so much and we wanted to give our children, who would not normally have the opportunity, the chance to take part in a weekend of outdoor activities and to sleep under canvas with their families.ldquoWe have been overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of help offered by leaders, not just from Cardf and Vale Scouts but from other scouting areas in Wales.This reflects the scope of the hospice itself which is open to all children with le limiting illnesses throughout Wales.ldquoWe have been able to give these children the opportunity to take part in activities not usually accessible to them and that we take for granted. It was an absolute joy to see them and their families take part in the weekendrsquos activities, seeing them smile and forget about their worries for a while was heart-warming.Lynne Phelps, from Ty Hafan, said: ldquoThe hard work, time and effort put in by the Scout Group since its inception has been truly amazing. The group has brought so much happiness to the hospice and given the children referred to us an opportunity to take part in activities with their families that they wouldnrsquot have had access toit wasnrsquot for Scouts.ldquoThe group has had a really positive impact not just on the children in our care, but also their families and our staff. We really canrsquot thank the Ty Hafan Scout Group enough.The Ty Hafan Scout Group was set up on the Scouting Centenary in  for any child referred to the hospice along with their siblings, parents and family, to spend time together having fun and making memories.A growing need for sibling involvement was soon recognised and so the group began to run regular sibling camps.The sibling camps have given the young people who have brothers and sisters in the care of the hospice the opportunity to attend events such as Scarefest and the Jurassic International Jamboree, as well as the chance to spend quality family time with their loved ones.ScoutsCymru gives over , young people in Wales the opportunity to enjoy fun and adventure while developing the skills they need to succeed, now and in the future.Open to all young people in Wales regardless of faith, gender, sexual orientation, race or social background, the movement encourages its members to do more, learn more and be more. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

powerlifting competition for toby  ","story":"A -year-old Tandragee man has received a surprise invitation to represent Northern Ireland in powerlting, only  months after taking up the sport as a result of a joke.Personal trainer Toby Clarke is heading to the Commonwealth Powerlting Championships in St Johns, New Foundland, Canada for September  - having reacted with scepticism to his initial invitation.Toby can now lt almost . times his body weight.“I received the news by email in July while I was finishing up my morning sht in work,” he said. “I initially thought that there had been a mistake and it was sent to me by accident but after a phone call and a couple of back and forward emails I found out that it was genuine and that there was no mistake.“I had only started training for and competing in powerlting back in January  and had competed in my third ever competition back at Christmas in .”He is now able to deadlt almost . times his own body weight, a very respectable achievement in the sport.He did have some experience previously in weightlting while a student at Loughborough University, a dferent sport which requires more speed and complex skills to lt usually lighter weights above the head.“While at Loughborough the weightlters and powerlters trained together and one of my friends, a powerlter, jokingly suggested that I switch to powerlting. So a few months later I did.”In powerlting the aim is to lt as much weight as possible in the deadlt, squat and bench press. The best of three efforts in each lt then gives a total, with the highest total in each weight class winning.His powerlting personal bests at around kg body weight are a kg squat, a kg bench press and kg deadlt, while his weight lting bests are kg in the snatch and a kg clean and jerk. Now head coach at Kaizen Strength gym, near Lurgan, the former Portadown College student earned a degree in Sports Science from the Belfast Met and Loughborough University and is studying for a masters degree in Strength and Conditioning at St Mary’s University in Twickenham. His own trainer is former Loughborough powerlting coach Alec Hewstone of Focus Strength and Conditioning gym in Portadown. He added: “Qualying for the Commonwealth Powerlting Championships was never on my mind and I believed that it would have been another couple of years before I felt that I would have been at the right level before I would have thought about trying to qualy for a competition of that calibre.” He adds: “Training for Canada has been hard going physically but more mentally challenging. I would love to improve all of my lts and my total. However, I’ve picked up a few niggles over the past few weeks, so I just want to go out, enjoy myself, do what I can and stay injury free.”The cost of competing in Canada is stretching, he says, and having already committed all his £ savings to cover his flights, insurance and hotel stay, he has set up a GoFundMe page for supporters to assist with food, transport and additional costs which has so far raised £ of his £, target- www.gofundme f road-to-the-powerlting-commonwealth-games-"},{"url":null,"title":"politics","story":"No records of consultation with the GAA on pitch strategy have been held by Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon Council, it has been revealed.

We speak to founder Daniel Crawford and his team about the journey so far A spark in the mind of Daniel Crawford as he studied for his masters degree in Glasgow just a few years ago has grown into a business at the sharp end of technology. axialD is tasked with turning the complicated and laborious process of converting D medical scans into D models – and producing them for use by surgeons and medical professionals. It’s an ever-growing business, spun out of Ulster University, which is expanding its reach across the UK, Ireland and now into the US where it’s targeting a burgeoning fresh marketplace. The company has been involved with Catalyst since , been directly involved with a host of its programmes, and is participating in the EU INTERREG funded North West Centre for Advanced Manufacturing , managed by the Special European Union Programmes Body . Catalyst is Northern Ireland’s leading technology hub, home to  companies and around , staff. Daniel has a strong team around him – growing to  staff based in Belfast city centre, including Niall Haslam, chief technology officer, Katie McKinley, head of new business and strategic partnerships and Cathy Coomber as operations manager. While studying medical visualisation and human anatomy in Glasgow, Daniel was exposed to the raft of imaging available – including CT, MRI and ultrasound, and began examining how the crucial data could be better used. The biomedical physics undergraduate grew the idea into his thesis – looking at converting D data sets and converting them into fully D printable files. “That allows us to turn images into D models to allow surgeons or registrars, to understand digital pathologies, before going in to theatre,” he said. “But we discovered it wasn’t just good for that and surgeons also wanted to get their hands on the D models.” That gave Daniel greater scope for developing the concept. In one early case, a surgeon was able to use one of the D prints to identy small fractures in a patient who had suffered a motorcycle crash, that weren’t initially apparent using more traditional methods. The company was thrust into Catalyst’s Springboard programme in  – a  week scheme which allowed a would-be entrepreneur, fresh out of university, access to business training and development, which included working with PathXL’s Stuart Harvey. From there, it was into the Halo programme – bringing axialD together with angel investors in order to get the start-up off the ground. It landed £, through Techstart and private investors, which allowed the company to get the ball rolling. Through Catalyst, Daniel also got the opportunity to visit MIT and the entrepreneurial development programme, Way to Scale, bringing axialD to Massachusetts and the Boston area – the global heart of the health technology sector. Niall Haslam is axialD’s chief technical officer. He said a Belfast and Boston partnership has helped strengthen the links between the cities, bringing firms from Northern Ireland to the US for both networking and scoping out the potential for setting up shop across the Atlantic. “The Way to Scale program brings entrepreneurs together. It’s a great networking opportunity,” Niall says. axialD is now a partner in the EU INTERREG-funded NW CAM, which brings together a network of research institutes, universities and enterprises to carry out research in advanced manufacturing. It is working with Ulster University on a number of projects, including looking at developing custom designed jigs for hospitals to produce D models. Cathy Coomber has been with axialD for three years. “What we have done in that time is looking at standardising the processes,” she says. “Biomedical engineers from Ulster University and those across the UK are producing data, manually segmenting thousands of medical images in order to help them develop an algorithm. “That allows us to massively improve our standardised process and reduce the time involved in producing those files.” That could mean reducing the time down from up to five hours, to as little as an hour. “When the company started, Daniel was able to get those early users excited in Glasgow, and then setting up in Belfast there were key surgeons which helped set the pace,” Katie McKinley, head of new business and strategic partnerships said. The company has since been involved with NHS frameworks as a means to help remove as many bottlenecks as possible. This involves developing and marketing the products to the NHS and HSC in the Republic – helping them to learn about the product, the process and what area of specialism it can be used in. “In the last  months with the development of the algorithms, we are moving in to the US,” Katie said. “We’re seeing a lot of growth in the US.” And the axialD team is also growing fast. “We have  staff at the moment but are looking to expand in  months,” Daniel said. “That includes new staff in the US to help grow and manage that market as we further expand our software team back home.” The success of axialD mirrors the overall success of Catalyst, since its inception  years ago. It’s an independent not-for-profit organisation across its four sites – including its largest base at the Titanic Quarter in Belfast, alongside its Londonderry hub, Ballymena, along with the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub at Danske Bank in Belfast city centre.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/jm_1.jpg","title":"how do you retain staff and keep them enjoying their job","story":"Posted on Wednesday September  by Ulster Business With such intense competition for talent, the challenge for employers isn’t just finding prospective candidates, it’s also keeping them, writes John Moore, managing director of Hays NI Astonishingly, almost half of professionals surveyed in the Hays What Workers Want Report said that they left at least one new job within the first  months because it didn’t match expectations formed during the application process. A signicant number of our employees at Hays have been with us for , ,  and even  years, and we pride ourselves on growing our own talent and promoting from within. Although there are times when employees leave due to circumstances employers can’t control, organisations can create the right conditions to retain their staff for as long as possible. We believe there are three key areas. A sense of purpose Across ages, cultures and sectors, professionals need to get up in the morning knowing that they can make a dference. No matter how big or small, recognising a clear and meaningful purpose in your role is a huge driver for staff. Communication is key for employers. By prioritising employee progression, offering regular feedback and communicating the wider objectives of the business, employers can ensure their staff come to work each day with a strong purpose. Variety each day While not every task can be exciting, and some parts of a job will inevitably be more stimulating than others,the mundane becomes the usual, employees will think about moving on. Injecting iety into each week and staying interested at work partly falls on employees themselves, who can proactively seize opportunities. But a good employer should also push their staff and encourage them to work outside of their comfort zones. This ensures professionals can keep growing and developing within an organisation rather than move where. A strong network The people we work with have a huge bearing on our happiness levels at work. You simply can’t stay in a role long-termyou don’t enjoy working with those around you, so the importance and impact of these relationships are not to be underrated. Employers can help their staff develop a network of inspiring and admirable colleagues from their first day by making sure they receive proper introductions and support contacts. Workers who have these strong bonds feel a greater sense of belonging which keeps them wanting to work in their organisation. With these three points in mind, it’s important to consider how someone’s organisation and role makes them feel, rather than just how impactful their salary or bonus might be. After all, this is what can’t easily be replicated across organisations and can keep an employee with an organisation throughout their career.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"new  bedroom boutique hotel planned for belfast","story":"Posted on Wednesday September  by John Mulgrew A listed Belfast building could become a new hotel and restaurant as part of wider plans for a £m revamp of the city centre. Tribeca Belfast, formerly Royal Exchange, will see UK developer Castlebrooke redevelop much of the north side of the city centre. It’s made a number of amendments and changes to the development, most notably revising back from a formerly retail-led scheme to one with fewer shops. As part of the revised plans it wants to turn the listed former Assembly Rooms building at the corner of North Street and Waring Street into a new -bedroom hotel, with a restaurant and bars. That would involve knocking down part of the newer extension to the building, including the rear part of the former Northern Bank and the adjacent - North Street to “accommodate the new extension to form the proposed boutique hotel”. “The proposals for the existing building are similar in scope to that which was included as part of the extant approval. It is proposed to conservatively repair the existing historic fabric of the former Northern Bank,” a design statement says. “A key feature of the proposed extension is that the interface with the rearelevation of the existing listed bank building will be improved by setting back the footprint of the proposed extension so that the north west corner of the original building is readable.” The scheme includes the re-use and adaptation of the existing building as well as an extension on the footprint of the existing s extension on North Street. The extension will be set over five floors, with a rooftop bar, while upper floors are set back with metal cladding to the facades to “reduce the overall massing of the building and reflect the roofing materials or upper story treatment of surrounding buildings”. Tribeca Belfast includes development around Royal Avenue, Donegall Street, North Street, Garfield Street and High Street. Castlebrooke Investments says it is now committed to bringing North Street Arcade back into use in a new format, with space designed for independent retailers. This summer the developer ran a fresh public consultation amid revised plans for the scheme, which included signicantly reducing a huge -storey building to around , retaining additional facades and dropping plans for an underground car park.

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals. What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you  Believe in yourself, be flexible and above all when opportunities present themselves to you, grab them.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
