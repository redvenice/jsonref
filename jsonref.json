So he would speak to you in poems, and sometimes, he\u0027d talk in riddles, and it would be like: \u0027\u0027Stop that now\u0027\u0027. But we tried not to be like that,\u0027 he adds.Although Blakeley says that he doesn\u0027t know how much influence he had on West\u0027s music and art, he does admit: \u0027How much of Kanye was innate and nothing to do with us? It might have been us or might have been the environment we created. We were both musical, writers, and cultural. Did that provide the path to wherever he is?\u0027 Although West was different, he didn\u0027t get bullied and would stand up for himself, a trait he shared with everyone in his family.\u0027He was a tough little kid, not bully-able in any way, shape or form. I remember one time he was out in the park, a boy who was ten or eleven, and Kanye was only five, took his Frisbee and threw it in the tree,\u0027 says Blakeley.\u0027Kanye told him to get it down, but this boy just played around with him, so Kanye socked him, pow, he kicked his a**, regardless of his size. There\u0027s not this intellectual, nerdy reticence in him. There\u0027s nobody in his family like that, they\u0027re forthright and aggressive.\u0027But the family did go to church and Sunday School every week. Donda says in her book that they\u0027d attend Christ Universal Temple in Chicago, a black megachurch on the South Side: \u0027I wanted Kanye to be steeped in that kind of exposure to God.\u0027It\u0027s a little known fact that West also went to a \u0027positive thinking\u0027 kindergarten for black children called the New Concept Development Center, where he was taught Swahili by Donda\u0027s trusted friend and fellow professor, Haki Madhubuti.          The star\u0027s very first music studio was his bedroom on Longwood Drive, Blue Island (pictured) - which is now an abandoned, ramshackle home, until his mother booted him out for playing his music 247          Blakeley said him and Donda \u0027installed into him an unshakable belief in his own talents, we encouraged him, and when he does things different, you don\u0027t judge anything he does\u0027When Donda and West went to China, they traveled to Thailand, frequenting the red light district of Bangkok and visiting nude beaches on Koh Samui. They also slummed it in the infamous Chungking Mansions, in Hong Kong, a ghetto block, notorious for its sex workers and drug peddlers.According to her book, Donda reveals: \u0027Once, Kanye and I literally took the slow boat from Canton to Hong Kong, where we\u0027d spend two weeks before going on to visit Thailand. \u0027In Hong Kong, we stayed in what became known as Slum King Mansion. The bath was down the hall and the room was definitely no-frills. The cost was eleven US dollars a night, if that tells you anything.EXCLUSIVE: \u0027If Donda was alive he wouldn\u0027t be married to...Jay-Z insists he WASN\u0027T dissing Kanye West over his Trump...\u0027Congrats on influencing all your fans\u0027: Shock as teetotal...Share this article\u0027When we got to Thailand we visited Bangkok first. Kanye went right along to the red-light district with me. From there it was on to Koh Samui. The beaches there are some of the most beautiful in the world. \u0027I was totally embarrassed, though, when one of the professors (also a Catholic priest) asked Kanye what was the favorite part of his holiday. Kanye answered: \u0027\u0027The nude beaches in Thailand\u0027\u0027.\u0027But this is nothing compared to the revelations that Donda reveals about West\u0027s sexual habits when he was approaching his teenage years.She wrote: \u0027I talked with him about it, like I talked with him about everything. There was no topic that was off limits, not even sex. When he was twelve, that conversation came up.\u0027It was my time to car pool and Kanye was in the car along with two of his friends. Jocelyn Elders came on the radio and, as I remember it, she was talking about the rise of teenage pregnancy.\u0027  Blakeley said: \u0027He was a little boy, preschool. He was off the scale. One time, someone asked him when they were looking at his drawings: \u0027Do you want to be an artist when you grow up?\u0027 He said: \u0027I am an artist\u0027. The ego\u0027s always been there!\u0027          Donda revealed in her book that she encouraged Kanye to masturbate rather than having sex with girlfriends at a young age. She added: \u0027I found out later my words had sunk in because Kanye told me so\u0027Donda continues in the book: \u0027That\u0027s when I told Kanye and his friends that masturbation was a far better alternative to having sex at such a young age.  \u0027I told them it was perfectly healthy, normal, and gratifying and that they did not have to participate in sex with another partner and risk some young lady getting pregnant or contracting a venereal disease, not the least of which was AIDS. They said nothing.\u0027They just sat there anxious for us to get to school I\u0027m sure, so they could get out of that car. I found out later my words had sunk in because Kanye told me so.\u0027After coming back from China, the pair moved home several times.          Blakeley had a special relationship with West, Donda revealed in her 2007 biography, Raising Kanye, which was published just before she diedThe star\u0027s very first music studio was his bedroom on Longwood Drive, Blue Island - which is now an abandoned, ramshackle home, until his mother booted him out for playing his music 247.Donda reveals: \u0027Kanye spent hours and hours mixing, rapping, and writing. It was nonstop. He became so involved that his socializing revolved around that studio in his room.\u0027That thumping bass line seemed to shake the very foundation of our house. Boom-boom-boom day and night. There were all sorts of people coming in and out of the house. \u0027Mainly it was the thundering bass that was no longer welcome—not all day and all night, anyway. I finally had to say to Kanye: \u0027You\u0027re moving\u0027.\u0027Another of his former homes, a tiny, rundown apartment on Lake Bluff Drive, Tinley Park, is where West saw the apparition of Christ - Yeezus meets Jesus!Donda reveals: \u0027One day Kanye was playing in the dining room of our first home in Chicago, a third-floor apartment on the South Side. \u0027All of a sudden, he looked toward the door and the staircase leading down. He pointed and said, \u0027Look, there goes Jesus!\u0027 My heart raced. I saw energy.           Blakeley watched Kanye grow up from the age of three to 11 and even bought Donda and Kanye their first home on South Shore Drive in Chicago (pictured)  The house was meant to be turned into a community center for the youth, but arguments between a charity named after Donda and Kanye means it hasn\u0027t happened yet\u0027To this day, I believe it was Christ giving us just a little extra protection that day. Neither Kanye nor I have spoken of it since.\u0027But it was very real to me and just one of the reasons I think Kanye is connected in a special way or for a special purpose. God has chosen him to not only reach but also touch millions.\u0027 Kanye\u0027s first job was as a busboy collecting plates at the American diner chain Bob Evans.Although, according to Donda, \u0027he decided immediately that bussing tables was not something that would work for him. He quit on his first day before he even started.\u0027When West finally broke onto the music scene, he moved to New York, where he found an apartment at the Hudson Tea Building, in New Jersey, directly across the river from Manhattan, as can be seen in our images.\u0027We rented it, sight unseen. It was $850 a month, with a living room and a step-up great room with a glass ceiling. You could actually look up and see the sky. It was wonderful. And Kanye was inspired...\u0027Kanye loved that place. He called up his friends and said, \u0027Man, you should see this place. It\u0027s like something off of TV.\u0027 Kanye was exactly where he wanted to be. He was on his way to fulfilling his dream,\u0027 says Donda in her book.  "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/11/15/16/03B6E933000003E8-0-image-m-8_1542300429456.jpg","title":"How Yoko Ono relentlessly pursued John Lennon","story":"John Lennon became mesmerized by Yoko Ono (pictured in 1968) after she relentlessly pursued him everywhere he went – in person and with letters, a new book claims           The superstar\u0027s aunt Mimi called Yoko a poisoned dwarf and John\u0027s band mates Paul, Ringo and George did not want her sitting in on album recording sessions or label meetings. Pictured: Yoko in the studio with the Beatles (pictured in 1969)          But by 1972, the \u0027dazzle had gone out of their lives\u0027. The only way out Yoko could see was to get John a mistress and she set up the relationship with May Pang, 22, (pictured with John in the 1970s) a beautiful Chinese girl who had been working for the coupleTheir relationship would lead to suffocation for John and he talked of orce while Yoko had found her métier running the iconic British band\u0027s empire.\u0027Her detractors, however, and there are many, point to some clever plotting and attention-seeking behavior on her behalf\u0027, writes Connolly. \u0027A little-known avant-garde artist who was wishing to make a name for herself in a new country could do no better than by finding a way of association with the Beatles, and especially John Lennon, whose every action was newsworthy and was now rich enough to be a very important person\u0027.The Beatles lived in a feel-good party bubble for two years after finishing their first North American tour in the summer of 1964.           Author Ray Connolly writes in Being John Lennon: A Restless Life that Yoko found a way to make a name for herself through John Lennon was already taking Preludin, an amphetamine, to keep up the intense booking schedule, as well as drinking alcohol.When Bob Dylan introduced the band to marijuana, consumption quickly progressed to smoking it for breakfast.LSD became John\u0027s next drug of choice and he took acid while reading a book by Timothy Leary about destroying your ego.Lennon\u0027s drug habits caused him to start panicking about death threats to the group, who were then confined to their hotel while touring.When crowds started spitting at them, the band decided it was time to \u0027give rock a rest.\u0027\u0027It was f***ing humiliation,\u0027 John said. \u0027One has to completely humiliate oneself to be what the Beatles were.\u0027The whole Beatle thing was just beyond comprehension. I was eating and drinking like a pig, and I was as fat as a pig\u0027.\u0027The Ku Klux Klan had nailed Beatles albums to burning crosses and radio stations began to ban the playing of Beatles records,\u0027 writes the author.\u0027To John, ever dissatisfied with the way things were, the idea of a spiritual rebirth, a starting again, was always attractive\u0027.The group went their separate ways - George went to India, Paul composed music for a movie, Ringo took a holiday and John went to Spain before returning to London.          The Beatles (above in 1965) lived in a feel-good party bubble for two years after making their first North American tour in summer of 1964. Lennon was already taking Preludin, an amphetamine, to keep up the intense booking schedule, as well as drinking alcohol          Yoko, a heroin addict, turned up in Lennon\u0027s (pictured in 1969) life during a time when he was seeking a spiritual rebirth and turned him onto her drug of choice, and she would eventually be instrumental in breaking up the BeatlesEnter Yoko Ono, who always claimed that their meeting at the Indica Gallery in London was \u0027purely by accident\u0027.John had been dropped off at the gallery by owner John Dunbar. He viewed the art as a con and suspected that he was being hustled to buy something.Downstairs he was introduced to \u0027a very small Japanese lady wearing a black sweater and black trousers, peering out from between two curtain folds of long black hair\u0027.She was preparing her exhibition opening the following day and was in London with her current husband and child, Kyoko.Yoko claimed she hadn\u0027t recognized John \u0027although she had insisted to Dunbar that a Beatle be invited\u0027, writes the author.One of her art pieces was a board with a chain and a hammer hanging on it and a bunch of nails at the bottom.John asked: \u0027Can I hammer a nail in it\u0027? \u0027No\u0027, she said and walked away.She came back and asked for five shillings. Lennon had no money on him and said he would give her five imaginary shillings to hammer in an imaginary nail.She later contacted Lennon and asked him for an original music score for a short film. He sent lyrics to one of the Beatles\u0027 songs but John didn\u0027t know that she had initially asked Paul who refused her request.\u0027Yoko had broken into the orbit of the Beatles\u0027, writes the author.A few weeks after the Indica Gallery meeting, she showed up at the Beatles\u0027 office in Mayfair hoping to speak to John.She wanted financial backing to wrap the statues of the lions in Trafalgar Square in canvas.          Yoko had John finance her art project that featured a room that had half of every object. Pictured: Yoko sitting in her \u0027half bedroom\u0027 in 1968          Yoko has always claimed that she met John at the Indica Gallery in London \u0027purely by accident\u0027. Yoko claimed she hadn\u0027t recognized John \u0027although she had insisted to Dunbar that a Beatle be invited\u0027, writes the author. Pictured: The couple in 1971In John\u0027s absence, she pitched the idea to Ringo who was \u0027non plussed --- and commented she might just as well have been speaking in Japanese for the little he understood of her plan\u0027.\u0027From the very beginning of her career, she understood the power of networking and self-promotion especially self-promotion,\u0027 according to Connolly, a veteran journalist and screenwriter who John befriended in the late 1960s.Yoko\u0027s next move was to send John a copy of her self-published book of \u0027instructional poems\u0027 called Grapefruit.One poem was: \u0027Stir inside of your brains with a penis until things are mixed up. Take a walk. Smoke everything you can, including your pubic hair\u0027.John \u0027felt that she was the star and he the audience\u0027.He hadn\u0027t felt that for a long time. She was an enigma to him. Never had he met anyone like this \u0027odd little Japanese woman dressed in her black intellectual\u0027s uniform,\u0027 writes the author.In the summer of 1967, the Sgt. Pepper album was released, while John was still high on LSD and feeling \u0027needles of jealousy\u0027 towards Paul for his clever songwriting.Beatles manager Brian Epstein was dead of an accidental overdose of sleeping pills, leaving John feeling guilty having introduced his old friend to pills.John knew years earlier that Epstein, openly gay, had fallen in love with him. It made John question his own sexuality and he once let Brian pleasure him him but then he later turned on him and called him a \u0027queer Jew\u0027. Throughout all of this, Yoko was writing letters to John, getting under his skin and suddenly was everywhere he was.She even showed up at a meeting that John, Paul and Jane Asher had with a yogi in the Indian Himalayas.          Throughout all of this, Yoko was writing letters to John (pictured in 1969), getting under his skin and suddenly was everywhere he was. She even showed up at a meeting that Paul and Jane Asher had with a yogi in the Indian HimalayasYoko wrote John multiple times a week while he was in India. He collected the letters at the post office so his wife, Cynthia, would be none the wiser.Yoko never quit the chase and John made up his mind to orce Cynthia, his high school Brigitte Bardot fantasy, and leave his wife and child for Yoko. Yoko, seven years John\u0027s senior, was born in Tokyo, her father a wealthy banker and a Christian, her mother a Buddhist. When her father was posted to a position in the U.S. and the family moved to Scarsdale, New York, Yoko enrolled at Sarah Lawrence College in Yonkers but dropped out after meeting a Japanese composer, Toshi Ichiyanagi, studying at the Julliard School, a performing arts conservatory.They were married and with little money, Yoko waitressed to support her bohemian lifestyle and her conceptualist art.\u0027If she received any reviews at all, they were usually critical, but criticism and rejection never stopped her\u0027, writes the author. \u0027Her belief in herself was total\u0027.She had affairs during that short-lived marriage and the couple separated with Yoko returning to Japan and putting on one of her conceptual art \u0027events\u0027.Failing to ignite any excitement, she was institutionalized by her husband and family after overdosing on sleeping pills.American filmmaker, Tony Cox pursued Yoko in Japan and helped her get out of the hospital. She got pregnant, quickly orced Toshi and married Cox.Cox delivered the baby at home and continued to do most of the childcare for their daughter. When fame eluded Yoko in Japan, she returned to New York.          Yoko, seven years John\u0027s senior, was born in Tokyo, her father a wealthy banker and a Christian, her mother a Buddhist. When her father was posted to a position in the U.S. and the family moved to Scarsdale, New York.

There were no reviews.Invited to appear at a symposium in London, she reconnected with John who \u0027finally found someone who was balmy as I am\u0027, John told his friend Pete Shotton.Yoko and John became a couple and a brand -- JohnandYoko -- and the \u0027poisoned dwarf\u0027 finally got her wish. \u0027She was becoming famous\u0027.They were never apart for the next three years before moving to Manhattan in 1971.With Yoko, he was no longer the front man as he was with the Beatles and never away from her side.Ronnie Spector, 75, reveals the moment her \u0027abusive\u0027...Tantalising secrets of The Beatles buried in the White...John Lennon\u0027s killer reveals he purposely used hollow...Share this articleThey dressed in matching white suits and both parted their long hair down the middle. John insisted that Yoko be at all recording sessions –inhibiting to the other Beatles and helped escalate the final demise of the band.Yoko had already expressed she didn\u0027t like rock and roll music and viewed it as culturally crude. She made suggestions in a field she knew nothing about.She was staging her own \u0027events\u0027 that critics viewed as \u0027Yoko\u0027s vanity projects that John was funding. Interest in them was low to non-existent,\u0027 writes the author.John sued Cynthia for orce citing adultery, a charge later withdrawn and reversed to John\u0027s uncontested adultery.Now he could marry Yoko but she was still married to Cox who had originally encouraged Yoko to pursue John as an art patron and she owed him a lot of money.          Inseparable, John insisted that Yoko be at all recording sessions –inhibiting to the other Beatles and helped escalate the final demise of the band. Pictured: John and Yoko in one of the last photos of John before he was shot dead in 1980 \u0027He got her out of the mental hospital in Japan, he kept her going, raised money for her shows...went after all the publicity, found backers for her films, borrowed money from banks...\u0027 writes the author, and now she was dumping him for someone rich and famous.John was blinded by Yoko and saw her as the most intelligent woman he had ever met as well as being very beautiful.The workforce at Apple Records didn\u0027t like Yoko and remembered her as \u0027a very pushy broad with not an ounce of humble in her\u0027.Mimi, John\u0027s aunt, told a reporter, \u0027I didn\u0027t like the look of her from the start\u0027. \u0027My God, what\u0027s that?\u0027 she said on first sight and dubbed her \u0027the poisoned dwarf\u0027.Little did Mimi know at the time that Yoko introduced heroin to John who began sniffing it regularly. John and Yoko were busted for hash, traces of marijuana and half a gram of morphine. John\u0027s own arrest didn\u0027t phase him. \u0027I was stoned all the time and just didn\u0027t give a s**t\u0027, he told Connelly.He was so stoned, he no longer cared about the once magical writing relationship with McCartney.While John was \u0027lost in the glow of love\u0027, he never recognized that Yoko was generating ill from fans and the general public who hated her music.          While John was \u0027lost in the glow of love\u0027, he never recognized that Yoko was generating ill from fans and the general public who hated her music. Neither did the other Beatles who wanted to get the group back to being only four          After Yoko gave her blessing to May and John (pictured together in 1974), the pair escaped to Los Angeles and stayed together for eighteen months. Yoko phoned John a dozen times a day still high on heroinThey just didn\u0027t like her – and neither did the other Beatles who wanted to get the group back to being only four. \u0027I think you\u0027re both nuts, the pair of you\u0027, Ringo told John.Yoko had driven a wedge between John and Paul as well as into the management battle and the new agent asking for a larger percentage.Life at the Dakota apartment building on Manhattan\u0027s Upper West Side where the couple lived turned into suffocation for the Beatle. John spent hours sleeping or staring mutely at the TV.\u0027The dazzle had gone out of their lives\u0027, writes the author. The myth of perfect love evaporated by 1972.The only way out Yoko could see was to get John a mistress and she set up the relationship with May Pang, 22, a beautiful Chinese girl who had been working for the couple.The pair escaped to Los Angeles and stayed together for eighteen months.Yoko phoned John a dozen times a day.John was now happier than he had been in years --- until Yoko rang saying she had found a cure for John\u0027s cigarette smoking – hypnotism and that could only take place at the Dakota.May wasn\u0027t invited to the session and off John went in January 1975.John never revealed what transpired during the session but he became quite ill and the author suggests some kind of aversion therapy transpired.John saw May on the sly but he was back in the grip of Yoko.          \u0027She was more than a wife to him. She was more like a mother. \u0027Perhaps that was why he began to call her Mother\u0027. Pictured: John and Yoko in November of 1980 \u0027She had needed him for his fame and the cachet it gave her, for his money and the limousines. She made him feel clever and not just a rock and roller. Now as she ran the Dakota apartment and staff, and sat in his place on the Apple board, she seemed to offer to bring order to his life\u0027, writes Connolly.\u0027She was more than a wife to him. She was more like a mother. \u0027Perhaps that was why he began to call her Mother\u0027.She took control of all of John\u0027s finances and became his manager.But his muse was dried up and for the next four years, John was rarely seen in public.He had nowhere to go, no one to see and spent time watching Dumbo cartoons with their young son, Sean.He became anorexic thin and was sure that the FBI was listening in on all his calls. No calls from friends were put through to him. \u0027Yoko has him all locked up\u0027, Mick Jagger said.\u0027Yoko had found her métier in life – she ran the busy Lennon empire\u0027 – according to whether or not Mercury was in retrograde.Lennon\u0027s days were spent living on the fringes of \u0027a world that Yoko was running without him\u0027.It was only when John went on a stormy sailing trip from Cape Town, South Africa to Bermuda that he regained his self-confidence and sense of self-worth.On his return he was ready to write and record again. But it wasn\u0027t to be.John was shot dead by Mark David Chapman on December 8, 1980 outside of the Dakota.Thirty-eighty years after the crime, Chapman remains in Attica State Prison. Ray Connolly\u0027s Being John Lennon: A Restless Life is available here. "},{"url":null,"title":"The Royal wee Princess Charlotte stuns punters nips south London pub use toilet","story":"    Princess Charlotte added an extra royal engagement to her brief public life – an unexpected visit to a south London pub to use the loo, MailOnline can reveal          The fourth in line to the throne nipped into the Phoenix in Stockwell with her mother to use the ladies after she was caught short while travelling down the notoriously busy A3 trunk road          Regulars and staff were stunned by the visit with one punter joking: \u0027It just goes to show that the royals are like any other family.

Polka dots are a huge trend right now, and you really can\u0026#39t go wrong with classic navy and white, right? Oh we can\u0026#39t forget to mention quite how flattering the pleated skirt is.

Samantha is pictured right with Meghan years ago          Dooley also revealed he remains extremely close to his grandfather Thomas Markle (pictured in June), who he described as a \u0027loving teddy bear\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s the hardest part, the fact that there is no privacy. It is hard to deal with.\u0027 Dooley revealed he is currently estranged from his father, who earlier this year released a public letter begging Prince Harry not to marry Meghan. \u0027The only family I have left now are my mom, brother, and grandfather,\u0027 Dooley said. \u0027We are still close and fine but for the rest of my family, their lives are lived out in the tabloids and that is the hardest thing.\u0027 \u0027I have to read what\u0027s going on in my family in the news because I don\u0027t even speak to them.\u0027 While Dooley hasn\u0027t spoken to Meghan in three years, he defended his aunt and said she doesn\u0027t deserve the way Samantha and his father have spoken about her. \u0027Meghan has always been a hard worker,\u0027 he said. \u0027I know she focused on her passion and trying to make a name for herself.\u0027           Meghan (pictured age 11) is seen next to Dooley, her father Thomas Markle Sr, Dooley\u0027s brother Thomas, and Samantha Markle \u0027She was a young girl with big ambitions.

He bent over backwards for her.\u0027 Dooley described Thomas Markle as a \u0027loving teddy bear\u0027 who was a \u0027very good parent\u0027 to the future Duchess of Sussex. \u0027Whether that contradicts reports that are out, I don\u0027t care,\u0027 he said. \u0027Because I can tell you on record he is a very kind, caring, loving person who adores Meghan. \u0027I would stand by that every day of the week.\u0027 Dooley hasn\u0027t met his aunt\u0027s husband, but only has nice things to say about Prince Harry and hopes he might one day meet his future cousins. \u0027I am a fan of Prince Harry.

But just after two years in 1925, the BBC assumed full editorial control and by 1937 the publication was in-house.Soon the magazine developed a reputation for featuring leading writers and illustrators.After the launch of the first 405-line television service by the BBC, the magazine reflected regular broadcast with TV listings, which began on 23 October 1936.

(stock image)Before I describe her reaction, I should explain for the benefit of younger readers how things stood at that particular moment. We’d been through a social revolution whose outcomes now are entirely taken for granted. The young, I’ve noticed, tend to act as though nothing has happened.They have little or no sense of history. The miracles worked by previous generations — they’re as ordinary as life itself. But as everyone who takes an interest should know, the entire debate began innumerable centuries before, with Plato perhaps, or with Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein, or with Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace, or the speculations of Alan Turing, or when, at the dawn of the third millennium, a computer program, learning from its own mistakes by way of deep neural networks and ‘self-play’, defeated a Grandmaster at the ancient Chinese game of Go.Or, most significantly, when the first android became pregnant by a human and the first viable carbon-silicon baby was born. Only three streets away from my apartment, in a delightful little square lined with cafés and shaded by pollarded plane trees, there’s a statue in Molly’s honour.You would think that there was nothing unusual in such a monument. Except that a pretty girl of eight in T-shirt and jeans, hands on hips, stands boldly before us on a plinth in place of a general, or a poet or an astronaut.Could a machine be conscious? Or put another way, were humans merely biological machines? The affirmative answers to both questions consumed many decades of international wrangling between neuroscientists, bishops, philosophers, politicians and the general public.Finally, long after it was due, artificial people were granted full protection under various human rights conventions. So too were their mixed-source off-spring.Other rights properly followed, including benefit of marriage, property ownership, of passports, voting and employment protection. An android could start a business, get rich, be bankrupt, sued, and murdered as opposed to destroyed.Around the world there developed various ‘autonomy’ acts which made it illegal to buy or own a manufactured person. The legal language self-consciously invoked the anti-slavery acts of the nineteenth century.With rights came responsibilities — military service was an uncontroversial, irresistible matter. On jury service, androids were a useful addition, given all the cognitive defects and weak, pliable memory of humans.Ours was the generation that came of age in the aftermath — turbulent years of passion and anguished reflection. What it meant to be human was being interestingly, or tragically, extended. If the consensus of the scientific elites was that our newly devised friends felt pain and joy and remorse, how could we prove it?EU judges will hand down crucial ruling on whether Britain...The Rolling Stones\u0027 darkest hit Sympathy for the Devil turns...Share this articleWe had been asking the same question about other humans since the dawn of philosophical reflection. Should we be troubled or delighted that they were, on the whole, cleverer, kinder, more beautiful than we were? Were the religious among us wrong to refuse to grant them souls?Then, as so often happens with contested social change, once these matters were talked out and the legislation approved, life moved on and soon no one could remember what all the fuss had been about. It’s often said that the great questions of philosophy are never resolved: they fade away.All those protest marches, monographs, speeches, conferences and dire predictions were for nothing. After all, our new friends seemed much like us, only more likeable. You could trust them, which is why so many went into law, banking and politics and began much-needed reasonable reform of those institutions. Their natures were deeply caring, and many became doctors and nurses. They were strong and fast and made up two thirds of our Olympic track and field team, though sprint hurdling took another fifteen years to perfect.Famously, they showed themselves brilliant musicians and composers in all forms of music. If ever we worried that they seemed a little too good at everything, we could congratulate ourselves that they were our creation, in our image, the final full flowering of our artistic and technical genius. They were, we often said, the better angels of our nature.By slow steps, though much remarked on, and affecting social life as well as legal process, it came to be understood and generally accepted that our crafted con-specifics deserved full dignity, and respect for their privacy. That’s to say, in a matter of years it became socially unacceptable — as was not the case in our youth — to ask.For example, at a gala dinner for a major book prize, you could not enquire of your charming neighbour at table, prompted by a rather too astute remark of his, if he, a highly respected publisher, was a bio-silicate based, locally manufactured artefact. Twenty years before, you could have — indeed, it would have been the first thing you wanted to know. It would have been no more than a casual preliminary. Just as if you had said, I hear you have a second home in Thuringia. So do I!With all the last mutinous mutterings about political correctness fading away, along with the stupid old ‘they live among us’ scare stories, it became offensive, even prurient to ask, since your enquiry would be, in essence, grossly physical, given that the matter of ascribing consciousness had long been settled. It would be no less intrusive than asking of a human over the chocolate mousse, Is it really true? Everyone’s saying you’ve had a colostomy!Another example. When Mrs Tabitha Rapting became prime minister with a parliamentary majority of two, there were those who wondered if she was ‘real’ — another hurtful word that has been dropped.But the point is this — socially, we had already crossed a great ide, for such wondering was not done in public. Only in golf club bars, or on street protest marches by marginal, radical groups. It would have been indecent, obscene, akin to racism, and therefore probably illegal. That was all long ago, and even now we’re still not sure when an android first became prime minister. Or if one ever has. Or whether we’ve lived under an unbroken succession of them.Nor do we know whether (or if) an android has ever taken the men’s or women’s singles championship at Wimbledon. Or if a human has won it these past twenty years.So if my question to Jenny that sultry July evening seems despic-able to younger readers, let me remind them that I belong to a generation that lived through the transition. As gruesome adolescents with an unforgivable taste for taunting women passers-by in shopping malls, we thought we knew a dozen ways to test the difference. We were wrong, of course — not that we would have cared.Beyond DNA analysis or deep micro-surgery, there are no means of knowing. But we knew we could always demand an answer from the victims of our taunts, and the answer was programmed always to be truthful — until that too began to change.Jenny, I’m proud to remember, did not take offence. She drew closer to me. Her eyes, now open and deep and black, were fixed on mine. She felt — words can barely perform the task — liquid, smooth, warm, enveloping. Sentient and sensual. Oh, such a loveable self. A bolt of love and pleasure threatened to render me deaf. But my curiosity was so strong that I heard every word she said. Moments like these are what we’ll take to the edge of the grave.          Ian McEwan, pictured in March this yearThe kiss we exchanged before she spoke was tender and rapturous. Her lips, her tongue — miracles, however they were formed. I knew, even before I had my answer, that I would never leave her. So why should it matter what she was made of?‘You’re mine.’ She said it as a matter of plain fact. She had uttered these words occasionally during our lovemaking and they had always pleased me. ‘And I belong to you. Everything else is froth.’ Because she paused, I disloyally wondered if these endearments, however sincere, were a form of evasion. But how dared I doubt her?‘I thought you already knew. I was formed in Dusseldorf in Greater France. So were my parents and the aunts you’re so nice to. But the cousin you met in the restaurant, the one you tried to beat at squash, he’s from Taiwan.’‘Dusseldorf!’ It was all I could manage, though the final syllable was no more than a swallowing sound, for I believed I was disappearing. Such mighty sensations belonged not to me but to the world of things, to the emptiness between things, to the essence of matter and space. Around those two entities there rose an obliterating tide of ecstasy. Such confirmation of her strange and beautiful otherness thrilled the world that included me to a vanishing point of oblivious singularity.Within seconds I had, in the colourful phrase of my shopping mall adolescence, ‘cartwheeled over the windmill’. Feebly clutching at my heart, I briefly fainted. How it shamed me to be such a selfish lover — and as I returned to the present moment I told her so. Of course, it was in her nature to forgive.I was in love and there was no turning back. But now I knew for certain something about her that I would need to bear in mind. Her processing speeds ran at half the speed of light. She could think a million times faster than me. Tact and other considerations would oblige her not to show it.But if we were to live together, I would have to acknowledge that it would be tricky for me to win an argument or counter any decision she made. In the instant it might take me to shrug and look away from her to gather my thoughts, she could have rehearsed in private reflection most of what was known about human nature and the history of civilisation.So, there it is, this is how it was for me. My generation straddled one of the great clefts or rifts in that lengthening mountain range we routinely call the story of modernity. Believe me, if you have never apologised to a machine for posing the indelicate question, then you have no concept of the historical distance that I and my generation have travelled.Ian McEwan’s new novel, Machines Like Me, will be published by Jonathan Cape on April 18, 2019. "},{"url":null,"title":"Prince Charles member Royal Family visit Cuba","story":"    Prince Charles (pictured above) will become the first member of the royal family to visit CubaPrince Charles is set to become the first member of the Royal Family to visit Cuba on a historic official tour next year.The ground-breaking visit to the Communist country is still in the early stages of planning and has not been confirmed yet.But government officials from both countries are ‘extremely hopeful’ it will happen in the next few months, possibly as early as the spring, the Mail can reveal.It is understood that Charles met with the new Cuban president, Miguel Diaz-Canel, at Clarence House last month, which is being viewed by diplomats as an extremely positive sign.The trip, which will be part of a large-scale Caribbean tour, would have been unthinkable just a few years ago, as the country was emerging from six decades of leadership under the dictator Fidel Castro and his family.In 2016 Barack Obama became the first US president to visit in 88 years, but no British Prime Minister has ever set foot on Cuban soil.With the Queen no longer undertaking foreign travel, the prince’s official trips are akin to a state visit and will be viewed as a significant step forward in Britain’s relationships with the once Soviet-backed Cuba, particularly in a post-Brexit world.Revealed: Prince William invited Tony Blair to Kensington...Charles shows Theresa how it\u0027s done!

Fidel Castro (pictured above) was the longest-ruling non-royal national leader since 1900 by term length (52 years, 101 days)Charles, 70, who will be accompanied by his wife, the Duchess of Cornwall, 71, will have to tread carefully, however, as the unprecedented visit is likely to be viewed with caution in the US.In 2014, President Obama announced plans to normalise diplomatic relations with the country after talks with the then president, Raul Castro, Fidel’s younger brother. Relations had been severed for more than 50 years, since the failed Bay of Pigs invasion and Soviet missile crisis.He also lifted trade sanctions and made it easier for Americans to travel and do business there in the hope of improving living conditions and slowly gaining influence over the future of the Communist nation.But in June last year, President Trump overturned aspects of his predecessor’s policies, arguing leniency had achieved nothing. He cited a mysterious spate of illnesses among US diplomats in Havana and ordered most employees of his embassy to leave.He also expelled Cuban diplomats from Washington and revoked travel and business freedoms.His decisions have allowed, many officials believe, the likes of China and Russia to gain a foothold on the island just 90 miles off the US coast. The new Cuban president visited Communist-run Russia, China, North Korea, Vietnam and Laos last month.But UK diplomats hope a visit by a senior royal will help to extend Britain’s global reach in the country, particularly once Britain has left the EU. The Government will be keen to encourage a more modern, open and free Cuba, and push for greater protection for citizens in a country which has a poor human rights record, especially when it comes to arbitrary imprisonment, unfair trials, freedom of expression and the use of digital media.    The trip to Cuba (pictured above) will be part of a wider Caribbean tour Charles is likely to highlight local entrepreneurship as well as point to Britain as a potential trade and investment partner. The Cuban government is actively seeking inward foreign investment as it tries to grow its economy, which is struggling with heavy state controls and lower global commodity prices.It is anticipated that climate change and environmental issues will also feature heavily on any future royal itinerary in a region blighted by increasingly unpredictable weather patterns, such as hurricanes, and by plastics.The UK recently told the United Nations it recognises Cuba’s positive steps in combating human trafficking but remains concerned about restrictions to the freedom of expression and the treatment of prisoners, issues which Charles is expected to raise indirectly.Clarence House last night declined to comment on the prospect of a royal visit."},{"url":null,"title":"Experts lift lid numbers sweet Christmas tubs","story":"    A Nestle spokesman said the Quality Street assortment was made up of three different types of sweet – fruit cremes, chocolates, and toffees and fudge.

If this was reflected in the contents, this would mean 11 to go round, yet there was only five.However, just 12 per cent listed the strawberry delight as their favourite, which should equate to no more than five per tub – yet there was double the number, meaning they are most likely to be left among the wrappers.Delving into Heroes, researchers found there were very few fans of the eclair, yet there was an average of 12 per box. By contrast there were only nine of the popular Wispas and just six of the Twirls.

So if you\u0027ve seen the original movie, you\u0027ll know what comes next.For the first film, the action was set in Edwardian London in 1910. For the sequel, it takes place in the capital in 1934.Mary is called back to help her former charge Michael Banks, now a father-of-three, played by Ben Whishaw, who is despondent over the death of his wife and money problems which means he risks losing their home.Also helping to care for his children is his sister Jane, played by Emily Mortimer, who takes after her campaigning suffragette mother by becoming a union activist.When Michael dumps his old kite in the bin, it is picked up by his youngest son Georgie, who flies it the park nearby — only to bring it down to earth with Mary Poppins attached.For Mary\u0027s grand re-entrance, costume designer Sandy Powell says it was essential that the character\u0027s new reincarnation cut a recognisable silhouette.\u0027You\u0027re trying to do another version of an iconic look. And, in a way, her character can\u0027t change too much as she\u0027s always the same person like Peter Pan or James Bond.\u0027To bring her up to date, Mary\u0027s skirt has a shorter hemline, she wears a double cape made of cobalt blue and carries a carpet bag with a Thirties Art Deco design.Sandy says: \u0027Traditionally, a nanny\u0027s coat would have been navy blue, but I wanted Mary to add brightness to a dark, grey world\u0027.Despite her dainty landing, Emily Blunt admitted she was terrified while filming the arrival scene because of her fear of heights.Emily says: \u0027I was 50ft in the air and so scared. As I landed, one of the camera guys came up and said: \u0027I got really choked watching you arrive there.\u0027\u0027It reminded me people really need a film and a moment like this. Maybe we didn\u0027t realise how much we wanted Mary to come back.\u0027WHY JULIE TURNED DOWN £1 MILLION TO APPEAR          When Emily Blunt took the part, she wanted to make it her own. Rather than study the original film again she read author P.L. Travers\u0027s original eight books insteadWhen Surrey-born Emily Blunt took the part, she wanted to make it her own. Rather than studying the original film again — which she hadn\u0027t seen since she was a child — Blunt read author P.L. Travers\u0027s original eight books instead.Emily, 35, says: \u0027I decided not to be intimidated by Julie Andrews in the iconic role, and just approached it as I would any other part. No one is going to out-do Julie Andrews.\u0027Blunt found a different side to the nanny in the books, written in Thirties and Forties — \u0027a little more acerbic and vain and weird\u0027.Indeed it\u0027s a portrait the Australian-born Travers would probably have preferred, having loathed the saccharine portrayal of her creation in the first film.Emily was the only actress approached to reprise the role made famous by Sound Of Music Star Julie Andrews, now 83.And, despite a rumoured offer of over £1 million to make a cameo, Julie Andrews turned down the invitation.Director Rob Marshall says: \u0027Julie was incredibly gracious, but she made it clear right up front.\u0027She said: \u0027I really want it to be Emily\u0027s show. I really want her to take this and run with it, because she will be brilliant.\u0027 \u0027However only two members of the original onscreen Banks family survive — Glynis Johns, who is now 95, who played Mrs Banks, and Karen Dotrice, now 63, was her daughter Jane.David Tomlinson, who was strict father George Banks in the original, died in 2000 aged 83, while Matthew Garber who played his mischievous son Michael died age 21 in 1977 after catching hepatitis during a trip to India.THE MOST FAMOUS ADDRESS IN CHILDREN\u0027S BOOKS          In the original, Dick Van Dyke played doddery old banker Mr Dawes Sr, who employs Michael Banks. Now the actor reprises the role, this time as Mr Dawes\u0027s sonAmerican actor Dick Van Dyke\u0027s cockney accent as a London chimney sweep has gone down in film history for all the wrong reasons.Indeed, the actor himself has branded it the worst ever, claiming that his vocal coach was Irish and didn\u0027t know how to do one himself.          Van Dyke spent two days on set often bringing cast members like Emily Blunt to tears by singing snippets of the original songsDick, now 92, says: \u0027People in the UK love to rib me about that accent. They ask what part of England I was meant to be from and I say it was a little shire in the North where most of the people were from Ohio.\u0027In the original, Van Dyke also played doddery old banker Mr Dawes Sr, who employs Michael Banks.Now that\u0027s he\u0027s hung up his chimney brush, the actor reprises the role, this time as Mr Dawes\u0027s son, who would now be the same age — so this time Van Dyke needed no make-up to age him.Van Dyke spent two days on the set of the film, often bringing cast members like Emily Blunt to tears by singing snippets of the original songs.FROM CHIMNEY SWEEP TO LAMPLIGHTER          Meryl Streep joins the new cast as cousin Topsy Tartlet. She has a fix-it shop in which everything, from grand pianos to china and statues, turns upside down on a TuesdayIn the original film, Mary\u0027s only relative was Uncle Albert (Ed Wynn), who laughs so much he floats on the ceiling.For this outing, she is joined by her cousin, Topsy Tartlet, played by Meryl Streep.She has a fix-it shop in which everything, from grand pianos to china and statues, turns upside down on a Tuesday.As a result, the Oscar-winning actress performs her song Turning Turtle upside down from a chandelier.Designers say her shop was the most challenging of the 50 sets to build.Topsy\u0027s costume — inspired by Bohemian poet Edith Sitwell — was also the hardest to make and based on a pair of Twenties vintage pyjamas and a kimono.For three weeks, a team of ten textile artists bleached the material before hand-painting it with Art Deco patterns of orange, pink, turquoise and yellow.To complete the look, Streep asked for a vibrant orange wig cut into bob which was topped off with a green turban and curtain tassles for earrings.THE BATH THAT BECOMES AN UNDERWATER ADVENTURE          Mary and the Banks children Georgie (Joel Dawson), Anabel (Pixie Davies) and John (Nathanael Saleh) go on a series of adventures in the filmJust as they did in the first film, Mary and the Banks children Georgie (Joel Dawson), Anabel (Pixie Davies) and John (Nathanael Saleh) — embark on a series of Technicolor-style fantasy adventures.One of the most beloved in the first film was when the characters jumped into Bert\u0027s chalk pavement pictures to discover a magical world where they interact with cartoon characters.And rather than use computer-generated images, the makers returned to traditional hand-drawn animation, a technique not employed in a Disney movie for nearly ten years.However in other parts of the film, computer animation is used when a dolphin beckons the children into the bath tub — and leads them to an underwater fantasia.The mix of special effects and live action meant that, although the live filming only took four months, Mary Poppins Returns spent more than a year in post-production, as long as a science fiction movie.RETURN TO A VICTORIAN MUSIC HALL          In one scene in which the children break a Royal Doulton bowl, Mary decides the only way to fix it is to disappear inside itWhen the children break a Royal Doulton bowl, Mary decides the only way to fix it is to disappear inside it.She spins the bowl around, creating a whirlwind that transports them within.Once there, Mary Poppins picks up her umbrella, and turns it to create a tent which turns into a Victorian music hall where Jack and Mary put on a show — with dozens of dressed-up cartoon animals in the audience.Hollywood film star and cricket hero are named among 35...Share this articleTo help the character fit with the animated creations, costume designer Sandy Powell says they wanted to make the humans\u0027 clothing look two-dimensional, as if had also been drawn by the animators.The outfits were then made out of canvas-like material which was hand-painted with details like collars, buttons and bows.Sandy Powell says: \u0027I wanted the effect on all of these costumes to look like watercolour on paper with the white coming through.\u0027THE RETURN OF THE PENGUINS          In the new movie the dapper bow-tied  penguins return once more. At the time of the original movie it was a pioneering move to combine live action and animationThe scene where Dick Van Dyke as Bert performs a tap dance with a group of four bow-tied penguin waiters was one of the most beloved from the original movie.At the time it was a pioneering move to combine live action and animation — shot against a bright yellow, rather than green, screen — which was so hard on the eyes that the actor reported he couldn\u0027t see by the end of the day.Now the dapper penguins have returned once more — named after Hollywood legends, (Fred) Astaire, (Oliver) Hardy, (Cary) Grant and (Charlie) Chaplin — to perform a music hall number with Mary and Jack.As well as some of the favourites from the original movie, the film also features nine new songs written by the same team who wrote the musical Hairspray, but which are intended to sound as if they could have been written in 1964.Although she has to match the legendary singing voice of Julie Andrews, Emily Blunt also has no problem holding a musical note.Before she became an actress, she was considering career as singer until she was spotted in a school production performing at the Edinburgh Festival.A LOVE LETTER TO LONDON          The film include\u0027s so many of London\u0027s landmarks- from areas outside the Bank of England and also Buckingham PalaceThe film has been called a \u0027love letter to London\u0027, because it includes so many of the city\u0027s landmarks.Areas outside the Bank of England and also Buckingham Palace were taken over during night shoots by hundreds of extras on vintage bikes and buses borrowed from the London Transport Museum.To add to the atmosphere, mist was used to look like a pre-war fog.However, actor Lin-Manuel Miranda said using the iconic locations piled on the pressure to get the scenes right first time: \u0027The adrenaline was pumping. You\u0027re never coming back to Buckingham Palace to get a second take.\u0027Throughout the film, the set is built on many levels to show as many dancers as possible during the musical numbers.To perfect the scenes, the actors and dancers rehearsed for eight weeks to get every move perfect — even though in some scenes they had to interact with cartoon partners who were not added until after.Miranda says they had to work with instructions such as: \u0027The penguin is going to be heavier holding on to your cane. Can you show us that?\u0027In order to recreate a scene with Big Ben for the climax, the filmmakers built a giant recreation of the clock face in a studio — all to scale, after making set visits to Westminster to see how it worked close-up.Production designer John Myhre says: \u0027The clock face and sections of the tower are completely authentic and an exact reproduction of what is behind the clock face. It\u0027s a little bit of movie magic.\u0027 Mary Poppins Returns is released in the UK on Friday, December 21."},{"url":null,"title":"PM decide week pull crunch Brexit vote","story":"    Theresa May (pictured above) will decide on Monday whether to pull the crunch Brexit vote amid intense pressure to push for a delayLast night it was claimed the PM had been warned by several Brexit-backing aides that they are prepared to resign on Tuesday unless there are major changes to her deal. Mike Wood, the parliamentary private secretary to Trade Secretary Liam Fox, told the Guardian he would quit and join leave-supporting backbenchers unless changes were made.May\u0027s deal is the only way to clear the fog over Britain...DAILY MAIL COMMENT: Britain will never forgive a Brexit...Share this article    Julian Smith (pictured above) is set to present the Prime Minister with his final count of the number of Tory MPs on whose support she can relyThe paper reported Cabinet ministers have also warned Mrs May she would have to stand down if the deal is defeated and she fails to secure better terms from the European Union. Last night Amber Rudd became the first Cabinet minister to openly discuss an alternative plan to Mrs May\u0027s deal. The Work and Pensions Secretary told The Times a Norway-style arrangement \u0027seems plausible not just in terms of the country but in terms of where the MPs are\u0027. A Norway option would keep Britain tied to most EU laws and rules, including free movement and vast annual contributions.As many as ten senior ministers have privately discussed backing the option. However, one minister described it as \u0027absolutely horrendous\u0027, adding: \u0027It would split the party for a generation.\u0027It would also be the biggest betrayal of the British people. We\u0027re in real danger now.\u0027There were also signs last night that Labour is seeking to join forces with rebel Tories and the DUP to force Mrs May\u0027s resignation in a no-confidence vote if her Brexit plan is heavily defeated.In public, Downing Street continued to insist yesterday that the vote on the withdrawal agreement would go ahead as planned.

Hardline Eurosceptics argue a huge defeat would send a signal to the EU that they would need to compromise.The amendment, proposed by Tory loyalists, would give MPs a vote in 2020 over whether to enter the backstop or extend the transition period – and place a \u0027duty\u0027 on the government to have a workable alternative within a year.

But being prepared didn’t make it any less daunting.The difference in physical stature between the two — Samantha is a diminutive 5ft 4in, Kelvin around 6ft tall — was matched by the stark contrast in their circumstances.At 25, Samantha was a lowly sales assistant Kelvin was 62, worth £500 million and the much-revered chief executive of fashion empire Ted Baker. Little wonder she felt nervous. ‘As I started to pull away, he continued to hug me. I stayed there for five seconds and then thought: “This is too long,” ’ Samantha recalls.‘As I pulled back, he kissed me on my shoulder. I was wearing a sleeveless dress. We’d only just met. I was shocked and disgusted.’Samantha is one of around 100 current or former employees who’ve reported receiving unwanted advances from Kelvin while working at the multi-national clothes company he founded 30 years ago.They accuse him of harassing them with uninvited hugs and crude sexual innuendo.  CEO of Ted Baker, Ray Kelvin (left and right) has worked in the fashion industry for more than 40 years and is now facing a string of bullying and harassment allegationsIt has been claimed Kelvin forced workers to sit on his lap and massaged their ears that he discussed his sex life in their presence, asked employees about their own relationships and took his shirt off in front of staff.The allegations emerged at the start of this week after staff used employee website Organise to launch a petition for an independent body to investigate their complaints.Ted Baker founder Ray Kelvin takes temporary leave as chief...Bizarre moment Ted Baker boss, 62, embroiled in \u0027forced...Share this articleAs days passed and some 1,000 Ted Baker staff backed the petition, the claims grew more torrid.It was said Kelvin reportedly pinned a male employee against an office wall when it transpired Kelvin was not invited to his wedding, before the company reportedly paid the man and his fiancee to leave without making a fuss.Yesterday, a second senior executive was accused of unwelcome hugging and the company — which had defended its hugs as an innocuous ‘part of Ted Baker’s culture’ — announced that Kelvin was to take a voluntary leave of absence while law firm Herbert Smith Freehills carries out an ‘independent external investigation’, with immediate effect.In a statement Kelvin said ‘the accusations of the past week have raised some very serious and upsetting issues’ and it was ‘only right the board should investigate fully’.          Kelvin (pictured) is to take a voluntary leave of absence while law firm Herbert Smith Freehills carries out an ‘independent external investigation’, with immediate effectTed Baker — whose distinctive clothes have been worn by celebrities including the Duchess of Cambridge, Amal Clooney and Holly Willoughby — has seen shares plummet to a five-year low. In a statement yesterday, Kelvin said: ‘Ted Baker has been my life and soul for 30 years. I love this company and care deeply for all my colleagues.’Ironically, Kelvin, a twice-married and fiercely private father of three, has long claimed to be staunchly protective of his workers’ rights, and a man to whom the bullying renowned among many of his peers in the fashion industry is anathema.Positing himself as the polar opposite of audacious Arcadia boss Sir Philip Green, himself struggling to recover from allegations of misogyny and abuse, Kelvin shuns the limelight, saying flaunting wealth is ‘vulgar’ and ‘the world has made too much of business people becoming celebrities’.Indeed, his profile is so low that until this week, few outside the fashion industry would have heard of him.Instead of advocating a rigid hierarchy, his managerial approach seems to render professional boundaries all but obsolete.His 80,000 sq ft North London HQ, a former Post Office sorting office known as the ‘Ugly Brown Building’, where Ted Baker has been based since 2000, has hosted stress massages for employees.A sign next to Kelvin’s desk in his open plan office says ‘Hugs Here’.‘I make it my business to get to know everyone. I give them all nicknames so I remember people’s names,’ Kelvin told Vogue in 2013. ‘I want to give them a real career — a “teducation” as we call it. It’s all just one big hug.’    This is the bizarre moment Ray Kelvin, 63, embroiled in \u0027forced hugging\u0027 staff harassment scandal kisses a footballer But in the post #MeToo era, with corporate culture under ever more piercing a spotlight, this quirky approach suddenly seems rife for abuse. His attempts to appear a friendly hero are now viewed by many as a cynical ploy to exploit employees’ vulnerability.Speaking to both his allies and critics this week, the Mail discovered a complex character, whose actions appear driven as much by insecurity as arrogance and desire.The son of a factory worker, Kelvin, who has two adult sons from his first marriage and a five-year-old daughter with current wife Clare, 46, was brought up in North London, where his parents taught him ‘you had to work hard for anything you wanted’.From the day he opened his first Ted Baker store in Glasgow in 1988, selling fashionably garish men’s shirts, the moniker Ted Baker provided a fictional frontman for Kelvin to hide behind. ‘I didn’t want to use my real name,’ he said. ‘I thought I’d be a failure. I could have gone bankrupt, then my name would have always been associated with a failed company.’Ted was the suave alter ego the self-effacing Kelvin wished he could be. In contrast, Kelvin was ‘camera-shy’ and described himself as ‘ugly’ — a reason given for his bizarre habit of partially obscuring his face behind inanimate objects such as sofas, towels and books on the rare occasions he agreed to be photographed.Despite — or, indeed, because of — his unconventional approach to business, his company grew, expanding into womenswear, shoes and accessories. And when, in 1997 Ted Baker — by then worth £56 million — went public, Kelvin’s demeanour dramatically changed.Having described himself as an aggressive ‘monster’ in the early years, success brought a management style as irreverent as his £279 sparkly jumpsuits.          More than 100 staff have submitted anonymous stories of harassment on Organise, the campaign website where the petition beganTearfully, one employee stressed Kelvin’s loyalty to his workers: ‘One woman has worked here since she was 16 and is now a director. The cleaner has been here for 30 years. Every year, without fail, she wins Employee of the Year.‘One man had cancer and Ray helped with his treatment and held him in his hospital bed. Ray is the most honourable man.’These sentiments were echoed by Kelvin’s first wife, Georgia Slowe, 53, who lives five minutes away from him. A former actress in Emmerdale, she married Kelvin in 1993 and remained friends after orcing him in 2000.‘I think what’s happening is ridiculous,’ she says. Describing Kelvin as the ‘loveliest man’ she adds: ‘I think it’s wonderful to have a family-like atmosphere at work. He’s a brilliant businessman.’Perhaps so, but Kelvin — awarded a CBE for his work in fashion in 2011 — is inappropriately puerile and his humour peppered with sexual overtones. For example, he insists that even those employees in a relationship when they joined Ted Baker must have an ‘office boyfriend’ or ‘office girlfriend’.While he clearly enjoys flirting, he doesn’t limit his attention to one woman — or man. ‘He is effectively having an affair with everybody, every day,’ says one acquaintance. ‘He’s just as touchy-feely with men. He is childlike and craves attention and approval.‘I think he’s charmingly weird rather than sinister and creepy. But as Ray has got older, he has become slightly more eccentric and lost sight of the effect his actions have on others. He forgets he is old enough to be his employees’ father.’Both Samantha and Lucy tell me the senior cohort of employees surrounding Kelvin seemed happy enough hugging their boss.‘It was well known that those in the higher levels were totally fine with it,’ says Lucy, adding: ‘I don’t know if they went along with it because they were being paid a lot of money and hugging was a part and parcel of being there.’It seems to have been primarily Kelvin’s younger employees, better versed in political correctness and workplace rights than older generations, who objected enough to instigate the recent petition. ‘I can’t recall any sales associates — who were aged between 19 and 27 — who wanted to hug him,’ says Samantha. She was warned by colleagues when she started as a sales assistant this year that, should she meet Kelvin, he would hug her for ‘way too long’.She adds: ‘I was nervous, but the managers made it seem there was no choice that it was a big deal to meet the CEO of your company. I didn’t want to get into trouble.’Before her own encounter, she had already seen Kelvin kiss a male colleague on the forehead. ‘He told me afterwards he’d never felt so violated. I told him to go to human resources, but he said nothing would be done — that’s just Kelvin’s way of saying hello.’          Staff at the high street giants also accused Kelvin of making them sit on his knee and taking his shirt offWhen it happened to Samantha weeks later (with a kiss on the shoulder) she, too, kept quiet. ‘I didn’t think HR would listen,’ she says. ‘I felt disappointed and embarrassed and didn’t tell anyone.’ Instead, she made sure she was out of Kelvin’s vicinity next time he visited the store, and left his company shortly afterwards.Rumours of unhappiness have swirled around for some time, but have, until now, been contained.When Rebecca Waller-Davies, a journalist from trade publication Retail Week, suggested to Kelvin that women had been coerced into sitting on his knee this summer, he told her she was on ‘very dangerous ground’ before pulling her to a hug, kissing her cheek and claiming, ‘I am not apologising for this’ — words that, tellingly, remained unpublished until this week.As even a close acquaintance concedes: ‘I can imagine him saying that. He’s very sensitive to criticism and I know this episode will have hurt him.’Whether through loyalty or fear, no staff at any of the three Ted Baker stores the Mail visited this week would comment on their boss’s situation. When the Mail visited the London HQ to ask to speak to Kelvin, three members of staff emerged to tell our reporter he was not available.After repeated attempts to contact Kelvin for comment, a statement from Ted Baker said the company would ‘carefully consider the content and recommendations’ of the independent report.‘We have always placed great importance on our culture. It is critically important to us that every member of our staff feels valued and respected at work. We do not believe these reports are reflective of the organisation we have all worked hard to develop over the last 30 years.’Kelvin, for his part, said in a statement yesterday: ‘Ted Baker means everything to me and I can’t bear to see it harmed in any way.’Whether he can weather this storm — and whether he deserves to — is a matter of opinion.Additional reporting: STEPHANIE CONDRON"},{"url":null,"title":"Liverpool council finds 24 asylum seekers posing children","story":"    Storm: Siavash Shah claimed to be 15.

And, who knows, if it proves a hit, then the next generation of royals might grow up not just talking to plants but exclusively eating them as well.Of course, as any non meat-eater will know, alternatives to the traditional Christmas lunch have in the past been distinctly uninspiring.So when my wife announced that this year we were entertaining vegetarian friends, I decided to find something that would not only taste good, but look good, too.After hours spent searching online I came across recipes for the lesser-spotted tofu turkey — or tofurkey. Seemingly a recent American invention for Thanksgiving, at its simplest it’s a tofu ‘loaf’ filled with stuffing.          The dish may look like a meat-lover’s dream but it is actually an entirely meat-free mainOthers, in a bid to mimic a turkey crown, have developed the look by creating a dome of tofu with stuffing inside. My plan is to take it to the next level. To do so will require a bit of creativity — and lots of tofu.Made from soya beans, tofu is a staple of Asian and vegetarian cooking. It’s available from most supermarkets, comes in blocks of varying firmness and is not dissimilar in texture to halloumi cheese.For my dish I buy ten 225g packs of extra-firm tofu costing £2.50 each, enough to make a meal for ten. With other ingredients for the stuffing and the baste bringing the total cost to about £30, that compares well with a real top-notch turkey, which can cost more than £12 a kilo (carcass included) and can work out at about £80 for ten people.Of course, with a real turkey it’s simply a case of chucking it in the oven and cooking it.Making a tofurkey is more time-consuming — but following the steps below took me no more than a couple of hours.And not only is the finished product much quicker to cook — just 90 minutes — than a real turkey, but because tofu can be eaten uncooked there’s none of that anxious last-minute poking with a skewer to try to work out whether your Christmas turkey is, finally, safe to eat. Of course, the proof is in the eating — and the carving.Taking a sharp knife I’m impressed that the beautifully browned outer shell of the tofurkey actually carves in to clean, white slices that hold their shape sufficiently well to allow me to transfer them to a dinner plate.The tofu itself is fairly bland — but is saved by the flavoursome stuffing inside and the exterior baste of sesame oil, soy sauce, miso paste and mustard.Combined with a roastie, half a sprout and a splash of vegetarian gravy, it’s a pretty tasty, texture-full mouthful. And, don’t forget, real turkey can be the blandest of meats. A good Christmas lunch is all about the accompaniments.Only time will tell, of course, if my version hits the spot with my vegetarian guests. And, if not, I’m pretty confident that my own chickens won’t turn up their beaks at a turkey-free ‘turkey’ treat on Boxing Day.Now make your own:Step One: First, break up the tofu as finely as possible. I start by dicing it with a knife and then place it in a bowl and attack it with a fork and potato masher, turning it into a moist crumb. Next, I line a colander with cheese cloth (a clean tea-towel will do), and fill with the crumbled tofu, packing it tightly down with my hands as I go.Step two: For the tofu to take the shape of the colander — the turkey’s ‘torso’ — it’s important to squeeze out all the liquid. To do this I place a weight (a heavy casserole dish) on top of it and put it in the fridge overnight. With the added weight, drips of milky liquid, collected in a dish, emerge through the holes at the bottom of the colander.Step three: To make the drumsticks, I improvise with two halves of an Easter egg mould that I find in a cupboard, puncturing a few small holes in the plastic for drainage before filling with tofu.Step four: The stuffing. Follow whatever recipe you fancy, but I combine onion, mushrooms, garlic and celery with breadcrumbs and lots of herbs and seasoning. Plain tofu has little flavour, so don’t scrimp. The same goes for the baste — a generous and punchy mix of sesame oil, soy sauce, miso paste and mustard. Not only will this add flavour, but it will colour, too.Step five: Once the tofu has had time to ‘set’, remove from the fridge and, with a spoon, carefully hollow out some of the tofu from the centre of the filled colander. Make sure you leave at least an inch around the edges or it won’t be thick enough to stand up once turned out of the colander. Then fill the hollow you have created with the stuffing, placing the excavated tofu back on top of the onion mixture to seal it back in.Step six: After that, turn out the tofu mound on to a baking tray lined with tin foil, flat-side down, hump facing up. While care should be taken at this stage, the tofu should be fairly robust and easily hold its shape. Then baste generously and bake at a temperature of about 200c.After an hour, remove, baste again and return to the oven for a further 30 minutes or so. The same goes for the legs. After that put together your turkey, adding details such as a carefully carved carrot ‘bone’ to create the drumsticks. Carve and serve. "},{"url":null,"title":"Which Christmas tree truly eco friendly","story":"    With seven million real trees bought every Christmas in the UK Jenny Wood explores which tree is the most eco-friendlyTraditional Nordmann fir, from £39.99, dobbies.comReal Christmas trees, which absorb harmful carbon monoxide as they grow, have a lot going for them.

Has there ever been a more remarkable political comeback?The 78-year-old grandmother is one of only four nominations Jeremy Corbyn has made for a life peerage since he became Labour leader in 2015. Like the other two incoming Labour peers who joined her in the House this week, Iain McNicol and Pauline Bryon, Baroness Osamor’s elevation is on the condition that she will vote for the abolition of the Lords.Her political history suggests she will be only too happy to oblige. One suspects the ermine is mere camouflage for the Marxist guerilla fatigues beneath, and that at some point in the future the robes will be cast aside. For the moment, however, she is to be known in full as Baroness Osamor of Tottenham in the London Borough of Haringey and of Asaba in the Republic of Nigeria.          Jeremy Corbyn (left) with Martha Osamor (right) at a rally in Wood Green, LondonTo party insiders, the picture of a rather grim-faced Baroness Osamor in all her finery is another reminder of the wholly unexpected seizure of the Labour party from the Centrists and Blairites who had held sway before Mr Corbyn’s leadership by a tiny hard-Left faction.The Labour Party has told the Mail that Baroness Osamor and Mr Corbyn met in 1977, when he was a Haringey councillor and she a local black rights activist. Who could then have envisaged the events of this week?Yet the elevation to the peerage of Baroness Osamor — who last night declined to comment to the Mail, directing our inquiries to the Labour Party — is only the latest twist in the long, colourful, scandal-mired saga of her remarkable political dynasty.          Martha Osamor (centre) with her daughter Kate  (right) and her grandson Ishmael (left)There are three generations of Osamors at Westminster. Cumulatively, these Corbynite ultra-loyalists are entitled to draw as much as £250,000 a year in salary and allowances from the public purse. But not all is well.Last Saturday the new peer’s MP daughter Kate Osamor, who was elected to the safe Labour seat of Edmonton in 2015, resigned from her front-bench post as Mr Corbyn’s shadow international development secretary.She quit after it was revealed she had known about drugs charges against her son Ishmael Osamor somewhat earlier than the Labour Party had claimed.          Back in March 1990, Haringey Labour Party voted, by 26 to 10, to deselect Martha Osamor (centre)  the hard-Left former deputy leader of the much-troubled local authorityIn October, Mr Osamor, 29, was convicted of intent to supply £2,500 of drugs at last year’s Bestival festival in Dorset.He was caught with cocaine, ecstasy, ketamine and cannabis nine months before he was elected as a Labour Party councillor in Haringey — the same authority from which his grandmother was ignominiously ejected as a councillor 28 years ago.Young Mr Osamor was gifted his safe seat on the council after the deselection of Labour councillors who had been deemed insufficiently Corbynite          Ms Osamor (left) was banned from standing again as a Labour councillor His criminal case only became public because there was a journalist in court when he appeared for sentencing in Poole this October.Thus exposed, he had to resign as a Haringey councillor after only five months, during which time he had rapidly achieved cabinet rank. But he remained in his £50,000-a-year post as a senior political aide — described as chief of staff — to his mother at the Palace of Westminster. He also kept his security pass.That caused a new furore. But the Osamors would not budge further. And, funnily enough, the Labour leadership declined to intervene.          Kate Osamor (pictured above) had recently stepped down from the Labour front bench Then, thanks to a legal application by newspapers including the Mail, came a new revelation that Kate Osamor had written a letter to the Dorset court asking for clemency for her son. Labour had said she knew nothing of the case until after sentencing.When last week a reporter from The Times called at Kate Osamor’s home to question her, she told him she ‘should have come down here with a bat and smashed your face in’.She also told the journalist to ‘f*** off’, threw a bucket of water at him, called the police and accused him of stalking her.Within 24 hours, she had stepped down from the Labour front bench, saying she wanted to ‘concentrate on supporting my family’.There was no apology for her behaviour. Some have questioned her suitability to remain an MP, let alone a frontbencher. Her supporters claim she is the victim of a racist and sexist media campaign.When under fire, she can always turn to her battle-hardened mother for advice.Martha Osamor was born in Nigeria, trained as a teacher and came to the UK in 1963 to be with her husband who was studying here. Future MP Kate was one of four children Ms Osamor had before her husband died in a car crash.          Jeremy Corbyn (pictured above) had been a speaker at a Defence Campaign meeting chaired by Osamor in 1986Life as a single parent on a council estate in Hornsey, North London, was a struggle to make ends meet. Racism, she has said, was an everyday challenge. Ms Osamor became involved in radical community politics, joined the Socialist Workers Party and helped found the United Black Women’s Action Group.In an interview in 2015, she recalled she hadn’t liked Labour because it was not radical enough. But, because the party had the power to change the situation through elected representatives, it was better to be in than out.And so in the early Eighties she joined and became an ally of Bernie Grant, the black leader of Haringey Council — though Osamor would later lambast him for being a moderate ‘sell-out’.In 1981, she had helped found the Broadwater Farm Youth Association to improve conditions for black youth on a sink estate in neighbouring Tottenham. A driving force behind the group was Jamaican-born Dolly Kiffin.Both women would come to prominence — and eventually verbal blows — in the wake of the October 1985 Broadwater Farm riot, which was sparked by the death of black resident Cynthia Jarrett during a police raid. PC Keith Blakelock was killed during the ensuing night of mayhem.          Osamor forged links with revolutionaries such as Martin McGuinness (pictured above), the late Sinn Fein politician and leading figure in the IRAIn the aftermath, Martha Osamor became treasurer of the Broadwater Farm Defence Campaign, established to support Winston Silcott and two other local men who were convicted — and later cleared on appeal — of the Blakelock killing. In April 1986, Jeremy Corbyn was a speaker at a Defence Campaign meeting chaired by Osamor.Along the way, she forged links with revolutionaries such as Martin McGuinness, the late Sinn Fein politician and leading figure in the IRA. This did not please the Labour Party leadership, with which she was about to come into direct conflict.She was elected to Haringey Council in 1986. When Bernie Grant became MP for Tottenham the following year, she was made deputy leader of the local authority part of a hard-Left caucus which attracted the then-popular soubriquet ‘Loony Left’. She and her comrades defied rate capping, refused to impose spending cuts, and within months were swept away in a no-confidence vote by a moderate Labour faction.But Osamor’s star was still in the ascendancy. She became vice-chair of the Black Sections pressure group in the Labour Party, which sought greater representation and a ‘black perspective’ on all issues. Osamor made no secret of where she stood in the wider battle being fought between the Bennites and Militant entryists of the hard Left, and the reformists of the Centre and Right, led by party leader Neil Kinnock.          Osamor made no secret of where she stood in the wider battle being fought between the Bennites and Militant entryists of the hard Left, and the reformists of the Centre and Right, led by party leader Neil Kinnock (pictured above)In an interview with the communist Morning Star newspaper in 1988, Ms Osamor said: ‘The Kinnock-Hattersley leadership has failed to support the struggles of the working class . . . sometimes the leadership makes statements which show that they want to modify capitalism to suit some sort of “level ground” of voters. I don’t think that is going to work.’She had reservations about whether socialism could ever be achieved through parliamentary democracy. ‘I believe that change will come from the struggle, collectively,’ she said. Revolution, in other words.The antipathy between her and the Labour leadership came to a head in early 1989 with the Vauxhall by-election. Osamor was on the Labour shortlist. But having been interviewed by a panel of the party’s ruling National Executive Committee, including deputy leader Roy Hattersley, she was effectively de-selected.(She would later try to have Hattersley de-selected in revenge for talking about her as if she was, in her words, ‘his little slave girl’.)The candidate imposed on the Vauxhall constituency was a white Ulsterwoman named Kate Hoey, who had won only one local nomination compared to her rival’s eight. (Hoey has gone on to have a distinguished career in Parliament, including serving as sports minister.)But this rejection of Martha Osamor had little, if anything, to do with race. The party leadership simply did not want to field a candidate in such a high-profile by-election who supported such hard-Left policies as unilateral nuclear disarmament, which had crushed Labour at the polls in 1983.But they had another reason. By early 1989, she and others were under the spotlight in an investigation by the borough auditor in Haringey. There was the scent of looming scandal.In the wake of the Broadwater Farm riots, Haringey Council — and bodies including the government and the European Community — had pumped millions of pounds into the area to speed regeneration and reconciliation.Large sums were given to organisations in which Martha Osamor and fellow activist Dolly Kiffin held positions of financial authority.The council called in the police after its auditor noted ‘unexplained withdrawals’ of £104,000, out of £240,000 of council grants. The withdrawals were unsupported by receipts, it was claimed. The auditor then reported that the money had been spent on domestic items and air fares.At that point, Kiffin and Osamor became embroiled in mutual recrimination. Kiffin claimed that a cheque for £10,000 had been paid from the Broadwater Farm Defence Campaign funds to Osamor without Kiffin’s knowledge.Kiffin also alleged she often saw workers at another group, the Mothers Project, of which Osamor was treasurer, ‘rolling drunk’ on brandy bought with council grant funds. No accounts had been submitted by any of these groups since 1986, it was reported. Osamor denied any wrongdoing but, according to contemporary reports of the dispute, said that when running a voluntary organisation, things could get ‘a bit chaotic’.The Evening Standard quoted her as saying: ‘I hope that Haringey’s Labour leadership will never allow a report based on information from one inidual, Dolly Kiffin, to do so much damage to black community groups.’She said no public money was spent on the disputed items, only that from fundraising. The air fares were to fly in two American judges to witness the riot trials. Two members of the Defence Campaign were then invited to visit America in return.          Dolly Kiffin received a suspended sentence at the Old Bailey (pictured above) in July 1989Dolly Kiffin received a suspended sentence at the Old Bailey in July 1989 for perverting the course of justice in relation to the alleged misappropriation of £500,000 in grants from Haringey, the Greater London Council and the Department of the Environment to four Broadwater Farm-linked organisations. She had failed to hand over accounts, claiming they had been lost in a flood in Jamaica. The jury heard that some of the money had gone on a hairdressing course for her daughter.Osamor would face further censure by the Labour hierarchy. Two weeks after the local party voted for her deselection, Labour’s National Executive Committee imposed its own bar on her standing as a candidate because she had campaigned for non-payment of the controversial Poll Tax, against party policy.But you can’t keep some political ideologues down, and now she is back at the heart of power, elevated to the Lords by her old Haringey comrade Mr Corbyn, three decades after an accounting scandal led to her being cast into the political wilderness. "},{"url":null,"title":"Two halves Renaissance masterpiece reunited time 500 years","story":"    The lower panel: The Descent of Christ into Limbo is privately owned Historical issues of the Radio Times from the 1940s are...Hidden heartache behind The Monarch of the Glen: A ravishing...Now THAT\u0027S a water colour!

Demand for northern freight transport is also expected to increase, particularly if Brexit pushes ships away from the Dover crossing and up to ports on the Humber and in north-east England.The core of the route between Stalybridge in Greater Manchester and Huddersfield in West Yorkshire will now not be electrified, along with 12 miles east of Leeds, according to the Rail Freight Group, which said the Department of Transport’s committee had made the recommendation to Grayling.Trains using the route will have to be “bi-modal”, switching to environmentally unfriendly diesel engines during key, hilly sections .The advice contradicts recommendations from Transport for the North (TfN), a statutory body set up to advise the government. In September, it asked the DfT for assurance that “any upgrades are environmentally sustainable and do not have a negative impact on air quality”. It also demanded provision for freight, with the option to transport containers by rail, which is currently not possible because the tunnels are too low. understands the DfT did not respond to the letter and that the TfN board met on Thursday and repeatedly asked a senior DfT official if it was true that Grayling preferred the one upgrade option TfN specifically asked him not to choose, without receiving a satisfactory answer.Barry White, TfN’s chief executive, suggested he was not ready to give in without a fight. “We continue to seek the journey time improvements, capacity, reliability and freight access that were first set out. We must push for the best solution for the north and will continue to do so,” he said. “This major investment must secure sustained improvement in our railway that delivers on ambitions.”Mike Hogg of the Rail Freight Group said that if Grayling’s plans went ahead, freight would continue to be transported by road, adding to the already congested motorways and increasing air pollution. “It means that the members of our trade body won’t have the opportunity to put containers on railway wagons and take them over the Pennines. They can’t now, because of capacity and height clearance, and they aren’t going to be able to in the future either. It will go by road, on the M62 instead,” he said.He said he had known since 18 November that the line was not going to be electrified fully and waas not going to be able to take freight, ignoring the business case made by shippers, port groups and rail hauliers for better freight lines across the Pennines. “We are disappointed and frustrated at the recommendation made by the Department of Transport’s BIC committee and apparently accepted by Chris Grayling,” he said.The fastest passenger trains between Manchester Piccadilly and Leeds take 58 minutes. The proposed upgrade would shave between seven and eight minutes off the journey time, according to Hogg. Commuters from Ashford in Kent can get to Stratford International in east London in half an hour, despite the journey being 10 miles longer.In response to questions from the  about which sections of the TransPennine route would be electrified and whether it would be able to carry freight, a DfT spokeswoman said claims from Maskell and the Rail Freight Group were “completely unfounded”.She declined to set out the specific plan for TransPennine, saying instead: “The first phase of the upgrade, starting in the spring, will be the biggest investment in our existing railway in the next five years. The department will continue to work with stakeholders to determine how best to deliver all phases of the upgrade.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/015d74ce9ae28903efaf0a58fec95a7ea144f32d/176_466_3107_1864/master/3107.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f8edc1d138d5e96a1a052f3d3eb951ff","title":"ted baker founder ray kelvin to take leave of absence","story":"Board says it has been made aware of ‘further serious allegations’ that it will be investigatingTed Baker founder Ray Kelvin is taking a leave of absence from the fashion company after the board said it had been made aware of “further serious allegations” that it would be investigating.In a statement issued to the stock market just before it closed on Friday afternoon, Ted Baker’s board said the chief operating officer, Lindsay Page, would be taking over as acting chief executive with immediate effect.Earlier this week, Ted Baker’s board said it had appointed the law firm Herbert Smith Freehills to carry out an independent investigation into reports of harassment by Kelvin after about 300 former and current staff signed a petition on campaigning site Organise complaining about behaviour including “forced hugs” and ear kissing. Organise said it had sent about 100 anonymised reports of alleged harassment to the Ted Baker board.It said it would not be making further comment about the nature of the allegations while they remained under investigation.The statement said: “Ray Kelvin has agreed, for the benefit of the business and the people who work in it, that he will take a voluntary leave of absence from his role with the company while these allegations are investigated.”In his first statement since the “forced hugs” allegations came to light.

It is only right that the board and HSF should investigate fully.“Ted Baker has been my life and soul for 30 years. I love this company and I care deeply for all my colleagues. It’s for that reason that I have decided to take a temporary leave of absence.“Ted Baker means everything to me and I can’t bear to see it harmed in any way.”David Bernstein, the non-executive chairman, said: “I am confident that the business remains in a strong position to continue to deliver its long-term growth strategy.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb6a8f4939eedd6b56641870a4de19d68091ec3f/0_19_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d6665a75727748d832aa596ac1d4081f","title":"ted bakers ray kelvin i can be hard work when i need to be","story":"The hugs dispensed by the firm’s founder were seen as part of the quirky culture – but a darker side has emergedAsk almost anyone who has met Ray Kelvin, the founder and boss of Ted Baker, and it is more than likely they will have a story about being hugged.City analysts, journalists, staff, suppliers and bankers alike tell of the snappily dressed chief executive taking them in swift embraces or long and intense bear hugs, planting kisses or even demanding press-ups.But this week Ted Baker removed the “hug zone” – a demarcated area outside Kelvin’s office – after more than 300 current and former staff signing a petition on the Organise campaigning platform calling for an end to “forced hugs” and alleged harassment by Kelvin.The company called in City lawyers to investigate and began an overhaul of its culture.But on Friday afternoon, just three minutes before the stock market closed for the week, that overhaul moved into overdrive. The company issued a statement to say it had received “further serious allegations” and that Kelvin would now take a leave of absence until the investigation was concluded.Staff of both sexes have complained not just of unwanted hugs but have accused Kelvin of ear kissing, shoulder massages and asking young female members of staff to sit on his knee.The campaigning group says it has sent more than 100 anonymised reports of alleged harassment to the Ted Baker board of directors.Until last weekend, when the Observer reported the allegations of harassment, Kelvin’s hugs were just seen as part of a quirky culture at Ted Baker’s London head office, called the Ugly Brown Building. It was a working environment which the snappily dressed Kelvin has described as part of “caring and loving people, and making sure while they’re in the business they have a good time and they enjoy it”.“Hug them,” he once told trade journal Retail Week “It’s not hard.” But a darker side to the Ted Baker culture has now emerged. Retail Week has reported occasions when hugs turned into an unwanted sit on the knee or a hand around the waist allegedly drifting downwards.When the allegations were put to Kelvin by one of the magazine’s reporters he responded: “If they are happy to sit on my knee …” before trailing off.Several members of staff have also described Kelvin’s “fits of rage” including one incident in which he pushed a senior executive against a wall after learning he was not invited to their wedding ceremony. As the  reported on Thursday, Kelvin was handed a formal warning by the Ted Baker board of directors following the incident.That sharp fall has been driven partly driven by fears that Kelvin, whose personality and ideas underpin the business, might decide to leave or be forced out.Emily Salter, retail analyst at GlobalData: “Kelvin’s position in the company is no longer assured, putting the brand in a dangerous position given that its success is so reliant on its founder.”While there are about 400 staff at the group’s head office, led by Kelvin’s right hand man of more than two decades Lindsay Page, industry insiders and former staff say that Kelvin is still at the centre of decision-making.“He is very hands-on and sticks his nose into everything,” says one industry veteran, who knows the company well.Kelvin himself has admitted as much: “I can be difficult. I am particular and I can be hard work when I need to be. But I think that’s respected.”The north Londoner, who will turn 63 next week, has fashion in his bones. His father Alf owned a small blouse factory in Tottenham and he began working alongside his mum Trudie in the family tailor’s shop from as young as nine.Trudie continued to be a major influence on his life, working in Ted Baker stores up until her death in 2011.Kelvin began his business life by supplying womenswear to high street retailers in the early 1970s via his Personal Contact company, before seeing an opportunity to specialise in men’s shirts. With the backing of Scottish department store empire A Goldberg \u0026amp Sons, he began with one 65 sq m (700 sq ft) store in Glasgow stuffed with 400 types of shirt.Kelvin has said he invented his Gatsbyesque alter ego, Ted Baker, as a way to separate himself from the brand – just in case it went bust.“The man closest to Ted,” as Kelvin is described in the company’s annual report and accounts, has kept a remarkably low profile in the world of fashion retail, where it’s not uncommon for bosses to be regular fixtures of diary columns or even front pages. That’s despite the fact that first wife Georgia Slowe, with whom he had two sons, now in their 20s, was an actress in Emmerdale. He married second wife Clare, with whom he has a daughter, in 2012.Kelvin has spoken out against his hatred of being seen to be flash and has rarely been photographed without a prop, like a hat or shoe, placed half across his face.The brand blossomed during the 1990s era of lad culture, with “vomit proof suits” complete with special pockets to store condoms. The company, which listed on the stock market in 1997, now has 544 stores worldwide and annual sales of £590m.Kelvin likes to promote from within and a number of senior staff have spent more than 20 years at the company. He talks about staff as like family, and has been known to help pay for education or medical treatments.But in the past year, several senior people have left the business including retail director Chris Browne and womenswear boss Catherine Scorey.One friend says the atmosphere has changed amid tougher times on the high street. “He’s been allowed to do whatever he wants to do. Perhaps he’s lost a bit of his moral compass in recent years and doesn’t realise not everybody wants to be hugged by their boss.”On Friday night, after taking his leave of absence, Kelvin was sounding contrite. In a statement, he said the accusations being made by current and former staff were “very serious and upsetting” and that it was “only right” they should be investigated.He added: “Ted Baker has been my life and soul for 30 years. I love this company and I care deeply for all my colleagues. Ted Baker means everything to me and I can’t bear to see it harmed in any way.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ddf6addbd500cea7febba5550c3a2e979152f342/0_50_2150_1290/master/2150.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=184a68543737163e11711f05149f2cbc","title":"brexit low paid workers unions back remain","story":"Scapegoating EU workers does nothing to solve labour exploitation. Only improved employment rights can do thatAlex is a white, English, low-paid worker. In fact, not only is he low-paid, but until recently he was being denied even the most basic employment rights, such as paid holiday and a pension. A pushbike courier in the Doctor’s Laboratory’s in-house courier department, Alex works alongside another hundred or so pushbike, motorbike and van couriers. A large proportion of these workers are Brazilians, able to live and work in the UK by virtue of dual citizenship with EU countries.After various unfruitful attempts at improving his working conditions on his own, he turned to the Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain (IWGB), a trade union founded by Latin American cleaners. With the Union’s help, Alex and his colleagues went on to unionise the majority of the company’s couriers, and brought a court case that resulted in the company recognising couriers as limb (b) workers and thus entitled to basic workers’ rights won a collective bargaining deal to negotiate pay, terms and conditions and are party to a backdated holiday claim worth over £1m. Their fight for better pay continues as part of an ongoing union campaign.Alex’s story is illustrative of both the root causes of labour exploitation as well the solutions. For imagine a world in which Alex had instead bought into to the xenophobic scapegoating that characterised the leave campaign by blaming his Brazilian colleagues for his plight. Despite the best of intentions, distilling any practical solutions from the hysterical rhetoric of the Brexiteers is almost as hard as negotiating a comprehensive trade deal with the EU in two years. But presumably the Brexiteers’ solution to Alex’s problems would be for Alex to vote leave and then sit back in the hope that eventually fewer Brazilians with EU passports would be working with him, and that that eventually might increase his wages and improve his terms and conditions and treatment at work.Of course, with the end of free movement, the supply of EU workers to Alex’s workplace does not dry up in isolation. For so too dry up the European patients who send their blood samples to be couriered by Alex and the other EU workers who participate in the economic ecosystem in which Alex’s employer operates. Every worker is also a money-spending consumer low-paid workers proportionately more so. But fundamentally, it is not Alex’s foreign-born colleagues that have suppressed his wages and deprived him of rights: it is decisions by management.Further, the Tories – who have an incredible capacity for temporarily mending Brexit fractures for the purpose of uniting behind policies which are bad for workers – have repeatedly erected roadblocks to the actual solutions to Alex’s problem. The passing of the Trade Union Act made union organising and action more difficult. The employment tribunal fees regime, until declared unlawful, rendered the enforcement of iniduals’ employment rights impossible for many. The government continues to adamantly refuse to enforce employment law in a serious way, and so gives employers a green light to ignore it. Combined with eight years of austerity, it’s hardly a surprise that economic insecurity is a defining feature of our times. Despite a bit of lip service to exploited workers, the prime minister’s plan of action was confined to the Taylor review of modern working practices, which offers little to the workers in question, and whose recommendations are wholly inadequate to solve Alex’s problems.This country is on the verge of momentous decisions, the ramifications of which will be acutely felt by low-paid workers for a generation or more. What’s on offer is a clampdown on migration, the throwing up of borders, and a validation by government that indeed the cause of British workers’ problems is their foreign-born co-workers. And not much else.If the question is how to deal with labour exploitation, the answer lies in improved and enforced employment rights, and a unionisation strategy based on uniting workers, vigorous campaigning and effective collective bargaining. If you don’t believe me, just ask Alex.• Jason Moyer-Lee is the general secretary of the Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/078558979c3076937f0dd1f85cfb784dbfd2ce43/0_213_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0089de36282896365d51849523592a4b","title":"crunch time labour posturing brexit jeremy corbyn","story":"Under Jeremy Corbyn, the party has evaded tough choices. Next week will trigger an ordeal for which it has not preparedNormally, an opposition could enjoy a week like the one that’s coming. It could sit back, relax and break open the popcorn as Theresa May walks into a Commons defeat on the policy that has defined her premiership. It could delight in yet more days of debate in which next to no one on the prime minister’s own benches rises to speak up for her, savouring the sight of a governing party that is devouring itself in full public view.But these are not normal times. For one thing, the stakes are too high. It isn’t just a regular piece of domestic legislation that the government is foundering on, but the most important – and potentially most damaging – move in the country’s postwar history. Labour cannot be passive in this process, giving the government enough rope to hang itself. Because if this goes wrong, it’s not just May’s career or the Tories’ electoral prospects that are wrecked: it’s the country.It’s not only an abstract sense of national duty that should be weighing on Labour: the more concrete fact is that in a hung parliament, an opposition has genuine power. With a substantial number of Conservatives having slipped the bonds of party loyalty, ready to vote with the opposition if they have to, Labour can shape the course of Brexit. The downside is that if this goes badly, it won’t be just be May and the Tories who are blamed: Jeremy Corbyn and Labour will be in the dock, too.All of which means the era of “constructive ambiguity” has to end next week. Maybe it worked for a while, this Labour blend of remain and leave, wording every pronouncement on Brexit in language bland enough to go down easily in both Hampstead and Hartlepool. But that fudge is past its sell-by date. We are at the moment of decision now.Not that you’d know it from the noises the party is still making. Take the article in the  on Friday by Corbyn himself. It spoke repeatedly of Labour’s “alternative plan” for Brexit, by which Britain would have all the benefits of the single market – such as “frictionless trade” – with none of the unwanted costs. This is a plan in the same sense that I “plan” to win the men’s singles title at Wimbledon next year. It is not a plan at all, but a desire for something that is demonstrably out of reach.The EU could not have been clearer or more unbending on this point since the vote in 2016 (and long before). The only way to get frictionless trade with the single market is not by forging “a new and strong relationship” with it, as Corbyn writes, but by being in it, as we are now. Equally, you cannot hope to leave the EU and simultaneously retain “a British say in future trade deals” done by the EU. To argue otherwise is to offer the same cake-and-eat-it, unicorn-filled impossibilism peddled by Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg. That it comes with a red rosette on its lapel does not make it any less dishonest. Which is why even one of Corbyn’s most senior shadow cabinet colleagues told me the leader’s article was “poor”, while its central claim – that there is some new, alternative, backstop-free deal just waiting to be negotiated with Brussels by Labour – is “nonsense”.To my mind that hope was always absurd, its impossibility captured by that meme of May on the phone, captioned: “Hello, is that Sky? Yes, I’d like to cancel my subscription but still receive all your channels.” Shadow ministers admit that is even more unarguably true now. Beyond “some tweaks to the political declaration”, there is nothing more the EU would offer a freshly installed Labour government, even if, as Shami Chakrabarti insists, “there’s such a positive atmosphere” the moment Corbyn walks into a room of European leaders. The EU27 are not going to pretend the last two years of talks didn’t happen and start all over again.Which is why the first move Labour promises to make, once May’s deal is voted down, is also hollow. It will call for a general election, arguing that that is the best and most legitimate way for the country to resolve its Brexit conundrum. But how would an election resolve it exactly? If Labour simply offers an impossible alternative to the May deal – a pain-free, “jobs first” Brexit in which we get all the pleasures of EU membership and none of the pain – then even if Labour were to win, the question would not be settled, because it would be as unable to deliver its Brexit as May was hers.That leaves two options: Norway-plus or a second referendum. Labour won’t be able to obfuscate its way through that choice for long, though it might try. So far the signals from Labour’s top table are hostile to Norway: because it would make Britain a rule-taker and, though they don’t like to say this too loudly lest it sound as if they’re anti-immigration, because it would commit Britain to freedom of movement. (Codedly, Corbyn signalled his opposition to free movement in his  piece by looking forward to Labour “setting migration policies to meet the needs of the economy”, which is a right-on way of saying: no blanket right for EU citizens to come here.)So a people’s vote could be the last option standing. After many months, Keir Starmer and John McDonnell now seem to agree on that, backed by Tom Watson. Ranged against them are Unite’s Len McCluskey – though McCluskey’s members back a second referendum – and the leader’s office, including the pivotal figures of Seumas Milne and Karie Murphy. Corbyn himself is said by one insider, who is not hostile to the leader, to be “pretty disengaged”.If Labour does end up calling for a people’s vote and getting it, plenty will praise the party for its strategic acumen. It will have played the long game, kept Labour leavers onside at the 2017 general election and picked the right moment to make its move. But then there will be a new question: how to win that second referendum for remain? How much easier would that task have been if Labour had spent the last two and a half years exposing the Brexiteers’ project as the impossible fantasy it is – rather than indulging it, accommodating it and even echoing it, right until the very last moment?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6acd6739c714d91ead303af4c40770b192f342e0/0_192_3600_2159/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a3f068c6e28f9d4e8ae60970b0140851","title":"lena dunham has apologised for disbelieving a allegation and made matters worse","story":"She is sorry she called Aurora Perrineau a liar, but claims it wasn’t her fault.

Should her latest egg with her longtime lover, Akeakamai, hatch, fledge and take to the open sea, it will be her 37th.Wisdom was first banded in 1956 by biologist Chandler Robbins, who estimated that she was about five years old at the time. The biologist and bird met again in 2002 when he went to band her and recognized that she had been one of the 8,400 birds he recorded during his first season, 46 years previously.Albatrosses are known for their long life s and often outlive their researchers – Robbins died in 2017 at the age 98 – but what makes Wisdom unique is that researchers have been able to monitor her habits for so long. She may or may not be the oldest wild bird, but she is the oldest known wild bird, and her habits have been lovingly documented by the fish and wildlife service over social media.And because so much of her background and history is known, researchers are learning more about her species by observing her. To a human, 68 years old may seem preposterous to still be laying eggs, but Wisdom and the other few documented examples of albatrosses in their 50s and 60s who do not appear to have trouble breeding at that age show the situation may be different for birds, said Beth Flint, a USFWS wildlife biologist.Like many albatrosses, Wisdom returns nearly every year to the place she was born for nesting and mating. Midway Atoll, a two-and-a-half-sq-mile island belonging to the US that was the site of the decisive Battle of Midway during the second world war, remains mostly uninhabited when it comes to humans. But come winter, more than 1m Laysan albatrosses flock to the beaches to nest.Albatrosses take mating and nesting seriously, forming bonds with their mates for life. The Cornell lab describes their courtship displays as elaborate they include “coordinated movements in which the birds touch bills, spread one or both wings, bob their heads, place their bill under one wing, and pause with their bill pointed at the sky”.Once they’ve met their mates, the birds will rendezvous at the same nest site every winter – and go through some iteration of the courtship process again, Flint said.“There is preening and a dance,” she said. “They’re very tactile animals. They sit closely and preen each other and snuggle. We can’t know what they’re feeling, but they exhibit the kind of behaviors that reinforce a bond and a connection.”Researchers first noted Wisdom’s relationship with Akeakamai in 2006 and are unsure if she had other mates before Akeakamai. But albatrosses are believers in co-parenting, and will take turns incubating an egg, caring for the chick and foraging for food over the ocean. Should this egg survive, Wisdom and Akeakamai will spend about seven months on Midway Atoll incubating and raising their chick.Albatrosses lay only one egg a year, and because it’s such a lengthy and energy-consuming process to both incubate and raise a healthy chick, most do not do it annually. While researchers are still collecting data regarding the frequency at which Laysan albatrosses breed, Wisdom “does seem to be exceptional in that she has bred for a number of years consecutively and has not taken a break”, Flint said.Wisdom has managed to raise a number of chicks who have gone on to raise chicks of their own, she has also faced hardship. In 2015, her egg was reported missing, which biologists say is just what happens sometimes.But her fertile contributions to the continuation of her species make every homecoming a celebration for scientists. Last year, they observed a chick that she fledged in 2001 setting up a nest just a few feet away. It was the first time one of her chicks had been documented returning to nest.“Midway Atoll’s habitat doesn’t just contain millions of birds, it contains countless generations and families of albatrosses,” Kelly Goodale, a fish and wildlife service refuge biologist, said in a blogpost. “If you can imagine when Wisdom returns home, she is likely surrounded by what were once her chicks and potentially their chicks.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/135e4286ebe6699e69572b0ce3e35a749e293f34/0_182_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6d6d5f45bb4b1fafa10886b034f1c004","title":"the week in wildlife in pictures","story":"An African wild dog preparing for a hunt and a male mimic poison frog transporting a tadpole are among this week’s pick of images from the natural world"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/089bb27562dfc0d23d9c25336fcf46ad538b5d0b/0_933_2461_1476/master/2461.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=521fcd9ae133dac3f93ceb9e48376aa6","title":"micro bags cash in on the cashless society","story":"Fashion is adapting to the swiping economy with wallets, purses and bags all shrinkingIt’s been called the cashless effect, the idea that we spend more when we can’t see what we’re spending. But with a cashless economy looming in the distance and bank card use fast eclipsing cash purchases, this so-called “effect” is not just influencing our expenditure – but also how we carry money entirely.It started with the micro-bag, one of 2018’s biggest trends at Fendi and Jacquemus as well as Topshop and Zara, which is large enough to carry a phone, a key fob and a card case but little more. The fashion is now moving on to purses, wallets and even pockets. At Selfridges, coin-free cardholders are currently available as well as purses, with the department store claiming this season is all about the “downsized cardholder”.It’s all down to cashlessness and convenience. “We have noticed a distinct shift to anything that facilitates this convenience and card holders are demonstrative of this,” say Selfridges’ accessories buyers. “An increase in demand for cardholders from both women and men who have shifted away from using traditional purses and wallets.”Colourful cardholders from Commes des Garcons and Marc Jacobs are among their bestsellers this season, but the trend is happening across the board. If last year’s cult item was the Prada paperclip – an $185 logo’d device designed to carry notes – this season it’s all about the Byredo cardholder. Ben Gorham, founder of the hip Swedish label that recently collaborated with Off White and just opened its flagship shop in London, says the label’s coin-free cardholders have been one of its bestselling items in Sweden, where a cashless economy is imminent. They are now selling “very well” here in the UK and two styles are currently sold out.There is another side-effect of this shift. “As we go cashless, it’s giving women a greater sense of freedom and, as a result, accessories are getting smaller – in fact, they’ve become purses with straps,” says Kathryn Bishop, the deputy foresight editor at retail intelligence and brand consultant the Future Laboratory. Whether this shift will affect things like pockets is a little knottier, she says, saying that might be the case for men but that the opposite is happening with women.“Arguably, men’s clothing had pockets because it was the traditional ‘keepers’ – be it of keys or money – but now we’re seeing women adopt workwear jackets with functional pockets to carry their debit card or phone.”Bishop predicts a movement for women to reclaim pockets but she also predicts bank cards may vanish entirely for some. “With companies like Biohax offering skin-embedded chips that allow travelcards to be stored – so you tap into the station with your hand – there is no reason why we won’t soon see the same with the chips from our bank cards.”Either way, this shift in accessories sparked by a changing economy is working in fashion’s favour, not simply because we are buying more. Accessories, especially handbags, have bigger margins than clothes, and generally turn the biggest profits. Introducing a new must-have accessory at a gateway price – a Commes des Garcons cardholder costs £70 by contrast a blazer can cost over £1,500 – is the only way to afford any of this stuff.

Spoiler warning: big purple bad dude Thanos succeeded in wiping out literally half of the entire universe, including a considerable proportion of the Marvel heroes fans had grown to love over the course of an eventful movie-going decade. So where do you go from there? Today’s new trailer for Avengers: Endgame has a few suggestions, squashed into two and a half minutes. Here’s what we learned.After getting his tin-can ass kicked by Thanos and witnessing his cosmic strike team of impromptu Avengers disintegrate into confetti on a far-flung moon, Tony Stark was in a bad place. Now, he’s somewhere even worse: floating through space in a dead spacecraft, four days without food and about to run out of air. That’s when this flippant motormouth decides to record a message for his beloved Pepper via his semi-wrecked Iron Man helmet – rambling, wry and, as ever, a little self-involved. Save that oxygen, Tony!After pledging to pull off the greatest workforce reduction in the history of the universe, Josh Brolin’s stocky bruiser mused that he would crown his galactic victory by retiring and becoming a farmer, watching sunrises and whatnot. There was a taste of that rural retirement in the final scenes of Infinity War but in the Endgame trailer, we see that he has genuinely repurposed his dread armour as a scarecrow. Surely the Mad Titan is now at peace? Except Thanos seems to enjoy walking through fields of space-thistles caressing his crop like Russell Crowe in Gladiator, which surely signals some retributive smackdowns ahead.Infinity War came unofficially billed as the most ambitious crossover of all time and many beloved Marvel characters did not survive to see the end of it (peace out Peter Parker, so long Doctor Strange, bye bye Black Panther, Star-Lord, Falcon and many more). Yet even among the sprawling cast list, one performer stood out among the sprawling Spandex crowd, and that was the beard that Steve Rogers grew to symbolise his outlaw angst. Weirdly, even though Cap should technically be sadder than ever now that his best pal Bucky is literally dust, Steve’s sadbeard has suddenly vanished. Thanos’s fateful finger-click should have sheared off half of it just for the LOLs.Despite Infinity War being full of ’arrowing scenes – stay with me here – there was no sign of black-ops archer Hawkeye, nominally because Clint Barton had apparently cut a deal to lay down his quiver and return to civilian life on that homely farm we saw in Avengers: Age of Ultron. Yet up Jeremy Renner pops in the Endgame trailer, with a vaguely new look (prison haircut, shadowy costume, constipated frown) and some sort of upgraded weapon that looks more like a sword than a bow. Admittedly at this stage, the Avengers need all the help they can get.At first, we all assumed that Paul Rudd aka Scott Lang aka Ant-Man had survived the Infinity War cull, partly because Rudd didn’t star in that film but mostly because he had his own Ant-Man sequel coming out very soon afterwards. But those who stuck around for the post-credits scenes of Ant-Man and the Wasp saw poor Scott seemingly stranded after spelunking into the teeny-tiny quantum realm. The fact that he has managed to find his way back for the Endgame trailer suggests Ant-Man holds the key to restoring the natural order: perhaps the seemingly ageless Rudd has some killer skincare tips that will sway the permanently crinkle-chinned Thanos?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/309b1966d48b366752e367c88f7084814e5bf20e/0_1017_6759_4055/master/6759.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bcf1a9364a18ddd37def9377cbe47bab","title":"cocktail of the week santas magic potion","story":"All the classic flavours of Christmas in a glassGood cognac + boozy chocolate and herb liqueurs + cinnamon + fruit juice + grenadine (for colour) + lime (to balance the sweetness)  Christmas in a glass.For the cinnamon syrup100ml water1 cinnamon stick1 clove100g caster sugarFor the drink50ml cognac – we use Rémy Martin VSOP15ml chocolate liqueur – Mozartor Briottet, ideally 5ml Bénédictine DOM herb liqueur10ml cinnamon syrup (see above)20ml pear juice25ml lime juice5ml grenadine1 shard cinnamon, to garnishTo make the syrup, put the water, cinnamon and clove in a pan, bring to a boil, then simmer for eight to 10 minutes.

But hot or cold? Brandy butter or cream? And does it matter which hand you eat it with?In 1733, the Gentleman’s Magazine carried a short reflection on mince pies – née Christmas pyes – that, among other observations, noted how puritanical Quakers swerved them on the basis that they are an “invention of the Scarlet Whore of Babylon, an Hodge-Podge of Superstition, Popery, the Devil and all his Works”.Sounds exciting, right? But, in 2018, the mince pie, subject of this month’s seasonal How to Eat (HTE), lacks that transgressive edge. We may buy a staggering 370m every Christmas but we also throw a shameful 74m away, indicative of how innocuous they now are. Any tingle of forgive-me-father-for-I-have-wolfed-four excitement has gone. Mince pies are mundane. We take them for granted.Part of the problem is that most shop-bought mince pies are clumsily spiced, collapsing air-pockets of disappointment. But this is a treat of diminishing returns for other reasons, too. We routinely abuse the mince pie. We fail to treat it with reverence. Which is where HTE – the series identifying how best to eat Britain’s favourite dishes – can help. Merry Christmas!As regular readers know, HTE is less a food column and more an examination of the misfiring engine in the once luxury saloon that is late capitalism. This supposed purring motor of perennial growth is now an old banger running on empty. Endless novelty is its only method of distracting us from its rusty, clanking malfunctions and the smoke belching from its exhaust. Nowhere is this truer than in mince pies. A 13th-century invention, their ideal form was established hundreds of years ago, but supermarkets must endlessly reinvent them in order to part a jaded, gullible public from its hard-earned.Iced pies, sloe gin-spiked pies, chocolate chip andor orange and cherry pies, crumble- or hazelnut-topped pies, plum, cinnamon and ginger pies, cranberry-mined pies: this is but a fragment of the long list of “mince pies” clearly created in an attempt to sell mince pies to people who do not like mince pies – spawning myriad culinary disasters in the process. Likewise, from brownies to baklava, magazine recipe writers redeploy mincemeat in endlessly ludicrous ways to offer us a twist on this classic. To paraphrase that great Salfordian sage, Shaun Ryder, it is twisting HTE’s melons, man.Repeated attempts to doughnut-ify or deep-fry the pie are also unnecessary, once we think past our drooling Pavlovian response to the words “deep fry”. In terms of foodie affectation, such splashy attempts to reinvent this wheel are topped only by those poseurs who insist you should be putting real meat in your mincemeat. These nose-to-tail outliers talk enthusiastically of blurring the distinction between sweet and savoury, a concept as reckless as crossing the streams in Ghostbusters.Even the supposed shortcrust versus puff pastry debate is overhyped, given that all reasonable people know that (unsweetened) shortcrust pastry is the correct casing.HTE tries to maintain a relaxed attitude to cooking and baking your own … anything. It is not always possible or preferable. But when the chef Jeremy Lee told the Independent in 2011 that commercial mince pies are “generally unspeakable”, he had a point. A point reinforced by this year’s Which? survey of Christmas foods, which found that, while there are diamonds in the rough (Asda’s Extra Special mince pies took its top spot), the general standard of pies is on the slide. The cost of butter and dried fruit is rising and manufacturers are increasingly stingy with these star ingredients. If you haven’t already been seduced by Iceland’s unlikely palm-free hook-up with Selfridges, home-baking your mince pies is a wise move. Go easy on those spices, though. A mince pie should not smell like the perfume counter in Boots.If you cannot heat your mince pie, it is better not to eat it. HTE is so adamant on this point that, for once, it will even license use of the microwave. It will heat your pie to thermonuclear temperatures, requiring ninja-like self-discipline as you allow it to cool to edible over three hours (timings approximate, inidual appliances will vary). But at least you will not have to eat a cold, stodgy puck of a pie, its pastry dry and brittle, its filling claggy, its aromas and flavours as faint as the chances of Theresa May’s Brexit deal passing in parliament.Heat transforms even the most half-arsed mince pie: butter and fats melt, pectin softens, scents are liberated. The whole thing takes on an almost supernatural lightness, as if the mince pie has been borne aloft by the oven’s hot draughts.Like Kendrick Lamar or Scott Walker, a great mince pie speaks for itself. It stands alone. It does not need any embellishment, no backing band, no guest verses on big pop hits. But there are a lot of middling mince pies out there, which can get monotonous over Christmas, and which need a little lubrication or, for the sake of variety, an added inflection of flavour. But tread carefully.Creme fraiche Supremely light and kissed with a lactic tang, creme fraiche is the hot mince pie’s most elegant cooling counterpoint.Single or double cream Either will grease the wheels, so to speak.Custard There is something magical about the contrast between hot mince pie and cold cream on the same plate. Custard, however, particularly in the first phases of Christmas, before gout sets in, can take the mince pie in an altogether gutsier, stickier, self-indulgent direction.Squirty cream “It’s better than nothing,” says your mum. She is wrong. This artificial abomination ruins anything it comes into contact with.Rum or brandy butter The only time alcohol works in food is when that alcohol is first cooked off, modulating the drink’s flavour. Raw alcohol is an aggressive, incoherent presence in any dessert, and particularly in the thick, creamy context of rum and brandy butters (top-shelf concoctions often made with rock-bottom brands), it creates a truly nauseating mouthful.Ice-cream Sounds good, in theory, but unlike cream (which we instinctively add judiciously), you will always add too much ice-cream until the whole thing becomes too sickly and too filling.Natural yoghurt It’s Christmas. Treat yourself. Keep this all-too-tart interloper away from your mince pies.Clotted cream Cream at its most extreme and proof that you really can have too much of a good thing.Blue cheese A slice of stilton with HTE’s mince pie, you say? Clearly this is something made up by mischievous internet trolls to fool innocent readers into trying it. It will ruin mince pies for you, for ever.The mince pie is the season’s emergency snack standby, frequently served ad hoc as friends, neighbours and relatives drop in. According to that hilarious satirical comedy creation andor renowned etiquette expert “William Hanson” (trigger warning: links to the Daily Mail), each guest should be given a napkin to catch their crumbs because, of course, nothing says: “Relax, make yourself at home,” like someone passive-aggressively warning you not to drop any mince pie on their carpet. If you are that uptight, hand plates around. Better still, go with the traditional serve, where everyone eats their mince pies with the little foil cup perched under their chin (useful to catch any major pieces of debris, but not too prissy), and then put the Hoover round later. What are a few crumbs between mates?Such informality is an alien concept to Hanson. For instance, rather than decline a second mince pie, he advises you take it home in a napkin so as not to offend your host. Should you come across anyone that easily offended, the better course of action is to decline that pie, bite that bullet and expunge that person from your social circle. They clearly have issues that it would take a lifetime of expensive therapy to unpack.Hanson further advises you should always eat a mince pie in your left hand. Not due to some ancient chivalric knights’ code (something about always being ready to defend yourself against killer ravens or dragons, HTE is imagining), but so that you can still shake hands with people. Key HTE tip: do not linger where people would expect you to prioritise polite mingling over a eating a pie. Of course, if serving your pie with cream you will require a side plate and a fork. A greater volume of liquid (eg custard) needs a bowl and a spoon. Do not try to cup it in your hands. That way madness lies.When unexpected visitors drop in (the horror!). In those moments of mid-afternoon peckishness between Christmas and new year, when your daily calorific intake has plateaued at a steady 6,000. As consolation when you arrive home from work at any point in December, wet, cold and thoroughly miserable, in desperate need of a little bump of sugar and self-care. On that blessed day, when – having spent the last week being dragged around Britain, including three days of high psycho-emotional tension at the in-laws – you can slump down on your own sofa and actually start to enjoy Christmas. The only bad news? You are back in work tomorrow.Champagne and mince pies is instant heartburn sherry and mince pies is too saccharine but good brandy is a fine foil for all that rich fruit and spice. Is alcohol really necessary, though? There is something about a good mug of strong tea, its tannins cleaning your mouth like a stiff-bristled brush on a patio, that – particularly when you are on a three- or four-pie bender – is the most effective way of resetting your palate for the next assault.So, mince pies, how do you eat yours?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d4897953ff67b9f506b771cf259bd225d3a6f13/0_0_2015_1209/master/2015.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=869b2837fd9a419a94545a2b85b79642","title":"jose mourinho manchester united relegation","story":"There was a good story at the start of this week’s BT Sport documentary Too Good To Go Down, a highly watchable 90-minute blockbuster about Manchester United’s relegation in 1973. Ten minutes into the film the United winger Willie Morgan starts to talk about Wilf McGuinness, who enjoyed an uneasy succession to Matt Busby.With United in the middle of a losing run McGuinness called Bobby Charlton out for a talk on the Old Trafford pitch after training. Charlton had already showered and changed into his suit and tie. It was a wet, freezing day and as he spoke he put his hands in his pockets briefly. At which point McGuinness pointed out that hands in pockets was a breach of club rules during what was still technically training.Dutiful as ever, Charlton bent down in his pinstripes to do 10 penalty press-ups on his own in the rain in the Old Trafford centre circle so his manager would agree to talk to him again. “McGuinness was sacked a few days later,” Morgan added, not really needing to say much more.Later in the film there are some great shots of a gorgeously ripe, slightly fried-looking George Best – beard sprouting, hair a little straggly, but still whippet thin and with that same playful sadness in his lovely blue eyes. Best is shown pouring champagne down a foaming tower of glasses, something people seemed to do at pretty much every social gathering in the 1970s but which has now sadly gone out of fashion, due to political correctness going mad or the popularity of the flute over the more decadent goblet, one or the other.There was footage of a TV reporter door-stepping Miss Great Britain, literally in her Miss Great Britain robes, to ask if Best was feeling depressed. “You saw George last night didn’t you,” the reporter demands of Miss Great Britain, which is to be fair probably a fairly decent guess just on the basic percentages. Miss Great Britain rolls her eyes then smiles a private smile, remembering something. “Well … he looked OK to me.”But it wasn’t George or Miss Great Britain who stood out as the most poignant on-screen presence. And it certainly wasn’t José Mourinho, who appeared earlier in the evening inside BT’s new “manager box”, a panel that pops up in the comer of the screen giving live and uninterrupted coverage of middle-aged men looking worried while football happens. At one point Mourinho just stood completely still in his little box for what felt like ages, face completely blank, hanging in the bottom of the TV screen like a particularly sour and sallow Halloween pumpkin.It was instead the basic premise of Too Good To Go Down that made it so apt. United being relegated has always been an interesting oddity. These days it seems medieval. The stratification of resources in club football has created an oligarchy of interests at the top. It is impossible this could ever happen again. Money will not allow it.The downside of which is that – whisper it – we now have a high grade but deeply predictable league. This week the research group CIES Football Observatory published a paper called Competitive Balance: A Spatio-Temporal Comparison. Its conclusions reflect what we already know to be true, that the top clubs in every European league are pulling away.The upside of this is the presence of some truly spectacular champion teams. Here is another stat from midweek: Manchester City have best goal difference of any club at this stage since Sunderland in 1892-93. It might seem perverse to see this as a problem: City are a pure joy to watch, drilled and styled with such a luminous set of footballing rhythms, such a generous, captivating style of play.How to address all this? How to fight the inbuilt competitive obsolescence of Big Sport? Regulation is a dirty word. The market will not stand for salary caps or rules on ownership, or even, it seems, for the existing financial strictures. This is unfair and regressive, the argument goes. Liverpool and United had more money than everyone else back in the 1970s and 1980s. But then, in the 1970s and 1980s the league was also won by seven teams in 11 years, back when having a little more did not mean being able to buy the world and all that is in it.Plus, United could still go down back then. And guess what? It was good for them too. A team haunted by past glories were cleared out and energised, freed up to play thrillingly carefree attacking football. United came back with the shackles of the past thrown off, those red shirts treading lightly. Just imagine. Hmm. Relegation maybe. But let’s keep it credible."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db4fdcdb8dd5d1adf45a11c915ead37811796117/0_53_1328_797/master/1328.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=05ac9ba4e713dd3a7595044459e5623b","title":"manchester city premier league title","story":"Liverpool are also unbeaten but the champions’ march on another Premier League title continues to be relentlessThere was something in Pep Guardiola’s face that looked like acceptance, maybe even a small amount of happiness, when he pondered the pocket of pressure Manchester City were briefly under at the end of their midweek win at Watford. For ages the game felt like a mild breeze, until a late goal for Watford produced a mini storm. Perhaps (admittedly it might be overthinking this here) Guardiola even welcomed it as a timely lesson for his players. “Never can you forget to play,” he stressed in a pointed manner that suggested that message was delivered more forcefully in the dressing room. In a way Liverpool’s capacity to keep close enough to City is a help – a motivational force of sorts. Even so, they do carry themselves through games with that ultra-confidence of a heavy favourite who expects to win. An off day against a keyed-up opponent is possible. Liverpool and Man United did it last season. Lyon this. It can be done, but it won’t be very often. Manchester City have the squad with the strongest depth, the most reliable gameplan, and their motivation remains unblemished.Clearly, Manchester City could be stopped. Liverpool remain unbeaten and only two points behind the champions, and still have to go to the Etihad this season. They won there in the Champions League in April, albeit in very different circumstances with their hosts chasing the tie. Maybe the resumption of the Champions League campaign in the new year will disrupt City’s rhythm and see them take the eye off the ball. And Liverpool, it seems, are still to hit their stride. Imagine what they could achieve when they actually start playing well. For those craving an injection of drama into the title race next spring, therein lies the hope. But, in truth, it feels highly doubtful City will be stopped. There is too much quality in their ranks, too much conviction in their philosophy, and too many players still hungry to make a proper mark this season. It feels unlikely anyone will stay with them for long. Let’s put it this way: Liverpool have made their best ever start to a league season in the club’s history. They have a player, Mohamed Salah, who scored 44 times last season, won a clean sweep of the inidual awards and was unlucky not to feature more prominently in the voting for the Ballon d’Or. Virgil van Dijk is the world’s most expensive centre-half and for a short time there wasn’t another goalkeeper on the planet who cost more than Alisson. Liverpool are a slick, formidable, confident team with 12 wins and three draws from their first 15 games, only six goals conceded and few weaknesses. And here’s the thing: they are two points behind Manchester City, with a vastly inferior goal difference (14 goals worse off, in fact), and even Jürgen Klopp sounds like he is not entirely sure they can overhaul Pep Guardiola’s team. It is certainly achievable for City to outdo their tally of 100 points and 106 goals from last season, or emulate Arsenal’s Invincibles by remaining unbeaten throughout the current campaign, even if it still feels a little early to make those kind of predictions. What can possibly stop them? An injury to Ederson, perhaps? More likely, they will pull even further away over the next five months.Watching this team pass and move, the way every part looks so brilliantly cool and well-drilled, it seems the only answer is: no. City are so good they make every other team in the league look like a supermarket own-brand version of the real thing. But this is also what makes them so fascinating. Surely there must be a way of disrupting this piece of high-end engineering? City play to a formula and formulae can be studied and anticipated on the other hand knowing someone is about to do something and being able to stop them are two different things. Lyon showed a way to beat City earlier in the season. With the ball they attacked in numbers and tried to score without it they were incredibly disciplined at filling the holes City like to find. Either Premier League teams haven’t tried to replicate this, or aren’t able to, preferring instead to walk out in a state of quivering fright. Or perhaps City were just off their game that night. On a more prosaic note, prolonged injuries to Fernandinho, Sergio Agüero or even Ederson would change the dynamic.The table shows that Liverpool are only two points behind Manchester City ahead of the weekend fixtures while Tottenham Hotspur are eight off the pace in third so it is down to Jürgen Klopp’s side to stop the champions turning the title race into a second successive coronation. To do so they require help and Chelsea can start on Saturday by doing to City what they love doing to oppositions. This means squeezing time and space and bullying Pep Guardiola’s team. Maurizio Sarri has to display tactical flexibility by moving N’Golo Kanté back to his usual defensive-midfield “mad dog” berth to lead the press on City. Liverpool have shown this can unnerve Guardiola’s men and if achieved suddenly holes appear in the rear-guard and they are breached. If Chelsea, and other sides, decide to take the fight to City points could be dropped, confidence dented, and when Liverpool visit the Etihad Stadium on 3 January, the championship fight will have a different complexion.

It was 2009 and I was 25, working as a musical director for a circus in the UK. I’d travelled alone from Gloucestershire to the village of Gornja Grabovica in Serbia, on a mission to learn Roma-style accordion. A week or so into my two-month trip, a friend called Dusan took me to meet his cousin Branko, who he said was one of the country’s best violinists.When we arrived, Branko came out of the house he shared with his aunt and grandmother, wearing a white vest and jeans. I don’t remember thinking he was attractive, but for some reason I took a photo of him that I still have today.We all sat around a table in the garden. I didn’t speak a word of Serbian and Branko knew no English, so Dusan struggled to translate. Branko was shy it wasn’t every day an English woman turned up at his house. The following day I went back, and we played music together late into the night. We did this several more times, quickly developing a strong connection. It was totally platonic, however nothing else entered my head, partly because he had a girlfriend.After two months I returned to Britain. I was still determined to learn Roma accordion, but for the next couple of years I was busy touring with my work. Then, in July 2011, I had a few weeks off, and felt I was being called back to Serbia.As soon as Branko heard I was back in Gornja Grabovica, he came straight to see me. With Dusan translating again, he told me he’d thought about me every day since I had left. He had broken up with his girlfriend months earlier. It felt unreal, like magic. It was exciting to acknowledge our connection, but unusual to feel something for each other without being able to communicate fully.That night we went to an igranke, or dance. I just enjoyed being near Branko. His body language was so open, and he was so kind and loving. The next day we played music together for hours, creating new compositions. He still couldn’t say a word in English, and I’d only picked up basic things in Serbian, but it just felt right. We could usually work out what the other was trying to convey on an instinctual level, and if we couldn’t, we’d just laugh. It was so romantic. If I could rewind time, I’d go back to that moment.I stayed at his house that night, and we fell asleep in each other’s arms. I’d never felt so happy. Not being able to express the subtleties of my emotions made it more intense. It was a relief for me to be able to just feel and be, rather than constantly talking.After three weeks, I had to leave for work in Britain. It was incredibly painful, and Branko worried I’d never come back. But I was desperate to go straight back out there. My mum was very supportive, advising me to do what felt right. From then, it became more real. I bought audio tapes to learn Serbian and booked a one-way flight. This time I stayed for three months.The type of Serbian Roma culture Branko lived in was very different from the English culture I knew. There isn’t the same language to describe the process of starting a relationship if you start spending time with someone, then you’re with them, and you immediately say, “I love you.”Branko and I planned to go to Britain together for a while to earn money and introduce him to my life but he had rarely travelled even in his own country, and his tourist visa was refused twice. It was difficult to go back alone. When I returned, we decided to get married, and in March 2012 we had a simple but chaotic wedding in Serbia. We built a house on the exact spot we first met in Branko’s grandmother’s garden.We formed a band, Faith i Branko, and have spent the last three years touring Europe, Australia and New Zealand, playing festivals and releasing an album. Today my Serbian is pretty good, and while Branko still doesn’t speak fluent English, he understands a lot. They say music is the language of the soul. We took a leap to find out if that is true, and music has held us together ever since.• As told to Emma Ledger.Do you have an experience to share?

Davidson (not her real name), a 34-year-old mother of two from London, was mindlessly scrolling through her mobile, “sucked into the Insta-vacuum”, when her eight-month-old baby crawled across the bedroom floor and on to the landing. “I heard a thud, then a cry,” she says. “My brain, transfixed by my phone, took a couple of seconds to realise that she had tumbled down the stairs. I hadn’t even noticed she was out of sight. My stomach turned.”Davidson admits that she was very lucky: apart from being a little shocked, her daughter was fine. Her fall had been broken three steps down. “I was riddled with guilt,” Davidson says. “I could have damaged my child, and for what? For looking at some meaningless nonsense on social media? I can’t bring myself to tell my husband. But it has been enough to make me re-evaluate my relationship with my devices. The irony is, I’ve always been pretty militant about their screen time – they are both under three and don’t watch TV or have iPads.”Many parents feel adrift in this new era of technology. Those with teenagers feel in constant conflict over screens, where leniency, rules and even bans all fail in different ways. Those with younger kids are trying to entertain and appease them, while instinctively wanting to limit time on devices that seem to do everything possible to keep children hooked. Yet parents seem unaware of the impact their own screen use has on their kids – prompting the education minister Damian Hinds to argue last month that they should consider putting phones away and prioritising “one-to-one time without gadgets”, so that children are properly supported in their learning at home.More worryingly, evidence is building that screen use, particularly of smartphones, has a negative impact on the conversational development of very young children. Chris Calland, a child behaviour expert and adviser to parents, schools and nurseries across the UK on what has been dubbed “technoference”, says a clear relationship has emerged over the last five years between adults who are glued to their phones and children who arrive at school without the language and interpersonal skills expected of a four- to five-year-old. “I was recently asked into a school reception class to help teachers find new ways to get through to parents who were persistently talking or scrolling on their phones, even as they collected their children, took their hands and walked them away from the school gates.”They concluded that one solution would be to write scripts that could be handed out to parents to re-educate them in talking to their children. For example: “Look at that dog”, or “Tell me one nice thing you’ve done today.” At one nursery Calland worked with, staff put up pictures of phones with red lines through them, because they were struggling so hard to gain parents’ attention. Perhaps this is not surprising, when parents can now buy a phone holder that clips on to a pram or even a “swipe and feed” accessory that can be attached to a baby bottle. “This is not about judgment,” Calland says. “Being drawn into our phones is insidious. But the first three years are the most formative for children, and when parents have their attention locked on their phones, they are missing countless cues to interact with their kids.”In learning language, the quality of interaction is critical. The “conversational duet” was first identified in the 1980s to describe the learning stage between 18 months and three years – the intimate cooing and babbling between parent and child as it learns and repeats language through a magical ensemble of bodily, facial and vocal interactions. Interruptions – calls, notifications, Facebook updates or photo-taking – sabotage that exchange.In a study published in the US journal Developmental Psychology in August 2017, researchers asked two groups of mothers to teach their children two words. In one group, the mothers were interrupted by a phone call whether they explained the interruption or not, their children did not learn the new words. The children who weren’t interrupted did. To make sense of this effect, Maryam Abdullah, a developmental psychologist who directs the parenting programme at the University of California, Berkeley’s Greater Good Science Center, says it’s important to recognise how crucial attachment is to child development. “Children are learning the rhythm of what it feels like to be in a social interaction. They are learning social dialogue from the responsiveness of the parent to their changes in emotion.”This delicate, gentle process of bonding and learning is critical for parents, too, honing their ability to read their child’s cues and anticipate a problem or need before it escalates. And a key part of attachment is, unsurprisingly, attention – the very thing our devices are so good at stealing from us.Michelle Morris, consultant speech and language therapist at Salford Royal NHS Trust, cautions that there is no unequivocal data on the effects of tech, because there are so many other variables at work. “We do, however, know about early language development and the importance of the adult being ‘in the moment’ and starting a conversation. If a child points to some ducks in a park, and the adult is not ‘present’ because they are looking at Instagram, they won’t see this non-verbal exchange and will miss the opportunity to respond accordingly. It frustrates the child and, over time, may reduce the likelihood of them initiating that type of interaction again. It reduces the opportunity for exposure to words, and it misses a vital early learning opportunity.”Even with adolescents – who are naturally pushing for autonomy to make their own decisions – the example set by their parents is hugely formative. Our self-management skills typically don’t mature until we reach our mid-20s, suggesting our parents and, to some extent, our peers, influence our development until then. All this means that if you’re confiscating your kids’ devices in the evening, but are still glued to your own phone at night, it’s a recipe for conflict, because you’re not setting a consistent example.I recently visited a church in Livermore, a quiet Californian town 40 miles from Silicon Valley, where a crowd of parents and slightly reluctant teenagers had gathered to watch Screenagers , an indie documentary about teenagers’ use of technology. There were groans of recognition as it played. “I got Lauren a phone when she was 13,” parent Michelle Deplitch tells me afterwards, “and now her sister is coming up to 13 and she wants one, too. But I say, ‘I already lost one child. I can’t lose another.’” Lauren and her younger brother, Ian, see things differently, of course. “Dad is on his computer from when he wakes up at 5am to when we leave for school, looking at motorcycles and boats and stuff,” Ian says. “It’s not at the right times,” Lauren adds. “When we have to go places, he’ll do everything at the last minute and we’ll be late.”Jaron Lanier doesn’t think it’s helpful to blame parents or their children for this apparent crisis in our prosocial development. A computer scientist, technology philosopher and musician, Lanier has been warning of technology’s “agents of alienation” since 1992. He has been emphatically vindicated by the era of the data-gathering, attention-stealing smartphone. He is multitasking when I talk to him, organising imminent delivery of tonight’s dinner with his 12-year-old daughter, while describing the malign effects of the technology companies to me on the phone. “I’m not claiming to be an ideal parent because I’m figuring this out, too,” he says. “But I do know about the technology and, from that perspective, it’s important to remember that these devices are designed to be addictive, in the formal sense. That’s the acknowledged truth from executives at these companies. Rather than thinking it’s the kids’ fault or the parents’ fault, we have to recognise that these are cruel systems that prey on universal human frailties.”Despite this, Lanier has detected the earliest shoots of conscience in Silicon Valley, not least because many technologists are now in their 30s with kids of their own. This summer, Google and Apple introduced features that let smartphone users monitor and limit how much time they spend on their own devices, although these are basic and easy to work around. Surely the industry could do more to come up with technologies that compete less aggressively for our attention and which are better for our physical and emotional health?Janet Read, professor of child computer interaction at the University of Central Lancashire, says part of the problem is that many services are based on rigid systems originally built for the workplace. These allow users to play, surf or browse infinitely, giving little encouragement to moderate screen time – whether they are a Facebook-addicted mother or a Minecraft-obsessed child. A more humane approach would be to use artificial intelligence to develop computers that could mimic and reflect the behaviour of children. “Maybe the computer could have a hissy fit, or it could slow down, or stop interacting or be naughty. That kind of interaction could be more helpful to a child’s development because it reflects our own instincts and behaviours.” If the computer decides that 20 minutes is enough, or that we seem too tired to play, it could just shut down – and, in doing so, help us to learn what the right time to switch off feels like.Read says there is insufficient research in this area, but that computers could be taught to respond to humour and playfulness, or to empathise when a user seems to be struggling. At school, that might mean creating a computer that behaves more like a teacher, adjusting each interaction according to the learning style of the child. Children could be encouraged to share, take turns and resolve arguments. But until there is some kind of maturity in the technology we have all come to rely on, Read acknowledges that parents are in a difficult position. For poorer families, in particular, the phone can provide a lifeline to support and connection when someone is feeling stressed and isolated. “You can’t teach anyone how to parent – they’ve got to figure it out for themselves,” she says.Advice published by the American Medical Association in August suggests good technology hygiene: no devices while driving, at the dinner table or in the bedroom allocating time to unplug with your children and showing them how to focus on a single task at a time. Crucially, it also advises prioritising quality, technology-free time with your children while resisting the urge to document it all. Morris, of Salford Royal NHS Trust, believes public health intervention is necessary. “One of the most helpful things that we can do is have a discussion with all parents about their screen time and ask them to monitor how much they are on their phones – everyone is shocked. We can then encourage them to pledge a planned period of phone-free time when they are with their children. This way no families are stigmatised.”Kelsey Wolfman, a parent from the San Francisco bay area, has had more success than most in rebalancing her family’s use of devices. She recently banned her three young children from playing video games, watching TV or using their tablet computers. She was tired of the tantrums when it was time to do homework and increasingly worried about the impact of screen time on her children’s wellbeing, especially when one of her sons started struggling with anxiety and night terrors.“I decided to do a screen fast and see if we could reduce the battle we are having,” she says. “Now I find I spend more time entertaining them, interjecting in arguments or when they are getting a bit too creative with toys. But what has helped them be OK with not having their screens is that I have turned off all the notifications on my own phone and, instead, try to check in once every couple of hours. I felt bad about them seeing me constantly responding to my phone. I don’t want them to stop having a zest for life in general, for being outside and exploring and getting their hands dirty. I want them to know that there is a huge world out there.”• Additional reporting by Deborah LintonCommenting on this piece?

In fairness, after several decades in which the gym has taken the place of drink and drugs, he has the kind of body most men his age would consider achievable only by means of radical surgery. What’s more, the song he’s starting – Women – is one so silly that an oiled torso seems only fitting. “And in the garden, lust began,” sings Joe Elliott – who remains fully clothed at all times – “the animal instinct, the wanton man.”Lyrics were never Def Leppard’s strong suit. But hooks were. Hysteria – played in full tonight – has sold somewhere in the region of 25m copies because it leaves nothing to chance. Rather than write songs and record them, Def Leppard wrote the best sections they could, which they then assembled into songs in the studio with producer Robert John “Mutt” Lange. Live, you realise just how complex the edifice is: the interlocking vocals (with lots of glam-rock chanting), the switches between guitars, the fact that every song just gets bigger: this bit should be the chorus! No, this bit should! No, this is the chorus! It’s irresistible.It’s a testimony to how powerful Hysteria was that we’re 40 minutes into the show before there’s a song that wouldn’t be intimately familiar to anyone around in the late 80s. Hysteria spawned seven singles, and thoroughly deserves its reputation as hard rock’s Thriller. You realise how sophisticated it was when the band follow it with their second single, Wasted, from 1979. It’s perfectly decent, miles better than most of their New Wave of British Heavy Metal peers, but it would never have opened arena doors for them. It took the set closer, Photograph, to do that. Collen and Vivian Campbell burst into its opening riff – one so indelible it will be playing in a loop on some automated classic rock station long after humanity has died – and you can’t help but thrill.

Country stars Maren Morris and Kacey Musgraves, rapper Cardi B, pop futurist Janelle Monáe and Lady Gaga could all take home major awards at the 61st Grammy award ceremony in Los Angeles next February.Elsewhere, Kendrick Lamar and Drake dominate proceedings, with eight and seven nominations respectively. Along with Childish Gambino, AKA Donald Glover, they could rectify the other dispute that emerged from this year’s awards – namely the Recording Academy nominating but not awarding major hip-hop artists.Recording Academy president Neil Portnow said in a statement that “reflection, re-evaluation and implementation” drove recent changes to the Grammys’ processes and nominations.Cardi B, Brandi Carlile, Drake, HER, Post Malone, Janelle Monáe, Kacey Musgraves and Lamar’s Black Panther OST are up for album of the year, the Recording Academy’s most prestigious prize. music critic Alexis Petridis said: “It seems like a concerted effort on the part of the Grammys to reward slightly less obvious artists than you might expect, and there’s something really pleasing about seeing talented but more tangential Nashville acts such as Brandi Carlisle and Kacey Musgraves being nominated in major categories.”Many of pop’s biggest acts will be disappointed. Taylor Swift, who received seven Grammy nominations for her previous album, 1989, received just one for Reputation, and in best pop album, a minor category. The Carters, AKA Beyoncé and Jay-Z, as well as Ariana Grande and Travis Scott, were also left out of major categories, receiving nods in genre categories. Kanye West received one nomination as producer of the year.More than half of the 2019 nominees in each of the four major categories (album of the year, best new artist, song of the year and record of the year) are women, with songwriter Brandi Carlile and R\u0026ampB singer HER among the lesser-known. Female artists also dominate the country categories – a trend that flies in the face of the genre’s male dominance.Only four women were nominated across all four major categories at the 2018 Grammys. Portnow compounded the issue when he said women artists needed to “step up” if they wanted to be recognised, comments he said he later regretted. In response to the outcry, the Recording Academy announced a taskforce to tackle anti-woman bias in the music industry, led by Michelle Obama’s former chief of staff, Tina Tchen.The 2018 Grammys also sparked controversy for nominating a number of hip-hop stars yet sending few of them home with trophies. Strong showings for Cardi B, Drake, Kendrick Lamar and Post Malone could change that this year.It is a mediocre year for British acts. R\u0026ampB newcomer Ella Mai has found greater success in the US than her home country, and received two nominations for her breakout single, Boo’d Up. Dua Lipa and Jorja Smith are nominated for best new artist. Seal is nominated for best traditional pop vocal album, and Arctic Monkeys for best rock performance and best alternative music album. Jon Hopkins and SOPHIE were recognised in best danceelectronic album. Recent sales suggest the UK’s ability to produce global pop superstars has dwindled.“The most vibrant music that’s currently happening in the mainstream in Britain – the post-grime wave of UK rap – is obviously going to struggle to cross over to America,” said Petridis. “There’s a big linguistic and cultural barrier facing those artists, as well as a longstanding American aversion to hip-hop that isn’t homegrown.”The 61st Grammy awards will take place at the Staples Center in Los Angeles on 10 February 2019. Recordings released between 1 October 2018 and 30 September 2018 were eligible for consideration.Album of the yearCardi B – Invasion of PrivacyBrandi Carlile – By the Way, I Forgive YouDrake –

skins review posthumous album kanye west","story":"Shot dead in June, the rapper has since stormed charts worldwide. This posthumous album reveals a maverick talent – and a grim contribution from Kanye WestEver since the day in May 1958 when Jerry Lee Lewis fetched up for a British tour in the company of a 13-year-old girl who turned out to be his wife, rock and pop music has offered fans ample opportunity to consider the wisdom or otherwise of separating the art from the artist. Music’s history comes liberally sprinkled with paedophiles, murderers, racists, domestic abusers, homophobes and violent criminals, among them some figures of pivotal artistic importance. The question of how the listener deals with their personal lives hangs heavy. Ignore it entirely? Pursue a music collection entirely comprised of stuff made by people whose moral integrity matches your own? Take the fingers-in-the-ears approach and assume innocence? Develop a personal sliding scale, in which some terrible transgressions are more terrible than others?Certainly, few artists in recent years have provoked those questions quite like the late XXXTentacion, who was shot dead in June. He was clearly an important artist, who almost singlehandedly shifted the way hip-hop sounded with one track: Look At Me!, as avant-garde, lo-fi and extreme a piece of music as has ever made the US Top 40. He was also a man who had experienced an appalling life of neglect, violence and mental illness, which in turn had made him an appalling person: when he wasn’t redefining hip-hop, he dedicated an inordinate amount of time to inflicting misery on other people, from the cellmate he subjected to a violent assault because he thought he might be gay, to the pregnant girlfriend whose grim deposition regarding the horrifying injuries he inflicted on her seemed to be confirmed by a recently unearthed recording in which the rapper also confessed to stabbing eight people.The position is further complicated by the fact that his fame and his music was bound up with his infamy. He exploded in popularity while he was in prison on domestic violence charges the chorus of his hit single Sad!, which took up residence in the charts after his murder, depicts him threatening to kill himself if his girlfriend leaves him, something the girlfriend behind the deposition also claimed he would do in real life.In fairness, his fans seem A-OK with this moral conundrum: he’s currently the fourth most streamed artist in the world on Spotify. But in the event that anyone is still wrestling with their conscience, his first posthumous release brings happy news: it’s OK, Kanye West has got this. Skins is both characteristically short – only one of its 10 tracks lasts over three minutes, half of them are over in under two – and short on guest appearances. But, thankfully, room has been made for pop’s premier blue-sky thinker to share his indispensable thoughts on a track called One Minute, amid a jerking, sickly metal guitar riff and the sound of XXXTentacion himself, in his solitary contribution to the song, offering an approximation of a death metal growl. After some imponderable remarks about anal sex, West announces that it’s time for us to worry no more, because the abuse XXXTentacion meted out was probably all the victim’s fault anyway: “Now your name is tainted by the claims they painting  the defendant is guilty  no one blames the plaintiff.”It’s difficult to know what to say about this, other than to note that Kanye West has once again managed to make an event entirely about Kanye West, albeit not through a dazzling display of talent, but by his increasingly wearying willingness to say something so asinine, ignorant and toxic that you can scarcely believe you’re hearing it. This now seems to be his full-time job and it’s a desperately depressing way for a talented artist to see out their career. It’s all the more baffling given that the lyrics that come of XXXTentacion’s mouth on Skins are largely devoid of the unchecked misogyny and violence that marked out his earlier work.One Minute is the most substantial thing here. The rest of Skins passes by in a bitty blur that’s alternately fascinating and confusing. It’s hard to work out if a track such as Whoa (Mind in Awe) is evidence of the kind of fragmentary, wilfully underbaked aesthetic that led some critics to compare XXXTentacion’s work to the early releases of lo-fi indie rockers Sebadoh and Tall Dwarves, or just unfinished: there’s a beautiful keyboard melody, one verse, some backing vocals and that’s it. There are tracks that suggest an artist straining at the confines of his genre – Difference is a really appealing recording of him singing to an acoustic guitar accompaniment, while the similarly acoustic closer What Are You Afraid Of? is a genuinely lovely song.Some tracks suggest his ambition to cross musical boundaries might have outstripped his ability to do so: a big fan of Kurt Cobain he may have been, but Staring at the Sky is awful, like a snarky parody of a self-pitying grunge track that’s evidently meant in deadly earnest. There are really chilling moments, not least Train Food, with its ominous piano chords and feedback-laden guitar backing given a creepy intimacy by being recorded without reverb, so they appear to be taking place right next to you. Here, a man who clearly had an inkling his time was running out confronts his own mortality and appears to accept that whatever legacy he’s left behind is irreparably tainted: “Ask yourself the final question – is you going down or up?  Recollecting all the moments that you never gave a fuck.” And there is stuff that just seems slight, as if its disjointed brevity isn’t always just an aesthetic decision, but occasionally also a way of covering up a scarcity of ideas, a lack of material.One unpalatable explanation for XXXTentacion’s success is that there are people out there stupid or disaffected enough to be turned on by his damaged nihilism. But there’s also just enough evidence of a maverick talent on Skins to make you see why others are willing to hold their noses, ignore the stern op-ed pieces and e in. Whether you can do that is a matter for your conscience."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a7962fc2531c83eac0188ce4fcd0d325cebca5b2/0_0_5030_3018/master/5030.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=40ae6b8a9f231a2bff5f27b32ed581bb","title":"china plan for global media dominance propaganda xi jinping","story":"Beijing is buying up media outlets and training scores of foreign journalists to ‘tell China’s story well’ – as part of a worldwide propaganda campaign of astonishing scope and ambition. By  Louisa Lim and  Julia BerginAs they sifted through resumes, the team recruiting for the new London hub of China’s state-run broadcaster had an enviable problem: far, far too many candidates. Almost 6,000 people were applying for just 90 jobs “reporting the news from a Chinese perspective”. Even the simple task of reading through the heap of applications would take almost two months.For western journalists, demoralised by endless budget cuts, China Global Television Network presents an enticing prospect, offering competitive salaries to work in state-of-the-art purpose-built studios in Chiswick, west London. CGTN – as the international arm of China Central Television (CCTV) was rebranded in 2016 – is the most high-profile component of China’s rapid media expansion across the world, whose goal, in the words of President Xi Jinping, is to “tell China’s story well”. In practice, telling China’s story well looks a lot like serving the ideological aims of the state.For decades, Beijing’s approach to shaping its image has been defensive, reactive and largely aimed at a domestic audience. The most visible manifestation of these efforts was the literal disappearance of content inside China: foreign magazines with pages ripped out, or the BBC news flickering to black when it aired stories on sensitive issues such as Tibet, Taiwan or the Tiananmen killings of 1989. Beijing’s crude tools were domestic censorship, official complaints to news organisations’ headquarters and expelling correspondents from China.But over the past decade or so, China has rolled out a more sophisticated and assertive strategy, which is increasingly aimed at international audiences. China is trying to reshape the global information environment with massive infusions of money – funding paid-for advertorials, sponsored journalistic coverage and heavily massaged positive messages from boosters. While within China the press is increasingly tightly controlled, abroad Beijing has sought to exploit the vulnerabilities of the free press to its advantage.In its simplest form, this involves paying for Chinese propaganda supplements to appear in dozens of respected international publications such as the Washington Post. The strategy can also take more insidious forms, such as planting content from the state-run radio station, China Radio International (CRI), on to the airwaves of ostensibly independent broadcasters across the world, from Australia to Turkey.Meanwhile, in the US, lobbyists paid by Chinese-backed institutions are cultivating vocal supporters known as “third-party spokespeople” to deliver Beijing’s message, and working to sway popular perceptions of Chinese rule in Tibet. China is also wooing journalists from around the world with all-expenses-paid tours and, perhaps most ambitiously of all, free graduate degrees in communication, training scores of foreign reporters each year to “tell China’s story well”.Since 2003, when revisions were made to an official document outlining the political goals of the People’s Liberation Army, so-called “media warfare” has been an explicit part of Beijing’s military strategy. The aim is to influence public opinion overseas in order to nudge foreign governments into making policies favourable towards China’s Communist party. “Their view of national security involves pre-emption in the world of ideas,” says former CIA analyst Peter Mattis, who is now a fellow in the China programme at the Jamestown Foundation, a security-focused Washington thinktank. “The whole point of pushing that kind of propaganda out is to preclude or preempt decisions that would go against the People’s Republic of China.”Sometimes this involves traditional censorship: intimidating those with dissenting opinions, cracking down on platforms that might carry them, or simply acquiring those outlets. Beijing has also been patiently increasing its control over the global digital infrastructure through private Chinese companies, which are dominating the switchover from analogue to digital television in parts of Africa, launching television satellites and building networks of fibre-optic cables and data centres – a “digital silk road” – to carry information around the world. In this way, Beijing is increasing its grip, not only over news producers and the means of production of the news, but also over the means of transmission.Though Beijing’s propaganda offensive is often shrugged off as clumsy and downright dull, our five-month investigation underlines the granular nature and ambitious scale of its aggressive drive to redraw the global information order. This is not just a battle for clicks. It is above all an ideological and political struggle, with China determined to increase its “discourse power” to combat what it sees as decades of unchallenged western media imperialism.At the same time, Beijing is also seeking to shift the global centre of gravity eastwards, propagating the idea of a new world order with a resurgent China at its centre. Of course, influence campaigns are nothing new the US and the UK, among others, have aggressively courted journalists, offering enticements such as freebie trips and privileged access to senior officials. But unlike those countries, China’s Communist party does not accept a plurality of views. Instead, for China’s leaders, who regard the press as the “eyes, ears, tongue and throat” of the Communist party, the idea of journalism depends upon a narrative discipline that precludes all but the party-approved version of events. For China, the media has become both the battlefield on which this “global information war” is being waged, and the weapon of attack.Nigerian investigative journalist Dayo Aiyetan still remembers the phone call he received a few years after CCTV opened its African hub in Kenya in 2012. Aiyetan had set up Nigeria’s premier investigative journalism centre, and he had exposed Chinese businessmen for illegally logging forests in Nigeria. The caller had a tempting offer: take a job working for the Chinese state-run broadcaster’s new office, he was told, and you’ll earn at least twice your current salary. Aiyetan was tempted by the money and the job security, but ultimately decided against, having only just launched his centre.As the location of the Chinese media’s first big international expansion, Africa has been a testbed. These efforts intensified after the 2008 Olympics, when Chinese leaders were frustrated with a tide of critical reporting, in particular the international coverage of the human rights and pro-Tibet protests that accompanied the torch relay around the world. The following year China announced it would spend $6.6bn strengthening its global media presence. Its first major international foray was CCTV Africa, which immediately tried to recruit highly-respected figures such as Aiyetan.For local journalists, CCTV promised good money and the chance to “tell the story of Africa” to a global audience, without having to hew to western narratives. “The thing I like is we are telling the story from our perspective,” Kenyan journalist Beatrice Marshall said, after being poached from KTN, one of Kenya’s leading television stations. Her presence strengthened the station’s credibility, and she has continued to stress the editorial independence of the journalists themselves.Over the past six years, CGTN has steadily increased its reach across Africa. It is displayed on televisions in the corridors of power at the African Union, in Addis Ababa, and beamed for free to thousands of rural villages in a number of African countries, including Rwanda and Ghana, courtesy of StarTimes, a Chinese media company with strong ties to the state. StarTimes’ cheapest packages bundle together Chinese and African channels, whereas access to the BBC or al-Jazeera costs more, putting it beyond the means of most viewers. In this way, their impact is to expand access to Chinese propaganda to their audience, which they claim accounts for 10m of Africa’s 24m pay-TV subscribers. Though industry analysts believe that these numbers are likely to be inflated, broadcasters are already concerned that StarTimes is edging local companies out of some African media markets. In September, the Ghana Independent Broadcasters Association warned that “If StarTimes is allowed to control Ghana’s digital transmission infrastructure and the satellite space … Ghana would have virtually submitted its broadcast space to Chinese control and content.”For non-Chinese journalists, in Africa and elsewhere, working for Chinese state-run media offers generous remuneration and new opportunities. When CCTV launched its Washington headquarters in 2012, no fewer than five former or current BBC correspondents based in Latin America joined the broadcaster. One of them, Daniel Schweimler, who is now at al-Jazeera, said his experience there was fun and relatively trouble-free, though he didn’t think many people actually saw his stories.Describing his work at Xinhua, the former employee said: “You’ve got to think it’s like creative writing. You’re combining journalism with a kind of creative writing.” Another former employee, Christian Claye Edwards, who worked for Xinhua news agency in Sydney between 2010 and 2014, says: “Their objectives were loud and clear, to push a distinctly Chinese agenda.” He continued: “There’s no clear goal other than to identify cracks in a system and exploit them.” One example would be highlighting the chaotic and unpredictable nature of Australian politics – which has seen six prime ministers in eight years – as a way of undermining faith in liberal democracy. “Part of my brief was to find ways to exert that influence. It was never written down, I was never given orders,” he said.Edwards, like other former employees of China’s state-media companies, felt that the vast majority of his work was about domestic signalling, or telegraphing messages that demonstrated loyalty to the party line in order to curry favour with senior officials. Any thoughts of how his work was furthering China’s international soft power goals came a distant second. But since Edwards left in 2014, Xinhua has begun looking outwards one sign of this is the existence of its Twitter account – followed by 11.7 million people – even though Twitter is banned in China.Outright censorship is generally unnecessary at China’s state-run media organisations, since most journalists quickly gain a sense of which stories are deemed appropriate and what kind of spin is needed. “I recognised that we were soft propaganda tools – but not to any greater extent than for the BBC or al-Jazeera, and certainly nothing like RT,” said Daniel Schweimler, who worked for CCTV in South America for two years. “We always joked that we’d have no interference from Beijing or DC so long as the Dalai Lama never came to visit.”When the Dalai Lama did come to visit Canada in 2012, one journalist in Xinhua’s Ottawa bureau, Mark Bourrie, was placed in a compromising position. On the day of the visit, Bourrie was told to use his parliamentary press credentials to attend the Tibetan spiritual leader’s press conference, and to find out what had happened in a closed-door meeting with the then prime minister, Stephen Harper. When Bourrie asked whether the information would be used in a piece, his boss replied that it would not. “That day I felt that we were spies,” he later wrote. “It was time to draw the line.” He returned to his office and resigned. Now a lawyer, Bourrie declined to comment for this story.His experience is not unusual. Three separate sources who used to work at Chinese state media said that they sometimes wrote confidential reports, knowing that they would not be published on the newswire and were solely for the eyes of senior officials. Edwards – who wrote one such report on Adelaide’s urban planning – saw it as “the lowest level of research reporting for Chinese officials”, essentially providing very low-level intelligence for a government client.That vanishingly thin line between China’s journalism, propaganda work, influence projection and intelligence-gathering is a concern to Washington. In mid-September this year, the US ordered CGTN and Xinhua to register under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (Fara), which compels agents representing the interests of foreign powers in a political or quasi-political capacity to log their relationship, as well as their activities and payments. Recently Donald Trump’s campaign manager, Paul Manafort, was charged for violating this act by failing to register as a foreign lobbyist in relation to his work in Ukraine. “Chinese intelligence gathering and information warfare efforts are known to involve staff of Chinese state-run media organisations,” a congressional commission noted last year.“Making the Foreign Serve China” was one of Chairman Mao’s favoured strategies, as epitomised by his decision to grant access in the 1930s to the American journalist Edgar Snow. The resulting book, Red Star Over China, was instrumental in winning western sympathy for the Communists, whom it depicted as progressive and anti-fascist.Eight decades on, “making the foreign serve China” is not just a case of offering insider access in return for favourable coverage, but also of using media companies staffed with foreign employees to serve the party’s interests. In 2012, during a series of press conferences in Beijing at the annual legislature, the National People’s Congress, government officials repeatedly invited questions from a young Australian woman unfamiliar to the local foreign correspondents. She was notable for her fluent Chinese and her assiduously softball questions.After the Beijing press pack accused Yu of being a “fake foreign reporter”, who was effectively working for the Chinese government, she told an interviewer: “When I first entered my company, there’s only a certain amount of understanding I have about its connections to the government. I didn’t know it had any, for example.” She left CAMG shortly after, but the same performance was repeated at the National People’s Congress two years later with a different Chinese-speaking Australian working for CAMG, Louise Kenney, who publicly pushed back against accusations of being a shill.The use of foreign radio stations to deliver government-approved content is a strategy the CRI president has called jie chuan chu hai, “borrowing a boat to go out to the ocean”. In 2015, Reuters reported that Global CAMG was one of three companies running a covert network of 33 radio stations broadcasting CRI content in 14 countries. Three years on, those networks – including Ostar – now operate 58 stations in 35 countries, according to information from their websites. In the US alone, CRI content is broadcast by more than 30 outlets, according to a combative recent speech by the US vice president, Mike Pence, though it’s difficult to know who is listening or how much influence this content really has.Beijing has also taken a similar “borrowed boats” approach to print publications. The state-run English-language newspaper China Daily has struck deals with at least 30 foreign newspapers – including the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, the Washington Post and the UK  – to carry four- or eight-page inserts called China Watch, which can appear as often as monthly. The supplements take a didactic, old-school approach to propaganda recent headlines include “Tibet has seen 40 years of shining success”, “Xi unveils opening-up measures” and – least surprisingly of all – “Xi praises Communist party of China members.”Figures are hard to come by, but according to one report, the Daily  is paid £750,000 annually to carry the China Watch insert once a month. Even the Daily Mail has an agreement with the government’s Chinese-language mouthpiece, the People’s Daily, which provides China-themed clickbait such as tales of bridesmaids on fatal drinking sprees and a young mother who sold her toddler to human traffickers to buy cosmetics. Such content-sharing deals are one factor behind China Daily’s astonishing expenditures in the US it has spent $20.8m on US influence since 2017, making it the highest registered spender that is not a foreign government.The purpose of this “borrowed boats” strategy may also be to lend credibility to the content, since it’s not clear how many readers actually bother to open these turgid, propaganda-heavy supplements. “Part of it really is about legitimation,” argues Peter Mattis. “If it’s appearing in the Washington Post, if it’s appearing in a number of other papers worldwide, then in a sense it’s giving credibility to those views.”In September, Donald Trump criticised this practice, claiming China was pushing “false messages” intended to damage his prospects in the midterm elections. His wrath was directed at a China Watch supplement in the Iowa-based Des Moines Register, designed to undermine farm-country support for a trade war. He tweeted: “China is actually placing propaganda ads in the Des Moines Register and other papers, made to look like news. That’s because we are beating them on Trade, opening markets, and the farmers will make a fortune when this is over!”In the Xi Jinping era, propaganda has become a business. In a 2014 speech, propaganda tsar Liu Qibao endorsed this approach, stating that other countries have successfully used market forces to export their cultural products. The push to monetise propaganda provides canny businesspeople with opportunities to curry favour at high levels, either through partnering with state-run media companies or bankrolling Chinese proxies overseas. The favoured strategy now is not just “borrowing foreign boats” but buying them outright, as the University of Canterbury’s Anne-Marie Brady has written.The most visible example of this came in 2015, when China’s richest man acquired the South China Morning Post (SCMP), a 115-year-old Hong Kong paper once known for its editorial independence and tough reporting. Jack Ma, whose Alibaba e-commerce empire is valued at $420bn, has not denied suggestions that he was asked by mainland authorities to make the purchase. “If I had to bother about what other people speculated about, how would I get anything done?” he said in December 2015. Around the same time, Alibaba’s executive vice-chairman Joseph Tsai made clear that under new ownership, the SCMP would provide an alternative view of China to the one found in western media: “A lot of journalists working with these western media organisations may not agree with the system of governance in China and that taints their view of coverage. We see things differently, we believe things should be presented as they are,” Tsai told an interviewer.The task of executing that mission has fallen to 35-year-old CEO Gary Liu, a Mandarin-speaking California native with a Harvard degree, who had previously worked as chief executive of the digital news aggregator Digg and before that, on the business side of the music streaming company Spotify. When we spoke via Skype, Liu sounded a little bit uncomfortable when asked how well the SCMP is fulfilling Tsai’s vision. “The owners have their set of language, and the newspaper has our convictions,” he said. “And our conviction is that our job is to cover China with objectivity, and to do our best to show both sides of a very, very complicated story.” The paper’s role, as he sees it, is “to lead the global conversation about China.” And to achieve that goal, Liu is being given significant resources. Staffers talk of “staggering” expenditures, with one employee describing the number of new hires “like the cast of Ben Hur”.Even under new ownership, the SCMP treads a delicate line on China, continuing to run granular political analysis and original reporting on sensitive issues such as human rights lawyers and religious crackdowns. Though pages are free from Xinhua copy, cynics joke the paper itself is transmogrifying into a kind of China Daily-lite, with increasing prominence given to stories about Xi Jinping, pro-Beijing editorials and politically on-message opinion pieces. All this is combined with constant, fawning coverage of owner Jack Ma, memorably described by the paper as a “modern-day Confucius”.Two stories in particular have been heavily criticised. First, in 2016, it published an interview with a young human rights activist named Zhao Wei, who had disappeared into police custody a year before. In the interview, the activist’s quotes, recanting her past behaviour, were reminiscent of Mao-era “self-criticism”. Fears she had spoken under duress were confirmed a year later, when she admitted she’d given her “candid confession” after being held in a heavily monitored cell for a year – “No talking. No walking. Our hands, feet, our posture … every body movement was strictly limited,” she wrote.Then, earlier this year, the SCMP accepted a “government-arranged interview” with bookseller Gui Minhai. Gui, a Swedish citizen, was one of five sellers of politically sensational books who disappeared in 2015 – in his case from his home in Thailand – and then reappeared in police custody in China in 2016. The SCMP interview was conducted in a detention facility, with Gui flanked by security guards.But Liu is adamant that the paper has not made any missteps on his watch. He says the paper was invited – not forced – to cover these stories. In Gui’s case, he insists the decision was based on journalistic merit: “The senior editorial leadership team got together, and said: This is important for us to show up. If not, there’s a very high likelihood that the other stories reported do not share the entire situation. In fact, a lot of the other reports did not mention the fact that there were security guards standing on either side of Gui Minhai at the start and at the end of the interviews.” Liu stressed that “there is a significant difference between how we reported it, and how we would expect state propaganda to report it.” But many in Hong Kong were distressed that a journal once seen as a paper of record was effectively running a forced confession on behalf of the Chinese state.To insiders, even the paper’s hardhitting coverage of China forms part of a broader strategy. “It’s all smoke and mirrors,” longtime contributor Stephen Vines said. “It’s so pernicious because a lot of is quite plausible.” In November, Vines issued a public statement announcing he will no longer write for the paper. A current SCMP journalist described “a veneer of press freedom”, noting, “It’s not so much that pieces are pulled and changed. It’s where they’re positioned, how they’re promoted. The digital revolution has made that all very easy to do. You write whatever you want, but the people control what we see.” The SCMP has countered public criticism of censorship aggressively, even running a column in which a senior editor blamed censorship accusations on “butthurt ex-Post employees with axes to grind”.But Essa pulled no punches in a piece he subsequently wrote for Foreign Policy: “Red lines are thick and non-negotiable. Given the economic dependence on the Chinese and crisis in newsrooms, this is rarely confronted. And this is precisely the type of media environment that China wants their African allies to replicate.” This is true not just in Africa, but for China’s media interests across the world.These days Australia has come to be seen as a petri dish for Chinese influence overseas. At the heart of the row is a controversial Chinese billionaire, Huang Xiangmo, whose links to Labor party politician Sam Dastyari precipitated Dastyari’s resignation in 2017. Three years earlier, Huang provided A$1.8m of seed funding to establish the Australia China Relations Institute, a thinktank based at the University of Technology Sydney. ACRI, which is led by former foreign minister Bob Carr, aims to promote “a positive and optimistic view of Australia-China relations”.In the past two years, ACRI has spearheaded a programme organising study tours to China for at least 28 high-profile Australian journalists, whisking them on all-expenses tours with extraordinary access. Many of the breathless resulting articles – footnoting their status as “guests of ACRI” or “guests of the All China Journalist Association” – accord remarkably closely with Beijing’s strategic priorities. As well as paeans to China’s modernity and size, the articles advise Australians not to turn their backs on China’s One Belt One Road initiative, and not to publicly criticise China’s policy towards the South China Sea, or anything else for that matter.Participants on the study tours do not downplay their influence. “I found the trip fantastic”, says one reporter who asked not to be named. “In Australia, the reporting often doesn’t go beyond having a one-party communist system. There’s a lot of positive things happening in China in terms of technology, business and trade, and that doesn’t get a lot of positive coverage.” Others treat the trips with more caution. “You go on these trips knowing you’re going to be getting their point of view,” says the ABC’s economics correspondent Peter Ryan, who went on an ACRI-sponsored trip in 2016.ACRI responded to our questions about the trips by issuing a statement, saying that its tours “pale into insignificance” compared with similar trips organised by the US and Israel. A spokesman wrote: “Not for a moment has ACRI ever lobbied journalists about what they write. They are free to take whatever position they want.” The spokesman also confirmed that in-kind support to the trips has been given by the All-China Journalists Association, a Communist party body whose mission is to “tell China’s stories well, spread China’s voice”. For his part, Huang Xiangmo said he has no involvement in ACRI’s operations.ACRI is a relatively new player in this game. Since 2009, the China-United States Exchange Foundation (Cusef), headed by Hong Kong’s millionaire former chief executive Tung Chee-hwa, has taken 127 US journalists from 40 US outlets to China, as well as congressmen and senators. Since Tung has an official position – vice-chairman of the Chinese government advisory body, the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference – Cusef is registered as a “foreign principal” under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (Fara).A picture of how Cusef has worked to sway coverage of China inside the US can be found in Fara filings by a PR firm working for the foundation since 2009. BLJ Worldwide, which has also represented Syria’s Bashar al-Assad, the Gaddafi family, and Qatar’s World Cup bid, organised journalist tours and cultivated a number of what it calls “third-party supporters” to marshal positive coverage of China in the US. In one year alone, 2010, BLJ’s target was to place an average of three articles per week in the US media, in venues such as the Wall Street Journal, for which it was paid around $20,000 a month. In a memo from November 2017, BLJ lists eight recommended third-party supporters who, it claimed, “can engage by writing their own op-eds, providing endorsements of Cusef, and potentially speaking to select media”. Fara filings also show that in 2010, BLJ discussed how to influence the way US schoolchildren are taught about China’s much-criticised role in Tibet. After conducting a review of four high-school textbooks, BLJ proposed “a strong, factual counter-narrative be introduced to defend and promote the actions of China within the Tibet Autonomous Region”.Over the past decade, Cusef has widened its remit, mooting ambitious cultural diplomacy plans to influence the US public. According to a January 2018 memo, one of the schemes included a plan to build a Chinese “town called Gung-Ho in Detroit”. The memo suggests redeveloping an entire city block to showcase Chinese innovation using design elements from both countries, with a budget of $8-10m. The memo even suggests shooting a reality TV show following the progress of the Gung-Ho community as “a living metaphor for the promise of the US-China relationship”. Given Detroit’s parlous state, the memo concludes, “It will be very difficult for the news media to be critical of the project.”Cusef responded to questions about its activities with a statement, saying: “Cusef has supported projects which enhance the communication and understanding between peoples of US and China. All of our programmes and activities operate within the framework of the laws and we are fully committed to carrying out our work by maintaining the highest standard of integrity.” BLJ did not respond to requests for comment.China’s active courtship of journalists extends well beyond short-term study tours to encompass longer-term programmes for reporters from developing countries. These moves were formalised under the auspices of the China Public Diplomacy Association, established in 2012. The targets are extraordinarily ambitious: the training of 500 Latin American and Caribbean journalists over five years, and 1,000 African journalists a year by 2020.Through these schemes, foreign reporters are schooled not just on China, but also on its view of journalism. To China’s leaders, journalistic ideals such as critical reporting and objectivity are not just hostile, they pose an existential threat. One leaked government directive, known as Document 9, even defines the ultimate goal of the western media as to “gouge an opening through which to infiltrate our ideology”. This gulf in journalistic values was further underlined in a series of CGTN videos issued last year, featuring prominent Chinese journalists accusing non-Chinese practitioners of being “brainwashed” by “western values of journalism”, which are depicted as irresponsible and disruptive to society. One Xinhua editor, Luo Jun, argues in favour of censorship, saying, “We have to take responsibility for what we report. If that’s being considered as censorship, I think it’s good censorship.”With its fellowships for foreign reporters, Beijing is moving to train a young generation of international journalists. A current participant in this programme is Filipino journalist Greggy Eugenio, who is finishing up an all-expenses-paid media fellowship for reporters from countries participating in China’s grand global infrastructure push, the Belt and Road Initiative. For 10 months, Eugenio has been studying and travelling around China on organised tours, as well as doing a six-week internship at state-run television. Twice a week he attends classes on language, culture, politics and new media at Beijing’s Renmin University of China, as he works towards a master’s degree in communication.“This programme continuously opens my mind and heart on a lot of misconceptions I’ve known about China,” Eugenio said in an email. “I’ve learned that a state-owned government media is one of the most effective means of journalism. The media in China is still working well and people here appreciate their work.” Throughout his time in China, he has been filing stories for the state-run Philippine News Agency, and when he finishes next month he will return to his position writing for the presidential communication team of Filipino president Rodrigo Duterte.Some observers argue the expansion of authoritarian propaganda networks – such as Russia’s RT and Iran’s Press TV – has been overhyped, with little real impact on global journalism. But Beijing’s play is bigger and more multifaceted. At home, it is building the world’s biggest broadcaster by combining its three mammoth radio and television networks into a single body, the Voice of China. At the same time, a reshuffle has transferred responsibility for the propaganda machinery from state bodies to the Communist party, which effectively tightens party control over the message. Overseas, capitalising on the move from analogue to digital broadcasting, it has used proxies likesuch as StarTimes to increase its control over global telecommunications networks, while building out new digital highways. “The real brilliance of it is not just trying to control all content – it’s the element of trying to control the key nodes in the information flow,” says Freedom House’s Sarah Cook. “It might not be necessarily clear as a threat now, but once you’ve got control over the nodes of information you can use them as you want.”Such blatant exhibitions of power indicate the new mood of assertiveness. In information warfare – as in so much else – Deng Xiaoping’s famous maxim of “hide your strength and bide your time” is over. As the world’s second-largest economy, China has decided it needs discourse power commensurate with its new global stature. Last week, a group of the US’s most distinguished China experts released a startling report expressing concern over China’s more aggressive projections of power. Many of the experts have spent decades promoting engagement with China, yet they conclude: “The ambition of Chinese activity in terms of the breadth, depth of investment of financial resources, and intensity requires far greater scrutiny than it has been getting.”As Beijing and its proxies extend their reach, they are harnessing market forces to silence the competition. Discourse power is, it seems, a zero-sum game for China, and voices that are critical of Beijing are co-opted or silenced, left without a platform or drowned out in the sea of positive messaging created by Beijing’s own “borrowed” and “bought” boats. As the west’s media giants flounder, China’s own media imperialism is on the rise, and the ultimate battle may not be for the means of news production, but for journalism itself.• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a673d643b3f2e203d5098e31cd2e3ac6d5120b2/0_158_2604_1562/master/2604.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=459f563608f2c4966c536bc67ed47028","title":"end of an era angela merkels long goodbye","story":"Angela Merkel steps down as the leader of the CDU party today after 18 years at the helm, although she plans to remain Germany’s chancellor until 2021.

European socialists have to fight for a different kind of Europe.”In a speech on the first day of the two-day event attended by Labour’s sister parties around Europe, Corbyn said of Brexit: “In a country where a million families are using food banks, over 4 million children are living in poverty, and real wages are lower today than they were in 2010, the British people voted to leave the EU. We respect that decision it’s our job to shape what comes next.”The Labour leader urged Theresa May to try to renegotiate her politically unpopular Brexit deal with the EU, using stronger language than before. “Further negotiations are a small price to pay to get a solution that works for us all,” he said.Earlier this week Corbyn repeated his call for MPs to vote down the prime minister’s deal and consider an alternative, under which the UK would remain in the EU’s customs union and stay close to the single market. It is not clear how likely it is that this could be negotiated before the UK is due to leave the EU, at the end of March next year.Corbyn criticised May’s refusal to take part in a TV debate with him before next Tuesday’s vote on the Brexit deal at Westminster, accusing the prime minister of trying to evade questioning in front of the nation.“Unfortunately, when it came to it, as in the general election last year … the prime minister backed off and refused the head-to-head debate on offer,” he said.Given the importance of the subject, he added, “this is the very last time for Theresa May to dodge scrutiny”.

But I have faith that these communities also the places where the answers will be found.”“Leaving the EU does not fix the problems that led to Brexit. This is the sort of radical thinking this country needs to genuinely reconnect with the communities left behind by years of globalisation.“Migration benefits our economy, but £4.7bn we receive every year from European migrants flows straight into government’s coffers in Westminster and austerity means communities like Redcar don’t see a penny.” Turley added: “We should spend this money where it’s really needed – outside of London and the south-east – in communities that have not felt the benefits of an increasingly global economy.”The People’s Vote campaigners have chosen the migrant tax take as a neat way of focusing on one of the causes of deindustrialisation (globalisation) but also on the positive contribution made by immigrants they might have voted against.Their £4.7bn figure is based on recent research by the Migration Advisory Committee.People’s Vote says it is growing daily, boasting 30,000 active members and 170 local action groups, with cross-party support from Labour and Tory MPs including Anna Soubry and Jo Johnson, who recently resigned as transport minister.They believe that voter hopes there will be a tangible Brexit idend are unfounded in deindustrialised areas that voted leave.Angela Smith, Labour MP for Penistone and Stockbridge, said a globalisation fund “would have a massive impact in parts of the country that have been hit by the decline of traditional industries and strangled by a decade of austerity”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/81a9a694eb0543d3d11cd837640bbc607eddabc9/0_37_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=146dca043d402121a802ca42337edf06","title":"to hull and back catching the zebrugge ferry in brexits shadow","story":"Jon Henley speaks to customs officials, lorry drivers and tourists as he travels on the Pride of Bruges from Belgium to north-east Englandby  Jon Henley in Zeebrugge and HullOn a chain-link fence beside a wet and windswept road in northern Belgium, a banner flaps bravely against the squalls whipping in from an angry sea. “Your gateway to the UK,” it proclaims, in English. “Brexit-proof Zeebrugge.”That’s the plan, anyway. Since nobody in either the North Sea port or the small beach resort next to it knows what Brexit will actually look like yet, the promise may be something of a hostage to fortune. But they are working on it.“We have to,” said the veteran customs official manning a newly-opened Brexit information point across the sodden and sprawling trailer park. “Half this port’s business is with Britain. Five thousand jobs. It could have a massive impact here.”Whatever kind of Brexit emerges, it will touch all whose livelihoods have – for the past quarter-century – been conditioned by Europe’s borderless single market, and few more so than the communities on both sides of the Channel that are directly involved in trade between Britain and the continent.On Heiststraat, all neat brick houses and gabled shopfronts, Mathilde Backer, who works in marketing for a hotel in nearby Bruges, said she had frankly not got the faintest idea what Brexit might mean for Zeebrugge. “But it’s clear anything that’s bad for the port will probably be bad for the town,” she said.Jeroen, her partner, worked off and on for the fish auction, Backer said, one of Europe’s largest: “More than half of what’s sold there is caught in British waters, and nobody knows who’s going to be able to fish where after Brexit. That’s pretty crazy, isn’t it?”If officials in the port, built a century ago to reconnect medieval Bruges with the sea, are confident there can be no return to the weighty armfuls of paperwork and endless checkpoint waits of pre-single market days, some worry about a longer-term impact on the town.“Technically, we’ll be as ready as we can be,” said Michael Voet of the local dockworkers’ union, in his office on the waterfront by the old fishing harbour. “But Brits will surely be buying less, that’s my big fear. Our members are paid by the day so that’s less money for them, and less to be spent here.”Everything from washing-up liquid to just-in-time engine parts, from orange juice to Evian mineral water – plus getting on for a million new cars a year – passes through Zeebrugge on its way to the UK, on 60-odd weekly sailings to such ports as Sheerness and Tilbury, Southampton and Hull.The Belgian port has one card up its sleeve: it handles mostly unaccompanied freight, so hopes to be less hit by any new post-Brexit border formalities and checks than places such as Calais, which mainly process trucks with paper-intensive drivers.“We’re trying to minimise future disruptions there’s extra staff, a new platform to pre-process everything electronically,” said the customs official, who preferred not to be named. “But it’s still a load of extra work right now – and we don’t know exactly what we’re preparing for.”“But only the other day,” Peeters said, “I got a catalogue of cuddly toys – the kind of thing that sells quite well in the souvenir shop – from a UK company. My first thought was: I wonder if there’s going to be some sort of import duty on these after Brexit?”On board the Pride of Bruges, which sets sail every evening from P\u0026ampO’s Zeebrugge terminal for a 12-hour voyage to Hull, British truck drivers were downbeat. “If things go back to anything like what they were before, it’ll cripple the industry,” said Ian Vear, taking a lorry-load of Belgian beer back to Yorkshire.Cradling a bottle of something else in the Lounge bar, Vear, who has been driving for 31 years, said truckers heading for the continent before 1993 had to “get our papers inspected and stamped and our tanks dipped – to see we weren’t carrying too much fuel – at every border. A four-day job took eight.”There were advantages, said Sam Campbell, carrying Nissan car parts to Sunderland. “You’d get to Spain or Italy on a Friday and know you wouldn’t clear customs till Sunday. So, the beach … But then it could take you ten hours to get through Dover. If that’s Brexit, I’d quit.”Several had voted leave. “I felt more strongly about our borders,” said Campbell. “And I never thought it would pass. Brexit could wreck my job, but it’s wrecked anyway. Just-in-time, you’re tracked every second of the way. And we can’t compete with Poles, Latvians, Romanians, Bulgarians … They work for half pay, less.”‘Doc’ Lockyer, from Hull, now a jobbing driver after running his own haulage business for 3o years, was a lone optimist. “It’ll be all right eventually,” he insisted. “Provided we adapt and use the technology right, it can be done. People are exaggerating the problems for their own agenda.”Ten hours later, June Heritage, 72, from Darlington, was stepping unsteadily down the gangplank into a chill, damp Hull morning. She, too, had voted leave: “Enough’s enough.” But she’d enjoyed her coach trip to Bruges Christmas market and couldn’t see Brexit changing much. “People will still want their fun, won’t they?” she said.A blustery walk up the road at Associated British Ports, which runs Hull and the three other Humber ports – employing, directly and indirectly, 23,000 overwhelmingly local people – head of corporate affairs Dafydd Williams agreed.“The longer sailing times used to put people off,” Williams said. “But if you’re going to be stuck in a queue at Calais or Dover...” Persistent uncertainty, and the possible earthquake of no deal, were still a worry, but the Humber ports were “cautiously optimistic. We’re investing, and we’ll deal with whatever comes.”Among ABP’s investments was, jointly with Siemens, a hefty punt on £310m Green Port Hull, making wind-turbine blades and servicing offshore windfarms. Juergen Maier, the German company’s UK chief executive, and an outspoken remainer, has just backed Theresa May’s deal as providing “certainty after two very difficult years”.On blustery Jameson Street, opposite the railway station, Rob Bateson, an IT worker for a Scandinavian-owned timber importer, said the vote was a “historic mistake. This is a port city, we grew by trading with Europe. I can already see it in my job – it’s going to throw a massive ner in the works.”But Steve Todd, a retired welder, said the only mistake had been to “not get out straight away, and sort the shit out afterwards. Now we’re stuck.”And Aida Hesketh, a payroll assistant for a temp agency, said none of her reasons for voting leave had gone away. “We’re being dictated to, there’s too many Europeans here, and it’s not right,” she said. “Whatever, we need to get out.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb3eb71c501f083d19eed8b5514aa148f2e46e53/34_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5247bd509fd93f163fe596832f6621ef","title":"sounds of mars wind captured by nasas insight lander","story":"The sound of the wind on Mars has been captured for the first time by Nasa’s InSight lander, which touched down on the red planet 10 days ago.The agency’s jet propulsion laboratory (JPL) released audio clips of the alien wind on Friday evening. InSight collected the low-frequency rumblings during its first week of operations.The wind is estimated to be blowing at between 10 and 15mph. These are the first sounds from Mars that are detectable by human ears, according to the researchers.“Capturing this audio was an unplanned treat,” said Bruce Banerdt, the InSight principal investigator at Nasa’s lab in Pasadena, California. “But one of the things our mission is dedicated to is measuring motion on Mars and naturally that includes motion caused by sound waves.”Nasa presented the sounds at a news conference on Friday. Cornell University’s Don Banfield told reporters they reminded him of “sitting outside on a windy summer afternoon ... in some sense, this is what it would sound like if you were sitting on the InSight lander on Mars”.Scientists involved in the project said the sound has an otherworldly quality. Thomas Pike of Imperial College London said the rumbling was “rather different to anything that we’ve experienced on Earth, and I think it just gives us another way of thinking about how far away we are getting these signals”.The noise is of the wind blowing against InSight’s solar panels and the resulting vibration of the entire spacecraft. The sounds were recorded by an air pressure sensor inside the lander that is part of a weather station, as well as the seismometer on the deck of the spacecraft.The low frequencies are a result of Mars’ very thin air density, which is almost entirely made up of carbon dioxide, and, even more so, the seismometer itself, which is meant to detect underground seismic waves that are well below the threshold of human hearing. The seismometer will be moved to the Martian surface in the coming weeks. Until then, the team plans to record more wind noise.The 1976 Viking landers on Mars picked up spacecraft shaking caused by wind, but it would be a stretch to consider it sound, said Banerdt.InSight landed on Mars on 26 November. “We’re all still on a high from the landing last week ... and here we are less than two weeks after landing, and we’ve already got some amazing new science,” said Nasa’s Lori Glaze, the acting director of planetary science. “It’s cool, it’s fun.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e909d8da276dcaa25baca97b134d6d63e8664e75/0_36_6025_3615/master/6025.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4d04b42c53a680540b4376e4d4a104bc","title":"young british black men change their names to increase chances of being hired","story":"A Hackney youth project aims to help overqualified but underemployed young people find their placeIn youth centres in cities across the UK young people are going into studios and remixing music. But at the Moving on Up project at Hackney Council for Voluntary Service (HCVS), young men searching for a job are remixing their names.Oluwatosin Adegoke, 23, who graduated this year from Bristol University, was an early adopter of this strategy. He’s been called Peter, the last of his four middle names, since he was a child.“I think my African parents want it to be easier for me in school,” he says. “But in the past two to three years I’ve had to start thinking about it a bit more. One, it’s instinct and two, whenever I go by Oluwatosin I have to spell it, and sometimes I get referred to as Oliver – even after I spell it out.”At Moving on Up, which the  visited as part of its Bias in Britain series, they aim to do something about that. “The difference is getting a foot in the door,” says Deji Adeoshun, a youth worker at HCVS, who advises Adegoke and others who take part. “I’ve had some guys who have had to change their surname because that was an issue,” he says, describing one in particular who was applying for an IT job. “Same job – applied with his actual surname and didn’t get a call back, applied with a Christian name and got an interview.”The strategy Adeoshun advocates might seem radical to some, but in the context of a workplace culture that often leaves black men excluded, radical action can be necessary. Such prejudices have clear economic consequences. The poverty rate for ethnic minorities is double that of white groups, according to research last year by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, which also noted that workers who were not white were concentrated in low-paid sectors. And that was despite generally higher standards of academic attainment than most white groups.It is young black men who suffer the brunt of the exclusion, in particular thanks to specific stereotypes around aggression and fecklessness. “Aggression and violence is the strongest stereotype that research has shown is associated with black men,” Kandola says.Connor Robinson, mixed race, from south Croydon, is taller and bigger than your average 18-year-old. Robinson has been working with Talent Match Croydon, a local project set up to help disadvantaged young people into work.“Being brown or being black has been a big effect on my life,” says Robinson. “I think white people are very stereotyping towards me because I’m brown, because they think I’m a rudeboy or gangster. White people are very quick to judge black and brown people.”While many black and brown people learn to ignore, or become inured to, such casual racism, for Connor, who is autistic, the experiences continue to trouble him. Racism, he says, means he is socially isolated from a community which he strongly identifies with through his white mother.Most confrontational racism went out with the Equalities Acts, hate crimes legislation and black and white TV. But as Adeoshun, the youth worker, points out, these days, and particularly in the workplace: “Racism is not overt, it’s subtle.”While discrimination comes top of a list of barriers that face young black jobseekers, it is commonly expressed through other, related, hurdles. One is a lack of self-confidence in an alien environment entirely the preserve of white people.Another problem is a lack of role models and social networks to help people into industries. Lamide Olusegun, 23, one of the young men visiting Hackney CVS, who this year received a higher education diploma in animation from the University of the Creative Arts, had hoped for work in a production company. It was not that the doors were shut to him, more that he could not find any doors at all.“I felt like it’s who you know, it’s not really what’s in your portfolios. Especially in this art field. A lot of jobs are gotten in the bars and it’s just connections,” he says. As a black animator, he feels he has no one to look up to. “I’ve not seen personally any other black animators. Even at uni on my course, I don’t think there was that many black people, maybe just a handful – or even Asians as well, just ethnic people.”Such barriers mean that by the time young black men find their way into work they have been forced to severely moderate their ambitions. So, they – and particularly the subgroup of black African workers – are more likely to be overqualified for their roles. Adeoshun, a law graduate, is a prime example. He passed his bar exams only to find he was unable to secure a pupillage at a chambers.And for those who appear stuck on the scrapheap, the lure of the shadow economy is strong. One young man in Croydon speaks of how, in an effort to raise a couple of hundred pounds, he pulled a scam and was convicted of fraud. Now he is blocked from any job in a bank, further limiting his prospects.What are the solutions? Many companies, including the , have begun rolling out “unconscious bias” training for senior managers, in an effort to make people aware of any unexamined prejudices that could lead to their not hiring people from ethnic minority groups.But in a key report on race in the workplace, commissioned by the government and published in February last year, the Conservative peer Ruby McGregor-Smith said this unconscious bias was often anything but. “We need to stop hiding behind the mantle of ‘unconscious bias’,” she declared.Lady McGregor-Smith said: “I have to question how much of this bias is truly ‘unconscious’ and by terming it ‘unconscious’ how much it allows us to hide behind it. Conscious or unconscious, the end result of bias is racial discrimination, which we cannot and should not accept.”Kandola, the business psychologist, warns that such a stance risks undermining attempts to eliminate what is a most insidious form of racism. “Not all biases are conscious,” he says. “There are some things that are very blatant that occur in the workplace and they are clearly not unconscious. But there are other things which are far more subtle that happen and people may not be aware they are doing it.He recommends seeing racial bias as a performance issue at work, feeding back to managers about their biases and telling them how to change them, and disciplining those who fail to respond.But young black men are not sitting back and waiting for procedures to be put in place and for attitudes to change. Olusegun is among those being active. Instead of trying to find work with an established production company he has taken his future into his own hands by starting his own business, merchandising his cartoon characters for sale online and in the market.“I’ve seen the light in self-employment, it’s helped me build some resilience as well,” he says. “I’ve learned so much of how to run a business, how to brand yourself, how to market yourself. These are things that I had a little idea about, but I’d never had a chance to practice it. And I’m seeing results as well, so it’s not looking bleak for me.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c727b4c65dc17b64e86dde8104dfa7981316a029/0_0_2015_1209/master/2015.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cb77f8e2566180883a84ee480d492e88","title":"champions cup preview saracens leinster bath toulon rugby union","story":"Bath are without Burns for crunch match against champions three-times winners Toulon look for a change in fortunesElliot Daly captains Wasps for their must-win encounter with Toulouse in Coventry on Saturday amid reports of his departure to Saracens over the summer. Dai Young is boosted by the returns of the wing Josh Bassett, the hooker Tom Cruse and the flanker Thomas Young as Wasps look to improve a run of one win in nine matches in all competitions against the four-times champions. Toulouse welcome back Jerome Kaino after he was suspended for the one-point victory over Leinster last time out in this competition. Bath are without Freddie Burns for their crunch match against the defending champions and with Rhys Priestland also out, James Wilson slots in at fly-half. Johnny Sexton returns to captain Leinster while Dan Leavy is also back after missing Ireland’s win over New Zealand with a neck injury.Exeter recall three of their six internationals who were rested for their first Premiership defeat of the season at Harlequins last weekend. Henry Slade, Ben Moon and Sam Skinner slot into the starting XV. Tomas Francis and Alec Hepburn take their place on the bench as Exeter seek a first win of this season’s competition after a draw with Munster was followed by defeat by Castres. Gloucester, who lie third in the pool a point above the Chiefs, hand the South African hooker Jaco Visagie his first start as Matt Banahan, Tom Hudson and Henry Trinder come into the backline for the trip to Sandy Park. Munster welcome back CJ Stander and Joey Carbery, who lines up in red alongside Conor Murray for the first time, with the scrum-half making his first European appearance of the season as the pool leaders host Castres.Mixed news for Saracens on the injury front: Mako Vunipola makes his first appearance for the club since suffering a calf injury in the ill-tempered Champions Cup win at Glasgow in October but Mark McCall is without Maro Itoje, who has a knee injury and is sidelined “for a number of weeks”. In his absence Nick Isiekwe and Will Skelton are paired together in the second row. Owen Farrell comes back into the side after sitting out against Wasps last week, meaning Alex Goode returns to full-back. Gareth Anscombe is at No 10 for Cardiff Blues, a move that sees Jarrod Evans shift out to inside-centre. Glasgow have recalled 11 players to their starting lineup, with Stuart Hogg and Tommy Seymour coming back into the back three to face Lyon, the only side in the competition without a match point to date.Matt Toomua is back for Leicester’s trip to the U Arena to face last season’s runners-up Racing 92, taking the place of Kyle Eastmond who is suspended following his red card during the heavy defeat at Bristol. The Tigers kept their hopes of qualification alive with a thumping win over the Scarlets in the previous round but have lost both their visits to Racing in the last two editions of the tournament. Geordan Murphy has also dropped Ben Youngs to the bench, with Ben White starting at scrum-half as Leicester look to avoid a seventh straight defeat in all competitions. Racing have made six changes in total with Simon Zebo selected on the right wing and Virimi Vakatawa named at outside-centre. Finn Russell comes back into the side at fly-half, while Wenceslas Lauret, Bernard le Roux and Cedate Gomes Sa all return.The three-times winners Toulon find themselves bottom of the pool after defeats by Newcastle and Edinburgh before their double-header with French rivals Montpellier. The New Zealanders Malakai Fekitoa and Julian Savea line up in the centres, while Hugo Bonneval, JP Pietersen and Filipo Nakosi are in the back three for Toulon, who have won two of their last Top 14 matches but still lie 10th in the table. Montpellier, who prevailed 29-17 when these sides met in early October at the Altrad stadium, are also struggling and are ninth in the domestic table after a home defeat by Clermont last time out. Vern Cotter has selected Johan Goosen at fly-half in place of Aaron Cruden, while Yacouba Camara makes his first European appearance of the season after returning from a long spell on the sidelines last weekend."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/015b39a9982f69243152aaaa466f4491d60fb047/377_132_2417_1450/master/2417.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cfbfb04e0cb3b6f2b06b4604dc032bfa","title":"ben stokes alex hales ecb verdict cricket","story":"The ECB’s approach may seem light beside Australia’s to ball-tampering but it is time to look forward to the last summer of cricket as we know itIt is now possible to move on. To the relief of those in charge of the England cricket teams – Trevor Bayliss, Ed Smith, Joe Root and Eoin Morgan – Ben Stokes and the man who became the doosra in all this, Alex Hales, are eligible for selection for all forthcoming matches. There will be no complications for the national selector when he announces the tour parties for the West Indies on Monday.So there is no real tarnish to the feelgood factor that has surrounded the England team for the past six months. No doubt Stokes and Hales are mightily relieved, too. Both pleaded guilty to the charges and have expressed more contrition for their part in the incident in Bristol than has been heard before.Of course they had brought the game into disrepute. They have publicly recognised this and have apologised to one and all. They are a few pounds poorer, by their standards, but they can now concentrate on their England careers ahead of a momentous year.By the same token those at the ECB are content that some sort of justice has been seen to be done. It was convenient for it that Stokes, in particular, had already missed enough matches to serve a punishment. Meanwhile the Professional Cricketers’ Association is happy as well after what its chief executive, David Leatherdale, described as “a fair hearing”.It may all seem a bit cosy but it is time to crack on. Throughout this entire saga Stokes has appeared to be the only man visibly unmoved by the affair whether in court – just about everyone except him was in tears after he had been found not guilty – or on the field. He does not like to suggest frailty in any sphere of his life. But on Friday he acknowledged that “this incident has been a huge burden for the last 15 months”, which is something he has hidden well.Yet for those watching Stokes prepare and perform for England recently it has become increasingly apparent that this episode has changed him it has enhanced his determination to do everything he can to improve as a cricketer. He is now an incredibly driven man. Stokes trains furiously to such an extent that England’s management may be as concerned about him driving himself too hard before he gets on to the field of play as about what he gets up to after play. Coaches and captain generally quite like that sort of problem, however.So finally this saga has come to an end. It has haunted the England setup just as the Cape Town ball-tampering incident has preoccupied the Australians recently. The approach of the two boards to these unwanted issues could not have been more different. Australia, triggered by initial public outrage, ed in and promptly imposed year-long bans on David Warner and Steve Smith after the episode in March. It may now regret the haste. For the ECB the situation was complicated by an impending court case. Even so it took the alternative course, often the one of least resistance, and bided its time. Eventually it is all over.Most people just want to look forward now. The summer of 2019 will soon be here. It is the most appetising imaginable before the English game embarks on its self-inflicted journey to the edge of a cliff in 2020. There is the World Cup and the Ashes and crowds will want to see Warner and Smith and Stokes – and possibly Hales – doing what they do best on a cricket field."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f410d629791d63d978b3850f5d62ca5db26470c5/0_21_3560_2137/master/3560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a5b384a3503d92fcf81955438e5484be","title":"australia v india first test day three live","story":"23rd over: India 75-1 (Rahul 43, Pujara 8) The Hazlebot has been restored to factory settings. A maiden is the result. Bowling to Pujara helps a bit. Had to play at every ball, but he doesn’t mind that.22nd over: India 75-1 (Rahul 43, Pujara 8) Rahul immediately charges Lyon to drive a run from the first ball of the over. Pujara happily sits back to have a look.21st over: India 73-1 (Rahul 42, Pujara 7) We’re getting the end-of-innings Pujara from the first dig, not the start-of-innings Pujara. He didn’t score for nearly two hours at one point on the first day. Here he’s already rattled up seven, as he leans back to square drive some width from Starc away for four. 20th over: India 69-1 (Rahul 42, Pujara 3) Pujara is not in control as he skews Lyon away past a possible catch at midwicket. Rahul doesn’t care what’s happening at the other end, as he whips out the reverse sweep once more and profits by another trio of runs. Then Pujara advances to drive through the on side. 19th over: India 64-1 (Rahul 39, Pujara 1) The new man gets off the mark with a single to square leg. Saved India’s bacon in the first dig. Could be lining them up with a fatted calf celebration if he can take them to a commanding lead in the second. Statisticians at 1o paces.The breakthrough comes, much later than Australia had hoped. Vijay hasn’t scored heavily but he’s supported Rahul in doing so. Starc bowls with a scrambled seam, over the wicket, and decks the ball away. Vijay follows it and edges to slip. Pujara, he of the first innings hundred and the implacable patience, walks to the centre.18th over: India 62-0 (Rahul 38, Vijay 18) Is he going full IPL? You never go full IPL. Rahul pulls out the reverse-sweep against Lyon, against the spin, having not done enough interesting things in the past 20 minutes. The lead is up to 77.17th over: India 57-0 (Rahul 34, Vijay 17) Rahul decides against any crazy-brave stuff as Starc comes back into the attack, except for one big air-hook against the bouncer. Dropped! Finch is fielding around the corner, which is where all the action is against Lyon. The spinner turning the ball into these two right-handers, who keep nudging and sweeping with the turn. Eventually Rahul gets too close to the catcher, but Finch es and fingertips it away. A tough one.15th over: India 51-0 (Rahul 31, Vijay 14) Smashed for six to start the over. Rahul really going after Cummins here, opens his stance and plays a lofted square sashay of a drive that lands in the seating in the Fos Williams part of the eastern stand. Rahul has played almost all of his drives in a lofted fashion today, like he’s opening in a T20. Perhaps he’s been told to go and play that way. Either way, this partnership is getting away from the fielding side now. The Australians have created plenty of dicey moments, but the Indian batsmen have survived and are prospering. That’s only emphasised when Rahul drives along the ground through cover for four to raise the fifty stand.14th over: India 40-0 (Rahul 20, Vijay 14) Nathan Lyon makes his entrance. Early for a spinner, but in his case almost later than you’d expect. Peter Handscomb is immediately launching a loud appeal for a catch at short leg, but Llong isn’t keen. Nor on the lbw shout that Lyon lets rip later in the over. A couple of byes beat Paine with their turn, then Vijay sweeps a couple of runs down to the same area of the ground. 13th over: India 36-0 (Rahul 20, Vijay 12) Just the single from Cummins, as Vijay deflects a decent bouncer.Watto, meanwhile, is at the Wiggles with Jimmy Barnes.12th over: India 35-0 (Rahul 20, Vijay 11) Profitable over. A single through midwicket, a thick inside edge for two, then each of the batsmen drives a three through cover. The previously miserly Hazlewood has had a Dickensian change of character, joyfully scattering nine runs to the hungry orphans on this frozen street. 11th over: India 26-0 (Rahul 15, Vijay 7) Rahul produces a couple of shockers to Cummins, who’s bowling back of a length. First Rahul hangs back and has a rank slap at one that wasn’t full enough, missing completely. He signals to the dressing room for new gloves. Either that or he wants a sock puppet to spice up the conversation in the middle. Next ball is a bit shorter, and Rahul aims a square slash but only gets an edge that limps over the cordon and down to the boundary. Cummins smiles broadly, and waggles his fingers at Rahul, as if to ask whether the gloves were the problem with that second shot as well.10th over: India 19-0 (Rahul 9, Vijay 6) In his fifth over, Hazlewood concedes his first run. A single, tucked by Rahul to fine leg. That’s how relentless Hazlewood is. He’s more machine now than man, twisted and evil. Vijay edges over the cordon for three, totally uncontrolled, then Rahul strides forward to drive four, a lofted shot with the bat face angled up. Hazlewood orders a small and unimportant planet be blown up.9th over: India 11-0 (Rahul 4, Vijay 3) That’s enough lawn-sprinkler work from M. Starc, and the ball instead is entrusted to P. Cummins. The scoreless run comes to an end, as Rahul leans back and lashes at a cover drive. It nearly paid off for Australia though, as he skewed it in the air and was lucky to place it into a gap. The ball slows up and Head saves it with a e as the batsmen run three.8th over: India 8-0 (Rahul 1, Vijay 3) Hazlewood is the more aggressive today, unleashing a third bouncer at Vijay in this early stanza. Later he finds the pad again, and the crowd sustain an appeal even as Paine largely ignores it and runs to collect the ball and stop a run being taken. Maiden over.See? Told you I didn’t need to look it up.7th over: India 8-0 (Rahul 1, Vijay 3) Another maiden, technically, though Starc’s tendency to swing the ball down the leg side costs his team four leg byes as it clips Rahul’s pad. Starc keeps the batsman scoreless more by a mechanism of surprise than quality in that set, including balls wide on either side of the wicket and a beamer that slips from the hand.How’s this for a biography? “Bud Shank, 82, who brought Brazilian music to U.S. audiences, helped define “cool jazz” in the 1950s and played the dreamlike flute solo on the Mamas and the Papas’ 1965 hit “California Dreamin’,” died April 2 at his home in Tucson.”Hello, I’m Bud. From Arizona. I helped define cool jazz.6th over: India 4-0 (Rahul 1, Vijay 3) Hazlewood is having a good one so far. He carves the ball back into Vijay off the seam, beating the edge and thudding into the top flap. Just a bit high and possibly going down leg. Nigel Llong says yeah nahhhhhh mate. Vijay leaves a ball not far from his off stump, then plays at one not far from his edge. Good ball. A couple of follow-up enquiries from the bowler. Three maidens in a row – what is this, a Canterbury Tale?5th over: India 4-0 (Rahul 1, Vijay 3) Typical Starc stuff. Wild down the leg side, wild outside off, then a laser-guided yorker. Rahul survives, and respectfully blots out another maiden.4th over: India 4-0 (Rahul 1, Vijay 3) Hazlewood dials the line in a bit tigher and makes Vijay play four times out of six. One of the leaves is a bouncer. It’s another maiden. What’s that Wong Kar Wai film that plays California Dreaming about 60 times in different variants to mark thematic shifts? I could google that myself but I have you lot.3rd over: India 4-0 (Rahul 1, Vijay 3) Vijay leaves, except when Starc bowls full and allows him to steer two runs into the gap at cover. He finishes the over with a tucked single.Ian Forth emails in. “Just been catching up on Justin Langer’s comments. Not sure his best strategy is to respond to every passing tweet and onfield gesture. At the moment Australia can’t win however they play things (too defensive? too aggressive?) so perhaps keep his head down and stick to the coaching for now. He’ll definitely listen to my advice, which is good.”I’ll tell you what, I’m more concerned about the substance of what Justin Langer said yesterday. “We’ve literally got kids when it comes to Test cricket playing. They’re just finding their own skin, they’re fighting their backsides off...”What does that mean? They’re finding their own skin? That sounds hideous? As in, do we mean skin that they had but which fell off in little pieces? Like finding their own skin in their cornflakes? Or are we producing cricketers who hatch or emerge as pupae with no skin at all, and then have to embark on a search for that skin and get inside it? Glistening, wet cricket larvae lumping along a changeroom hallway, looking for their final housing. And where does that skin come from? Is it always theirs, grown separately, waiting? Or do they... gulp... have to take it from somebody else first?I don’t think I can do this blog anymore.2nd over: India 1-0 (Rahul 1, Vijay 0) All the leaves are Rahul’s. And the sky is grey. I’ve been for a walk on a winter’s day. Hazlewood starts with a maiden.1st over: India 1-0 (Rahul 1, Vijay 0) Starc opens with the ball, as you’d expect. KL Rahul gets off the mark with a knock through square leg. Starc launches a good bouncer that Vijay plays with a fending bat, elbows high, getting his gloves up and getting whacked near the handle. Three slips and a gully in, the Australian uniforms a rich cream colour against the grass in this cloudy light. Point, mid-off, leaving cover open for the drive against the angle. Short leg, midwicket, fine leg. Vijay defends. Part 1: complete.The players are wandering back out. It’s still humid and sweaty, still lots of grey cloud. The pitch was still doing a fair bit for the Indian bowlers. So Australia are in with a chance here, despite trailing by 15 to start with. They’ll need to pile on the pressure and take wickets, but they have conditions conducive to that possibility.If you didn’t guess, it’s still raining. Or at least it was, and now they’re still doing clean-up. Play is scheduled to start eight minutes from... now. In the meantime, please enjoy this quality family-friendly  content.The covers are coming off. The Pants took off too. Rishabh has set a new record for catches at the Adelaide Oval, taking six in that innings to pass a mark of five that Ian Healy set several times. He’s also the youngest keeper to take six in an innings, thrashing Healy’s mark of 25 years old to do so at 21 years and 65 days. I shudder to think what I was probably doing at 21 years and 65 days of age. It’s sandwich, it’s sandwich time. I know what you’re trying to say, you’re trying to say it’s time for sandwiches. Or you know, other kinds of food if you have different tastes for lunch. I’m not the dad of your midday meal. Which, on consideration, is absolutely just as well, because that would either mean that I’m a sentient and prehensile vegetable  animal  loaf of bread, or that you habitually dine on an postmeridian meal of long pig. Both scenarios best avoided.It’s raining in a very Adelaide manner. Gentle but thorough. Inoffensive but not exactly memorable. The sandstone library equivalent of precipitation. As well as sandwich time it’s honesty time. I haven’t read Adam’s OBO – I was sitting next to him but was occupied for most of the four hours by trying to consume a custard tart without meeting personal disaster. The entire South Australian custard tart industry must be kept afloat by this one week of Test cricket each year. Did he say anything interesting? Let me know on the tweets or on the email – send me your highlights or conversational invitations. 1:52pm is when the next session might start, if the rain stops. It’s heavier now than at any stage, though, I’m sorry to report. It’ll be Geoffers with you from now, taking the baton for the middle session. Thanks for your company over few hours of rain, punctuated with some excellent bits of cricket. Catch you tomorrow!Just as the Australians were walking out to send down four or five overs before the lunch break. It’s quite heavy too, so that’ll almost certainly be lunch. Urrrggghhhh. The final two wickets. First ball! For the second time in the match the tenth wicket stand has been broken immediately, which will mean Shami is on a hat-trick in Australia’s second dig. He found the edge of Hazlewood, a conventional dismissal that delivered Pant his sixth catch. The deficit is 15 with India finding a way, through Shami, to finish the job just as it was getting away from them. Lyon walks off with an unbeaten 24 to his name. Head is gutted after edging Shami from the crease into the hands of Pant, but he’s done his job here. “A downpayment on a long career in the baggy green,” Gerard Whateley’s assessment on the SEN call. A wonderful innings. He fells with the deficit 15, Lyon earlier in the over hooking the first ball of the set for six. Their stand was 31. 98th over: Australia 228-8 (Head 72, Lyon 17) Ashwin on for his first go today, replacing Bumrah from the southern end. Predicably, Lyon launches into his favourite shot - the big sweep - second ball, and beats the fielder at deep backward square, finding the rope! A nice little flick to one of the two sweepers gets him another. Head’s turn, and he immediately leaps at Ashwin picking off a single to midwicket before Lyon does the same to finish. Fantastic batting from these two, claiming seven from the over.97th over: Australia 221-8 (Head 71, Lyon 11) Ishant is doing everything necessary to work Lyon over, peppering him with short stuff before beating him with a tempter. But the number ten is keeping his cool, once again retaining the strike from the final ball of the set, this time with a clip to square leg. 96th over: Australia 220-8 (Head 71, Lyon 10) Head handles the first half of Bumrah’s over and does is well, finding one to midwicket. Lyon does it equally nicely, striking another useful drive down the ground, this time for three. He could have given Head the strike with two but he’s confident enough at this stage and rightly so. Fantastic cricket as Australia creep towards India’s first innings tally of 250."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f7d7b74bc874c606f489e8921349a35d0b6dc9e/456_628_2532_1519/master/2532.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e6ece9690f2385915eac14be69c43c6","title":"alvin ailey american dance theater at 60 in pictures","story":"Alvin Ailey’s groundbreaking dance company is celebrating its 60th anniversary with a season at New York City Center.

All images captured on the Google Pixel 3A decade ago, grabbing a burger was a quick fix, something we did when we were short of cash, time or imagination. For modern diners, going for a burger is a quest. A quest for excellence: gastronomic, ethical and aesthetic excellence. In cities around the globe, dishes that would once have been termed fast food – pizza, grilled cheese sandwiches, tacos and hot dogs – are being taken as an art form, with fiercely loyal cult followings on social media and five-star newspaper reviews by food critics previously accustomed to starchy tablecloths and foamy, fiddly haute cuisine offerings. On Twitter and other social media platforms, diners furiously debate the merits of a Bleecker burger over a Patty \u0026amp Bun burger on the Mexican front, Breddos and DF Mexico vie for the crown of best tacos in London, and the gloves are off between devotees of Pizza Pilgrims and Franco Manca.This is the golden age of flash food – poshed-up fast food – when the most sought-after meals around the UK are sophisticated versions of simple staples.“I think haute cuisine has been put in its place,” says chef Gizzi Erskine, author of Slow: Food Worth Taking Time Over. “We now take comfort in simple dishes that mean something to us, that may have been pushed to another level from technique and ingredients. Plus, we care much more about the ingredients – provenance, breed and how things are farmed – so there’s a new understanding that a great piece of meat cooked simply is enough.”A menu is one of the most telling barometers of any society, indicating our shifting aspirations, economic circumstances, ethical and health preoccupations and how we choose to socialise. “This is definitely a sociological trend as much as about food tastes,” says Damien Gabet, editor of Square Meal magazine. “It’s no longer cool to shout about that Michelin-starred meal you ate off starched tablecloths, but there’s cultural capital to be gained from going out and Instagramming a meal from the most hyped food truck in town.”Social media has significantly fuelled the trend for superlative versions of simple dishes. “Fine-dining fare doesn’t actually photograph that well and generally looks fussy and drab,” says Gabet. “Whereas, dishes such as tacos and burgers have distinct outlines and vibrant colours.”In London, few figures have done more to champion affordable new restaurants, informal supper clubs and food trucks than Clerkenwell Boy, an anonymous food influencer with close to 200,000 followers on Instagram (@Clerkenwell_Boy). “I started Instagramming to try and make food more accessible and less elitist,” he says. “Because, while there is a place for special-occasion fine-dining, on a Tuesday night with friends, we generally want affordable but delicious meals served family-style, in a no-frills setting but with relaxed and friendly service.”And while we might be dining out more, this doesn’t mean we’re lowering our standards. “If we go out for a burger, we want it to be the best burger in town,” says Clerkenwell Boy. “We want to eat simply, but we want it to be the absolute best version of that dish.”As Trish Caddy, Mintel’s senior foodservice analyst, puts it: “Millennials – the generation most likely to consider themselves as ‘foodies’ – have developed an acquired taste for artisanal flavours such as dry-aged meats and smoked cheese, partly out of a desire for visceral, intense experiences that stimulate their senses.”And although consumers are increasingly health-conscious, there’s also been a shift in what we consider an “unhealthy” meal. Burgers and pizzas are no longer demonised there’s a new understanding that excessive sugar, sweeteners, additives and heavy processing are the real culprits in poor health and obesity.“So, instead of eating low-quality processed meats such as fatty pepperoni and sausages, millennials are seeking out functional ingredients like fermented foods that tap into the ongoing gut-friendly food trend,” says Caddy. “For example, sourdough pizzas, which feature purported health benefits that come from the fermentation process, have a distinctive sourness compared to ordinary pizza bread dough. This suits millennials, who have grown accustomed to food with intensive flavours as well as health benefits.”And if diners are rediscovering simple pleasures, the good news is that these dishes are also immensely satisfying to prepare. “Cooking should be about everything from sourcing great ingredients to the therapeutic rituals of breaking down the recipes,” says Erskine. “And everyone should be able to eat, and cook, this way.”The Curiosity Rooms events take place at 55 Regent Street from 15 November to 16 December 2018.

All images captured on the Google Pixel 3 by Stephanie Sian SmithVibrant, arty and home to one of London’s most erse communities, Peckham has cemented itself as a true cultural hotspot – with creative hub Peckham Levels, the legendary Bussey Building and no shortage of galleries and cafes just a few of its draws. But long before SE15 was named by Time Out as one of the world’s coolest neighbourhoods, it was the stomping ground of blogger and best-selling author Chidera Eggerue.With 187,000 Instagram followers, Eggerue is now known globally by her online moniker, the Slumflower – a name borrowed from Street Etiquette’s concept of a rose growing from concrete. Her debut book, What a Time to be Alone: the Slumflower’s Guide to Why You Are Already Enough, is now in its third print run and she has recently published her second, Scribble Yourself Feminist. Growing up in south-east London, Eggerue mirrors the Slumflower message of growing, glowing and flourishing in an urban environment. Here, she presents her very personal guide to Peckham, reflecting on the everyday extraordinary places that fire up her imagination …Taste some proper Nigerian foodI live with my mum and two brothers and I don’t really eat out much as my mum is an amazing cook. She makes jollof rice, egusi (a type of melon seed) soup, beans and yam. She also shops local and buys her meat and vegetables from the market in Peckham.But if you want to know a good Nigerian restaurant in the area, I would suggest 805 Restaurants – I get plantain and jollof rice. Afterwards, stop by Cafe Spice, a small, yellow shop opposite the Bussey Building. Look out for a Nigerian snack called a puff puff, which is very sweet and like a fried doughnut.Kick back with a drinkJohn the Unicorn is really nice, or Prince of Peckham – it does great chicken, and has really good DJ sets and there’s a party room upstairs. It’s quite new but it’s where I’d go with friends now. People do of course go on to club nights at the CLF Art Cafe – known locally as the Bussey Building (during the summer months there’s a rooftop bar and cinema), but I’m like an 80-year-old granny and just go home!Head to the only cinema worth knowing aboutOnce a month I take myself on an evening date to watch a film at Peckhamplex. I’ve been going there since I was born and it’s still the only cinema I go to – at a fiver a ticket, you can’t go wrong. I saw the new Incredibles film recently, which I loved it was so cute. Going there and having time to myself is important. What is now above it – the creative workplay hub that is Peckham Levels – used to be a multi-storey car park. My dad used to park there before we went to the cinema and he’d whizz around the levels, it was so much fun. Frank’s Cafe is there now, on the rooftop, but it’s not really my thing.Look out for inspiring wall artWhen I was younger, there was a wall by Peckham library with photos of famous black actors, who I very much aspired to be. The bus I took to secondary school went past it, so I’d see them every day from age 11 to 16. Now the murals are on the walls of the Peckhamplex, which I love.Hit up my beauty go-tosPaks Hair and Cosmetics is where I get my hair treatments, conditioners and extensions. I also go to Anna’s nail shop once a month to get my nails done. (Find it in Ali Baba’s barber shop on 127 Rye Lane.) It’s £25 and quite expensive. I always get pointy nails shellac all the way. I get the brightest, neon colours I can. My tip? Get Anna’s son to do them – he’s the best.Get a coffee fixI get my coffee at the Costa on Rye Lane every day, but it’s not very Peckham! It used to be a Mothercare. My mum would always go in there with me and just the other day I was looking at an old film of me in there, which we still have on tape. There was more footage of me in my pram and walking through Peckham. There were green buses then – they were so cool – and the McDonalds is in shot, which is still there.Find some headspaceSexby Garden in Peckham Rye Park is my hideout, my reflection spot – my secret favourite place.

From rethinking your routine to noticing art and culture around you, as part of our Tales of the everyday extraordinary series, here are 10 ways to appreciate the magic of the everyday. All images captured on Google Pixel 3Most of us are settled into our routines. Wake up, check emails, grab a coffee, hop on the train, get to work. It’s not our fault, it’s the efficient way that our brains work. “Having this autopilot mode allows the conscious mind to be freed up for other tasks,” says Gemma Griffith, a director at the Centre for Mindfulness Research and Practice at Bangor University.However, autopilot mode can have its downsides. By being so wedded to our ingrained habits and routine we can risk becoming disconnected from other people and our surroundings, and missing out on everyday magic. For Griffith the remedy is simple: “It’s about switching back to ‘being’ mode rather than ‘doing’ mode and focusing our attention on the present moment”. Here are 10 ways to shake up your routine and relish the everyday.Take time outYou don’t have to trek to the top of a mountain to find inner peace. Whether you’re on your commute or taking a lunchtime stroll, take the time to open up your awareness. “Focus on your walking, how your feet feel on the ground, the temperature of the weather at that moment, and the sounds you hear,” says Griffith. Coax your mind into the present moment by taking a different route home or trying out a new lunch spot.Be more basicFashion’s love affair with utilitarian dressing continues, with pared-back basics the lynchpins of Instagram’s most followed fashion icons. “The current appetite for streetwear and the rise of high-street stores that specialise in stocking classic key items, such as brands like Arket, prove that the trend for basics is going nowhere,” says stylist Laura Martin. The humble white t-shirt, the classic hoodie and ordinary gym trainers have never been more on trend. The good news is, they’re probably already in your wardrobe.Rethink your favourite foodsThe internet has turned eating into an art form. While home chefs could once have lived a lifetime using only Mrs Beeton’s Cookery Book for company, today we are googling ambitious dishes then feverishly photographing and hashtagging the results. But have we forgotten the simple pleasure of ordinary meals and ingredients? As the zeitgeist turns towards a balanced approach to eating, bloggers such as the Ugly Vegan are performing the seemingly revolutionary act of sharing unfiltered, familiar dishes. For your next evening in, why not grab a bag of imperfect veg and create something extraordinarily ordinary?Notice art around youYou don’t have to go to a gallery to appreciate great art and design: seek out signs of creativity all around you. If you’re in London, look up Art on the Underground’s Brixton mural map, leading to examples of street art in the area dating back to the 1970s and 1980s. Based in Manchester? Check out the street art tours on offer by writer Hayley Flynn, who set up bespoke tours of the city to put a spotlight on the local landscape of the Northern Quarter, which is packed with rich history. Over in Bristol, the tourist office has published free, downloadable walking tours of Banksy’s work.Discover hidden librariesFrom repurposed old red phone boxes to shelves at the train station, hidden libraries are popping up everywhere. The literary scheme Read Now, Write Now has teamed up to create book exchange shelves along the Wirral train line, and Clapham North tube station in London has a book swap shelf located at its entrance. Over in Crossmichael in southern Scotland and Amberley in Stroud, locals have turned their old phone boxes into mini libraries. The pleasure in these new makeshift lending libraries? “You get to discover new gems,” says Fruzsina Bekefi who runs a monthly book swap out of east London reading nook Libreria. “It’s a great way to widen my horizons and inject a bit of serendipity into my life.”Find a new perspective There are more than 4m posts for #lookup on Instagram and with good reason: from intricate architecture to stunning skies, there’s so much you could miss if you keep your eyes trained on the ground. And as we shuffle along our daily tramlines, our thinking can get stuck in a rut too. Head up a hillside or tall building for a fresh look at where you live, or mix up your commute by getting off a stop or two early and walking the rest of the way.Discover hidden historyWhether you are a fan of poets, musicians, athletes or writers, it’s worth keeping your eyes peeled for the English Heritage blue plaque scheme. The plaques dotted around London point out where notable creatives lived in the city, from children’s author AA Milne to the black composer Samuel Coleridge-Taylor. The English heritage scheme has also influenced other local areas across the UK to celebrate their histories, too – so look out for blue plaques in Brighton and Hove, South Tyneside and Leeds (thanks to the local Leeds Civic Trust).Shake up your workoutIf your idea of exercise is headphones and a running machine, why not break the habit and explore a more sociable way to exercise? GoodGym hosts running meet-ups across the UK, combining fitness with an activity that benefits the local community. Jog to meet an isolated elderly person, sort out cans at a food bank or pitch in to tidy someone’s garden. A recent study from the University of New England College of Osteopathic Medicine in the US proved that team exercise can lower stress and improve quality of life.Appreciate moreBusy doesn’t have to equal stress – it’s all about how you approach it, says Griffith. “Do a routine activity mindfully, whether that is brushing your teeth or eating breakfast in the morning, by adjusting your senses to what you are doing,” she says. The benefits of mindfulness are worth it. “It’s a practise that lowers the stress hormone cortisol. It encourages those who apply mindfulness to their daily lives to have more compassion for themselves and others,” says Griffith.Get back to natureGwyneth Paltrow’s love of grounding has been well documented (and much maligned), but how about a spot of forest bathing? This new nature buzzword refers to a rising trend in green spaces inspired by a Japanese tradition. Try it by heading to your local forest or woodland trail and soaking up everything you see, touch, hear and smell. Even if you can’t make it that far afield, swap that “al desko” lunch for some much needed vitamin D – it’s the perfect pick-me-up when daylight hours are in such short supply.The Curiosity Rooms events take place at 55 Regent Street from 15 November to 16 December 2018.

It is a reaction she has to the bullish claims that big tech firms like to make. As federal investigations hit Facebook and global protests plague Google, the mantra remains. Artificial intelligence will make all our lives better. Poverty, mental health, climate change, inequality? All can be solved with AI.As a Silicon Valley technologist, entrepreneur and theoretical neuroscientist, Ming might easily have fallen under the same spell as her tech firm counterparts. She is a firm believer that AI will become an ever more powerful tool, after all. And what could be more west coast than a Human Potential Maximiser?But Ming’s take is different and perhaps life experience is why. Vivienne Ming was once Evan Smith, a wretched, troubled student at the University of California, San Diego, who dropped out, became homeless, and then clawed his way back to glittering success. It would be simplistic to call Ming an arch sceptic, but not unreasonable. What bothers her is not AI. What makes her flinch are the people behind it.“We are entrusting some of the most profound problems in the history of human experience to a bunch of very young men who have never solved a problem in their lives,” she says. “They have never done anything from scratch to make someone’s life better.”Evan Smith pulled his life around in his 20s. Having lived in his car in Mountain View, battling demons he struggled to understand, he was admitted to Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh where he studied neuroscience. There he met his future wife, Norma Chang, who stuck with him when he confessed his wish to be a woman. The couple, who use the mash-up surname Ming, have two children.After a career spent setting up companies and organisations to take on problems in education, health and the workplace, the couple founded the non-profit thinktank Socos in Berkeley, California, where they now work together. Ming calls the work “mad science”, but it is far from mad. She does consultancy for startups, American states, public institutions and the United Nations. They call her in for advice on the use of AI and neuroscience to steer hiring practices, the treatment of employees, and better ways to support students.On Tuesday evening Ming will join a panel of world-leading AI thinkers at the Barbican in London for the Royal Society’s final event in its You and AI series. Chaired by Brian Cox, a physicist and TV presenter, the panel will take questions on the impact AI will have on jobs the risks it may pose to society, and its ability, perhaps, to make moral and ethical decisions.At the heart of the problem that troubles Ming is the training that computer engineers receive and their uncritical faith in AI. Too often, she says, their approach to a problem is to train a neural network on a mass of data and expect the result to work fine. She berates companies for failing to engage with the problem first – applying what is already known about good employees and successful students, for example – before applying the AI.“These are very smart men. They are not malicious. But we are asking them who should I hire, how should we deal with mental illness, who should go to prison and for how long, and they have no idea how to solve these problems. AI is a genuinely powerful tool for solving problems, but if you can’t work out the solution to a problem yourself, an AI will not work it out for you.“Amazon is a case in point. Ming says the tech firm once tried to recruit her as a chief scientist. The company would soon have a million employees, she was told, and it would be her job to make their lives better. “It became very clear that Jeff Bezos’s idea of better was very different to mine,” she says. The company’s invention of a wristband that buzzed when factory staff reached for the wrong package did not meet with her approval.It didn’t end there. Ming heard about the firm’s hopes to build an algorithm that could automate the hiring process, an idea she says she criticised at the time. In October, news broke that the firm had scrapped the project because it was biased against women. The algorithm scoured applicants’ CVs and ranked them on a five star scale. But because it trained on Amazon data, it learned that male applicants fared best in the workplace. It penalised those with the word “women’s” on their CVs, as in “women’s rowing champion”, and downgraded graduates from women’s colleges.“They thought they could throw an algorithm at the problem and it would figure it out,” says Ming. “But if a company doesn’t know how to solve the problem of bias, an AI will not solve the problem for them. After a couple of years working on it they dragged it out behind the barn and shot it in the back of the head.”Ming, who says she turned down offers from Uber and Netflix, took a different tack at a startup called Gild. The firm found that traits like resilience and what Ming calls a “growth mindset” – the flexibility to learn from one’s failures – predicted better software engineers, as rated by human coders. So the firm built small AIs to crawl blogs, LinkedIn and social media feeds for the best candidates, whether they were job hunting or not. Sometimes, a lone tweet carried enormous weight. One read: “Celery is awesome.” Out of context it sounds “like someone who is fundamentally wrong about a gross food,” says Ming. But “celery” was a reference to an obscure job queue tool written in the programming language, Python. The tweet, and the passion it contained, was a “huge predictor” of the candidate’s coding skills.To get back on track we need an AI revolution, Ming says, one that moves beyond correlation to causality. Throw a neural network at a pile of data and it will find patterns that can predict a person’s grades, their job prospects, or the odds they will reoffend. But correlations can hide the most appalling biases, the sort that rank black men at a higher risk for reoffending. We need AIs that know the real causes of what makes someone a reoffender, a great employee, a grade-A student. “We need that knowledge built in, and I am routinely shocked at how infrequently it is done in AI,” she says.Every year, swarms of freshly minted PhD graduates pour into tech firms without the faintest idea how to solve real-world problems. That will not change any time soon. A thorough grounding in ethics will help, but Ming believes it takes more than learning the rules from a book. “Ethics is like resilience, you get good at it by failing. To act ethically you have to understand all of the consequences of the solution you are proposing,” she says.With big tech so dominated by young, largely white men, it may be women and other marginalised people who drive the revolution Ming says is needed. “I think it’s incredibly valuable for people who have suffered in some way to have a voice in this. If you come from a background like mine, you are sceptical. You realise that technology increases inequality and it only gets better if we take active steps to avoid that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb058b4c84b60a1947ab2b4e1f4b9e57f7a8fa59/0_232_5274_3164/master/5274.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=947395587c347ddc8592c14028d2ed40","title":"share your experiences of lost footpaths","story":"More than 10,000 miles of footpath are estimated to have been lost from maps. We’d like your help in documenting their recoveryEngland and Wales have about 140,000 miles of footpaths, but it is estimated more than 10,000 have been lost from current maps. Volunteers have been working tirelessly to rediscover them and put in legal applications for the recovery of lost paths before a government deadline in 2026 after which claims will no longer be accepted.If you have already found a lost footpath, how did you find and identify it? If you put in an application for a path to be recovered we’d also like to hear about it.Below are some tips on how to rediscover a lost footpath:1. The first port of call is the Ramblers, whose website gives clear advice on how to identify a lost path and make an application. The method involves comparing new and old maps, plus examination of historical sources. Walking and exploration is involved, but don’t forget that a lost path has to be proven before you can use it, otherwise you are trespassing.2. It is also important to be sure you are not replicating work already underway. This government website can give you information on current applications.3. You may also know of paths that are used regularly, but are not on the definitive map (you can ask your local council to see that map). Any footpath walked by the public for 20 years without any attempt by the landowner to prevent access can be made a right of way. Check your local walking groups for people actively walking along unmapped routes to help establish this right.You can share your tips and stories with us in the encrypted form below.

The five others were in the KC-130.The Marine Corps identified the dead crew member on Friday as Capt Jahmar Resilard, 28, of Miramar, Florida, an FA-18 pilot with Marine All Weather Fighter Attack Squadron 242.The marines said in a statement that the two planes were involved in routine training, including aerial refueling, but that they were still investigating what caused the crash.Donald Trump tweeted that his thoughts and prayers were with the Marine Corps crew members involved in the collision. He thanked US forces in Japan for their “immediate response and rescue efforts” and said” “Whatever you need, we are here for you.”The crash took place 320km (200 miles) off the coast, according to the US military. Japanese officials said it occurred closer to the coast, about 100km.Japan’s Maritime Self-Defense Force, which dispatched aircraft and vessels to join in the search operation, said Japanese rescuers found one of the crew from the fighter jet in stable condition.

Merkel told the party faithful on Friday it was “time for a change”.Kramp-Karrenbauer - or AKK as she is popularly known, not least because many Germans find her double-barrelled name difficult to pronounce - will now be viewed as a potential future chancellor if the CDU wins the next election in 2021.The mother of three, a self-professed strict Catholic who has served as state leader of Saarland and before that was its interior minister, has a total of 18 years’ leadership experience, all of which stood her in good stead to win the vote.The third candidate in the running, Jens Spahn, 38, refused to withdraw his candidature, despite pressure from party colleagues to do so when it was clear that support for him was weak. Made health minister in Merkel’s government six months ago, he had been considered a frontrunner for several years to succeed Merkel but was pushed aside when Merz decided to throw his hat into the ring and won the support of party heavyweights, such as the president of the Bundestag and Merkel’s former economics minister Wolfgang Schäuble.Spahn secured a higher than expected 175 votes out of 999, but was not eligible for the second round.Over 1,000 party delegates were eligible to vote on what was described as the most momentous decision for the party in nearly 50 years and one that would decide the future direction not only of the CDU, but also of the country and the continent.The party has faced a dilemma, to either keep itself on the course set by Merkel – who was determined to secure the centre ground and has turned the CDU into a champion of gay marriage, a minimum wage and a quota for women in politics - or to take it more to the right in an attempt to win back the voters lost to the Alternative für Deutschland (AfD).In Kramp-Karrenbauer it has arguably chosen a safer option than Merz, not least because she is likely to have an easier relationship with Merkel in the chancellery than Merz, who is seen as having a grudge against Merkel. Kramp-Karrenbauer’s victory is a sign that the party wants to continue on the path set for it by Merkel.Nevertheless, Kramp-Karrenbauer has repeatedly said she would forge her own path, and is decidedly more socially conservative than her predecessor. She told party delegates she was “not a mini version” of Merkel, but her “own person”.“I have read a lot about what I am and who I am: ‘mini’, a copy, simply ‘more of the same’. Dear delegates, I stand before you as I am and as life made me and I am proud of that,” she said.Although she supported Merkel’s open-door migration policy in 2015, Kramp-Karrenbauer is in favour of tightening migration, she is against same-sex marriage and has argued for more restrictions placed on doctors carrying out abortion.But she also takes a liberal approach to other issues, voting in favour of a minimum wage, and supporting a women’s quota.Some say she is still largely an unknown quantity, having played out most of her political life in Saarland.Thousands of CDU members descended on Hamburg for the spectacle, as well as over 1,600 accredited journalists and hundreds of diplomats and political observers. Watching from the sidelines, Udo Tappe, a long-time CDU member described it as the most exiting moment for the party in decades.“My heart was with AKK, my head with Merz,” the 77-year-old retired Hamburg estate agent admitted. “I think that Kramp-Karrenbauer is better in that she has a lot more political successes behind her than Merz, but I wonder how she will stand up to the likes of autocrats like Erdogan and Putin, which Merkel did well.”Earlier in the day Merkel fought back tears after CDU delegates gave her a 10-minute standing ovation after she delivered an emotional speech marking the end of her leadership, which she said had been both “challenging” and “a joy”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2b055fe03568e3630764aa77c2725b0c1f4d1daa/65_546_4377_2626/master/4377.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a5beded04d38bf873fa82566f02dc4c6","title":"armoured vehicles deployed paris combat gilets jaunes","story":"Streets cordoned off and Ligue 1 football matches cancelled in anticipation of more violence French security forces will deploy armoured vehicles in Paris on Saturday in anticipation of more violence and rioting by fringe elements of the gilets jaunes (yellow vests) movement.A government official said 89,000 police and gendarmes would be mobilised across the country, 8,000 of them in the capital, alongside a dozen VBRG armoured vehicles.“We are facing people who are not there to demonstrate but are there to smash things up and we want to make sure we’re not leaving them to do what they want,” said the prime minister, Édouard Philippe, attempting to justify the use of the VBRG, which are capable of firing teargas grenades and clearing barricades and are rarely used in city areas.Paris went into lockdown on Friday as the city prepared for a fourth weekend of  protests. There was a sense of impending attack in the city centre as banks, shops, restaurants and businesses rushed to board up windows to protect their premises from looters.At Place de la Bastille, which has been undergoing pedestrianisation, workers cleared away metal and concrete barriers and carried off anything that could be thrown. The windows of the Banque de France were being boarded up on Friday morning. Staff at the Bastille Opéra were reported to have locked the orchestra’s instruments somewhere safe fearing an assault on the building.Parisiens, even those far from the Champs Élysées, Arc de Triomphe and Place de la Concorde – the scenes of violent clashes in previous weeks – were advised not to leave dustbins on the streets for fear they could be set alight.Last Saturday the city saw the worst street unrest in 50 years as groups of casseurs (hooligans) confronted riot police, torched vehicles and looted shops.The Eiffel Tower and Louvre museum will remain closed on Saturday. In Bordeaux, a dozen public buildings will be closed. Six Ligue 1 football matches have been cancelled.The gilet jaunes movement started as a protest against a proposed rise in diesel and petrol tax, and takes its name from the yellow high-vis jackets that all motorists must by law carry in their cars. It quickly expanded into a wider anti-government movement with a list of erse demands, many associated with living standards.The vast majority of protesters have been peaceful, their anger directed at a president perceived as aloof and out of touch and a government seen to represent a political elite that has no idea how la France d’en bas – the less well-off – live.Outside of the capital, tax offices have been boarded up, though the association of rural mayors has asked local councillors to keep town halls open to allow “each citizen to verbally express their anger”.Ministers have repeated calls for calm and asked protesters to stay away from the capital, as have union leaders, opposition parties and Roman Catholic clergy.On Friday French media reported that the president, Emmanuel Macron, had refused a demand to meet “moderate” gilets jaunes at the Elysée.Benjamin Cauchy, an unofficial spokesman, said representatives of the movement had asked to see the president because “insurrection is at the gates of France and we don’t want any deaths this weekend”. The Elysée responded that the prime minister’s door “remained open”.Macron has been silent since Wednesday evening when he performed a surprising volte-face on the fuel tax, announcing it was being cancelled, hours after Philippe had told the Assemblée Nationale it was being frozen and “might” be abandoned.French media quoted officials as saying the president was anxious not to inflame the situation by addressing the country before Saturday’s demonstrations. He is expected to give a televised address at the beginning of next week.Efforts to prepare for what gilets jaunes demonstrators are calling Act IV of their action is hampered by the grassroots movement having no formal organisation or leadership, posing a unique challenge for the French authorities.Speaking to gilets jaunes protesters, a recurring theme is the feeling that France’s leaders hold them in contempt. Attempts by the Élysée and government to calm the crisis, including dropping the fuel tax and pledging to review the complex tax system, have done little to appease protesters.The insurrection is being further fuelled on social media by conspiracy theories and fake news, including widely spread but false claims that Macron is “selling France” to the United Nations, World Bank or other international organisations planning to let millions of migrants take over France. The reports have been viewed several million times.The French government has also deployed police to deal with high school student protests. A video showing police forcing students to kneel in rows with their arms behind their backs has caused shock and further criticism of the government.The education minister, Jean-Michel Blanquer, said the images had to be seen in the context of police responding to student violence. “There are shocking images because we are in a climate of exceptional violence,” Blanquer said.

People Magazine scored the exclusive pictures.But this was India’s Rajasthan state, the bride was Priyanka Chopra, and during the five-day ceremony the groom, Nick Jonas, draped her in a mangalsutra – a traditional Hindu necklace she will wear until her husband’s death.The publicity blitz around “Nickyanka’s” nuptials has confirmed Chopra, 36, as the most successful Indian ever to make the leap from Bollywood star to American celebrity.In trying to crack the American market, Chopra followed in the footsteps of another former Miss World, Aishwarya Rai. Several male actors including Irrfan Khan and Anil Kapoor have also carved out American profiles, while last year, Deepika Padukone made her Hollywood debut alongside Vin Diesel in xXx: Return of Xander Cage.But Chopra has been a trailblazer, film industry writers say. “This is the first time an Indian has been cast not as an ‘Indian’,” says Subhash Jha, a veteran Indian film critic and journalist. “Nowhere has Priyanka been made to speak in a sing-song voice, or with an accent, or even to play an Indian character.”When Chopra was cast as a lead in the TV action drama Quantico in 2015, she was the first South Asian to win such a role. Though her American film credits have been relatively modest, her celebrity has skyrocketed: this year she was the first Indian to appear on the cover of Variety magazine, will next month become the first to front the US edition of Vogue, and has been named as one of the most influential people in the world by Time and Forbes.Chopra’s fame has been the product of relentless work but also keen self-awareness, especially to avoid being pigeonholed by American producers, says Raja Sen, an Indian film critic.It has helped that Chopra is fluent in American culture: she spent three years as a teenager studying in different schools on the country’s east coast. After shifting her career stateside, one of her first TV appearances was as a singer during the opening theme of the NFL’s Thursday Night Football broadcast.“She didn’t portray herself as this unattainable woman from a mysterious country,” says Sen. “She tried to straddle both cultures which I think none of the other Indian actors could do. They were always presented as these ethereal, beautiful women from the east who were fetishised for their Indian-ness.”In contrast, the Indian background of Chopra’s character in the now-cancelled Quantico, Alex Parrish, is largely incidental to the wider plot. “When has one ever seen before an Indian character that doesn’t announce his or her Indian-ness on screen?” Masand says.Basing herself in the US has also been crucial, something few others have been willing to do, fearing the impact it could have on their careers in India. With hard work, Chopra has managed to keep both plates spinning.“I remember meeting her on a flight when she was doing a weekend trip to India,” says Rajeev Masand, a film writer. “She flew to India for 24 hours to finish a role here and flew right back for when she was required at Quantico on Monday morning.“She was willing to do what it took,” he adds. “Whether it was appearing on all the talk shows, playing to the tabloids and the paparazzi, or acquiring an American accent.”She has understood the power of perception, says Shubra Gupta, a film journalist and critic with the Indian Express newspaper, who has watched Chopra became a fixture of the global celebrity circuit.“She moves in the circle where she gets to be invited to things like the royal wedding, she goes to Cannes, she’s at the Met Gala ball and red carpets – these are all optics that make people sit up and take notice,” Gupta says.Yet she has shown enough humility to understand that moving to the US – at the peak of her celebrity in India – meant returning to square one. “In Bollywood, most actors who are big stars don’t feel the need to audition anymore,” she says. “Priyanka put her A-list actor ego aside and actually asked for those roles, she auditioned and did the heavy lifting.”Achieving film success in India is just as challenging as in Hollywood, and on sheer scale of numbers, probably harder. Beauty pageants have frequently provided a shortcut for young women to careers in cinema. But even among this cohort, Chopra – the winner of the 2000 Miss World pageant – has stood out, says Sen.“Priyanka came along and started doing really feisty roles,” he says. “She was not going to be just another pretty girl, who could be anyone. She wasn’t always pulling it off – but she was bringing something to the table.”One of her breakout roles was in 2004’s Aitraaz, where she played an business executive who falsely accuses an employee of sexual harassment. In What’s Your Raashee (2009), she played every sign in the zodiac, thought to be the first time an actor has played 12 roles in a single film.In the US, too, she has shown a willingness to take risks. In 2017’s Baywatch, a film remake of the 90s series, Chopra starred as the film’s chief antagonist: a Colombian businesswoman who controls the drugs trade on the beach. “It was a horrifically bad film,” says Jha.“It’s not a good movie at all,” agrees Sen. “But even then, she didn’t play one of the girls. She’s the villain. She gets more visibility that the seven women in the red swimsuits by not being one of them.”Chopra’s timing has also been impeccable, coming as Hollywood grapples with the need to reflect an American population that will become majority non-white within three decades.“Diversity is the key word in American currently, and it wasn’t 10 years ago when Aishwarya was trying to break out,” says Masand. “She benefits from that being such an important conversation right now.”Indians rallied around Chopra this week after The Cut, New York Magazine’s female-focused culture website, published an article calling the actor a “global scam artist” who had fooled Jonas into marrying her as a public relations coup.Readers bristled not just at the sexism and racism they saw in the piece, but also the suggestion their home-town star needed to seek Jonas out for publicity. In India, there is little doubt over whose star received a bigger boost. “He’s the lucky one,” Gupta says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c943a1a61c722d1b12670c6ecebb70cd36b2fa1f/185_587_4219_2532/master/4219.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7ac2ecc1cfea33e3fd5565abf2cfc783","title":"un ambassador heather nauert fox news state department","story":"The state department spokesperson is a former Fox anchor with no background in policymaking or negotiatingDonald Trump’s appointment of Heather Nauert – the state department spokeswoman and a former Fox News anchor – as the new US ambassador to the United Nations is widely being interpreted as bad news for the UN.Unlike the current ambassador, Nikki Haley, Nauert is not expected to be given cabinet status, downgrading the role to being largely a mouthpiece for the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, and the national security adviser, John Bolton – both of whom are deeply sceptical of the UN’s usefulness.With no policymaking or negotiating experience, and after 20 months as a spokeswoman for the state department, Nauert will take her seat on the security council alongside counterparts with decades of experience. Haley was also a diplomatic novice – though she did arrive in New York with the six years experience of running South Carolina as governor.During Nauert’s tenure at the state department, press briefings went from being daily events to being held once or twice weekly. Nauert was mostly a polished and unflappable defender of administration policy, smoothing over frequent rifts between the Trump’s first secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, and the White House.But her inexperience sometimes shone through: in June she cited the D-day landings as evidence of the longstanding relationship between Washington and Berlin.“When you talk about Germany, we have a very strong relationship with the government of Germany,” Nauert said, adding: “Tomorrow is the anniversary of the D-day invasion. We obviously have a very long history with the government of Germany, and we have a strong relationship with the government.”Nauert, 48, rose to fame at the time the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal threatened to bring down Bill Clinton’s presidency, joining Fox News as one of a chorus of presidential critics.“I told her, ‘God made you beautiful. Now you’ve got to make yourself smart,’” Tony Snow, a Fox News host told the Washington Post in 2000. “TV can be a blond wasteland. There are a lot of gorgeous people with only one thing to say who vanish from the scene.”Nauert became an anchor on Fox \u0026amp Friends, Trump’s favourite television talkshow, where she helped air the network’s recurrent themes about the threat of immigration, warning that immigrant children arriving in the US could be bringing disease into the country, and that Sharia law was spreading in urban areas with Muslim populations.On the other hand, while mostly toeing the administration’s line at the state department lectern, she has spoken out strongly in support of journalism, at a time the president has referred to the press as the “enemy of the people”, and called for accountability for the massacre of Rohingya civilians by Burmese forces while the administration dithered over whether to call the mass killings a genocide.Nauert will arrive at the UN at a time when the Trump’s administration’s attitude to the organisation, always sceptical, is turning disdainful following the arrival of Bolton in the White House in March. The former US ambassador to the UN once said that if you lopped off the top 10 floors of the organisation’s New York headquarters, it would make no difference.Pompeo was scathing about the UN in a speech this week in Brussels.“Today at the United Nations, peacekeeping missions drag on for decades, no closer to peace,” he said. “The UN was founded as an organisation that welcomed peace-loving nations. I ask: today, does it continue to serve its mission faithfully?”Haley was also an outspoken UN sceptic, but developed a working relationship with the secretary general, António Guterres, which helped protect US funding from hawkish demands for deep cuts from Washington. Since Haley announced her departure, the US has become more aggressive in insisting budgets for UN peacekeeping operations in Africa be frozen or cut.“The balance between Nauert’s ambition and autonomy will be interesting,” Ashish Pradhan, the International Crisis Group’s senior UN analyst, said. “Haley had a lot of autonomy, with Tillerson largely absent, she had the ambition and leeway to drive US policy.“Those days are definitely behind us, especially since Pompeo and Bolton joined,” Pradhan said. “For Nauert it is going to be more about implementing than developing policies.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3723897.1544223494!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"luas cross city one year on popular success logistical mess","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Luas on Dawson Street, Dublin. Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillWith delays, overcrowding, yellow box blockages, troubles with longer trams, and College Green “chaos”, the Luas Cross City line, introduced a year ago, did not exactly get off to a smooth start.However, the popularity of the new service is undeniable. Trips on the Luas system as a whole exceeded 10 million for the first time in the second quarter of the year.In just eight years, traffic has grown by 50 per cent. On the Green Line, revenues are up more than 30 per cent since the introduction of the new service, while on the Red Line revenues are up 7 per cent.Filling in the “missing link” between the Luas Red and Green Lines through the heart of a congested city centre was never going to be easy, or it would have been done more than a decade ago when those two lines were built.There should, of course, never have been two separate lines in the first place. This was apparent from the start of Luas operations in 2004, if not before, as evidenced by the fact that plans to connect the lines were announced the very next year. It was another five years, however, before an application was made to build the connecting line. The Cross City line – which is in fact an extension of the Green Line, and runs on from the original Green Line terminus at St Stephen’s Green, through College Green and O’Connell Street, where it meets the Red Line, and on to the new DIT campus at Grangegorman, serving Phibsborough and finally Cabra – was granted permission in 2012. Work on the line started the following year and ended on schedule last December.While the trams arrived on time, the surrounding city clearly wasn’t ready for them. This was most obvious at College Green. In 2009 Dublin City Council tried and failed to remove all but public transport from College Green, which in 2010 was watered down to a peak-time-only car ban. Only in mid-2014, when Luas construction work made the area practically impassable, was the ban extended to 7am-7pm on weekdays.On the first weekday of operations as many as six trams were lined up from O’Connell Street to College Green, unable to move, while buses took up to 22 minutes to cover 200m from Pearse Street Garda station to the front gate of Trinity College Dublin.Initially tram operator Transdev reduced the frequency at peak times to try and take heat out of the situation, with the predictable consequence of overcrowded carriages. The following month, 17 bus routes were erted away from College Green, and another 10 routes followed in February.College Green was not the only hostile environment for the new trams. While the services started with 43m-long trams, 55m trams were introduced in February, which presented a potential problem crossing the 45m-long O’Connell Bridge. The solution was to use yellow boxes, which motorists, again predictably, blocked at one end, forcing trams to block the quays with their back-ends.While all this has the distinct whiff of fiasco off it, Paolo Carbone, head of public transport capital programmes with Transport Infrastructure Ireland said the introduction of the Luas has not been more problematic than similar systems in other countries.“The Luas is not segregated in the city centre. It shares the road with other users – buses, cars, taxis, delivery vans. Inevitably there will be some traffic problems, but when you travel through the city, these things happen.”Difficulties at O’Connell Bridge have been rare, he says, and have largely been down to motorists trying to take an illegal turn from the bridge on to Eden Quay.“At times things will go wrong in a city, and it will impact on the system, but it will impact on all the services – buses, drivers in their cars – not just Luas.”Having worked on similar systems in other cities, including Vienna and Budapest, Carbone says: “I haven’t seen anything I wouldn’t have expected.”The popularity illustrated by the passenger numbers has brought strains, Carbone concedes. “So far the usage has bucked every projection, so at times it can be uncomfortable, but this is exactly why we have introduced the capacity enhancement programme.”This means the introduction of extra longer trams. Seven 55m trams were brought into service between January and June this year, 26 existing 43m trams will be ungraded to the longer length and eight additional 55m trams will be in place by 2022, he said.“At the moment 6,400 passengers can currently travel from Sandyford to St Stephen’s Green in the morning. This will increase to 8,200 after the expansion in capacity with a very generous factor of comfort.”Graeme McQueen of the Dublin Chamber of Commerce says the service has “broadly been a great addition to the city” but issues excused as teething problems at the start “have not all gone away”, he said. “If there is one thing we really would like to see it’s more enforcement of yellow boxes. This is probably down to Garda enforcement, but it is a perennial problem of trying to get everything working together in the city, and for that to be solved the College Green area needs to be addressed.”The Luas line, and College Green in particular, has posed a particular problem for cyclists. While evidence is anecdotal, hospital staff have reported increased injuries involving the tracks.Kieran Ryan of the Dublin Cycling Campaign says there has been a “steady stream” of reports of falls, particularly at College Green, where cyclists have in some cases to travel with the tracks , and in others cross them, in an area that is very tight for space. The National Transport Authority (NTA) had initially sought to ban cyclists from parts of the city centre used by the tram, but was blocked from doing so by the city council.“The NTA said instead of the ban they would prioritise alternative routes for cyclists through the city. We thought Suffolk Street would be ideal for that, but that has ben blocked off and has become an informal loading bay, which is a real missed opportunity.”The NTA has “no immediate plans for any major re-routing of cyclists in the College Green area”. There may be ways to improve the effectiveness of the current two-way cycle route that runs in front of the Bank of Ireland, it said, but a lot will depend on the revised proposal for the plaza.The Luas, while undeniably popular, is seen by some, particularly those reliant on buses, as getting too much precedence and priority, and was even accused in the Oireachtas of ruining Christmas this year, with the council cancelling the traditional Christmas tree ceremony at the GPO on O’Connell Street so as not to disrupt its services. Operational issues will never fully be eliminated. The recent breakdown of a bus on the tracks on Dawson Street early one weekday morning brought the service to a standstill during rush hour. Ultimately, securing reliability for the service in the city will come down to the resolution of the College Green mess.A City United: As Dublin\u0027s Luas lines come together we look at the impact on the city"},{"url":null,"title":"charity prints from the irish times","story":" photographers have produced a gallery of images that will make a unique Christmas gift.

Photograph: Liam McBurneyPA WireNorthern Ireland journalists Trevor Birney and Barry McCaffrey caused a bit of a splash when they visited Westminster on Thursday.The two are on police bail until March 1st arising from police investigations into information featured in their award-winning documentary No Stone Unturned, about the 1994 UVF murders of six people in a pub in Loughinisland. They have not been charged, but the police are investigating alleged breaches of the Official Secrets Act.During their visit they highlighted the aggressive raids on their homes. Birney told MPs that even his eight-year-old daughter’s pink phone and her homework, on a memory stick, had been confiscated and remains in custody. The NUJ group, led by former union president Tim Dawson, got a warm reception from predictable sources, including Tony Lloyd, Labour spokesman on Northern Ireland and Chris Stephens of the SNP. Former deputy PM John Prescott was especially supportive.Afterwards, there was a special showing of the film at the NUJ’s head office in King’s Cross. Among the attendance was the Sinn Féin MP for South Down, Chris Hazzard, along with academic and journalist Roy Greenslade, historian Dr Maurice Walsh, late of this parish, and an array of others. Back in Westminster, with the Brexit debate raging in the Commons, there was some surprise among the visitors when Boris Johnson stopped to chat. In no time at all he was loudly expressing his shock at the treatment of the two journalists. According to Birney, it only took the MP two minutes to become fully informed and totally outraged, “nearly as long as he took to consider the implications of Brexit”.Sinn Féin’s top brass were out in force in the Members’ Dining Room on Wednesday night when the Ceann Comhairle Seán Ó Fearghaíl launched A Leap of Faith, a book by Presbyterian minister David Latimer recalling his long friendship with the late Martin McGuinness.In an endorsement on the front cover, Bill Clinton writes that their “remarkable” friendship “reminds us all about the importance of building bridges between faiths if we are to truly share the future”.Former leader Gerry Adams joined his successor Mary Lou McDonald at the event, which was also attended by Martin’s wife, Bernie, who has written the book’s foreword. The unlikely friendship between the former IRA leader and the minister of Derry Presbyterian Church began over a decade ago, and the book covers a series of events, including the Rev Latimer’s speech at the Sinn Féin ardfheis, McGuinness’s handshake with the queen, and their joint work for peace in Derry. The author’s also writes about his time as an army chaplain at Camp Bastion in Afghanistan in 2008.Launching the book, Ó Fearghaíl spoke of the journey undertaken by the two, “their strange challenging journey of discovery – discovery of each other, of themselves and the communities in which they served”. Meanwhile, McDonald told of the “enriching ties of friendship” which they built across the political ide and, in the case of McGuinness, “that sometimes got him into a bit of bother, including with us, his own republican family”. She added: “It is only with the value of hindsight that many of us realise how right he was, how wise he was.” Latimer got warm applause from the crowd – from across the political spectrum – for his opening lines: “A Ceann Comhairle, go raibh maith agat. Dia daoibh go léir. Is álainn liom a bheith anseo.”He said it was “a great honour” to be in Leinster House and said he couldn’t believe it when he saw Bernie McGuinness there. She had been texting him when he was coming down to Dublin on the bus from Derry, but didn’t tell him she would be at the launch too. The culture clash between Leo Varadkar and the rural Independents is regularly stoked by the quartet of Mattie McGrath and the Healy-Rae brothers, with Michael Collins from Schull, Co Cork given the occasional walk-on part. Week in, week out, there are howls of protest over the Taoiseach’s coldness to rural Ireland as he variously closes it down, rips the heart of it, turns it into a wasteland and deprives thirsty aul’ fellas of their pints on the way home from Mass. This week, according to Kerry’s Danny Healy-Rae, he blew “the social fabric of rural Ireland to smithereens” and brought about a situation where “people who need a car to get from A to B can’t even have one pint”. And why was “the culture of the rural people being blown to smithereens” by guards stopping thirsty aul’ fellas on the roads at all times of the day and night and bagging them?Danny gave Leo the answer: “It was at your behest, trying to satisfy Minister Ross.”Shane Ross’s name was mentioned again by McGrath, but this time it wasn’t in relation to rural transport and the drink driving laws. He wanted the Taoiseach to ask his Minister for Transport to arrange a meeting between one of his constituents and the Road Safety Authority. “There’s a young man in Tipperary, an entrepreneur named Jason Maher, and he’s developed a tyre app – and he’s with the RSA, up and down – a road safety app for tyre safety. And it’s the most important part of the vehicle, is the connection with roads and our tyres, and would you please ask Minister Ross to get the Road Safety Authority to engage with him?” said Mattie, in the course of a somewhat garbled contribution.Leo looked up and drawled: “For the benefit of the stenographer, I think the Deputy said ‘tyre app’.”“I thought he said ‘tie rack’,” smirked the Taoiseach. Michael Healy-Rae was not impressed. “There’s no need to be smart.”But Leo was delighted with his little quip. “I wasn’t quite sure what use a tie rack would be to the Road Safety Authority,” he chuckled to himself.The Taoiseach appeared to give us an insight into his town-versus-county view of politicians when commenting on Tuesday about the length of time it is taking for legislation to go through. “We have an effective filibuster here by rural Independents on the abortion Bill and a filibuster in the Seanad by urbane Independents on the Judicial Appointments Bill.” Leo and the rural urbane ide. Q: How many ministers does it take to change a lightbulb?A: The reality is, and let us be perfectly clear about this, we all recognise the importance of lightbulbs and that is why we are even more determined to nearly meet our lightbulb target almost as soon as we get the report from the scoping committee advising on the structure of the expert group to be established under the chairmanship of retired Ms Justice Whoeversfree to examine expressions of interest from stakeholders in the chandelier pillar groups in partnership with incandescent civic society with a view to joining the Taoiseach and insignificant others at a big launch before lunch in Government Buildings in time for the one o’clock news. So, how many ministers does it take to change a lightbulb?None. You couldn’t let them anywhere near electrics. No. A clever press adviser will do the job. When Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment Richard Bruton joined the Taoiseach at the Government’s latest Project 2040 launch in Merrion Street recently – the one about the €500 million Climate Action Fund, he announced the provision of €17.5 million for the retrofitting of public lighting. All very laudable, but how does this relate to the man and woman back in the constituencies?Former Indo reporter Niall O’Connor, who is now press adviser to Paul Kehoe, the Minister of State for Defence, was quick off the mark to see the potential for his boss. Immediately after the announcement, bright spark O’Connor had his own lightbulb moment and he lobbed in a query to Bruton’s department. And Kehoe was able to supply the Wexford media with a good news announcement: “New funding provided to Wexford county will see the upgrade of up to 12,000 public lights across Wexford.” On foot of the Government’s plan to retrofit 326,000 public lights around the country, “Minister Kehoe said he understands around 12,000 lights will fall under this scheme in Wexford. Poor public lighting can cause people, particularly elderly people, to feel unsafe. This will provide a piece of mind to many communities and ensure that our streets are better lit.”It was a tough start to the week for the Minister for Finance.Paschal Donohoe flew out to Brussels on Sunday evening to be in time for his monthly Eurogroup meeting, which had an early start on Monday morning. On Tuesday he was due at the regular Ecofin meeting to discuss banking union and the digital services tax. The Eurogroup meeting went on, and on, and on. Appropriately enough, as the European Commission was marking the 20th anniversary of the euro, the ministers were discussing monetary union and securing the euro. It had been expected that proceedings would wrap up around midnight, but that didn’t happen. During a break in the early hours, Paschal called Deliveroo and ordered a raft of burgers and chips from “Be Burger” for the starving Irish contingent in the Europa Building. The meeting finished at 8am. The Minister then moved on to his Ecofin appointment, where all the sleep-deprived EU foreign ministers talked until midday before staggering out again. After a couple of hours’ sleep, Paschal left for the airport and a Tuesday evening flight home.

Photograph: Sam PanthakyAFPDespite the country’s crippling poverty, under-nourished population, astronomical levels of urban pollution and rapidly crumbling infrastructure, successive Indian governments have displayed a penchant for grand, attention-grabbing and hugely expensive enterprises.Almost all of them have endeavoured to project India as a global power, but in doing so they have wilfully ignored the myriad domestic economic, environmental, educational, social and medical shortcomings that render daily existence for the ordinary Indian nightmarish.Much hope was pinned on prime minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government that assumed office in May 2014 after an impressive victory at the hustings.In the run-up to the elections it projected itself as different, promised frugality, moderation and above all achhe din or good days to the people, following a decade of venal Congress Party-led rule.But over the past four years Modi’s government too has proved no different than its predecessors, succumbing to populism and erring on the side of extravagance and grandiosity while overlooking India’s stark realities.Modi’s most recent indulgence was the inauguration of the world’s tallest statue.Built at a cost of €355 million in the prime minister’s western home state of Gujarat, the 182m monument honours Sardar Valabbhai Patel, independent India’s first deputy prime minister. Patel, like Modi, was from Gujarat.Patel’s statue, however, will be overshadowed by that of Shivaji, the 17th-century Hindu warrior king that is being built off the Mumbai coast to a height of 210m – up from the 192m planned earlier – at a cost of €561 million. Modi laid its foundation stone in December 2016 and it is scheduled for completion by 2020.Modi also inaugurated a €3 billion Japanese bullet train project last September slated to run 524km between Gujarat’s largest city Ahemdabad and Mumbai at a time when the vast Indian Rail network is beset by obsolescence, corruption and frequent accidents.And if such profligacies were not enough, Modi in his Independence Day address in August declared that India would send a “son or daughter of India” into space by 2022 to celebrate 75 years of freedom.“This government and its predecessors have failed ordinary Indians, year after year,” declared columnist Kanti Bajpai. “It is laughable to talk about a rising India given our sad scabrous state.”On the Life Expectancy Index, it is ranked 163rd out of 224 countries, while the Global Hunger Index ranks it 103rd of 119 countries. In 2017, India recorded the highest number of malnutrition cases globally, in addition to having the world’s highest number of stunted children.Environmentally, India is calamitous. According to the Environmental Performance Index it is 177th out of 180 countries and contains 14 of the world’s 15 most polluted cities, with its capital New Delhi ranked sixth on this scale. Last year, more than two million deaths in India were attributed to pollution and in 2018 this number is projected to rise.The country’s water situation too is alarming. A recent federal government report warned that some 20 Indian cities including Delhi, Bangalore and nearby Hyderabad were likely to run out of ground water by 2020, affecting more tha n 120 million residents, some 24 times Ireland’s population.The report cautioned that Bangalore faced the grim prospect of “day zero”, when its water taps would run permanently dry if drastic measures to avert the looming crisis were not swiftly implemented.In 2018, India was ranked 115th out of 158 countries in the World Human Capital Index and, despite its perceived competence in information technology, it was 134th out of 178 nations in the Information and Communication Technologies Development Index.The situation with regard to journalism too was abysmal, as the Committee to Protect Journalists’ 2018 Global Impunity Index, which measures the dangers faced by media personnel, noted that India was 14th out of 14 countries evaluated. And on the World Justice Report’s Rule of Law Index, the world’s largest democracy was placed 62nd out of 113 nations.“India is a competent event manager, capable of undertaking short-term projects, but incapable of sustaining any long-term developmental ventures,” said Seema Mustafa of the Centre for Policy Analysis in Delhi.It needed to stop competing mindlessly in the international arena and concentrate instead on its innumerable deficiencies at home if it wanted to survive in the 21st century, she warned."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3723046.1544128301!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit mps hear of laughter in tipperary and galway","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Pro-EU supporters call for a People’s Vote outside the British Houses of Parliament on  December 6th, 2018:   Some claim the backstop creates a problem of democratic control upwards because people in Northern Ireland would be subject to EU rules without any democratic representation in the EU. Photograph: Andy RainAlthough most of this week’s political drama has taken place in the House of Commons, they have also been debating Theresa May’s Brexit deal at the other end of the Palace of Westminster in the House of Lords.On Thursday, former first minister David Trimble complained that the Northern Ireland protocol had been drawn up by members of the French administrative elite of énarques, who were “deeply imbued with a different way of approaching things”.“That protocol is not a democratic one and it undermines the Belfast Agreement.\u0026nbspOver the past year or two, people have expressed concern that this process might damage it. Yes, but it is not the desire to leave the EU that is causing the damage it is what the EU is doing by way of reprisal, aimed not just at us in Northern Ireland but at the UK as a whole,” he said.Historian Paul Bew offered a more thoughtful analysis on Wednesday when he acknowledged the need to address the difficulties Brexit created in Ireland.But he argued that Britain’s cast-iron assurance that it would not create a hard border meant that its efforts in the negotiations were aimed at ensuring that the EU did not oblige Ireland to do so.“Maybe we were right to do it, but we should be absolutely clear that that is what we have been doing. We have put ourselves through a lot of pain to do it, and I absolutely accept it is right to be sensitive to the needs and problems created for Ireland by Brexit,” he said.He said the backstop created a problem of democratic control upwards because people in Northern Ireland would be subject to EU rules without any democratic representation in the EU. This was, he said, inconsistent with the model of North-South co-operation in the Belfast Agreement.“This is a huge difficulty that will have to be attended to otherwise, we lose the template of the Good Friday agreement, which all parties in Northern Ireland accept. Even now, when we cannot make it work, everybody accepts that that is the basic template for a settlement. If we throw it away, which will be the effect of going along these lines, we will be taking a massive risk with the stability of Northern Ireland.”Ulster Unionist peer Reg Empey pointed to the huge preponderance of Irish trade that goes across the Irish Sea rather than across the Border, suggesting that Ireland’s real border with the UK was eastwest rather than northsouth.But in the House of Commons on Thursday, Labour’s Chris Ruane, who represents the Vale of Clwyd, reminded MPs that any disruption to trade across the Irish Sea would hurt parts of Wales almost as much as Ireland.“We have heard about the 17-mile tailbacks that would affect Dover. Seven-mile tailbacks are predicted for Holyhead. We are already seeing sea lanes open from Cork to Santander and from Cork to Rotterdam. If we lose the sea lanes and lose that trade with Ireland, which is as big as the trade with Brazil, Russia and India combined – it is worth over £45 billion – that will be a problem,” he said.The SNP’s Angus Brendan MacNeil noted that Thursday was the 96th anniversary of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, adding that Brexit had shown the Irish they were right to become independent. Casual Irish schadenfreude and aggressive bluster about Brexit has bruised some feelings at Westminster but MacNeil relished it.“The escaped Irish have belly laughs, and their biggest wind-up is to go on television at various points of crisis and tell the UK to stay calm. Back in Tipperary, Waterford and Galway they are laughing, because they know exactly what it means to tell London to stay calm,” he said.Earlier, MPs rubbed their eyes as they watched Labour’s shadow chancellor John McDonnell, who once praised “the bombs and bullets and sacrifice” of the IRA, denounce the backstop as a threat to the union. Almost as improbably, Ian Paisley quoted C Desmond Greaves, the Marxist historian who acted as a muse to IRA chief of staff Cathal Goulding in the 1960s.“All fundamental battles in British politics take place in the Conservative Party, with everyone else having bit parts,” Greaves said.\u0026nbspAn index of selected articles available exclusively to our readers with an  digital subscription "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3724129.1544213675!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"uk ports could face six months of delays after no deal brexit","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tCargo trucks wait to embark ferries in front of the white cliffs at the Port of Dover. Photograph: Luke MacGregorBloomberg via Getty ImagesBritain’s major Channel ports could face up to six months of delays and disruption after a no-deal Brexit, the British government warned on Friday. New assessments of the impact of leaving without a deal found that delays at Dover and Folkestone could last much longer than previously predicted.Health secretary Matt Hancock has told healthcare providers to prepare for a worst-case scenario by stockpiling more than the six-week supply of medicines previously recommended.“In areas where we cannot tolerate significant risk to the flow of goods, such as with medicines and medical products, we need to have contingency plans in place for this worst-case planning assumption,” he said.“This means that whilst the six-week stockpiling activities remain a critical part of our contingency plans, this now needs to be supplemented with additional actions.”Britain fears that, if it leaves the EU without a deal, France and other EU countries will impose additional checks on goods crossing the Channel, leading to long delays for trucks carrying supplies. Mr Hancock said the National Health Service should prepare to use alternative routes, including the use of aircraft to fly in supplies of essential medicines.The warnings came as Theresa May struggled to win support for her Brexit deal ahead of a vote in the House of Commons scheduled for next Tuesday. A group of Conservative backbenchers supportive of the government have tabled an amendment that would require Mrs May to obtain “further assurance from the European Union that the Northern Ireland backstop would only be a temporary arrangement and that, in the event that it comes into force, both parties intend to agree a future relationship or alternative arrangements consistent with the Political Declaration one year after the end of the Implementation Period.”\u0026nbspDowning Street said on Friday that the prime minister is not seeking to reopen the withdrawal agreement, the legally binding text that includes the terms of the backstop. Despite pressure from cabinet colleagues to delay Tuesday’s vote, Mrs May continues to insist that it will go ahead as planned.About 100 Conservative MPs have indicated that they will vote against the deal, which is also opposed by the DUP and all opposition parties. But the government is hoping that an amendment to the Brexit deal motion can be crafted to offer sufficient reassurance on the backstop to win over a majority of MPs.If such an amendment is passed, the government could avoid a vote on the substantive motion on Tuesday, sparing the prime minister a crushing defeat that could doom her Brexit deal and her premiership. The EU will not offer any concession or clarification on the backstop ahead of Tuesday’s vote and next week’s European Council is unlikely to produce any new text.Mrs May will address the 27 other EU leaders during the summit in Brussels next Thursday, after which they will discuss Brexit among themselves. If the House of Commons has not approved the Brexit deal, EU leaders are expected to authorise an escalation of planning for a no-deal Brexit.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

We believe they are involved in doing the Kremlin’s bidding on a whole range of fronts, which includes using their financial muscle on behalf of the Russian state.“Roman Abramovich is on the list because he is \u2028believed to be Mr Putin’s most important financial supporter.”The source continued: “Targeting these iniduals will be an important part of the UK Government’s \u2028response to the Salisbury \u2028attack.”Mr Abramovich’s spokesman declined to comment but a source said the Chelsea FC owner was emphatically not in Mr Putin’s inner circle.The measures are thought to include an attempt to \u2028revoke visas, impose travel restrictions and target \u2028UK-based financial and property assets. It follows an\u2028 announcement by the Home Office this week that it was suspending the “golden visa” scheme that allows wealthy foreigners to acquire British visas.Well-placed sources have confirmed Mr Abramovich is on the list along with Oleg Deripaska, who was once associated with a number of British politicians but has since been placed on a US Treasury sanctions list.Oleg Deripaska, who was once associated with a number of British politicians but has since been placed on a US Treasury sanctions list, also appears on the list, it is understoodBritish intelligence officials say they regard Mr Deripaska as another priority because of his alleged links to Russia’s security forces. The  revealed this week that Evgeny Fokin, a former senior officer with Russia’s SVR foreign intelligence service, was a director with Mr Deripaska’s London-based energy company EN+, which is chaired by Lord Barker of Battle, the Conservative peer. Mr Fokin has denied being with SVR.“Mr Deripaska provides the Kremlin with financial backing and is also believed to have a close relationship with Russia’s intelligence services, including the GRU military intelligence unit that carried out the Salisbury nerve agent attack,” said a Whitehall official.Another name on the list is Alisher Usmanov, a metals magnate who in the summer sold his £550 million stake in Arsenal Football Club but whose company has ties with Everton. In 2017, Mr Usmanov launched a tirade against Mr Putin’s arch-critic Alexei Navalny, ending with the words: “I spit on you, Alexei Navalny.” Mr Navalny had accused him of corruption, a claim Mr Usmanov strongly denies.Mr Usmanov declined to comment but sources close to him insisted he had no involvement in Russian politics. “He is a businessman he is not an active supporter of politicians,” said the source. Arkady Rotenberg, Mr Putin’s former judo partner, also appears on the list with his younger brother Boris.In 2017 the EU announced new sanctions on Mr Rotenberg after judging he had been “undermining or threatening the territorial integrity of Ukraine”. When Mr Rotenberg orced in 2015, some details of assets in the UK were made public including a mansion in Surrey and a home in London.Igor Sechin, the energy baron known in Russian media as “Darth Vader”, is the sixth man on the list. Mr Sechin is chief executive of the oil \u2028 conglomerate Rosneft and was once Mr Putin’s secretary. He has been \u2028 described as Russia’s most powerful oligarch.The apparent decision to target Mr Abramovich is the most significant, however, given his position as the highest profile Russian with such strong connections to the UK. Putting him on the list will likely throw further doubt on his continued ownership of Chelsea.Despite owning at least three homes in London, he was barred from entering the UK after being forced to apply for a new visa when his previous one expired. Mr Abramovich later took Israeli citizenship to circumvent the problems – no such visa is required to visit the UK by Israelis.But a source close to Mr Abramovich was unable to say if he had returned to the UK since then.The concerted crackdown on the oligarchs has provoked fury in the Kremlin, which accused Western nations of “unfriendly and unscrupulous actions”.Britain’s relations with Russia plunged to a new low in the wake of the nerve agent attack in Salisbury when Russia’s military intelligence, on the order of Mr Putin, attempted to assassinate Col Sergei Skripal, 67, using Novichok nerve agent.    British backpacker\u0026#39s disappearance in New Zealand being treated as suspected murderMichael Cohen made illegal hush payments at direction of Trump, prosecutors sayWhite nationalist convicted of murdering protester in CharlottesvilleWhy tubs of Christmas chocolates never have enough of your favourites Danny Dyer hosts Have I Got News for You, review: guest host hits his stride with nimble wit and salty quipsWarnings of no-deal ports chaos are \u0026#39misleading\u0026#39, industry boss saysLegalising cannabis could result in extra one million young people using the drug with 100,000 addicted, CSJ study findsMental health crises to be treated within four hours in new NHS targetTheresa May told to quit by Cabinet ministers if her Brexit deal falls and she fails to get better terms from EUComment: For Brexiteers, there\u0026#39s only one route to no deal – get rid of Mrs May and call a general electionHi-tech maps to tell public how long police officers spend on their beatsTfL pays £10m for staff to work for unions as strikes cause chaos for commuters Mother and ex-partner jailed for ‘brutal’ murder of three-week only baby, as judge says she treated her son as a ‘fashion accessory’Question Time is to have a ‘softer’ feel after Fiona Bruce agrees to take over as host in addition to her four other BBC rolesUCL students\u0026#39 union closes controversial men\u0026#39s rugby club after they attempt to hold banned initiation ceremonyNorway plus, second referendum or EU rescue: what are all the options if Theresa May\u0026#39s Brexit plan fails?Christmas chaos for train and plane passengers as two strikes announced for December 22Four arrested over theft of \u0026#39national treasure\u0026#39 tiara during audacious gallery raidPalace fears for Duke and Duchess of Sussex\u0026#39s safety after BBC publicises \u0026#39neo-Nazi propaganda\u0026#39 calling for Harry to be shot Donald Trump calls Rex Tillerson \u0026#39dumb as a dog\u0026#39 after the former diplomat criticises his presidencyWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"british backpackers disappearance new zealand treated suspected","story":"The disappearance of a British backpacker in New Zealand is being treated as a suspected murder, police said on Saturday.Grace Millane, a 22 year-old from Essex, was last seen last Saturday night entering the four-star CityLife Hotel at 9.41pm. A 26-year-old man is being questioned by detectives after he was located by police at an address in central Auckland on Saturday afternoon.Police said they were still looking for Ms Millane, although evidence suggested she had been killed.Her family have been left devastated by the development, Auckland City Police Detective Inspector Scott Beard said.Sadly the evidence we have gathered to this point in the inquiry has established that this is a homicide, he told a press conference.Grace\u0027s family have been advised of this development and they are devastated.Police released a CCTV image (left) showing Miss Millane at the CityLife Hotel in Auckland on Saturday evening.

He said she typically “bombarded” the family with messages and photographs.Miss Millane, who completed a degree in advertising and marketing at Lincoln University, was on a yearlong trip and arrived in New Zealand on Nov 20 after a four-week group tour to Peru.

The Purple One falls into the category with tby far the most sweets, the caramelfudge type, which also includes the Caramel Swirl, Fudge, Toffee Penny, Coconut Eclair, Toffee Deluxe, Toffee Finger.The contents of a tub of Quality StreetsNestle appears to be cashing in on its less than ideal flavour ratios by teaming up with John Lewis to offer chocolate lovers the chance to fill a 1.2kg Quality Street tub with their own handpicked selection of chocolates. Shoppers can fill up with as many Purple or Green Ones as they can stuff into their tins - but for £12 - which is nearly twice the price of a same sized tin at Sainsbury\u0027s, which costs £7. Which? also ranked the flavours in tubs of Mars’ Celebrations, and Cadbury’s Heroes and Roses according to popularity, to determine what proportion of each should make up the perfect assortment.    Conversely, it found families were less likely to fight over Roses as there were an abundance of Strawberry Creams, the most popular chocolate. This is because the fruit cream category comprises just two flavours (Strawberry Delight and Orange Creme).  Cadbury’s said it chooses a random selection in tins of Roses which it said is designed to be enjoyed by all. When it comes to Celebrations there is good news for fans of Malteser Teasers, the most popular in the tub, as Which? found it is one of the most abundant chocolates with an average of 10 in each tub. Mars also has a random selection process for filling tubs. The Purple One - one of the nation\u0026#39s favourite Quality Street chocolatesThere was also disappointment for fans of Cadbury\u0027s Heroes, as despite Wispas and Twirls being the most highly coveted, they had the fewest chocolates per box, with 30 per cent and 29 per cent ranking them as their favourites, but only an average of 9 and 6 in a box.Harry Rose, Editor of Which? Magazine, said: “Our analysis shows that it’s not your family’s fault that your favourite flavours disappear from the tub so quickly: there really are too few Purple Ones to meet popular demand.“Of course, if you’re a fan of Strawberry Delights, Eclairs or Milky Ways, this will be welcome news - you’re more likely to still be eating chocolates into the New Year than your Wispa-loving friends.”A spokesman for Nestle said: “We do take the popularity of inidual sweets into account and have increased the number of people’s favourites in this year’s assortment. Our research shows that the Caramel Swirl is the sweet with the broadest appeal but other studies point to The Purple One or the Strawberry Delight as being more popular. Part of the fun of Christmas is the family discussion about each of our favourites and who gets the last sweet.A spokesperson for Cadbury said: “The mix for our Roses and Heroes tubs are specifically hand-picked and we review the mix regularly to ensure we are giving our customers an assortment of the best chocolate that they love. However, there can be some minor deviations in the mix due to manufacturing processes.A spokesperson for Mars Wrigley Confectionery UK said: “Every year we enjoy seeing the debates rage about the nation’s favourite Celebrations.British backpacker\u0026#39s disappearance in New Zealand being treated as suspected murderMichael Cohen made illegal hush payments at direction of Trump, prosecutors sayWhite nationalist convicted of murdering protester in CharlottesvilleDanny Dyer hosts Have I Got News for You, review: guest host hits his stride with nimble wit and salty quipsWarnings of no-deal ports chaos are \u0026#39misleading\u0026#39, industry boss saysRoman Abramovich on list of six Russian oligarchs targeted by UK intelligence over links to PutinLegalising cannabis could result in extra one million young people using the drug with 100,000 addicted, CSJ study findsMental health crises to be treated within four hours in new NHS targetTheresa May told to quit by Cabinet ministers if her Brexit deal falls and she fails to get better terms from EUComment: For Brexiteers, there\u0026#39s only one route to no deal – get rid of Mrs May and call a general electionHi-tech maps to tell public how long police officers spend on their beatsTfL pays £10m for staff to work for unions as strikes cause chaos for commuters Mother and ex-partner jailed for ‘brutal’ murder of three-week only baby, as judge says she treated her son as a ‘fashion accessory’Question Time is to have a ‘softer’ feel after Fiona Bruce agrees to take over as host in addition to her four other BBC rolesUCL students\u0026#39 union closes controversial men\u0026#39s rugby club after they attempt to hold banned initiation ceremonyNorway plus, second referendum or EU rescue: what are all the options if Theresa May\u0026#39s Brexit plan fails?Christmas chaos for train and plane passengers as two strikes announced for December 22Four arrested over theft of \u0026#39national treasure\u0026#39 tiara during audacious gallery raidPalace fears for Duke and Duchess of Sussex\u0026#39s safety after BBC publicises \u0026#39neo-Nazi propaganda\u0026#39 calling for Harry to be shot Donald Trump calls Rex Tillerson \u0026#39dumb as a dog\u0026#39 after the former diplomat criticises his presidencyWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/20/21/david-davis.jpg","title":"house prices uk brexit property market london decline halifax index","story":"IM Subscribe  registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

Property prices in the three months from September to November fell 1.1 per cent compared with the preceding quarter, while prices dropped 1.4 per cent between October and November. Meanwhile, the rate of growth dropped to 0.3 per cent, the lowest rate since December 2012. Russell Galley, managing director at Halifax, said: “High employment, wage growth and historically low mortgage rates continue to make home ownership more affordable for many, though the need to raise a significant deposit still acts as something of a restraint on the market.

Mike Scott, chief property analyst at estate agent Yopa, said: “The usual Christmas slowdown in the housing market has started early this year, as people wait for the outcome of the current political turmoil before making long-term commitments, such as buying a new home.”Jeremy Leaf, a north London estate agent and a former residential chairman of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, said: “Looking forward, we don’t expect activity to change much, bearing in mind seasonal and political distractions. On the ground, lethargy is replacing energy.”Gary Barker, chief executive of proptech company Reapit, also predicted a continuation of the current subdued performance. “Transactions have been flat for the past three years, and caution is likely to remain whilst Brexit remains unfinished. Furthermore, if Brexit stalls, or more significant uncertainty over the government develops, it will be a painful road ahead,” he said. Mr Barker said that there could be room for optimism: “We are seeing house price reduction in some areas, which could make property more affordable and also boost the economy by increasing spending power and buying capacity. “If the Brexit deal passes through parliament, we could potentially see a much more confident market, resulting in more transactions, fewer withdrawals, and increased prices.”However, he added: “If the Bank of England’s forecast of a 30 per cent drop in house prices comes to fruition following a no-deal Brexit, the balance of the market will shift dramatically. “Although transactions may reduce significantly, with depressed prices discouraging sellers from listing their properties, low prices will put buyers back in control. First-time buyers, in particular, could benefit from slashed prices, giving them a leg-up onto the property ladder.”Additional reporting by newswiresShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The oil producing nations had been expected to agree to a reduction in production on Thursday at its meeting in Vienna. Reaching a deal proved difficult as sanctions-hit Iran refused to comply with the output cuts, despite the input of non-Opec member Russia. For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialThe stalemate led the oil price to fall - the commodity had previously dropped by 30 per cent from four-year highs of more than $86 per barrel in October to below $59 at the end of November. However, a second day of talks led to an agreement, providing a boost to the price of Brent crude which rose to $63.25 by mid-afternoon on Friday. Qatar to quit Opec in 2019 amid angry dispute with Saudi ArabiaWhat is OPEC and why has Qatar left its ranks?Trump hits out at OPEC and says oil prices are artificially very highWhy Opec is caught between a rock and a hard placeBarani Krishnan, senior analyst at Investing, said it was natural that oil traders would react as positively to Opec’s decision to cut production as they did negatively “when the group seemed powerless to reduce even a barrel”. He added: “However, the market will also be watching for any signs of cheating by OPEC and punish the cartel accordingly.”Mr Krishnan said the bigger takeaway is “what the Saudi energy minister would possibly have on his mind as he leaves Vienna today a Russia that has become as powerful to Opec as Riyadh and a US that is now a net exporter of oil”.Furthermore, we\u0027ve not even gotten to the Khashoggi fallout and likely Trump dismay over these cuts,” he added. “One can only speculate at this point to how this will play out for the Saudis and their oil business going forward.Donald Trump had called on Opec to leave production unfettered in order to weigh prices down, tweeting ahead of the Vienna meeting: “The world does not want to see… higher oil prices”. Meanwhile, Ashley Kelty, oil \u0026amp gas research analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald Europe, said that although cutting output by 1.2 million barrels per day was a larger reduction than some had expected, it was still short of “what is really required to bring the market back into balance”. She said: “Our initial snap judgement is that prices will stabilise in the $60-65 per barrel range, as the cuts are likely to be insufficient to stem the near term supply glut, given US output is continuing to \u0026nbsprise (albeit at a slower pace due to capacity constraints).“It feels like a bit of a fudge, and the absence of the final communique at this late stage suggests that a lot of horse trading has been underway to reach a situation that tries to appeal to all parties, whilst ending up with a situation that will appease no-one.”Earlier this week, Qatar quit Opec, however, it still attended the meeting in Vienna.

We know that the type of university and qualification can make a difference to earnings later in life – so tackling this inequality of access is vital.“Schools and universities need to work together to ensure that bright, state-educated students have a fair chance at accessing the best higher education opportunities.”The Sutton Trust has not disclosed which eight schools and colleges accounted for the huge number of Oxbridge admissions – a condition of obtaining the data from Ucas.However, it is understood the majority are independent, fee-paying schools, with Eton, Westminster School and St Paul’s School all included on the list.In its report, the charity highlighted practices at some of these schools, which are giving students a leg up on their peers.At Eton, where pupils have access to a dedicated universities officer and the school’s own internal higher education guide, between 60 and 100 boys are sent to Oxford or Cambridge each year.Westminster School offers its students bespoke mentoring and university preparation classes, resulting in around 70 to 80 admissions to Oxbridge each year.gofundme fundraiserSt Paul’s School assigns each of its students a university advisor to guide them through the application process – a move that helped over a quarter of their students gain a place at either Oxford or Cambridge in 2016.In its report, the Sutton Trust called for students from all backgrounds to receive admissions advice to help close the admissions gap between top schools and the rest of the country.“If we are to ensure that all young people, regardless of their background, have a fair chance of getting in to our top universities, we need to address the patchwork of higher education guidance and support,” the trust’s founder, Sir Peter Lampl said,“All young people, regardless of what area they grow up in, or what school they go to, should have access to high quality personal guidance that allows them to make the best informed choices about their future.“The admissions process also needs to change. We have made the case for giving poorer students a break through contextual admissions, but we also need universities to make it clear what grades these students need to access courses.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 49Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A large mural depicting one star being chipped away from the EU flag is seen in Dover.

Others argue that the context of the song means the word should be interpreted as traditional Irish slang for a lazy person.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialPeople are calling for \u0027Fairytale of New York\u0027 to be censoredThe story behind The Pogues\u0027 \u0027Fairytale of New York\u0027MacGowan\u0026nbsphas now issued a statement to Virgin Media Television\u0027s The Tonight Show,\u0026nbspin response to calls from two RTE 2FM DJs to have the word censored during airplay.Presenter Eoghan McDermott took to Twitter this week to object to the word which he condemned as a “slur” and “insult”, while presenter Stephen Byrne revealed how he felt when he heard it played in a club, “I stood in a room as over 200 people screamed a word thats been used to make me feel like an outsider, with such joy and cheer”.McGowan, who wrote the song in 1987, and who sang it with the late Kirsty MacColl, released a statement explaining why he included the word in the song.“The word was used by the character because it fitted with the way she would speak and with her character,” he wrote. \u0026nbsp“She is not supposed to be a nice person, or even a wholesome person. She is a woman of a certain generation at a certain time in history and she is down on her luck and desperate.”He continued, “Her dialogue is as accurate as I could make it but she is not intended to offend!\u0026nbspShe is just supposed to be an authentic character and not all characters in songs and stories are angels or even decent and respectable, sometimes characters in songs and stories have to be evil or nasty in order to tell the story effectively.”Created with Sketch.Albums of the year 2018 Show all 40Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Thom Yorke’s first ever soundtrack summons the darkness of horror, and the terror of blood and evil, over 25 tracks.Marauder is Interpol’s most experimental to date, blending everything from rough garage rock to Motown rhythms. The band appear reinvigorated, brimming with energy and self-assurance.Brent Cobb’s music is built around people and places. The country artist returns after the release of his acclaimed 2016 album Shine On Rainy Day with Providence Canyon a slice of blue-collar country offering fresh tales of Southern lifeThe Brighton metal band’s sublime second album is their most ambitious to date. Enlisting Adrian Bushby (Foo Fighters, Muse) on production was a master-stroke – with his help they offer up vast sonic landscapes that recall the drama of Darion Malakian’s Scars on Broadway record, DictatorOne moment opining the joys of leaving a party to pluck your eyebrows, the next raging over the gaslighting of assault survivors, Miya Folick’s debut album continues her habit of cracking the shiny veneer of pop, and unsettling the exceptions put upon a feminine voiceThough their themes remain in the gutter, Suede aspire to monuments, and The Blue Hour will stand as another sordid masterworkSix years after the release of her last LP Sun, Cat Power – whose struggles with alcoholism, addiction and mental health issues have been much publicised – demonstrates “both a newfound sense of calm, and strength” on her new albumHoly Hell offers up some of the best tracks of the band’s career, with a through-line that maintains Tom Searle\u0027s role as an integral part of Architects, particularly on “Doomsday”, while “Hereafter” feels like the song that launches the album’s momentum. Listening to vocalist Sam Carter scream: “I wasn’t braced for the fallout” is intensely cathartic – even non-metal fans will find it hard not to be moved by the band’s sincerity. (RO)Even in discarding such basic pop necessities as melody, Robyn has managed to create a masterpiece. With her first album in seven years, the Swedish singer delivers nine songs that glow and pulse with bittersweet sensuality, sung in a voice that sifts over the synths like icing sugar1040 31. Florence \u0026amp the Machine - High as HopeOn Florence \u0026amp The Machine’s latest album High As Hope, her voice is just as powerful when she holds back. She seems to attribute much of this calmness to her new-found sobriety – she quit alcohol a few years ago and looks back on her twenties with a mix of fondness and regret1140 30. Teyana Taylor - Keep that Same EnergyShe’s not restricted by genre constraints, and K.T.S.E. (Keep That Same Energy) is a pleasant surprise. Embellished with producer Kanye West’s keen ear for samples, it blends Eighties nostalgia with fresh rap and R\u0026ampB. At the core of the project is Taylor’s love of pleasing herself, her relationship with her husband, and being a mother1240 29. The 1975 – A Brief Inquiry into Online RelationshipsOn their third and best album, A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships, The 1975 have created what so many post-Radiohead bands couldn’t: a coherent pop statement with enough hope, radical honesty and genre-ning breadth to make sense across ided generations1340 28. Kamasi Washington - Heaven and EarthFor a new generation, Kamasi Washington is largely responsible for the revitalised interest in jazz in modern music, most notably with his work on Kendrick Lamar’s jazz-heavy masterpiece, To Pimp a Butterfly. On Heaven and Earth, the Los Angeles saxophonist and band leader splits his second record in two halves: the urgent Earth side explores reality while Heaven deals in dreamy opulenceThe 21-year-old south London MC Novelist’s debut album is a clear, concise look at the current social and political landscape of the UK, offering up astute observations on black masculinity and the music industry along the way.The German composer’s 10th solo album is a stirring, complex work that draws on the concept of connection a fluidity in the way the universe worksCamila Cabello\u0027s debut solo album is the first time fans have been able to see her clearlyOn Mitski\u0027s brilliant fifth album she is desperate and lonely one minute, hardened and withdrawn the next. Her music, which exists in a space between fierce, guitar-led walls of noise and soft, delicate balladry, feels like an open wound – and Be The Cowboy is no different. (AP)Frontman Olly Alexander is offering fans their own generational pop icon: a young man who has the courage to put all of that vibrant, dynamic character on full displayOn Tell Me How You Really Feel, Courtney Barnett turns her keen eye inwards, exploring anxiety and depression while coming to terms with her own emotional life. Written as her burgeoning stature and hectic touring schedule began to take their toll, these 10 songs are Barnett’s attempt to work through her vulnerability and sadnessFor Negro Swan, Blood Orange’s fourth album, the multi-instrumentalist has dreamed up a 16-song suite that weaves together impressionist psych-pop and interstellar funk, late-Seventies Marvin Gaye and early-Eighties Prince, with some tangled ballads and insomniac blues reminiscent of Elliott Smith and King Krule thrown into the pot2140 20. Cardi B - Invasion of PrivacyWhen she sings off the hook, it’s just another moment where Cardi B runs to her own rhythm: because nothing about Invasion of Privacy is formulaicWith producer SOPHIE on board (whose own album, also released this year, is well worth your time), they explore the anxieties and frustrations of being a teenage girl through clattering beats and Nokia samples. The result is exceptionalGhetts re-evaluates much of what he said on Ghetto Gospel, when he was frustrated and angry with the world. Now he looks more to the future, whether on “Next of Kin”, where he speaks from the perspective of a mother carrying her child’s coffin, or “Black Rose”, which addresses fears for his daughter in a society that places double standards on black women. It’s a reminder that grime is so much more than violence and threats. (RO)2440 17. Cypress Hill – Elephants on AcidElephants on Acid is a 21-track monster, loaded with twists and turns that take you as far as Egypt, where Muggs recorded much of “Band of Gypsies” – teaming up with artists on oud, sitar, keyboard and guitar, as well as some of its street musicians. Its lead hook harks back to the glitchy shrieks of “How I Could Just Kill a Man” from their eponymous 1991 debut.His brilliant fourth album Love Is Magic takes listeners on a similar thrill ride, dominated by swirling loops of grand, romantic melody, sly twists of sardonic wit and heart-stopping drops of sheer honestyHis third record, produced entirely by Kanye West, could easily have been an EP, coming in at just seven songs and 21 minutes. While many fans were disappointed by the erratic and self-indulgent nature of some of West’s other releases, including his own album ye, the beats on Daytona are sample-heavy and superb the instrumentation is sparse but all the more impactful for itSince her debut single – the AK Paul-featuring “So Good” – was released in 2014, London-based singer-songwriter NAO has hovered around a near-perfect brand of sultry, neo-soul-inflected R\u0026ampB. Four years later, and she seems to have mastered itThe third solo album from the US artist stars an overwhelming number of (uncredited) guest features, producers and co-writers, but, ultimately, it’s his own, most career-defining work to date. Bloom captures the A to Z’s of modern queer love with pinpoint precisionHoward’s music has always, above all, reflected the shifts and moods in nature, while he sings poetic lyrics in his signature low, warm murmur. On Noonday Dream, he expands on the Cornish landscape that impacted his earlier work and brings in sounds and instruments that spark the imagination for places further afield, in the most exquisite way3140 10. Shame – Songs of PraiseDistinguishing themselves from the hordes of other white, indie guitar bands that emerged around summer 2017, south London natives Shame manage to make raw, bleeding anger on their debut album sound articulate.Gaika broke new ground on the UK music scene and asserted himself as one of the most provocative and multitalented young artists of this generation with his debut album, Basic VolumeTamino’s music on his debut Amir draws on the old-world romance of his grandfather – a famous Arabic musician and actor ¬– but also embodies the genre-less quality of much modern pop. The musical heritage that is so essential to the 22-year-old’s sound comes to life in the dramatic, sweeping instrumentation on a song like “So It Goes” haunting, graceful violins, bold drum beats and the shimmer of a tambourine transport the listener entirely.Mac Miller turned his anguish into one of the year’s most disarming records3540 6. Colter Wall - Song of the PlainsWall’s songwriting is as stark as it comes: his plain-speaking manner is delivered in a slow, melancholy drawl that paints him as some lonely cowboy – the last man of the West, as he describes in the most matter-of-fact terms how a bullet ripped in to “poor Wild Bill”. There’s no fuss in the instrumentation, either, mostly just gentle picking or brisk, deep thrums on Wall’s acoustic guitar, which are bolstered by icy laps of pedal steel and the occasional harmonica. It’s effective in the simplest of ways – and allows the listener’s imagination to do the restKendrick Lamar co-executive produced the Black Panther soundtrack, has writing credits on its 14 tracks, and appears in various skits and features. But his most essential job on this album is that of the curator, as he brings in a staggering array of talent – from Anderson .Paak, SZA and Future to South African gqom (EDM) artist Babes Wodumo and alt-rapper Yungen Blakrok.Kacey Musgraves third album flips between wide-eyed country pop and disco-electronica. Aided by co-writers and producers Daniel Tashian and Ian Fitchuk – both Nashville stalwarts – Musgraves conjures up a feeling of lightness as she melds the traditional and futuristic.Dirty Computer is Monáe’s gift to the LGBT+ community, non-binary people, black men and women… anyone who faces stigma and abuse just for embracing their true selves. It’s a message of love and hope to anyone who fears what is different, but who has capacity to learn and know better. And it’s seemingly a gift to herself, as well. (RO)Tranquility Base Hotel \u0026amp Casino feels more like an interlude between AM and a seventh Arctic Monkeys album – a delve into the bizarre, where even the Steinway piano has its own character. On “The Ultracheese”, the descending piano chords symbolise a kind of final bow the last soliloquy of the night before the curtain closes. Few bands today are as brave as this.Letissier makes her vintage synths snap, crackle, pop, fizz, freeze, squelch, shimmer and soar. There’s even a shattered glass effect (on “Stranger”) to complete the Old Skool Electronica bingo card. Treble notes bounce from air-cushioned soles. Bass lines lasso your hips. Chiffon layers of Letissier’s Anglo-French vocals glide around your neck and shoulders and roll them back. It’s ridiculously danceable.Thom Yorke’s first ever soundtrack summons the darkness of horror, and the terror of blood and evil, over 25 tracks.Marauder is Interpol’s most experimental to date, blending everything from rough garage rock to Motown rhythms. The band appear reinvigorated, brimming with energy and self-assurance.Brent Cobb’s music is built around people and places. The country artist returns after the release of his acclaimed 2016 album Shine On Rainy Day with Providence Canyon a slice of blue-collar country offering fresh tales of Southern lifeThe Brighton metal band’s sublime second album is their most ambitious to date. Enlisting Adrian Bushby (Foo Fighters, Muse) on production was a master-stroke – with his help they offer up vast sonic landscapes that recall the drama of Darion Malakian’s Scars on Broadway record, DictatorOne moment opining the joys of leaving a party to pluck your eyebrows, the next raging over the gaslighting of assault survivors, Miya Folick’s debut album continues her habit of cracking the shiny veneer of pop, and unsettling the exceptions put upon a feminine voiceThough their themes remain in the gutter, Suede aspire to monuments, and The Blue Hour will stand as another sordid masterworkSix years after the release of her last LP Sun, Cat Power – whose struggles with alcoholism, addiction and mental health issues have been much publicised – demonstrates “both a newfound sense of calm, and strength” on her new albumHoly Hell offers up some of the best tracks of the band’s career, with a through-line that maintains Tom Searle\u0027s role as an integral part of Architects, particularly on “Doomsday”, while “Hereafter” feels like the song that launches the album’s momentum. Listening to vocalist Sam Carter scream: “I wasn’t braced for the fallout” is intensely cathartic – even non-metal fans will find it hard not to be moved by the band’s sincerity. (RO)Even in discarding such basic pop necessities as melody, Robyn has managed to create a masterpiece. With her first album in seven years, the Swedish singer delivers nine songs that glow and pulse with bittersweet sensuality, sung in a voice that sifts over the synths like icing sugar1040 31. Florence \u0026amp the Machine - High as HopeOn Florence \u0026amp The Machine’s latest album High As Hope, her voice is just as powerful when she holds back. She seems to attribute much of this calmness to her new-found sobriety – she quit alcohol a few years ago and looks back on her twenties with a mix of fondness and regret1140 30. Teyana Taylor - Keep that Same EnergyShe’s not restricted by genre constraints, and K.T.S.E. (Keep That Same Energy) is a pleasant surprise. Embellished with producer Kanye West’s keen ear for samples, it blends Eighties nostalgia with fresh rap and R\u0026ampB. At the core of the project is Taylor’s love of pleasing herself, her relationship with her husband, and being a mother1240 29. The 1975 – A Brief Inquiry into Online RelationshipsOn their third and best album, A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships, The 1975 have created what so many post-Radiohead bands couldn’t: a coherent pop statement with enough hope, radical honesty and genre-ning breadth to make sense across ided generations1340 28. Kamasi Washington - Heaven and EarthFor a new generation, Kamasi Washington is largely responsible for the revitalised interest in jazz in modern music, most notably with his work on Kendrick Lamar’s jazz-heavy masterpiece, To Pimp a Butterfly. On Heaven and Earth, the Los Angeles saxophonist and band leader splits his second record in two halves: the urgent Earth side explores reality while Heaven deals in dreamy opulenceThe 21-year-old south London MC Novelist’s debut album is a clear, concise look at the current social and political landscape of the UK, offering up astute observations on black masculinity and the music industry along the way.The German composer’s 10th solo album is a stirring, complex work that draws on the concept of connection a fluidity in the way the universe worksCamila Cabello\u0027s debut solo album is the first time fans have been able to see her clearlyOn Mitski\u0027s brilliant fifth album she is desperate and lonely one minute, hardened and withdrawn the next. Her music, which exists in a space between fierce, guitar-led walls of noise and soft, delicate balladry, feels like an open wound – and Be The Cowboy is no different.

It’s a wartime story in which, for a change, the men are relegated to supporting roles. It follows in a tradition of French rural family sagas like Jean De Florette or Manon Des Sources. The landscapes and the changing seasons play as much of a part in the story as the main characters.Dark River offers little such consolation. It has some lyrical and delicate moments but the mood is generally overwhelmingly bleak and lugubrious. Incest and abuse don’t leave much space for any comic interludes. This is a powerful film with a grinding intensity about it. Light relief it isn’t but Dark River still has quite an impact.Late on in Argentinean director Lucrecia Martel’s startling, highly original new feature, Zama, a character who has just had both his arms cut off, is advised to “shove your stumps in the sand … if you don’t bleed out, you’ll survive.” It’s a grisly, darkly humorous moment in a film that continually surprises us with both its brutality and its lyricism.The most dispiriting aspect of this otherwise enrapturing Oscar-nominated animated feature is that its storyline still seems so current. The film depicts an Afghan society in which women don’t have a face. It is set during the Taliban rule, which lasted from the mid-1990s until late 2001, but this doesn’t feel like a period piece. Seventeen years after the Taliban were ousted from power in Afghanistan following the US invasion, the plight of women in the country appears hardly to have improved. Spike Lee’s work sometimes risks sensory overload. He fires off so many different ideas and storytelling styles that audiences can become bamboozled by his scattergun approach. BlacKkKlansman is one of his very best films because the digressions are as entertaining as ever but don’t get in the way of the main story.Much of the pleasure in Aardman films has always lain in their gently ironic, Alan Bennett-like humour. They take very exotic characters and subject matter but then deal with them in a matter-of-fact fashion. They make a virtue out of their own relative modesty. Early Man isn’t the flashiest animated feature that you’ll see this year but it is certainly the most likeable. 717 Isle of DogsLike all of Wes Anderson’s work, Isle Of Dogs is very stylised, very offbeat and characterised by its extremely dry and often ironic humour. This Japanese-set stop-motion fable is also gorgeous to look at – packed full of intricate visual detail. It deals with some weighty themes (ethnic cleansing, fascism and corruption) but does so in an idiosyncratic fashion.817 Three Billboards Outside of Ebbing, MissouriWriter-director Martin McDonagh has a host of award-winning plays behind him but his movies haven’t always lived up to his stage work. This one certainly does. It shares some of the dark and nihilistic humour found in McDonagh’s previous film, Seven Psychopaths.In an era of wearisome poltergeist movies, haunted house stories and torture porn, A Quiet Place is a refreshingly pared-down and very original affair. Director John Krasinski relies on editing, sound effects and off-screen action to crank up the tension. We do see the creatures from time to time, sometimes even in extreme closeup. They are very grotesque, bigger versions of the polyp-like succubus which exploded out of John Hurt’s stomach in Alien. However, the most terrifying moments here come when the humans are waiting for them to appear, desperately hoping that they won’t. Lady Bird is one of the best American coming-of-age films since Barry Levinson’s Diner. Written and directed by Greta Gerwig, it offers an utterly winning mix of humour, poignancy and sharp-eyed social observation. Gerwig approaches her subject matter with the same tenderness and affectionate irony with which the adolescent Lady Bird regards Sacramento. Gerwig also shows Lady Bird’s heroism as the young heroine strives against the odds to become the very best version of herself she can be.If Phantom Thread is indeed Daniel Day-Lewis’s final film as an actor, he is going out on a wondrously bizarre note. This must be the oddest film in his career, one in which he gives a typically commanding but very idiosyncratic performance. Almost everything here is jarring – but generally in a very positive way. It is not so long ago that Paul Schrader seemed to be giving up on cinema. The American writer-director (whose credits include Taxi Driver, American Gigolo and Affliction) had taken to making movies like the sour Hollywood satire The Canyons with Lindsay Lohan and the cartoonishly violent Dog Eat Dog, shot cheaply, aimed at a VOD audience. The former had a montage of closed-down movie theatres. In interviews, Schrader struck a gloomy note about the future of the industry. This is why First Reformed is so refreshing. This is not just Schrader’s best film in a very long while. It is also a re-affirmation of the director’s belief in the medium.Oscar Wilde goes to ruin in Rupert Everett’s debut feature as director. Everett also wrote and stars in the film, giving a grandstanding performance as the Irish writer at the end of his life, after his release from prison, where he has been doing hard labour for “gross indecency”. This is a moving and surprising biopic that squeezes out every last drop of pathos from its subject matter. Black Panther is not only one of the most entertaining recent superhero films but has an intelligence and a political dimension that such inchoate offerings as Suicide Squad and Justice League completely lacked. It is an action movie which touches on Pan-Africanism and which owes as much to Malcolm X as it does to Batman or Captain America. Sicilian Ghost Story is a genre-bending affair that combines elements of teen romance, gothic psycho-drama and political thriller. It is loosely based on a true story of a boy called Giuseppe Di Matteo whose father, an ex-member of the Sicilian Mafia, turned “grass” against his erstwhile associates. The Mafia responded by kidnapping Giuseppe and keeping him in captivity for nearly 800 days. First Man is all about understated heroism. It’s affecting precisely because Armstrong (played with quiet intensity by Ryan Gosling) doesn’t feel the continual need to boast about his mission. The film is a tearjerker but a very subtle one. Dogman is one of the best Italian films of recent times, a modern day neo realist fable that bears comparison with the great work of Fellini, Rossellini, De Sica et al. Its main character, the dog groomer Marcello (Marcello Fonte), is a wonderful creation: loveable, vulnerable, seedy and comic all at the same time. From its slow-burning beginning, s develops into an epic melodrama. It’s a wartime story in which, for a change, the men are relegated to supporting roles. It follows in a tradition of French rural family sagas like Jean De Florette or Manon Des Sources. The landscapes and the changing seasons play as much of a part in the story as the main characters.Dark River offers little such consolation.

Lady Bird is one of the best American coming-of-age films since Barry Levinson’s Diner. Written and directed by Greta Gerwig, it offers an utterly winning mix of humour, poignancy and sharp-eyed social observation. Gerwig approaches her subject matter with the same tenderness and affectionate irony with which the adolescent Lady Bird regards Sacramento. Gerwig also shows Lady Bird’s heroism as the young heroine strives against the odds to become the very best version of herself she can be.If Phantom Thread is indeed Daniel Day-Lewis’s final film as an actor, he is going out on a wondrously bizarre note. This must be the oddest film in his career, one in which he gives a typically commanding but very idiosyncratic performance. Almost everything here is jarring – but generally in a very positive way. It is not so long ago that Paul Schrader seemed to be giving up on cinema. The American writer-director (whose credits include Taxi Driver, American Gigolo and Affliction) had taken to making movies like the sour Hollywood satire The Canyons with Lindsay Lohan and the cartoonishly violent Dog Eat Dog, shot cheaply, aimed at a VOD audience. The former had a montage of closed-down movie theatres. In interviews, Schrader struck a gloomy note about the future of the industry. This is why First Reformed is so refreshing. This is not just Schrader’s best film in a very long while. It is also a re-affirmation of the director’s belief in the medium.Oscar Wilde goes to ruin in Rupert Everett’s debut feature as director. Everett also wrote and stars in the film, giving a grandstanding performance as the Irish writer at the end of his life, after his release from prison, where he has been doing hard labour for “gross indecency”. This is a moving and surprising biopic that squeezes out every last drop of pathos from its subject matter. Black Panther is not only one of the most entertaining recent superhero films but has an intelligence and a political dimension that such inchoate offerings as Suicide Squad and Justice League completely lacked. It is an action movie which touches on Pan-Africanism and which owes as much to Malcolm X as it does to Batman or Captain America. Sicilian Ghost Story is a genre-bending affair that combines elements of teen romance, gothic psycho-drama and political thriller. It is loosely based on a true story of a boy called Giuseppe Di Matteo whose father, an ex-member of the Sicilian Mafia, turned “grass” against his erstwhile associates. The Mafia responded by kidnapping Giuseppe and keeping him in captivity for nearly 800 days. First Man is all about understated heroism. It’s affecting precisely because Armstrong (played with quiet intensity by Ryan Gosling) doesn’t feel the continual need to boast about his mission. The film is a tearjerker but a very subtle one. Dogman is one of the best Italian films of recent times, a modern day neo realist fable that bears comparison with the great work of Fellini, Rossellini, De Sica et al. Its main character, the dog groomer Marcello (Marcello Fonte), is a wonderful creation: loveable, vulnerable, seedy and comic all at the same time.

Property prices in the three months from September to November fell 1.1 per cent compared with the preceding quarter, while prices dropped 1.4 per cent between October and November. Meanwhile, the rate of growth dropped to 0.3 per cent, the lowest rate since December 2012. Russell Galley, managing director at Halifax, said: “High employment, wage growth and historically low mortgage rates continue to make home ownership more affordable for many, though the need to raise a significant deposit still acts as something of a restraint on the market.

Mike Scott, chief property analyst at estate agent Yopa, said: “The usual Christmas slowdown in the housing market has started early this year, as people wait for the outcome of the current political turmoil before making long-term commitments, such as buying a new home.”Jeremy Leaf, a north London estate agent and a former residential chairman of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, said: “Looking forward, we don’t expect activity to change much, bearing in mind seasonal and political distractions. On the ground, lethargy is replacing energy.”Gary Barker, chief executive of proptech company Reapit, also predicted a continuation of the current subdued performance. “Transactions have been flat for the past three years, and caution is likely to remain whilst Brexit remains unfinished. Furthermore, if Brexit stalls, or more significant uncertainty over the government develops, it will be a painful road ahead,” he said. Mr Barker said that there could be room for optimism: “We are seeing house price reduction in some areas, which could make property more affordable and also boost the economy by increasing spending power and buying capacity. “If the Brexit deal passes through parliament, we could potentially see a much more confident market, resulting in more transactions, fewer withdrawals, and increased prices.”However, he added: “If the Bank of England’s forecast of a 30 per cent drop in house prices comes to fruition following a no-deal Brexit, the balance of the market will shift dramatically. “Although transactions may reduce significantly, with depressed prices discouraging sellers from listing their properties, low prices will put buyers back in control. First-time buyers, in particular, could benefit from slashed prices, giving them a leg-up onto the property ladder.”Additional reporting by newswiresShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Instagram unfortunately doesn’t let you tinker with filters and effects, but you can change your original caption, tag people and update the location.  The site finds out which of your posts received the most likes, assembling them into a collage of nine pictures. You can then opt to share it to your Instagram – or do whatever else you like, such as sending it directly to your friends or uploading it to your story.Instagram finally lets people choose who sees storiesThe feature might take a while to compile your picture and so asks for an email address so that it can notify you of when your best nine is ready. While its privacy policy allows it to use that email for marketing, it does allow you to opt out – but if you\u0027re anxious about it, it might be worth quickly setting up a disposable email account just to make sure your address stays safe.That website – unlike some other, more questionable tools – doesn\u0027t require that you give it your login or the ability to access your account, since all the data that it needs to make the collage is public anyway. Since there are safe tools like that around, make sure not to use one that requires you to give any account information at all, since it is unnecessary and can put you at risk of having your profile used maliciously or even hacked.But for the same reason, the tool will only work for public profiles. Since it works by scraping the information from your profile, if you\u0027ve locked it down you won\u0027t be able to see the results.One option is simply to switch very quickly to a public profile, make your collage, and then switch back. As long as you do it quickly then it is unlikely anyone will notice.Another option is to make your own best nine, by picking through your photos and then arranging them into a collage using Instagram\u0027s own Layout app. That has the advantage of allowing you to choose any photos you wish you were included but aren\u0027t – but the downside of having to pick manually through what might be hundreds of photos.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

But, argue\u0026nbspJohn Curtice\u0026nbspand his co-authors in a new book edited by Philip Cowley and Denis Kavanagh, the real Brexit referendum actually happened a year laterClick to followThe IndependentThe social geography of the 2017 general election was shaped by attitudes towards BrexitIf voters agreed with the prime minister that the 2017 general election was about Brexit, then – given that her vision of Britain’s future relationship with the EU was widely regarded as representing a “hard” Brexit (prioritising control of immigration over continued membership of the EU single market) – we might expect her party to have advanced more strongly in places where the previous year a relatively high proportion had voted to leave the EU.Our analysis suggests this is precisely what happened. The higher the estimated vote for Leave in 2016, the more the Conservative vote increased, while support for the party actually fell back on average in places where Leave failed to secure at least 45 per cent of the vote.\u0026nbspThe link between Labour’s performance and the strength of the Leave vote in 2016 is much weaker, a finding that might be thought to reflect the party’s relatively ambiguous position on Brexit.How Europe became the funeral pyre for Tory leadersThere was only a three-point difference between the increase in the Labour vote in places where 60 per cent or more voted to Leave and the equivalent figure for constituencies where less than 45 per cent voted to Leave – far less than the corresponding difference of 12 points in the Conservative performance.Even so, between them these two patterns are sufficiently strong that in seats where more than 60 per cent voted to Leave, there was on average a net (total vote) swing of 0.8 per cent from Labour to the Conservatives, even though everywhere else in England and Wales Labour’s vote increased more than that of the Conservatives.Where did the Ukip vote go?A key reason why the link between the Conservative performance and the strength of the Leave vote is much stronger than that for Labour lies in the impact on the two parties’ performances of the collapse in the Ukip vote.Ukip’s share of the vote in the 2015 election was much larger in areas where Leave did well in the referendum. The decline in Ukip support two years later was almost invariably greatest where the party had previously been strongest. If those who voted Ukip in 2015 (nearly all of whom voted to Leave in 2016) were now particularly inclined to switch to the Conservatives, this could have served to boost the Conservative performance in constituencies that voted heavily to Leave.Indeed, while Labour\u0026nbspappears to have won some of the voters that Ukip lost, the Conservatives apparently gained many more.Ukip in 2017 was almost invariably greatest in areas where the party had been strongest before (Getty)Nevertheless, the collapse in Ukip support is far from being the whole explanation for the strong Conservative performance in areas keenest on leaving the EU. Even when we take into account how heavily Ukip support fell, the Conservatives still performed better where the Leave vote was stronger in 2016.Where did Remain and Leave voters go? The Conservative Party did not do well in places where Leave was strong in 2016 only because of the pattern of switching among\u0026nbspformer Ukip voters rather, Leave voters more generally seem to have been drawn into voting Conservative at this election, while Remain voters tilted towards Labour.Support for Ukip in 2015 and for Leave in 2016 varied substantially by age and educational background. Both were particularly popular with older people and those with few or no formal educational qualifications, while younger people and graduates tended to shun Ukip and vote Remain. This pattern was reflected in the Conservative and Labour votes in 2017.Created with Sketch.EU referendum - in pictures Show all 18Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A woman in a wheelchair with British and European Union flags shows her support for the United Kingdom to remain in the European Union on the day of the EU Referendum in GibraltarA polling station being used in the EU referendum at Batley Town Hall in the constituency Labour MP Jo CoxPeople arrive to vote in the EU Referendum at the Library where British MP Jo Cox was shot and fatally wounded last week in BirstallA man arrives to vote at a polling station for the Referendum on the European Union in north LondonVoters queue to enter a polling station at Trinity Church in Golders Green in LondonBritish Prime Minister David Cameron and his wife Samantha Cameron leave after voting in the EU Referendum at Central Methodist Hall, Westminster Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn cast his vote at a polling station at Pakeman Primary School in IslingtonChelsea pensioners arrive at a polling station near to the Royal Chelsea HospitalA woman wearing an I\u0027m In t-shirt, promoting the official Remain campaign, leaves a polling station in LondonPeople queuing outside a polling station on Amott Road in LondonScotland\u0027s First Minister and Leader of the Scottish National Party (SNP), Nicola Sturgeon and her husband Peter Murrell, react as leave after casting their votes at a polling station at Broomhouse Community Hall in east GlasgowA man wearing a European themed cycling jersey leaves after voting at a polling station for the Referendum on the European Union in north LondonUkip leader Nigel Farage arrives to cast his vote at Cudham Church of England Primary School in Biggin Hill, KentJustice Secretary and prominent \u0027Vote Leave\u0027 campaigner Michael Gove poses with his wife Sarah Vine after voting in the European Union referendum at their local polling station in KensingtonNuns leave a polling station after voting in the EU Referendum in LondonPeople arrive to cast their ballots in the EU Referendum in Gibraltar.

There is a corresponding, though much weaker tendency in the opposite direction for Labour. At the same time, the Conservatives performed less well and Labour better in seats with more young adults – though once we take this into account, there is no indication, despite the prominence given to Labour’s manifesto promise to scrap tuition fees for students at English universities, that constituencies with large numbers of students were particularly likely to swing towards the party.The social geography of Conservative and Labour performance at this election was primarily, albeit not entirely, a consequence of the role played by attitudes towards Brexit in shaping how people voted.What about the economy?Traditionally, the state of the economy has played a central role in how people vote. In 2015, for example, the Conservatives clearly performed worse where unemployment was highest or had increased most, and where household incomes were relatively low. At this election, however, if anything the opposite was the case.Revolutionary study into voter \u0027clans\u0027 holds key to 2022 electionThe worse local economic circumstances were, the better the Conservatives did and the worse Labour did. For instance, Conservative support increased on average by 5.8 points where the constituency unemployment rate increased between 2015 and 2017, compared with 4.9 points where it fell. The equivalent figures for Labour were 9.8 points and 10.4 points respectively. Moreover, despite a continued squeeze on public spending and a promise from the Conservatives of more austerity to come that could mean cuts in public sector jobs, there was, in contrast to 2015, no particular relationship between Conservative or Labour performance and the local prevalence of public sector employees.Did the antisemitism row hurt Labour?Not that the focus on Brexit meant that nothing else mattered. Jeremy Corbyn’s views on the Middle East have attracted particular controversy, with critics accusing the Labour leader of being too sympathetic to iniduals and groups opposed to Israel, including some widely regarded as extremist. There were related accusations that, under Corbyn’s leadership, the Labour Party had dealt inadequately with allegations that some party members have made antisemitic statements. These issues appear to have made a difference. On average Labour’s vote increased by 11.6 points in constituencies where more than 4 per cent are Muslim, compared with an average increase of 9.6 points elsewhere in England and Wales. This difference is not accounted for by the tendency of the Leave vote to be lower in seats with more Muslims. Meanwhile, and by contrast, the Labour vote only rose by 8.8 points on average across the 10 constituencies with the largest Jewish populations, even though seven of these 10 seats are in London, where Labour generally performed relatively well.Did social class drive the voting?However, the fallout from the EU referendum was most important in shaping the geography of Conservative and Labour performance. In so doing, the contest served to reduce some of the traditional isions in British elections. For example, although working-class voters had traditionally been the bedrock of Labour support, they had also been more likely to vote Leave and to vote for Ukip. Thus, thanks to its gains among such voters, at this election Conservative support increased by as much as 9.4 points in seats where more than 13 per cent are engaged in a routine manual occupation, compared with just 1.3 points where fewer than 10 per cent have a routine job. Conversely, Labour’s support increased by just 9.1 points in relatively working-class seats, but by 10.7 points where relatively few have a routine job.\u0026nbspWhat happened to the northsouth ide?Equally, the northsouth ide in Britain’s electoral geography also narrowed somewhat, the first time it has done so since 1997. A relatively weak Conservative performance and a relatively strong Labour performance across the largely more pro-Remain south of England\u0026nbspmeant that on average there was as much as a 3.9 point swing from Conservative to Labour there.In contrast, the swing to Labour was only 1.3 in the north of England and 0.7\u0026nbspin the heavily pro-Leave Midlands. One striking consequence of this ergence is that Conservative support is now higher in the Midlands than in the south of England, not least, but also not solely, because pro-Remain and ethnically erse London has now become something of a Labour citadel.Paxman returned to Newsnight to interrogate May and Corbyn (Getty)Despite initial appearances, therefore, this clearly was not an election that heralded a return to the familiar patterns of two-party politics.Do constituency boundaries hold the key?But what about the notion that the makeup of parliament is as much to do with the way constituency boundaries have been drawn as anything else? That question is particularly topical, given current proposals for boundary reform. \u0026nbspThe present constituency boundaries are biased against the Conservatives, but this is compensated for by the more efficient distribution of their vote.Surprising though the failure of the Conservatives to win an overall majority last year might have seemed, was the tally of seats won by each party significantly different from what we might have anticipated given the shares of the vote each of them secured?\u0026nbspThe traditional way of addressing this question has been to compare the actual outcome in seats with what would have happened if in every constituency each party’s share of the vote had increased or fallen in line with the change in its overall share of the vote across Britain as a whole – that is, uniform change.However, applying this method becomes difficult when, as happened in 2015 and again in 2017, there is a substantial change in the level of support for a party, such as the SNP, that only fights elections in one part of the country but wins plenty of seats there. In these circumstances the change in that party’s share of the Britain-wide vote will inevitably be but a pale reflection of the actual rise or fall in its support in the part of the UK where it stood.It is therefore better to use as our initial benchmark what would have happened if support for all of the main Britain-wide parties had increased or fallen in every constituency in England and Wales in line with the overall change in their support in those two parts of the UK combined. For each seat in Scotland, meanwhile, we calculate what would have happened if the rise or fall in each party’s support had been in line with the change in its share of the Scotland-wide total.On the basis of these assumptions, the Conservatives would have won 323 seats (instead of 318), Labour 259 (262), the SNP 37 (35), the Liberal Democrat nine (12), Plaid Cymru three (four) and the Greens one (one), while, of course, there would be 18 other MPs from Northern Ireland. None of these figures are\u0026nbspvery different from what actually transpired and, above all, the Conservatives would still have failed to secure an overall majority – albeit they would have been only three rather than eight seats short.What about Scotland?That projected Conservative tally includes 11 seats in Scotland. However, if the increase in the Conservative vote north of the border had been in line with the lower increase in England and Wales – and the fall in SNP support had not happened – the Conservatives would have won only two Scottish seats. Thus, in the absence of the distinctive outcome in Scotland, the Conservatives would have won only 314 seats. To that extent, the distinctive result in Scotland proved to be crucial to the arithmetic of the new House of Commons.SNP only fights elections in one part of the country but wins plenty of seats there (Getty)What were the other factors?However, although the overall tally of seats for each party was more or less in line with what might have been expected given the changes in their overall shares of the vote, there were lots of seats where the outcome was at variance with what would have happened if the movements in party support had been the same everywhere.What if Nick Clegg had gone into coalition with Labour in 2010?No fewer than 36 seats changed hands that would not have done so under those circumstances, while 16 constituencies were held against the tide. Most of these outcomes can in fact be accounted for by one or other of the systematic patterns of variation our analysis has identified, including the tendency for the Conservatives to perform better in seats with a relatively large Leave vote and Labour to do likewise in seats where Remain polled relatively well, the Conservatives’ ability on occasion to squeeze the other unionist parties in Scotland, and the willingness of some of those who might otherwise have voted Labour to make a tactical switch to the (pro-Remain) Liberal Democrats. In short, much of the significant variation in party performance was linked in some way or other to the fallout from either the 2016 EU referendum or the 2014 Scottish independence referendum.Dem leader Tim Farron narrowly retained his seat with 8.4 per cent swing to the Tories (Getty)This still leaves us with the observation that for the third time in a row, the electoral system failed to deliver the winning party a substantial overall majority (and, indeed, on two occasions any majority at all).The system’s ability to generate safe overall majorities has long been regarded as a hallmark of the single member plurality system (often referred to as “first past the post”) and the resulting clarity of the link between the outcome of an election and who forms the government is often cited as a major justification for its continued use.It might be thought the explanation is that, at 2.5 points, the Conservative lead over Labour in terms of votes across Great Britain as a whole was a relatively narrow one. It was certainly much narrower than the seven point leads that the Conservatives enjoyed in 2010 and 2015. Yet it was larger than the leads (in Great Britain) that the Conservatives enjoyed in 1955 (1.9 points) and 1970 (2.3 points) or Labour did in 1964 (1.9 points), yet those three contests all resulted in an overall majority, including in two instances a relatively safe one.Historical precedent apparently suggests that the Conservative lead should have been sufficient to give the party an overall majority.What about variable constituency sizes?One consequence of the prime minister’s decision to secure a Commons vote for an early election is that the contest had to be fought on the same constituency boundaries as in 2015 and not on the new boundaries the various parliamentary boundary commissions were in the midst of preparing in readiness for an election in 2020.The resulting inequality in the sizes of constituencies was certainly a disadvantage for the Conservatives. The average electorate in constituencies they won at this election was 74,451, whereas in seats won by Labour it was 70,529. The difference of some 3,920 people was around 520 bigger than it had been two years previously.The gap may have been increased somewhat by the government’s decision in 2015 to speed up the introduction of inidual electoral registration, which resulted in particularly sharp drops in registration in some typically Labour-held constituencies with large numbers of students. But the gap was then narrowed somewhat by the applications to be added to the register many (and especially younger) voters made after its initial compilation in December 2016. These added 2,300 names on average to the register in constituencies that Labour won, compared with just 1,600 on average in seats won by the Conservatives.Did voter turnout make a difference?However, inequalities in the registered electorate are not the only consideration that we have to bear in mind in considering the sizes of constituencies. Bias might also arise if turnout is lower in seats held by one party than it is in those won by its opponents. Indeed, turnout was on average some four points lower on average in seats won by Labour at this election (66.5 per cent) than it was in those won by the Conservatives (70.7 per cent).\u0026nbspAFPGetty)That said, this was a noticeably smaller gap than in 2015, for turnout increased on average by 3.8 points in seats Labour won, but by only 2.0 points in those won by the Conservatives. As a result, at 5,675 votes, the difference between Conservative and Labour-held seats in terms of the total number of votes cast was actually smaller at this election than it had been in the same two sets of seats two years previously (6,541).To this we need to add one other consideration. The relative success of the Conservatives in seats with a relatively high Leave vote meant that the increase in the party’s vote was often greater in more working-class seats outside of London and the south of England, whose populations have grown less rapidly and thus tend to have lower than average electorates.For example, Conservative support increased on average by as much as 7.3 points in seats in which fewer than 72,000 people were registered to vote, compared with just 4.3 points where more than 77,000 names appeared on the register. Similarly, while the Conservative vote increased on average by 9.7 points where turnout was less than 65 per cent, it increased by just 3.2 points where turnout was above 71 per cent. As a result, there was a noticeable reduction in the extent to which the Conservative vote was concentrated in constituencies where more people turned out to vote.Created with Sketch.

The Labour Party was ahead of the Conservatives by more than 40 points in 27 per cent of seats that it won, while the Conservative Party was that far ahead of Labour in just 12 per cent of the constituencies that it won.\u0026nbspIn short, whatever disadvantage the Conservatives suffered as a result of inequalities in the sizes of constituencies tended to be compensated by them having a more efficiently distributed vote.John\u0026nbspCurtice, Strathclyde University, Stephen Fisher, Trinity College, Oxford, and Robert Ford and Patrick English, University of Manchester, are authors of The Results Analysed, in ‘The British General Election of 2017’, edited by Philip Cowley and Dennis\u0026nbspKavanagh, from which this article is extractedShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Back then in 2000, she wasn’t yet one of the great icons of popular culture. All I knew about her was the publicity cliché of her being a single mother made good. It was the same tired story repeated constantly about her.\u0026nbspSo I ignored all that and started her journey at the beginning in the villages near Bristol where she grew up.I discovered she was childhood friends with the Potter family who had lived in the same street and I spoke to them about childhood dressing-up games and Jo Rowling’s vivid imagination. I remember Mrs Potter telling me that Jo always had a big aversion to spiders. It’s no surprise that spiders the size of carthorses feature in her books.Six male celebrities changing the conversation around masculinityIt’s a bit like playing detective but you’re not investigating a crime. Start at the beginning and follow the journey imagine you are celebrating a life and chat to those who have known, liked or loved the famous person you are writing about.I moved on to Oporto in Portugal where Jo taught English as a foreign language to local students. I met her best Portuguese friend who worked with her at the school. She invited me to a family party at a restaurant where all these delicious dishes kept on appearing throughout the night the children ran around playing games and we drank wine and talked. It was a perfect evening. She told me the story of how she helped Jo extricate herself from her unhappy first marriage to a local man and return hastily to the UK with her young daughter. She also told me at the time she thought Jo was a nervous person, anxious and flitting around like a butterfly.Rowling\u0026nbspto Oporto in Portugal, where she was married to a local man and teaching English as a foreign language (AFPGetty)Through the eyes of the people I spoke to, I was able to build a picture of a real person – not one created by a publicity department. People like to talk if given the chance. I realised that when I was responsible for reporting golden and diamond wedding anniversaries on a weekly newspaper. That may sound boring but I loved it – the chance to hear about people’s lives while having a cup of tea and piece of homemade fruit cake. But you can’t pretend to be interested. That’s impossible to fake. My philosophy is simple: the most disrespectful thing you can do to another person is to have no interest in them.\u0026nbspWe live in an online world where the art of proper conversation is disappearing.

I asked the guy on the till if he had ever come across her. ‘She used to work here,’ he said and proceeded to tell me all about it. He made me laugh because he wasn’t so impressed with Jennifer, who, after all, was still a shop assistant in his eyes. But his eyes lit up when he told me that Sophia Loren had once been in his store.I met with Jennifer’s school drama teacher Anthony Abeson in New York and went along to one of his classes. He had great enthusiasm for Jennifer as an actress. He told me about the time at the Fame School where his pupils had to prepare a scene for performance in front of class and she chose a particularly difficult one from The Three Sisters by Chekhov. It was meant to be very dramatic but everyone laughed. She was mortified. Afterwards, Anthony took her aside and told her she had a wonderful gift and it was marvellous that she had this ability to amuse. His words were life changing for her.\u0026nbspI was in McComb, Mississippi, which is where Britney Spears went to school. I was given an address for her first boyfriend about 10\u0026nbspmiles out of town so I drove out but there was no one there. There were no other houses. Nothing –\u0026nbspa\u0026nbspdead end. As I was leaving, a car pulled up. It was his mother, who was a charming woman. She\u0026nbspinvited me into her amazing mansion for coffee. She was a very accomplished painter and showed me her work. She rang up her son and he agreed to speak to me.He was great company and took me to a barbecue in the Mississippi woods. We chatted and drank beer and threw golf balls into the woods for his dog to fetch. He told me he once took Britney turkey hunting but she had to give up when she was bitten to hell by mosquitoes. This is a long way from Las Vegas and when night falls you can hear the coyotes – it’s a scary place. Britney didn’t like the nights in the woods and would get upset and have to be taken home. I don’t blame her.One of the myths about Britney is that she is some sort of trailer trash from the Deep South. This is nonsense. She went to a private school, where, incidentally, she was taught creationismOne of the myths about Britney is that she is some sort of trailer trash from the Deep South. This is nonsense. She went to a private school, where, incidentally, she was taught creationism. She had private dancing lessons. Her teenage boyfriend’s house had an elevator between floors. Money was tight when her dad’s building firm collapsed but she was brought up as a nice little girl. I remember speaking to her teacher at the Disney School in Orlando, Florida, when she was under contract to Disney. He told me that she was ‘the most wholesome, huggable little girl that you would ever want to see’. This is the real Britney Spears.\u0026nbspBritney used to date Justin Timberlake, who I also wrote about. I flew into Memphis, where I thought he was from, only to discover he was actually brought up 20\u0026nbspmiles away in the comfortable middle-class community of Shelby Forest, on the outskirts of the town of Millington.\u0026nbspOn my first day there I went into the local Millington library and asked loudly, ‘Does anyone here know Justin Timberlake?’ A woman piped up:\u0026nbsp‘My daughter was in his class at school.’ She put me in touch with her daughter and we had a lovely lunch and she told me about growing up in Shelby Forest.Apparently Justin was a Maths geek at school and was in the algebra club. She also recalled the school’s Christmas concert when the power failed. The enormous school gym was packed with bewildered parents and children sitting in complete darkness. Suddenly a voice launched forth from the gloom. It was Justin, aged 11, singing ‘O Holy Night’, unaccompanied. My lunch companion remembered, ‘The whole gym was in tears.’The most interesting thing about Rob, however, was learning that he\u0026nbspwasn’t entirely Jack the Lad. \u0026nbspHe\u0026nbsppreferred to take part in\u0026nbsppanto\u0026nbspthan kick a ball around in the parkI also had lunch with Justin’s delightful first girlfriend, who was looking forward to her wedding to a local doctor. She told me about the time she and Justin had decided to make love for the first time. They needed to buy condoms but that was tricky because Justin’s stepmum was the local pharmacist. In the end they had to catch the bus into Memphis to purchase a pack of three. Danielle’s pet name for Justin was ‘Stud Muffin’, a dream nickname for any teenage boy.\u0026nbspI love being able to share interesting new things about people we admire and care about. Take Robbie Williams for example. I had a great time in Stoke on Trent drinking with his old school buddies. They called him Rob – he wasn’t Robbie until Take That’s manager decided to call him that for his image. Rob and his friends were rascals. They used to ring up random numbers and tell jokes on the answer machine until the tape ran out.\u0026nbspThe most interesting thing about Rob, however, was learning that he wasn’t entirely Jack the Lad. He was a\u0026nbsprather a sensitive boy and a highly talented one who preferred to take part in panto than kick a ball around in the park. His father, a professional comedian, left home when he was a youngster and it had a profound effect on him.Why some people don\u0027t celebrate ThanksgivingAutistic boy writes letter to Anne Hegerty calling her an inspirationYoung people more inspired by grandparents than celebrities, pollI learnt much of his true nature from a wonderful woman called Zoe who was his closest friend in amateur dramatics for 10\u0026nbspyears. They were inseparable. They were in Chittty Chitty Bang Bang, Annie, Pickwick and Oliver together. In Oliver he was the Artful Dodger. On the opening night, Zoe knew something was wrong. He was singing ‘Consider Yourself’ and he just wasn’t himself. Off stage she could see he was upset, so put her arm around him and asked him what was wrong. He told her:\u0026nbsp‘I just started my first lines and I look up and there is my effing old man in the front row.’ He started crying but he went back out and gave the performance of his young life for his Dad.\u0026nbspI really warmed to Robbie. \u0026nbspI don’t write about celebrities. It’s a meaningless word these days, isn’t it? Celebrity used to mean something when we idolised proper stars such as\u0026nbspMarilyn Monroe, Audrey Hepburn or Elvis.\u0026nbsp Now, everybody is a celebrity who has been on television for two seconds. I write about the most famous people in the world: Adele, Cheryl, Kate Middleton and my latest subject, Ed Sheeran.But, more than that, I write about real people. When I was looking at the amazing life of Adele, I went into the flower shop in South London where she used to buy flowers for her mum and the young assistant in there said to me:\u0026nbsp‘I love Adele. She keeps it real.’\u0026nbspGeorge Michael, who I wrote about following his very sad death, is an example of someone who the world\u0026nbspdidn’t really know during his lifetime. He was poorly treated by the media while he was alive. He turned out to be a thoroughly decent man, a good man. But he\u0026nbspwasn’t George Michael until he was 18. He was\u0026nbspGeorgios Panayiotou, a Greek Cypriot boy.I interviewed his girlfriends from school and they were so warm about him. It was a joy. first girlfriend told me the story of how at her 16th birthday party, Yog, as she called him, turned up at her parents’ house with Andy – Andrew Ridgeley. It was a great night and later in the evening she looked out of the window into the garden to see the two future superstars of Wham! peeing into the fishpond.Ed Sheeran by Sean Smith is published by HarperCollins and is out now.\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

At this biennial event, the participating companies exhibit their latest service robotic technologies and componentsThe robot developed by Seed Solutions sings and dances to music during the Japan Robot Week 2016 at Tokyo Big SightThe issue appears to have been with a piece of software, provided by Ericsson, which is relied on not just by O2 but by other companies that experienced problems, such as Japan’s Softbank.Börje Ekholm, president and chief executive of Ericsson, said: “The faulty software that has caused these issues is being decommissioned and we apologise not only to our customers but also to their customers. We work hard to ensure that our customers can limit the impact and restore their services as soon as possible.”Ericsson says O2 data will be coming back ‘as soon as possible’The company said most of its affected customers had got back online, but that some – presumably including Tesco – were still not working, and that it was continuing to work with them.On Thursday evening, O2’s\u0026nbspchief executive said\u0026nbsphe was “sorry because we have let our customers down”.\u0026nbspMark Evans told Sky News restoration of the network had started and it would be completed by Friday morning.\u0026nbspPressed\u0026nbspby Sky News host\u0026nbspDermot Murnaghan\u0026nbspif the company would compensate customers, Mr Evans would only say it would “find a way of making an apology in an O2 way”.\u0026nbspMr Evans admitted, however,\u0026nbsphe did “not know yet” what “an O2 way” meant.The problems with the service provide\u0026nbsphave hit as many as 30 million people in the UK, affecting not only O2 customers but users of the networks that borrow their infrastructure, such as Tesco\u0026nbspMobile and GiffGaff.It also hit transport networks and other systems that rely on O2’s\u0026nbspinternet connections to transfer data.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

They will be informed about when that is available.O2 data network restored after millions hit by day-long outageAnd pay as you go customers on O2\u0027s mobile broadband will also be given a 10 per cent discount on a Bolt On purchase in the new year.All of O2\u0027s\u0026nbsp30 million customers are thought to have been hit by the outage, and so will be receiving the free package.Customers do not appear to need to do anything to get the refund, and will either be contacted to alert them to it or will just receive the additional airtime added to their bill.It is not clear whether customers of the networks that were also offline because they rely on O2\u0027s infrastructure – such as GiffGaff\u0026nbspand Tesco\u0026nbspMobile – will also be getting refunds from their carriers.The outage caused problems across the UK, including in some unusual places, such as live bus arrivals at bus stops, which rely on O2\u0027s\u0026nbspdata connection.It lasted for almost a full day, going down early in the morning and with service only being restored overnight the following evening.O2 said the issues were caused by problems with software provided by Ericsson. It also caused problems elsewhere in the world, such as at Japan\u0027s Softbank.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The oil producing nations had been expected to agree to a reduction in production on Thursday at its meeting in Vienna. Reaching a deal proved difficult as sanctions-hit Iran refused to comply with the output cuts, despite the input of non-Opec member Russia.

However, a second day of talks led to an agreement, providing a boost to the price of Brent crude which rose to $63.25 by mid-afternoon on Friday. Qatar to quit Opec in 2019 amid angry dispute with Saudi ArabiaWhat is OPEC and why has Qatar left its ranks?Trump hits out at OPEC and says oil prices are artificially very highWhy Opec is caught between a rock and a hard placeBarani Krishnan, senior analyst at Investing, said it was natural that oil traders would react as positively to Opec’s decision to cut production as they did negatively “when the group seemed powerless to reduce even a barrel”. He added: “However, the market will also be watching for any signs of cheating by OPEC and punish the cartel accordingly.”Mr Krishnan said the bigger takeaway is “what the Saudi energy minister would possibly have on his mind as he leaves Vienna today a Russia that has become as powerful to Opec as Riyadh and a US that is now a net exporter of oil”.Furthermore, we\u0027ve not even gotten to the Khashoggi fallout and likely Trump dismay over these cuts,” he added. “One can only speculate at this point to how this will play out for the Saudis and their oil business going forward.Donald Trump had called on Opec to leave production unfettered in order to weigh prices down, tweeting ahead of the Vienna meeting: “The world does not want to see… higher oil prices”. Meanwhile, Ashley Kelty, oil \u0026amp gas research analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald Europe, said that although cutting output by 1.2 million barrels per day was a larger reduction than some had expected, it was still short of “what is really required to bring the market back into balance”. She said: “Our initial snap judgement is that prices will stabilise in the $60-65 per barrel range, as the cuts are likely to be insufficient to stem the near term supply glut, given US output is continuing to \u0026nbsprise (albeit at a slower pace due to capacity constraints).“It feels like a bit of a fudge, and the absence of the final communique at this late stage suggests that a lot of horse trading has been underway to reach a situation that tries to appeal to all parties, whilst ending up with a situation that will appease no-one.”Earlier this week, Qatar quit Opec, however, it still attended the meeting in Vienna.

Guards can also offer advice and assistance to passengers and help disabled passengers to embark and disembark.RMT general secretary Mick Cash said: “South Western Railway continues to refuse to resolving this dispute, which is about safety, security and access while the company look to open up a loophole that would allow them to run driver-only services at their discretion.South Western Rail staff to strike this Saturday“Recent figures have shown a shocking a surge in violence on our railways. It is frankly appalling that South Western Railway are looking for a green light to throw the guard off their trains as and when they see fit in the name of profit.“SWR might think it’s acceptable to play fast and loose with passenger safety, security and access but RMT members, who have stood firm throughout this dispute despite appalling harassment from the company, will not accept a dilution of the safety regime on the railway.“There’s a simple solution to this dispute and it means SWR stop playing with words and negotiate the guard guarantee that reflects the safety values of the agreements RMT has pinned down in other parts of the rail industry.“A South Western Rail spokesperson told The Independent:​\u0026nbsp“By targeting the last Saturday before Christmas when people are trying to travel to be with family and friends the RMT is ensuring the maximum misery is inflicted at what should be a time of relaxation and enjoyment.\u0026nbsp“This action is totally unnecessary. We have guaranteed to roster a guard on every train, and we need more, not fewer guards – 70 more by May 2019 – and we have an opportunity with the introduction of the new suburban trains to operate these trains differently to maximise the customer benefits.\u0026nbsp“The RMT is scaremongering by using crime in its statement. The number of crimes on the SWR network has reduced by nearly 6 per cent\u0026nbspsince April. SWR’s team of 35 Rail Community Officers work on trains and at stations to prevent and detect crimes.

Tory MPs don’t like it because we can’t get out of it except by signing a permanent trade deal that guarantees the same thing. Even Jeremy Corbyn has criticised it because we have no way out of it except with the agreement of the EU.\u0026nbspNow she could tell her MPs that avoiding a hard border in Ireland is something to which the UK should be committed anyway. But a lot of them don’t agree. They think it would be a price worth paying for a “real” Brexit – although they tend to argue in public that a hard border could be managed by technology so no one would notice it.\u0026nbspSo, instead, Theresa May is telling her rebels that they can have a veto over the backstop, should it ever be needed.\u0026nbspTheresa May’s backstop veto plan ‘would rip up withdrawal agreement’This is spin. She has written into the withdrawal agreement a choice at the end of the transition period, the end of 2020. If the long-term trade deal with the EU has not been negotiated by then, and it seems likely that it would not have been, the UK would then face a choice between the backstop or a one-off extension to the transition period. It would be inconceivable that any government would make that decision without consulting parliament, so May’s “offer” is no more than a statement of the obvious.\u0026nbspAnd it does not get round the fact that the backstop will still be the fallback option. If, in 2020, the UK opts to extend the transition period, at most by two years to the end of 2022, and if when that expires there is still no long-term trade deal, then the backstop will come into effect anyway.\u0026nbspThe only way out of it would be for the UK to repudiate the withdrawal agreement. This is an international treaty and we have a sovereign right as a nation to pull out of any treaty, but that would have serious consequences. Any country that goes around binning international agreements would become, in effect, a rogue state, and other countries will be wary of signing new deals with it. If we did that, it would not be possible to negotiate any kind of trade deal with the EU.\u0026nbspThis was what many journalists and Brussels officials thought the prime minister meant by her offer: she would be giving MPs the chance to repudiate an agreement to which they had just agreed. That is the trouble with spin. If you are trying to pretend something is what it is not, people might assume you mean something else altogether.Created with Sketch.Brexit threatens life on the Irish border: in pictures Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.John Murphy flies the European flag outside his home near the border village of Forkhill, Co ArmaghAn abandoned shop is seen in Mullan, Co Monaghan.

Whether the UK had this power or not has been disputed, and campaigners had asked judges to rule.This isn’t a final legal ruling by the court, but judges usually endorse what the advocate general suggests. We should find out if this recommendation is confirmed within the coming weeks, with 17 December one date that is being talked about in Brussels.\u0026nbspIf it is confirmed, an accidental no-deal Brexit is effectively taken off the table – the government would be able to stop it in all circumstances if it wanted to.\u0026nbspThis is significant because the government’s main argument to remainer MPs to get them to support Theresa May’s deal has been that if they don’t, a disastrous no-deal Brexit could happen without anyone wanting it to. In one respect, the decision makes it harder for May’s deal to pass, because she won\u0027t be able to scare them into backing it.Meanwhile, in WestminsterAs the news from the Luxembourg court broke in the morning , MPs were settling in for a big day in Westminster. By the time they went home for the night, the Government had been defeated in three votes – a record bad day for Theresa May’s minority administration.One of these votes was about whether the Government was in contempt of parliament for refusing to release its legal advice about its Brexit deal. MPs decided that ministers were indeed in contempt – effectively forcing the government to release the legal advice. This is significant because the advice is expected to provide more ammunition for opponents of the deal, especially Brexiteers.But another vote lost by the government will likely have even bigger implications. MPs – including 26 Tory rebels – voted to give parliament more power if Theresa May’s deal is voted down.If the deal is voted down next Tuesday the Government has 21 days to come back to Parliament and lay its plan for what happens next. But under the successful amendment tabled by Tory Remainer Dominic Grieve, the Commons will also be able to vote on what it wants the Government to do. Though that vote wouldn’t technically be binding, it would be politically incredible for the Government to ignore it.\u0026nbspTaken together with the likely ECJ ruling that the UK has the power to stop Brexit if it wants, MPs would be expected to take no-deal off the table. They might also call for a so-called ‘plan B’ – a call for Theresa May to go back to Brussels and negotiate a different deal. Whether that would be successful is another matter.So what are the implications for Brexit?The overall effect of the events of Tuesday 4 December are to make a no-deal Brexit significantly less likely. Nobody thinks there is a majority of MPs in favour of a no-deal, and they will now control the Government’s response to its deal being defeated.\u0026nbspIf the ECJ decides that the UK does have the unilateral power to revoke Brexit, then no-deal is effectively off the table. But even if it doesn’t it’s unlikely member states would stand in the way and push Britain off the cliff.In one sense, the deal is also less likely to pass because of what happened: Remainers were being encouraged to vote for it on the basis that a no-deal might happen.\u0026nbspBut in a strange way, the deal might win more support – if Brexiteers decide that the defeat of the deal might mean Brexit not happening at all, they could swing behind it. A large number have already publicly said they will vote against it, however – so whether that will be enough remains to be seen.Is that everything that happened?No, that’s just the main thread. Plenty more happened that would have been big news on any other day.\u0026nbspNigel Farage also announced he was leaving Ukip – the party he has long been synonymous with – because of its increasing closeness to far-right activist Tommy Robinson.\u0026nbspThe BBC dropped out of plans to host a debate on Brexit between Jeremy Corbyn and Theresa May after the three sides couldn’t agree on a format.The Pound fell to an 18-month low after the Government lost the contempt vote, but then rebounded.\u0026nbspMeanwhile, former Bank of England governor Mervyn King wrote an article in which he likened Theresa May’s Brexit deal to the appeasement of the Nazis. All in a day’s work!\u0026nbspThe Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The key issue that we’re\u0026nbspsaying\u0026nbsptoday, and that’s why we’re delivering a petition signed by a million people in this country, is that those choices are ones that should be made by the British people.“Parliament is gridlocked ... This is no way to decide the most fundamental question facing Britain for the next 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 years.“It is time that we now put the clear choices to the British people and allow them to decide.”Thornberry contradicts Jeremy Corbyn and insists Labour could still back Final Say Brexit referendumThe two documents were handed in to officials at 11am by Ms Greening, politicians from three other parties and The Independent‘s editor Christian Broughton.\u0026nbspLabour’s\u0026nbspChuka Umunna, a champion of the People’s Vote campaign, said: “The biggest issue that we’ve had since the Second World War is being left to MPs. And the problem we have with MPs\u0026nbspin parliament, is\u0026nbspthat they can’t come to a view of what should happen in this situation.“The bottom line is how else are you going to resolve impasse in Westminster if not by referring it back to the people. I don’t know anyone who has come up with a viable alternative.”\u0026nbspLiberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable said the “let’s-just-get-on-with-it”\u0026nbspattitude is a “fallacy”, because “even if we accept the government’s deal we’re not just getting on with it”.“We’ll be spending years in negotiation of what kind of arrangement we’d want with the European Union – the problem isn’t going to go away,” he said.The prime minister has repeatedly said that she will not countenance a further referendum on Brexit. But with no option carrying a majority in the Commons, a new vote has become\u0026nbspa more likely way to break the political deadlock.\u0026nbspReferring to calls for a new referendum on Monday, Ms May said: “People are talking about a second vote when we haven’t even delivered on the first vote.“I think we need to deliver on the first vote. We asked people to vote. We said ‘please decide whether we should leave or remain’.“People voted to leave and I think there’s a, sort of, democratic duty on us as politicians, having had that referendum, and having said it is your choice, to actually deliver on it. So, let’s deliver on the first vote.”Created with Sketch.Brexit march for a final say – in pictures Show all 65Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Red smoke from a canister hangs in the air as around 100,000 demonstrators march through London during a People\u0027s Vote anti-brexit demonstration savings banners and placardsMayor of London Sadiq Khan takes part in the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.MP Chuka Umunna (left) and MP Vince Cable (right) as MP Anna Soubry (centre) addresses Anti-Brexit campaigners at a rally after the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.

In recent days she has outlined how her proposals will deliver on the\u0026nbsppublic’s desire to end EU free movement.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

It is governing on a left-wing platform with ad hoc support from the Left Bloc, the Greens, and Portuguese Communist Party.“I want to pay tribute to the Portuguese left as a whole, the Portuguese Socialist Party and the parties supporting it in government,” Mr Corbyn told the Party of European Socialists congress.Jeremy Corbyn suggests new referendum could follow Brexit deal defeat“Because it has been that alliance of progressive forces in Portugal that made it possible to start to turn the tide of failed austerity economics.”Mr Corbyn added: “Inside or outside the European Union we are internationalists to our very core.\u0026nbsp“As socialists and trade unionists, we will work together to help build a real social Europe: a people’s Europe, a socialist Europe, that will strengthen solidarity across borders, resist the race to the bottom in rights and protections and work together to extend them for all workers, consumers and our environment.”The Labour leader has been the star attraction at conferences of European centre-left parties in recent years, speaking to packed halls at other international meetings in Belgium and the Netherlands.\u0026nbspJohn McDonnell dismisses union leader\u0027s opposition to new referendumLabour\u0027s Harriet Harman calls for female MPs to have global networkLabour to table no confidence motion if Brexit deal fallsLabour MP Lloyd Russell-Moyle reveals HIV diagnosis in the CommonsGrim GDP forecasts as Corbyn ally says new Brexit vote ‘inevitable’Labour’s surprise reversal of fortunes at the 2017 election and its increase in vote share was in sharp contrast to most other centre-left parties across the continent. Parties in Germany, the Netherlands, France, Greece, and Italy have plunged to historic lows, shedding voters – often to the far-right or populists. As a result, activists from around the continent looking for answers have been drawn to Labour to see if they can learn lessons.“The stakes could not be higher. If we cannot rise to the task, then we will smooth the path to power of the fake populists,” Mr Corbyn said.“The far-right feeds on fears fuelled by falling living standards, damaged communities, insecure work and underfunded public services.

It has said this “may include employer sponsorship, work permits, visa regulations or a tailored mix of all these”.Labour’s manifesto commits to balance government spending with the amount raised by taxation, which can mean little more than significant tax increases.

If the European political establishment carries on with business as usual, the fake populists of the far right will fill the vacuum.”The intervention in Lisbon comes after Mr Corbyn appeared to edge ever so slightly closer to backing a final say referendum on the Brexit deal. Writing in  newspaper on Friday he stressed his party’s position of keeping open “the option of campaigning for a public vote to break the deadlock”.Labour says it could negotiate a better future relationship than Theresa May that would scrap restrictions on state aid and give the UK say on trade deals while keeping frictionless trade. But the EU would be unlikely to accept such a plan, having stated that different aspects of the single market cannot be chosen “a la carte”.\u0026nbspThe Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

This is the sort of radical thinking this country needs to genuinely reconnect with the communities left behind by years of globalisation.Migration benefits our economy, but £4.7bn we receive every year from European migrants flows straight into government’s coffers in Westminster and austerity means communities like Redcar don’t see a penny. We should spend this money where it\u0027s really needed - outside of London and the South East - in communities that have not felt the benefits of an increasingly global economy.”Angela Smith, MP for Penistone and Stockbridge, added:\u0026nbspBrexit will do absolutely nothing to tackle the very real challenges faced by people in this country who have been badly affected by globalisation.We need a People\u0027s Vote to sort out the Brexit mess, but just as important is new thinking about how to tackle the biggest challenges faced by our communities. A Globalisation Fund, spending the idend from European migration in the places it\u0027s really needed, is one idea that would have a massive impact in parts of the country that have been hit by the decline of traditional industries and strangled by a decade of austerity.It comes as\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspprepare to vote on whether or not to accept Theresa May\u0027s Brexit deal.The Commons is widely expected to reject the proposal, prompting fresh calls for the public to be given a Final Say vote to break the deadlock in Parliament.\u0026nbspThe Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

There would be bomb scares unannounced fire inspections unexplained electricity failures\u0026nbspsudden urges to redecorate concert halls. There would even be\u0026nbsparrests\u0026nbspon arriving into town.\u0026nbsp“It’s all very unpleasant and terrorising,” Kostylev tells The Independent. “We’re doing nothing illegal, just singing our harmless, ironic songs.

When tour manager Oleg Mitrofanov tried to accompany more fans into the venue, he was reportedly\u0026nbspassaulted and pinned against the wall by police.The men in black claimed to be from health and safety inspectorate,\u0026nbspfollowing up reports of food poisoning.\u0026nbspNastya Kreslina, member of electronic duo called IC3PEAK (AP)The state’s\u0026nbspinterest in post-modern techno\u0026nbspculture does not seem\u0026nbspto have come by\u0026nbspaccident. IC3PEAK are, in fact, only one of a number of groups to have come up against the authorities\u0026nbspin recent weeks.\u0026nbspOn the same day that the band was battling “food hygiene officers” in Voronezh, the\u0026nbspteen-band Friendzone saw a gig cancelled in Yaroslav, central Russia. Their repertoire, which includes such dark hits as “Maybe, Baby”\u0026nbspand “Cute Boy”\u0026nbspis, apparently, considered\u0026nbsp“extremist”.Meanwhile, the teen rapper GONE.Fludd cancelled a show in the northern city of Petrozavodsk, following an intervention by the local prosecutors’ office. Earlier, he said he had come under pressure from “every police agency imaginable”.Last month, another rapper,\u0026nbspHusky (Dmitry Kuznetsov), hit the headlines after being imprisoned\u0026nbspwhile on tour in the southern city of Krasnodar. Officials had warned venue owners in the city that the rapper’s lyrics were “under investigation”. Kuznetsov responded to a wave of cancellations\u0026nbspby staging an impromptu concert on top of\u0026nbspa car, after which he was arrested. He was released only after public outcry and the apparent intervention of unnamed Kremlin\u0026nbspofficials.\u0026nbspRussian director’s trial opens in Moscow amid claims of persecutionWhat was interesting about Kuznetsov’s story was that the musician\u0026nbspcould barely be described as an\u0026nbspopposition figure. His breakthrough hit, “stray bullet”, revealed, if anything, a lust for guns and gangster culture\u0026nbspover politics. He has also\u0026nbsplent his face to Kremlin-backed separatist fighters in Donetsk, singing, last\u0026nbspyear, a rap eulogy to Arseny “Motorola” Pavlov, the notorious separatist warlord\u0026nbspassassinated in 2016. \u0026nbspLawyer Pavel Chikov, who represents some of the artists in question, says that the recent crackdown seems to have been calculated to be “concentrated and demonstrative”. The cancellations and arrests all seem to come from one central command, he says – though the exact decisions by local law enforcement “differ by region”.\u0026nbsp“The logic is the same – getting in the way – but there is variation from case to case,” he tells The Independent.\u0026nbspYoung Russians have learned to think for themselves. They look for information and they process it critically. That is very scary for the government\u0026nbspThis was apparently in response to two traumatic episodes for the agency:\u0026nbspone, a shooting in Kerch college,\u0026nbspRussia’s “Columbine massacre”, in which 20 teenagers were killed the other, a young anarchist’s\u0026nbspsuicide bombing\u0026nbspattack on\u0026nbspan\u0026nbspFSB\u0026nbspregional headquarters\u0026nbspin the northern city of Arkhangelsk.\u0026nbspBut for Artemy Troitsky, a music critic credited with introducing western music to Soviet audiences, the crackdown brought back more distant memories.\u0026nbsp“If it\u0026nbspwas rock music in the 1980s, now it’s rap music,” he says. “The methods the spooks are using are\u0026nbspexactly the same: black lists, cancellations of concerts and arrests.”\u0026nbspHe says he still remembers the secret gigs and\u0026nbspno-play lists issued by Soviet authorities. Those lists came in two sections\u0026nbsp– one for underground Russian groups and the other for western pop stars. The second list would always contain helpful annotations: “David Bowie, banned for homosexual perversion and drug promotion, for example ACDC for alcoholism and violence.”\u0026nbspThe critic describes the moves to ban concerts as a “ham-fisted response to the\u0026nbsppolitical awakening\u0026nbspof Russian youth”.Russian teens are “different” from their “passive and cowardly” parents and “Putin-supporting” grandparents, he says. It’s a generation that Putin “seems to have lost”, and which now forms a significant part of the protest movement headed by opposition leader Alexei Navalny.\u0026nbspRussians rally for young anarchists jailed over ‘revolution plot’“Up until now, the authorities thought the young generation was harmless, interested mainly in money, sex and booze,” says Troitsky. “They miscalculated, and are fighting back by the only way they know how – closing down their communications, the internet, and witch-hunting their heroes.”\u0026nbspNastya Kreslina, the other half of the IC3PEAK duo, says the Kremlin did indeed appear to be\u0026nbspfrightened of people her age. They see “unmanageable masses”, she says, and don’t don’t know what to do about them:\u0026nbsp“Young Russians have learned to think for themselves. They look for information and they process it critically. That is very scary for the government.”\u0026nbspIf reports are to be believed, authorities have been\u0026nbspparticularly vexed by\u0026nbspone of\u0026nbspIC3PEAK music videos, the outrageously macabre “No More Death”.\u0026nbspThere’s no question the video consciously pokes around Russian taboo. It\u0026nbspopens at\u0026nbspthe Russian White House, the seat of the country’s\u0026nbspgovernment, with Kreslina singing the lyrics: “I flood my eyes with kerosine let everything burn let everything burn. The whole of Russia is watching me let everything burn let everything burn.” It then moves to images of eating flesh in front of Lenin’s tomb, drinking blood,\u0026nbspand riding on riot police in front of the Lubyanka, the infamous headquarters of the Russian security services.\u0026nbspThe group says that only those without a cultural background would fail to understand the “irony” of the work.\u0026nbsp“It’s all very metaphorical, without any direct appeal or single-layer image,” says Kostylev. “It’s a post-modern take, with multiple layers and vivid images. There is no single meaning, and it’s very funny when people start to interpret it in a single way.”\u0026nbspTroitsky told The Independent that he became a fan of the group after becoming aware of the “sensational” video, and had successfully lobbied a London-based indie record company to offer the pair a record deal.\u0026nbspAnd,\u0026nbsphe\u0026nbspsays, the authorities have “shot themselves in the foot” by unintentionally promoting the group’s work. \u0026nbsp“The only thing their campaign will do is create a wave of solidarity among artists and young people,” he says.\u0026nbsp”The Kremlin would be wise to learn from history.\u0026nbspUnderground rock was a significant force in causing the Soviet regime to fall. If the hawks continue with their aggressive course, the regime will end up in the same place.”\u0026nbspIt is difficult to predict which\u0026nbspposition will prevail, and already there are signs of major differences of opinion within the walls of the Kremlin. Two fairly prominent government figures, the head of the Foreign Intelligence Service Sergei Naryshkin and former culture minister Mikhail Shvydkoi, have already spoken out against “prohibitive measures”.\u0026nbspThere has also been support from the most unlikely of quarters. On Sunday, Russia’s propagandist-in-chief, Dmitry Kiselyov, surprised viewers of his infamous\u0026nbspnews review programme by\u0026nbspbreaking out into rap. He used\u0026nbspVladimir Mayakovsky’s futurist poetry to “prove”\u0026nbspRussian rappers were patriotic, not American. His message was simple:\u0026nbsp“They\u0026nbspshouldn’t be harassed.”\u0026nbsp‘Banned’ Russian ballet about gay Soviet dancer finally premieresAnd last month, another propaganda master, RT’s Margarita Simonyan, came out in support of the imprisoned HuskyKuznetsov. Writing on Twitter, she said the musician had been freed from prison thanks to the interventions of “two or three” people in the Kremlin, and would now “hopefully” be left alone.\u0026nbspIt was unclear how this tallied with her own claims of an independent legal system in Russia, but the official endorsement\u0026nbspseemed to have immediate effect. On Thursday, the same day that his colleagues were being hounded across Russia, Kuznetsov was in the State Duma, Russia’s parliament, taking part in a panel about improving relations between musicians and the state. (Kuznetsov declined to comment for this article.)IC3PEAK told The Independent that they had noticed state media had covered their problems on tour “fairly objectively”. This, they said, was evidence of “uncoordinated actions” that undermined the authorities’ overall repressive approach. \u0026nbspAnd on Thursday evening, the liberal internet TV channel Dozhd reported that the president’s own staff had become angry at the heavy-handed actions of local officials. A source “close to the Kremlin” told the channel that the president would “put an end to the idiotism”, it said.\u0026nbspThe test of that promise will come soon enough.\u0026nbspThe next stops on IC3PEAK’s troubled tour\u0026nbspare the southern cities of Krasnodar and Rostov at the\u0026nbspweekend – capitals of Cossack culture, and hardly known for a warm reception of subversive\u0026nbspculture.\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

There is no point in the Government trying to hide that fact.The Democratic Unionist Party has vowed to oppose any new checks on goods passing between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.Irelands Foreign Minister, Simon Coveney, said that EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier indicated that the European Union will allow extra time for talks about the border.Mr Coveney said he was frustrated and disappointed that it was going to take more time than people had hoped.At the start of a key debate in Parliament on her Brexit plan, the Prime Minister said the backstop was not a trap for Britain.The backstop is not a trick to trap us in the EU, said Mrs May.It actually gives us some important benefits of access to the EUs market without many of the obligations and that is something the EU will not want to let happen, let alone persist for a long time."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/NINTCHDBPICT0004459005531-e1543889679409.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"ofsted chief amanda spielman says schools are now being asked to do things that should be done by parents","story":"Watching kids in a classroom is great fun. Most are keen and eager to learn. That’s why teaching can be a really rewarding job, but there’s no doubt it is also a tough one.Today I will be launching my annual report, which will show that, overall, schools in England are doing a good job.The vast majority of children are attending good or outstanding schools, which is as it should be. Young people get just one shot at childhood — leaving no room for complacency.Yet in recent years it feels like more and more is being asked of schools and teachers, which could put this improvement at risk.They are being asked to do things that should be done at home by parents, as they used to be.This is making the job of schools harder. It takes up too much precious time and stops teachers from doing their actual job — teaching.One of the most shocking examples I hear about is the growing number of children beginning their reception year still in nappies.I’ve asked about this in primary schools this year, and each time I’ve asked I’ve been told it is a real problem.This is dficult for teachers, embarrassing for the children concerned and disruptive to their classmates.Quite simply, it is wrong. Toilet training is the parents’ job. It should not be left to schools. Only in the most extreme cases should parents be excused from this most basic of parenting tasks.And this isn’t the only area that concerns me.We all know about the growing problem of childhood obesity. By the start of primary school, almost a quarter of children in England are overweight or obese. This is at the age four or five.This rises to more than a third by the time they go to secondary school.It is estimated that nearly , young people in the UK are now suffering from type  diabetes, an unpleasant disease normally only seen in people over the age of .Schools have an important role to play, teaching children about the importance of healthy eating and exercise. Kids need to get out of breath during PE.But schools can’t do it all. It is lazy for us to rely on schools to change kids’ habits.And the reality is, that as Ofsted research shows, schools on their own can’t make the dference. The answer to the obesity crisis, particularly among younger children, lies in the home, and parents need to make sure their offspring eat healthily, go outside, and don’t spend all day playing on electronic devices.There is no point in teaching about healthy choices, making sure school meals are healthy or having rules about what goes into a packed lunch,for breakfast, dinner and all weekend children have a supply of junk food.One of the saddest things I’ve heard about recently is cases where children have leftover fast food, cold chips or chicken nuggets, in their packed lunches the following day. With the best will in the world, schools cannot fight this single-handedly.Sadly, in some parts of our country, schools are also at the forefront of tackling a very dferent kind of risk: kne crime and gang culture.Thankfully most schools are safe, and of course they can help educate young people about the dangers of knives and how to avoid being drawn into gangs.But they cannot be expected to solve the problem alone. Preventing kne crime requires people working together — police, youth services, health services — to protect children and to do everything to bring those who cause harm to children to justice.However we must not forget the role of parents here either. This is about taking responsibility for your child. I accept that many families are busy and that some children have dficult and complex problems to deal with.But that doesn’t excuse parents from the basics of teaching their children right from wrong, giving them proper boundaries and security. And that means not trying to be their “best friend”.One answer may be to introduce more parenting classes. We know these can work and help parents who might otherwise be struggling.These shouldn’t be for schools to run, but perhaps to run in schools. Maybe now is the time to look again at the ambitions of the Le Chances strategy or the ideas behind the Sure Start programme.But parents must recognise they cannot off load their responsibilities at the school gate.Every minute we ask teachers to spend on these issues is time children aren’t learning the Rs, studying our nation’s history or the scientic forces that shape our world.I want schools to be able to do their proper job, and to let them do that, parents have got to step up.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So why the apparent change of heart The popular consensus seems to be it’s a charm offensive to counteract the negative coverage of an alleged rt between her daughter Kate and royal newbie Meghan Markle — a laying out of the “Team Catherine” stall,you like.But as the fallout rumours are fairly recent and most glossy mags are laid out six weeks in advance, may I humbly cynicallysuggest that the stall she’s laying out might be more monetary than motherly In other words, building up traffic to her and husband Michael’s Party Pieces website for Christmas in preparation for potentially flogging it off to an overseas billionaire in the pre-Brexit New Year.But I digress. On Christmas Day I will be enduringour annual family fallout over a game of Monopoly. ButI wasn’t, I’d be straight round to Middleton Towers in Bucklebury, Berks, for what sounds like an idyllically festive few days.In a Christmas walnutshell, it goes something like this: Wake up whenever, pop in to the local church, go for a walk, open a few pressies, smoked salmon and champagne for lunch, more pressies, some games, then the main meal early evening.Oh, and all the grandchildren will have a small tree in their bedrooms that they can decorate themselves. The rest of the year, she says, “is really normal most of the time”. Which, to Prince William, who has grown up amid the pomp and circumstance of stuffy royal traditions, must feel like a slice of sheer heaven.Instead, poor love, he and Kate are expected to join the rest of the royalsat Sandringham, where the Queen et al stick to the German tradition of opening gts on Christmas Eve before dressing for a “formal dinner” from which, oh dear, the women eventually retire to another room while the men enjoy a port or brandy.Then it’s off to the highly publicised visit to St Mary’s Magdalene church on Christmas morning, followed by a turkey lunch and a communal viewing of “Granny’s” speech at pm.It’s unclear when William and Kate will head off to see her family, but what’s the betting they get in the car with fixed grins before mumbling “thank God that’s over for another year” the second they hit Norfolk’s A  And that’s why, whatever the truth behind the rumours that Kate and Meghan aren’t getting on, it won’t matter one jot to the admirably grounded Duchess of Cambridge who, thanks to her idyllic childhood, knows exactly who she is.Meghan, on the other hand, has no such cosy alternative to retreat to. Her parents orced when she was just six years old and it’s no secret that she’s now estranged from her father Thomas and his highly vocal, deliciously off-message side of the family.So, however well meaning she is, all her charitable grandstanding and repeated declarations of being “an independent woman” suggest she finds validation from being regarded as a, yawn, groundbreaking feminist role model rather than, as Kate is dismissed by some, a dutul we and mother, who toes the royal line and doesn’t make waves.But Kate has no need to virtue signal because she’s rooted in the love and respect of her tight-knit family — a set-up she’s replicating with William, who, after his own fractured childhood, clearly adores the normality of le Chez Middleton.And of course, they’re both equally secure in the knowledge that, post-“King Charles”, the top job is theirs.Harry, on the other hand, has chosen a bride who, despite her efforts at reinvention, has a chequered pastand a burning desire to be seen as more than just a pretty appendage to the sixth-in-line to the throne.That’s understandable.

Im calling this government to resign, Valette said.Valette is also the founder of the National Equality movement and has organised a number of protests over the past few years.The yellow vest movement is led by protesters wearing the distinctively coloured roadside safety vests used by motorists known as gilets jaunes in FrenchSince the movement kicked off on November , three people have been killed and hundreds injured in clashes or accidents stemming from the protests.In the past three weeks, demonstrators have been setting up roadblocks across the country and their movement has won wide public support.Riot police were overrun on Saturday as protesters wrought havoc in Pariss wealthiest neighbourhoods.Frances interior ministry says about , people took part in the protests nationwide on Sunday December .Demonstrators burned dozens of cars, looted boutiques and smashed up luxury private homes and cafes in the worst disturbances the capital has seen since .The yellow vest movement’s supporters cut across age, job profile and geographical region.On Monday their ranks were swelled by paramedics complaining about working conditions and students angry about education reforms as the violence continued.It has succeeded in bringing together people from across the political spectrum complaining about Frances economic inequalities and waning spending power.The movement was organised online and has no clear leadership, making talks all the more complicated for the government.Most want the government to scrap the new fuel taxes, hold a review of the tax system and raise the minimum wage.There have also been calls to roll back Macron’s tax cuts for the wealthy and his economic programme, which is seen as pro-business.One protester said the reforms “will bludgeon us financially and destroy our companies. Were going to have to fire people, thats for sure.One of the eight spokesmen for movement Christophe Chalençon called on President Macron to resign.He said the President should step aside for General Pierre de Villiers, the former head of the French armed forcesThe general resigned after a clash with President Emmanuel Macron over budget cuts and Chalencon called him a “true commander”.Macron says the fuel tax increases are part of his effort to combat climate change, wanting to persuade French drivers to exchange diesel-fuelled cars for less polluting models.His pro-business reforms have aimed to make the French economy more competitive globally, but French workers see the changes as brutal and weakening their rights."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/nintchdbpict000312629742.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"universal credit application driving licence","story":"MP Dan Carden said hed heard of constituents being made to buy a form of ID before they can get access to benefits, but Amber Rudd blasted him for scaremongering.Mr Carden, the MP for Liverpool Walton, said in a letter to Amber Rudd: I have now been informed that job centres across Liverpool are advancing payments to my constituents to obtain provisional driving licences for the purposes of identication and then deducting the cost from their benefits.He said people in his area were being made to pay the postage and passport photos too - just to get a form of ID.And it could mean theres an even longer wait for benefits too, as the DVLA said there was a five week wait.It already takes five weeks to get the first payment through on Universal Credit, meaning struggling Brits could be wrongly told they have to wait TEN weeks to get help.Mr Carden urged the DWP Secretary to halt the rollout of Universal Credit in his area until the problems are fixed.He said: The Universal Credit system is not fit for purpose. The online system is riddled with faults, complications and delays.There can be no doubt, continuing with this roll-out will leave many of the most vulnerable families destitute by Christmas, and I am asking you to intervene as a matter of urgency.His area is currently seeing the full roll out of Universal Credit.But Amber Rudd blasted the letter as scaremongering.She said tonight: Theres no requirement for a UC claimant to have ID, butyou do purchase one we can actually reimburse you.Where people wont have ID our terric work coaches use many methods to identy someone and get their claim started right away.Many Brits have said they are finding the verication process online dficult - and hundreds of thousands of people have abandoned the online application because they couldnt finish it, recent figures revealed.Only half of claimants said they were able to make a claim online for benefits without help.IF youre experiencing trouble applying for your Universal Credit, or the payments just dont cover costs, here are your options:Apply for an advance - Claimants are able to get some cash within five days rather than waiting weeks for their first payment. But its a loan which means the repayments will be automatically deducted from your future Universal Credit pay out.Alternative Payment Arrangements- If youre falling behind on rent, you or your landlord may be able to apply for an APA which will get your payment sent directly to your landlord. You might also be able to change your payments to get them more frequently, or you can split the paymentsyoure part of a couple.Budgeting Advance - You may be able to get help from the government to help with emergency household costs of up to £youre single, £youre part of a couple or £you have children. These are only in cases like your cooker breaking down or for help getting a job. Youll have to repay the advance through your regular Universal Credit payments. Youll still have to repay the loan, evenyou stop claiming for Universal Credit.Cut your Council Tax - You might be able to get a discount on your Council Tax or be entitled to Discretionary Housing Paymentsyour payments arent enough to cover your rent.Foodbanks - If youre really hard up and struggling to buy food and toiletries, you can find your local foodbank who will provide you with help for free. You can find your nearest one on the Trussel Trust website.To apply for the new flagship benefits system you do need a form of ID - this can be a passport, credit card or a driving licence.ButBrits dont have this, there are other forms of ID that can be used - including evidence of your address, bills, a birth or marriage certicate, a National Insurance card, or council tax documents.Claimants can also be asked security questions too to try and very identities.Today it was revealed that the DWP has spent £million on adverts for Universal Credit.A DWP spokeswoman told The Sun: Having ID is not a requirement for those making a Universal Credit claim but it does make the process easier.

Suddenly, every berk thinks that the phone in their hand gives them the right to publish anything they see.Either they have some gung-ho fantasy of being a war correspondent, responsible for recording a fracas without doing a damn thing about stopping it. Or  in their head they are suddenly Quentin ­Tarantino, recording a particularly tasty bit of violence.So we get incidents like last week’s, at a Towie-favourite nightclub in Gants Hill, North East ­London. A young woman was filmed being sexually assaulted as onlookers, some of them women, jeer at the “fun” and point cameras up her skirt.Were these people scared of intervening and pulling the thugs off her, and filming it in order to pass the footage on to club management and police  Nope, they just put it up on the internet for the world to share the jeering. The weird and wicked idea that this is somehow OK is growing.Incidents on planes, in clubs, in the street, in schoolyards, are filmed by bystanders who don’t even try to shout or intervene. They are then plonked online, just to get some strange kudos for the person filming it.From the US and, increasingly, here there are cases of onlookers recording the humiliation of other people, not responsibly and ethically in order to give it to the authorities — managements, police, teachers — but just to put it online and “go viral”.Take the coward who last month filmed a policewoman being violently kicked in the head, then posted the footage online with the caption “LOL.” Or the bully who posted a video of a drunk teen ­giving oral sex to more than  men in Magaluf, for the “banter”.And last week, a shocking video of a -year-old Syrian refugee boy called Jamal being dragged to the floor by his neck went viral. Then, because the poor boy has not been humiliated enough, his ordeal was shared online by “disgusted” celebs and MPs who proclaim to care but are, of course, unwittingly ­contributing to his suffering.Some may vaguely think they are activists exposing bad ­behaviour, but in cases like this they are no such thing. They are voyeurs, cowards, and exhibitionists. Because it’s the victim of the attack, not just the attackers, who gets humiliated.Anyone half-decent understands that only disgusting ­people go in for “revenge porn”, sharing intimate videos of someone they broke up with. Whether dumped or cheated on, that is a horrible thing to do and can make the victim suicidal. Young girls live in terror of it, on one hand encouraged to be sexy and on the other scared of having their most unguarded moments exposed to the world.It has, a few times, led to ­prosecution and so it should. But personal vengeance and associated “slut-shaming” is only part of it.The whole business of filming other people without consent needs to be seen for what it is — a form of unregulated, potentially irresponsible and damaging rogue journalism.  Smartphone tech and the internet should be ­governed by the same ethical rules journalism developed.Good editors pixelate faces and agonise about what is responsible reporting, and what is in the ­public interest.If it would be wrong for a news reporter to film, for no good ­reason, a person being humiliated, assaulted, or even just tumbling in the street or falling asleep in an embarrassing position on a train, then it is even more wrong for any selfish git with a smartphone to do it.Journalism has rules because it is public. Now that technology can make anyone’s instant shot just as public, the rules should be the same. And because the technology belongs to the “digital natives” who grew up with it, it is time they applied to it all those pious, ethical modern values which we hear so much about.Not all slut-shamers and gloating video bystanders are young — but a great many are. It’s the job of the new ­generation to invent and support a digital morality.What’s the point being a ­liberated, gay-friendly, vegan-conscious, no-ing snowflakeyou’re not willing to call out callous voyeurs and smartphone sneaks Libby Purves is a former presenter of Radio ’s Today programme.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But this lot beats them all.Two years ago we had a vote on whether we wanted to stay in the European Union. The outcome was decisive.By  per cent to  per cent we voted to leave. The people had been given a voice.And the people said very clearly: We want to leave.But there was never a majority among our political class for leaving.tp composite more brexitBecause for two years the Remainer majority of MPs has done everything it possibly can to thwart the will of the people.They have undermined Theresa May and the Government when it tried to negotiate with Brussels.That’s the main reason the deal we have before us now is so weak.Because as soon as ministers set off to do battle, the likes of Philip Hammond and Justine Greening would be trying to pull the rug from under their feet.The biggest deceit is this. All the while these politicians are trying to scupper Brexit, they are putting on their sincere faces and saying: “We must respect the will of the people.”This is a downright lie and it has always been a downright lie.When Tory Remainers tell you we must get a good deal, they really mean we must not leave the European Union.When the Labour Party tells you that we must have a “good Brexit for jobs”, they really mean that we must not leave the European Union.When that coffin-faced bore Dominic Grieve, once our Attorney General, puts down amendments which effectively stop us leaving with a no-deal, he is really saying: “We must not leave the European Union under any conditions at all.”When they start lecturing you about how Parliament must be sovereign — they’re saying the same thing. We must not leave the EU.What has happened over the past two years has been a concerted campaign of treachery and betrayal.The Tory Brexiteers — with one or two exceptions, such as David Davis, Priti Patel and Jacob Rees-Mogg — haven’t helped by being a disorganised rabble.Too interested in their own political careers to do the dficult work of leading Britain towards a confident exit from that authoritarian bureaucracy.But it is the Remainers who have done the real damage.If they didn’t tell us, at every step of the way, that “the people’s vote must be respected” then I’d have a little more time for them. But they trot that out every time they open their mouths.All the while trying to wreck any chance of Brexit.God knows what will happen now. Although I suspect even he’s perplexed.What should have been a graceful and confident exit from an unfit institution has turned into a bugger’s muddle.But I do know this. The people of the UK will not forget the names of those who have sold us down the river.And one day, sure enough, we’ll have our revenge.What’s advertised as a glistening winter wonderland is usually five square yards of mud with a plastic donkey and an elf who has just completed a five stretch for armed robbery.I know everybody needs to make a ­living. But I do wonder how the owners of these crap grottos live with themselves.Find eight of the best Winter Wonderlands here.WHAT a fabulous family the Osamors are.A real credit to the country, to the Labour Party and to the House of Commons.Let’s start with Kate, above, the Labour MP for Edmonton and one of Jeremy ­Corbyn’s favourites.She employed her son, Ishmael, below, as a researcher at the House of Commons.And continued to do so even after he had been convicted of possessing lethal drugs including ketamine and ecstasy at a festival.Not only that, but she misled the public and her colleagues.She said she hadn’t known about her son’s conviction until after he was sentenced.When it was absolutely clear that she had.How did she respond when a journalist tried to ask her about this business She screamed “f*** off” at him. Then threw a bucket of water at him.Then said: “I should have come down here with a bat and smashed your head in.”After which, this entitled madam actually rang  – twice – to say the reporter was “stalking” her.Unbelievable.Then there’s  Grandma Osamor, Kate’s mother Martha. Now ennobled as Baroness Osamor of Tottenham and taking her seat in the House of Lords at your expense.A supporter of Labour activists suspended over anti-Semitism.And once considered too left-wing even for the Labour Party, until Corbyn came along.What a great parenting job both she and her daughter have done.And do you suppose that either would be in the ­positions they are now were it not for the colour of their skin THE animal rights activists Peta want us to stop using  certain phrases which are nasty about animals.Such as, “No use flogging a dead horse”.Better to say: “You can’t feed a fed horse.” Which doesn’t sound right at all, to me.Some vegans are also supposedly  objecting to “don’t put all your eggs in one basket”, because it’s unkind to eggs. And “bringing home the bacon”. Which is unkind to bacon.I think we need to create a few new ones to annoy Peta even further. So . . .Too many voles in the blender spoil the smoothie.Riots, confusion, mayhem. They’ve just woken up to the fact that their president is a smirking liberal halfwit who cares not a jot about working-class people.  We could have told you that, mes amis, when you elected him  months ago.Emmanuel Macron has already had to climb down and give in to some of the demands from the rioters.During the election he portrayed himself as a populist, but was anything but. It was a con job.Next time you toddle off to the polls, you lot, get it right.SO, Nigel Farage has deserted Ukip because he thinks the party has become too extremist.Fair enough, he’s probably right. The party looks dead and buried.It’s a shame that because of our first-past-the-post system Ukip were never able to capture many seats in parliament.I’ve never been a fan of proportional representation.Butwe had it, Ukip under Farage, above, would likely be our second or third biggest party by now.And those negotiations over  Brexit would be looking very dferent, wouldn’t they RESPECT to Wrexham driver Kenneth Samuels. He managed to fit ELEVEN people into his Ford Focus.Actually, he’s a Wrexham non-driver now, because the Old Bill caught him.  He was disqualied from driving for  months.I assumed at first that he was ferrying a troupe of dwarves to a panto.But no. There were children involved, which kind of antagonised the magistrates.If the police had looked a bit further I suspect they’d have found the entire Liberal Democrat Party in the boot.  And Speaker John Bercow in the glove box. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

members braved the icy waters as they desperately swam to safety, but soon realised the mum was missing.She had gone down into the galley just before the boat flipped over.The quick-thinking yacht skipper took off his le jacket and free-ed into the freezing waters.The brave man found the terried mum inside an air pocket of the galley.He then instructed her to e down through the icy waters and guided her through the galley doors and back up to the surface.The petried mum had a fractured shoulder as she had to brave the choppy seas to get to the two crew members waiting to pull her out of the water.Two sea rescue craft, Spirit of Day and Spirit of Vodacom, raced to the scene after the NSRI leboats had been alerted.They were backed up by the Cape Town Fire and Rescue Dive Unit and a Police Dive Unit as they found the five Brits and three crew members safe on the upturned hull.The mother had suffered a fractured shoulder and two of the crewmen had suffered non-le threatening injuries.Paramedics took them to the hospital to be treated.Everyone on board also suffered hypothermia and were treated at the hospital, National Sea Rescue Institute spokesperson Craig Labinon said.Mr Labinon told how the catamaran skipper rescued the British mother-of-two.He told News: “She was trapped in the galley where water was rising as the cabin filled with water causing a fast diminishing air pocket that had provided some relief.“From what we understand we believe the skipper of the catamaran free ed under the catamaran after she capsized and he was able to bring the mum up from below deck.“Eight persons – three local male crew members and five tourist passengers from the United Kingdom – were found on the upturned hull of the boats when we arrived.“All were wearing le

Kildonan in Scotland on Wednesday when he spotted the unusual sight from his window while working.He asked his pal to pull over so he could snap the beautul sight.Daniel, from Brora, said: After wed driven past these strange-looking things, I asked the driverwe could stop briefly so I could have a look at what they were.I was just so puzzled and interested by them, then I learnt they were called ice pancakes.I think they look more like prawn crackers than pancakes.They ied in size - some where the size of a DVD while others were the size of a vinyl.I regularly take pictures of sunrises in winter, and Ive definitely taken nicer pictures before but nothing as unique as this.Daniel, who regularly takes pictures of winter sunrises while on the job, admits these images are his best yet.According to the Met Office, ice pancakes require very specic conditions to form and are most commonly seen in the Baltic Sea, but can also form in North America and Canada.The discs can measure anywhere between cm and cm and are described as a unique spectacle.Daniel said: I was working on Wednesday and we were driving up the Strath of Kildonan.I was scanning the countryside and river as we were travelling and I noticed something strange on river. I didnt know what to think.An ice pancake is a type of ice that is in round pieces that range from being  centimetres in diameter to three metres. Ice pancakes are formed in two ways. One way is that is formed on water and covers slush or grease ice. Another way is that it is created by breaking ice rind, which is a shiny crust of floating ice.I was loader on the lorry that day and we have to go up the Strath Road that runs along the river then we go back in the same direction.I went down river bank to have a look as I had never seen these before.It was clearly ice but I couldnt figure out how the pancakes had formed so I had to do some research.I had no idea they were so rare, but Id never seen anything like them.As far as Ive read, theyre caused by foam freezing and bouncing off other bits of frozen foam."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/NINTCHDBPICT000454648836-e1544202116562.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"angela merkel replacement cdu annegrat kramp kareenbauer","story":"Her -year reign as party leader has come to an end, but she will serve out her term as the German chancellor.Kramp-Karrenbauer, , will now lead the CDU into the next general election and as the leader of Germanys largest party, is in pole position to become the next chancellor.Often dubbed mini Merkel, she is a close ally of the chancellor has largely supported her open door policy on refugees.Merkel has been widely criticised for allowing one million people allowed to settle in the country, a policy that has been blamed for tensions and the rise of the far-right.But Kramp-Karrenbauer has questioned whether Germanys large Turkish minority should he allowed to hold joint citizenship and said migrants should make more of an effort to integrate.She won  of the  votes cast and narrowly defeated Friedrich Merz, a millionaire lawyer, who received  votes at the party conference.As the result was announced, she became overcome with emotion and struggled to hold back tears.I have read a lot about what I am and who I am: mini, a copy, simply more of the same, she said in her passionate victory speech.Dear delegates, I stand before you as I am and as le made me and I am proud of that.AKK - as she is widely known - grew up in a Catholic family in Saarland in south-western Germany, the countrys smallest state.She joined the CDU in  as a -year-old student and her Catholic upbringing has shaped her more conservative views on same-sex marriage and allowing same-sex couples to adopt children.Kramp-Karrenbauer has also spoken in favour of re-introducing one year military service.After completing a masters in political science, worked in state-level politics.She has been the CDUs general secretary, in charge of day-to-day political strategy, since February and was previously a popular state premier in Saarland.Kramp-Karrenbauer has also backed traditional left-wing policies such as the minimum wage, and end to nuclear power, tackling poverty and higher taxes.The new CDU leader lives in her hometown of Püttlingen with husband Helmut Karrenbauer.They have been married for  years and he left his job as a mining engineer to look after their three sons while she pursued her political career.Kramp-Karrenbauer now faces improving the partys political fortunes and trying to win back voters from rivals to the right and left, while working with Merkel as chancellor until Germanys next election.She becomes only the eighth leader of the CDU since World War II and all but two of her predecessors served as chancellor.For the latest news on this story keep checking back at Sun Online, where we will bring you live updates as soon as they happen, before anyone .Like us on Facebook at www.facebook thesun, and follow us from our main Twitter account at @TheSun, where we will bring you this story and all the rest of the top news and exclusives of the day.TheSun is your go to destination for the best celebrity news, football news, real-le stories, jaw-dropping pictures and must-see videoOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Keep your eyes peeled.”There are some things Brits can do to keep the pests away that include keeping a clean home, making a homemade repellent, spotting and fixing leaky pipes and taps, and getting a dehumidier to keep the moisture away.A repellent can be made using equal parts vinegar and water, a squirt of washing up liquid and then mix it with  drops of peppermint and eucalyptus oil, Gohri adds.A silverfish is a small, wingless insect that is light grey in colour that imitates fish-like movements.Silverfish are attracted to food residue and moisture.The pests love pasta and cereals and it is recommended all food is kept in sealed containers.They can enter homes through leaky pipes and taps.If the home is already crawling with silverfish making honey and salt traps can catch them.Gohri said to mix honey and baking soda onto a piece of cardboard to attract them, trap them and then dehydrate and kill them from the salt.Silverfish also hate the smell of garlic, lemon, lavender and oranges."},{"url":null,"title":"karen danczuk split from toyboy","story":"Karen - once married to shamed former MP Simon Danczuk - was due to tie the knot in Spain next year with boyfriend David Escudero.

Senior figures there say that will not be decided until Monday.But they do admit they are making little headway in trying to quell this rebellion, and that they are heading for a loss.How big  “I’m sure it’ll breach three figures”, one Cabinet minister says of the margin of defeat.A way to avoid such a humiliation would be to find an amendment that could pass the Commons.This means there would be no vote on May’s deal as it currently stands, enabling the Government to argue that it hadn’t actually been defeated.Though, as one source admits, voters would be left baffled by this procedural trick.This approach isn’t guaranteed to work either.First of all, it would rely on John Bercow selecting the amendment — which is far from certain. The Speaker is supposed to be impartial, but Bercow has long used his power to cause the Government trouble.Much of Tuesday’s Cabinet meeting was taken up with ministers complaining about him. Liam Fox, the Trade ­Secretary, called Bercow “a disgrace to his office”.Also, some Tory rebels are itching to defeat the Government. They are discussing whether to vote against ALL amendments, regardless of whether they agree with them or not, so they can make clear their opposition to May’s deal. Some in Cabinet think thatMPs voted for an amendment setting out what would make the deal acceptable to Parliament, it would strengthen May’s hand with the EU.One tells me: “The negotiation has been all about us saying yes or no. This would make the EU say yes or no to something.”Chancellor Philip Hammond, though, argued at Thursday’s inner Cabinet that any concessions are more likely to come after a vote has been lost — so there was a case for pressing on.What May thinks the way ahead is remains unclear even to her inner Cabinet, much to their frustration.“The main problem is that it is very dficult to read the PM,” one tells me, adding that, “Until she decides what she wants to do, it is very dficult to put weight behind any ­particular outcome.”Backbench Tory MPs are also becoming increasingly irritated with her.One senior figure who is ­normally sympathetic complains that she has become “completely messianic about the backstop”. This source says that Tory MPs “want to hear a solution rather than this is the only choice and they’re stupid”.Allies of May are deeply pessimistic about the EU offering any meaningful concessions.Their view is that the EU thinks that the alternatives to May’s deal are either a softer Brexit or a second referendum, so it has little incentive to offer much up.Not everyone in the Cabinet is so sure.One senior minister, with Prime Ministerial ambitions, has been explaining to junior ministers in detail how they could negotiate a better deal on the backstop.Tory leadership contenders are readying themselves.They calculate thatthe vote goes ahead this week May will lose by a big margin, the  letters will then go in and May could well lose that vote of confidence, triggering a contest.If she does go ahead with Tuesday’s vote, she’ll be betting her premiership on keeping the margin of defeat respectable. It would be a mighty gamble.There are two reasons for this. First, the Labour front bench are not keen on Norway-Plus and a number of those on the Labour benches who did support it have moved to backing a second ­referendum. Second, there is now more Tory opposition to it than there was before, particularly among the Cabinet.One Secretary of State warns that a Norway Plus deal “would destroy the Conservative Party forever”.The problem is that in an effort to make the plan acceptable to the Europeans, it has gone from being a temporary solution that would give the UK time to negotiate a free trade deal with the  EU to an indefinite arrangement that involves accepting the withdrawal agreement and with  it the ­backstop. This all makes it much less ­acceptable to Brexiteers.Even those in the Cabinet who are sympathetic to the idea admit that it would face problems.One tells me: “I am not sure it is possible because so many people would trash it.”Norway-Plus would also require a new leader.Those close to May say she could not endorse a deal that did not end free movement.EVENthe Government loses heavily on Tuesday, it would still survive a vote of confidence.The Tory rebels and the DUP have been clear that they would vote for the Government in that debate.This poses a dilemma for Labour.It means that any attempt to bring down the Government would fail, and risk providing a rare moment of Tory unity. I understand, though, that opposition parties have been mulling a dferent approach – a censure motion in the PM.This would allow the House to express its disapproval of May’s handling of Brexit, without bringing down the Government.The thinking is that this might persuade the DUP to support it.  It would demonstrate that without them, the Government cannot win a confidence vote.Traditionally, these censure motions have been accompanied by a cut in salary for the minister concerned. But there are worries on the Opposition benches that such an approach could backfire because it would look too personal.So,the UK couldn’t now leave without a deal without facing catastrophic consequences, who should carry the can for that ONE theory doing the rounds this week is that May could resign as PM and advise the Queen to ask her de facto deputy, David Lidington, to form a government.This government would then, so the thinking goes, move towards a Norway-style deal.But I am told there would be resignations from the Cabinetthis happened, and a leading Tory backbencher warns that such a government would not be able to command the confidence of the House.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Under his Remain Plus proposals, Theresa May would be required to negotiate new membership terms for the UK which he believes would make it acceptable to Leave voters. Lord Saatchi is tabling the EU Membership Bill, to be put before the House of Lords on Monday. It would involve changes to free movement rules allowing the UK to control immigration, as well as reform of EU institutions to give Britain equal voting weight with Germany.  Outlining his plan to peers on Monday, Lord Saatchi is expected to say that nobody is happy with the result of Brexit negotiations, but simply remaining in the EU on existing terms would be a national humiliation. British voters objected to the UKs membership because we dont like to be bossed around, particularly by the Germans,we dont like uncontrolled immigration, he is expected to say. His plan would rein in Berlin by restoring the UK - and possibly France - to parity with Germany in voting weight in the European Council, he proposes.  Treaty changes which linked voting power to population size have given Germany - with  million inhabitants to the UKs  million - effective control of Europe, he will argue. Freedom of movement would remain a principle of the EU, but implemented in a manner which would allow member states to absorb new migrants without damaging legitimate expectations of their own citizens.  Lord Saatchis bill would give the Prime Minister two weeks to present the proposals to the European Commission along with an indication that the UK is ready to withdraw the Article  letter notying Brussels of its intention to leave the EU. These are big reforms for the EU leaders, Lord Saatchi is expected to say.

The dogs uterus had ruptured and she needed to be rushed into emergency surgery in a desperate bid to safe her le, My London reports. The RSPCA officer who found the dog - who has since been named Florence - found her with a closed eye and a cut to the side of her face. The officer was unable to tell what Florences natural colour was, as she was covered with her own faeces.  After being discovered on Sunday night in an alleyway close to Florence Road, in Finsbury Park, she was taken to the RSPCA’s Harmsworth Memorial Animal Hospital. If Florence had not been found and provided with intensive treatment she would soon have died a horrible death, the RSPCA said. A spokesperson for the hospital said: “Poor Florence has been through a heartbreaking ordeal, but despite it all she has still been friendly, even though she is so poorly. “When she came into us we did an ultrasound that showed the presence of a dead foetus in her uterus. “Sadly it is most likely she was having dficulty giving birth when she was abandoned. “If she had been seen by a vet sooner they could have intervened and maybe helped and saved her pup.  There was also a superficial wound on her face which has been treated. She is currently recovering on fluids and medications but is still in a serious condition.” The terribly ill dog would not have been rescued without a member of the public phoning the animal charity. RSPCA animal welfare officer Nicola Thomas said Florences situation was both heartbreaking and tragic. She said: I would like to thank the member of the public who contacted us after finding poor Florence in the alleyway.They kept her safe until I arrived to collect her. “When I first picked her up she was covered from head to toe in faeces and smelled so awful. You couldn’t actually tell what colour she was meant to be. “Dumping a dog for any reason is heartbreaking, but to think that this poor girl was so poorly and also in the midst of labour is just tragic. Nicola is searching for the owner who abandoned Florence.

It is also clear that Florence has had numerous puppies in the past and was probably a breeding dog, so thereforeanyone thinks they have had a puppy from her we would also urge them to get in touch. “Florence is very poorly but staff at the hospital are doing all they can to make her comfortable and we just hope she has the strength to pull through.” "},{"url":null,"title":"bbc licence fee payers feel","story":"NewsBBC boss causes outrage after claiming that viewers “love repeats” at ChristmasA total of % of of programming across BBC One and Two is set to be re-runsShareCommentsByTom BryantHead of ShowbizBen GlazeDeputy political editor:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsDads Army will probably be on at Christmas - again \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA BBC boss has caused outrage after claiming that viewers “love repeats” at Christmas.Kate Phillips backed the Beeb’s content after it emerged % on its two main channels had aired before.Show re-runs include The Vicar of Dibley, starring Dawn French and Emma Chambers, and Dad’s Army.

Labour’s Jo Stevens, who sits on the Commons Digital, Culture Media and Sport Select Committee, said: “It’s disappointing to hear that yet again this Christmas, BBC schedules will be full of repeat programmes. “Licence-fee payers expect more, andaudiences are served up old programmes again and again, they will look to other channels for Christmas entertainment and won’t come back to the BBC. It’s self-defeating.” John O’Connell, chief of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: “No one minds a re-run of a classic film or an episode of Only Fools and Horses, but when there is so little original content at this time of year, licence fee payers might be feeling a bit short changed over the festive period.”  Ex-Gogglebox stars Steph and Dom: We didnt want people to think we had turned to drink because of our problems Of  BBC Two shows to be screened from December  to January , are re-runs.

John O’Connell, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: “Most families will be looking forward to settling down together to watch the box this Christmas, but might be disappointed to find that they’ve seen it all before.”  But Lib Dem culture spokeswoman Baroness Bonham Carter had more sympathy. She said: “People are paying pound for their licence fee and therefore will expect a iety of content this Christmas – both old and new. “The BBC are under great financial pressure as they prepare to cover the loss of government funding for TV licences for the over-s. “Inevitably, the public are having to forfeit content to foot the bill.” A BBC spokesman defended their scheduling, saying: “More than % of BBC One’s peak time schedule is new this year,” before adding: “Viewers love a few old favourites at Christmas as well.” The BBC launched its Christmas schedule earlier this month. They point to many original programmes such as drama Luther, Sarah Phelps’ adaptation of Agatha Christie’s The ABC Murders, a six-part drama adaptation of th century classic Les Miserables and a three-part adaptation of Andrea Levy’s best-selling novel The Long Song.

She also claims that BA refused to bring a cleaner on board to carry out a proper decontamination of the seat and area around it.   The mother and daughter started theirjourney to the US on a connecting BA flight from Rome to London. Despite having reserved seats they say they were moved to another part of the aircraft to accommodate VIP passengers. British Airways Twitter replied to Ann saying: Were sorry for the delay in getting a response. Our team are investigating the issue. As soon as we get the necessary information, well be in touch. Thanks for your patience.British Airways toldthere was no evidence there was urine on the seat, cabin crew provided Ann with a new seat during the journey and the company has apologised to the mum.A gesture has been offered by way of apology, the firm said.

Johnny Clapham, , and Victoria Bowness, , built their own -acre mountain hideaway to bring up their daughter Anaya in Sydney, Australia. The couple both moved to Sydney six-years-ago, but didnt know one another until they met at a meditation retreat. Johnny, originally from London and Victoria, from Manchester, quickly fell in love after bonding over their shared love of nature and adventure. Last year when Victoria fell pregnant, the couple looked into buying a house in Sydney but soon realised they would have to take out a million-dollar mortgage. Worried they would miss their little girl growing up due to working to pay off the mortgage, they decided to look at living an alternative lestyle.  They opted to buy some land and started building their very own off-grid property whilst living in their converted  Toyota Coaster. Johnny and Victoria designed a stunning geodesic dome which they will live in after they have travelled Australia at the start of next year. Both of Victorias parents passed away when she was in her twenties and this is something that has encouraged her to live outside of what society deems normal and to live for the moment. She said:We both lived in Sydney and ended up getting together, then I fell pregnant with our daughter, Anaya. We were looking into buying a house around the Northern Beaches in Sydney but even super small apartments were close to a million dollars. Literally both at the same time, one day we said to each other, what are we doing  We are going to have a million-dollar mortgage that will pretty much cripple us financially for years. To pay for the mortgage we would both have to be working full time and that would mean I would have totwelve months after Anayas birth and she would have to go to child care. That whole process just didnt feel good for us. We started to question why we were going to take that path and it was really because thats what everyone  does, thats what you believe is the right thing to do but it actually puts a lot of stress on your shoulders and you dont get to spend time as a family when your baby is very young.  We believe these are the years we should be living le to the full, we know there is no guarantee of a long healthy le.Everything gears you up to relax during retirement years, but we want to experience the world and enjoy every day, not be stuck in the grind of nine to five. My parents have both passed way, my mum when I was  and my dad when I was , this has definitely impacted how I see the world, the le I want to live and what I want for my daughter. We think its ok to step outside the norm and do things that excite you, like building our geodesic dome, which is now our bedroom. Why just do what everyone  is doing, when you do something dferent, thats when you feel really alive. We started to look at more rural properties and found that land was much cheaperyou moved away from the city. The land was cheaper out of the big cities, we are now three-and-a-half-hours from Brisbane, moving rural reduced our financial pressures massively. We loved how much land we could own, currently living on  acres. Being in tune in nature, rising with the sun and living off the land.We wanted to do something dferent from everyone  and not just follow along because all our friends were getting million-dollar mortgages. We loved the idea of having a creative project where we could build our dream home. The familys rural lestyle means that they are -minutes from the nearest shop, have no bills and rely on the sun to power their electrical items, collect rain water using rain tanks and use LPG gas to heat their water and cook their food, a wood burner for heating in the winter months and internet via G.  Johnny and Victoria share their beautul familys adventures on their Instagram page, under the handle @thelivingfreefamily and document their journey on YouTube under the same handle. As well as being constantly surrounded by nature in the mountains, Victoria spoke about the other benefits of this lestyle. Victoria added: Relying on nature for power and water means you get to appreciate all weather. It feels amazing to open the letter box and not see any repayments, bills of any kind as we are debt free, which we were able to become by living a minimalist off grid lestyle. Its great to be able to remove all the elements in your le that make you busy and have time to actually realise what you truly want from le. Since we started to live this lestyle, we stopped getting the occasional takeaway and have stopped drinking alcohol, so our health has improved, these were things we would abuse so-to-speak as they were an easy option because there are takeaways and bottle shops everywhere. There is also a real sense of community with our neighbours. Johnny discussed how he went about building their geodesic dome.  He said: It is still on going, but I had the dome up in sixteen hours over two days which I did alone, it took me about forty-hours to build the deck it sits on. We love the fact it seems like youre sleeping out in nature, its kind of like sleeping in a really huge, super strong tent. A geometric dome supports itself without needing internal columns or interior load bearing walls, making domes the most efficient structures known to man, they use less material and are lighter and stronger than any type or building bar none, because domes have at least thirty per cent less surface area than other shaped buildings it takes thirty per cent less energy to heat and cool them. Domes are naturally hurricane resistant, high winds can pass smoothly over a dome because it has no corners and flat surfaces to cause turbulence, high pressure air presses the dome down towards the ground. These facts made us fall in love with them even more. Simply their beauty, we love how beautul and magnicent they look. Ultimately, the family want to show people that they dont have to be confined by societys sometimes rigid expectations on living and can live freely.  We want to inspire people and show that there are other ways to live, to enjoy your time on earth because it is limited and it isnt all about chasing material possessions or growing wealth, said Victoria. Being happy with what you have right now and alternative living is a big movement where people are taking control of their lives whilst reducing their environmental impact. Do your research, make sure it is what you want because it is a big change, there are plenty of communities to help you along the way, connect with likeminded people, dont let fear hold you back. We really can do anything we set our minds to, whether its building a house, sewing some jeans or writing a book, trust in yourself and you will go far.

Elizabeth Wilkins, , fractured her babys skull and broke his ribs by shaking him and banging his head, a court heard. The former pound-an-hour escort was branded manipulative and devious by a judge on Thursday when she was jailed for seven years for the attack. Plymouth Crown Court was told Wilkins boy suffered brain damage and may have developmental problems as he grows up. But a Facebook campaign calling for her release has attracted more than  followers, Plymouth Live says.   The page even claims to have the results of a polygraph - lie detector - test Wilkins is alleged to have undergone shortly before her trial started.The latest status, written yesterday after sentencing, said: Seven years to serve half. Appeal preparations very much under way. And the pages about section reads: This poor innocent woman has been wrongly convicted. We aim to inform the public of her innocence, assist her appeal and correct the numerous errors reported in the media. If nothing , we want Elizabeth to know she has support for the sane members of society who can see how wrong this is.   It is understood that family and friends are continuing to update the Facebook page and an appeal is being considered. Piers Norsworthy, defending, said ahead of sentencing that she “maintained her innocence”. He said: “There have been threats of violence and death towards her. They found their way to her in several ways.A photograph of her has been sent to the prison she is likely to attend. Someone convicted of offences against a very young child is likely to find le very dficult.”  The jury was told Wilkins tried to sht the blame onto her former partner and co-defendant -year-old Erick Vanselow. But back in September, the dad was cleared of attacking the baby. Sentencing Wilkins, Judge Peter Johnson said: I find you manipulative and devious and you had only your best interests at heart. The insidious suggestion that Erick was responsible for shaking your son I find despicable. You deprived him of contact with his father and gave lie after lie to save your own skin. There was just one possible perpetrator - you.

But Lawrence Dallaglio now gets the same sense of pride and satisfaction at helping some of the most disadvantaged children in the country. The rugby union legend works with youngsters who have been kicked out of school – and is now determined to tackle the scourge of kne crime. As the -year-old wins a prestigious Letime Achievement award at the Daily Mirror’s Pride of Sport, Dallaglio says it’s been “humbling” to help so many troubled teenagers. And he added seeing one of them become a rugby coach just last week was as rewarding to him as Jonny Wilkinson’s winning drop-goal in the World Cup final in . He said: “I was so proud to captain England and to win the World Cup, but I genuinely feel the same pride over the work we do. Going to meet and help some of the most troubled youngsters in our cities is just so humbling. “We’ve managed to help over , teenagers since we started. What has truly made me proud though is, last week, we have actually employed one of the students as a coach.”  Dallaglio was given his award at the Daily Mirror’s Pride of Sport, in partnership with TSB, during Thursday’s glittering event to celebrate the unsung heroes of grassroots sport and elite performers who inspire them. He was presented with the honour at London’s Grosvenor House hotel ceremony by former players Mike Tindall, Kenny Logan, Martin Johnson and Jason Leonard. The audience of stars included Zara Phillips, swimmer Rebecca Adlington, Premier League footballers, such as Jamie Vardy, and Strictly stars Graeme Swann and Katya and Neil Jones. But, while Dallaglio is proud of the successes with the children, he also knows a lot more has to be done to combat the horric explosion of kne crime.

By the end of this year, they will have helped , of , permanently expelled  to  year olds.  He told the Mirror: “The work we do with the young people on our programme can be transformational. I remember one lad who was excluded for taking a kne into school. “But we have worked hard with him over three years to see him turn himself around from a very angry young man... to a diligent student succeeding in his college course.” He added: “Typically, our students come from areas with high levels of social deprivation. At one Pupil Referral Unit in Tower Hamlets [East London], for example, % of our young people live in poverty... “All of the young people on our programme have been excluded from mainstream education for a wide iety of reasons, ranging from aggressive behaviour to simply not attending school at all. “Crime and gang involvement is a major risk in the communities we work in... % of the prison population were excluded from school at some stage in their lives. “Some say it’s about giving them a second chance – but with our young people, it’s often their first chance.” "},{"url":null,"title":"meghan markle kate middleton feud","story":"NewsMeghan Markle and Kate Middleton feud due to bad blood between Harry and WilliamPrince Harry allegedly accused his older brother of trying to wreck his relationship with Meghan after William voiced concerns over the US actressShareCommentsByLuke Kenton:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video kate-middleton-speaks-meghan-over-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get Royal Family updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMeghan Markle and Kate Middletons dficult relationship has been the subject of much speculation for weeks now. Newlyweds Meghan and Harry will reportedly not spend Christmas with Kate and William following rumours of a rt between the sisters-in-law. It was thought the frostiness between the Royal Fab Four had been caused by disagreements between to two Duchesses. But new revelations suggest it’s actually the BROTHERS increasingly strained relationship that’s at the heart of the ision. Harry is even believed to have accused his older brother of trying to wreck his relationship with US actress Meghan.  The rumours come just two weeks after Harry and Meghan unveiled plans to move out of Kensington Palace - where the Cambridges also live - and relocate to Windsor instead. From the two young boys once united by tragedy, to rivals increasingly ided in love, things have never been worse between the pair, The Sun reports. According to the source, Diana’s boys started squabbling back in  when -year-old Meghan first began dating Harry, . Prince William is said to be incensed by his younger brother’s over-protectiveness of Meghan and his failure to see reason with her. “He will brook absolutely no criticism of Meghan — and he is so sensitive he often sees criticism or negativity where there isn’t any,” a source told The Sun.  Just as any other brothers, the pair have a long history of tfs, tantrums and sibling rivalries. William, , was said to be furious with Harry back in  when he was secretly filmed stripping naked in a Las Vegas hotel room. The pair are also notorious for teasing one another about who’s got the least hair, and who’s the better soldier. But more famous than their fallings out was their unity in through the toughest times. And now that bond is now said to be hanging by a tether.  The first of the threads allegedly snapped after William was first introduced to Meghan, and, shortly afterwards, offered Harry some unwelcome brotherly advice. Knowing his brother to be glitzy-eyed for the American actress, William is said to have warned his brother to take it slowly. A Sun source close to the Royal Family has said: “William told his brother they knew nothing about her background, her intentions, what she was really like. “He just wanted to stress that becoming part of the Royal Family is a massive undertaking and the pressure and scrutiny is unrelenting. Was Meghan the right one  “Harry went mental, he accused his brother of trying to finish his romance before it had begun. The brothers’ relationship has not really recovered.”  However, it’s said William wasn’t the only to voice his concerns over Meghan, with similar sentiments echoing down from the upper echelons of the monarchy. Another courtier said: “A lot of people in the family objected. Who really knows what the concerns were  Was it Meghan’s background  Her father and dreadful half-sister  Because she was an outspoken American  Divorced  “Harry stood up for Meghan very forcibly. He really loves her.” The Middleton’s were also slow to reach out a hand to Harry’s signicant other, who voiced concerns over inviting Meghan to Pippa’s wedding last May, in fear she’d overshadow the bride-to-be’s big day. Eventually she was asked but only opted to attend the evening reception.  Hoping to make amends when she moved to London last November, engaged to Harry, Meghan reportedly tried desperately to integrate herself with her in-laws. Hoping to be taken under Kate’s wing, the Princess was left disappointed to find Kate - suffering from motion sickness from her pregnancy with Louis, and looking after George and Charlotte - too busy to spend time with her. A royal source said: “Meghan hoped Kate would show her the ropes. But, equally understandably, Kate was busy. She didn’t have as much time for her as Meghan would have liked. They were at very dferent places in their lives. “Meghan felt quite let down. She had really tried but felt rebuffed, and so just stopped trying.” Harry did not take this lightly and spoke to William about making Meghan feel welcome. William, however, took his we’s side.

She spoke about womens right, education and even called Donald Trump misogynistic and isive during a TV interview. But one of the many things she had to adapt to when she became the Duchess of Sussex was becoming impartial when it comes to the big issues, especially politics.Meghan has done just this since her wedding day back in May, but one royal expert believes that even though shes been muted for now, it wont last long.  Speaking on his podcast Robert Jobsons Royal Podcast, the Evening Standards royal editor explains: Perhaps the most important rule that has implications for the survival of the ancient and unelected institution is that the royal family is not allowed to vote, hold any type of political office or speak publicly about politics. They must certainly not be seen to be supporting one political party above another as to do so could cause a constitutional crisis, reports the Express. Speaking about how Meghan has spoken passionately about political issues in the past, he adds: Such strident opinions would have to be muted as she embraces her le as a member of the royal family. But he believes Meghan is not afraid to use her voice and will not easily be silenced by the niceties of royal protcol.  In sharp contrast, her sister-in-law Kate Middleton has always remained completely unbiased on politically issues. Meghan, who is expecting her first child in the spring, has given a number of speeches since taking her position, including a number during her first Royal Tour. Shes expected to announce which charities she will officially support in the new year, and she has already raised thousands with a charity cookbook. The best selling book raises cash to support a community kitchen which helps people affected by the Grenfell Tower tragedy.

Meghan, who was probably around  at the time, writes that she is ft in tall and weighs lbs, with brown hair and eyes. The headshot is a stunning black and white shot which shows Meghan looking past the camera in a simple black halter neck top. Her hair, of course, is in a messy bun. The CV lists roles she has played, including her small part as Hot Chick in A Lot Like Love, which also starred Aston Kutcher. There are also a number of theatre jobs listed, including the part of July Star to Be in Annie and a role in Richard Harriss  play Stepping Out.  In the special skills section it also states that she does ballet, jazz and tap dancing - which could help her score brownie points with her niece. Princess Charlotte is reportedly a big fan of dancing, and Prince George is also learning it at school - so it seems theyve got a good teacher at home in Kensington Palacethey want some extra lessons. Meghan also claims she is fluent in Spanish, which could also help her with the kids as they both apparently speak it thanks to their nanny Maria Borrallo. One of the other surprising skills on the Duchess CV is kickboxing. We knew shes a big fitness and yoga fan as she has spoken regularly about her passion for it, but this is a new insight.

Brave Leah Smith is repeatedly losing the use of her arms and legs and feels constant numbness in her tongue, mouth and nose. The -year-old, from Prestatyn, Wales, can’t even support her own head or turn it without losing movement in another part of her body. She says she now fears for her le most days as her heart struggles toproperly and her breathing is deteriorating by the week. “To fear for your le on a daily basis rocks you to your core, it strips your security, your mental health, your personality, your relationships and so much more, she told Wales Online. “I don’t know who I am anymore. I’m in a big and scary mess.”  Leah’s problems all began in February  when she started experiencing stroke-like symptoms. She called her mum who dialled  for an ambulance to take her to Ysbyty Glan Clwyd in Bodelwyddan, Denbighshire, Wales. “I was alright sat in AE and the symptoms went away,” she added. “They kept me in overnight and ordered a brain MRI to see whether I had multiple sclerosis.” Leah was discharged, but needed repeated visits to the hospital over the next few weeks as new symptoms began to emerge. “My legs would go from underneath me and I would get numbness in my ribs,” she added. “Then one day I ended up being admitted because I lost the ability to swallow. That was incredibly scary.”  After taking high doses of steroids, Leah said she began to suffer with terrying hallucinations, seeing “evil zombie faces” wherever she went. And following a lumbar puncture which took fluid out of her spine, she said her condition took another turn for the worse and left her unable to stand up. Doctors diagnosed her with cervical cord compression, spinal fluid leak and, according to a private neuroradiologist, a condition which causes instability of the spine called AAI. “AAI can’t be dealt with in Wales and potentially not the UK at all,” Leah told Wales Online.“It requires dangerous surgery that takes an experienced - and probably crazy - surgeon to undertake. “I’ve come so far on this journey already and there’s no way I’m giving up now. “My children deserve more than a mummy who’s just about existing.” Leah, whose children are now being looked after by her ex-husband and her family, has to permanently lie down as the pain in her head is too severe when she sits up.  “You can’t even call it a headache. It’s the worst head pain you can imagine,” she added. “It feels like my brain is being pulled every time I’m not lying down.” She has now set up a GoFundMe page in a bid to get more private appointments and to find out more about her debilitating conditions. She believes a specialist team in Barcelona, Spain, may be able to help with her AAI. I’m  years old with no medical training, yet I find myself having to be my own doctor, my own researcher, she said. I have to work out what scans, what specialists, who might be able to help, what move to make next and in what order while being as accurate with funds as possible so as not to waste any money that will hold up the next needed appointment.

Viktorija Sokolova, of Wolverhampton, was found dead by a passer-by after she was attacked in West Park near to her house on April . A post-mortem examination concluded that the -year-old, originally from Lithuania, died from a blunt force trauma to the head. Wolverhampton Crown Court has heard a -year-old, who cannot be named for legal reasons, murdered and anally raped Viktorija before having sex with her leless corpse. Today the court heard Viktorija had been in contact with the accused boy via Facebook before her death. But she had promised her parents she was not going to converse with stupid people while she was living in Ireland two months before her death.   The court heard she had been battered to the head, knocking out three teeth, and her clothes were soaked in blood when they were found in the park by police officers. Louise Oakley, prosecuting, said: Viktorija Sokolova was -years-old at the time of her death. At .pm on February  when she was in Ireland she send the following message to Saidas Valantinas, her step-father. She said Dad, I would like to apologise for everything I did in Wolverhampton. I promise not to converse with the stupid company and not to behave the way I behaved when I was living at yours. Please forgive me, good night. On April  she sent a message to her mother Karolina saying Im staying overnight at my friends - Im safe today. Tell coppers not to look for me as Im safe. X.  Ms Oakley said analysis of her Facebook account showed she had been in contact with the -year-old accused of her rape and murder prior to her death. Ms Oakley said: On April , a paramedic recovered items from the bench where Viktorija was found. These were a cigarette lighter, a piece of Rizla, a key to her home address, and a letter from the City of Wolverhampton Council - a medical consent form relating to a bruise being examined on her leg. Items recovered from West Park by police included a tooth from Viktorija found under a park bench, a piece of broken tooth from the floor of the pavilion and another tooth found under a bench at the back of the pavilion. Also found was a hooped earring on a bench inside the pavilion and a second hooped earring on the floor of the pavilion. A Nike baseball cap, which was white but heavily bloodstained, was found in a pool of blood on the floor of the pavilion. Also found was Viktorijas black and silver Vodafone mobile phone from the island in the boating lake.   Police seized a a pair of light pink ankle boots from the edge of the lake. A pair of white jeans - heavily bloodstained - were found inside a litter bin. Inside the jeans were a pair of black knickers. A post-mortem examination of the two teeth found and the tooth fragment concluded they were Viktorijas teeth. It was a left upper and lower canine and half an incisor. Experts concluded these had been knocked out her mouth by a violent, heavy blow or contact with a hard surface. Six other teeth were chipped. Toxicology showed a low concentration of alcohol in her blood. None was present in her urine. Alcohol can arise in the body after death. The results indicate that Viktorija would not have been intoxicated through alcohol or any [other drug] at the time she died. She had not consumed cannabis shortly before her death. Just after midnight on April , [the defendant] was arrested at home on suspicion of the murder of Viktorija. Information suggests he had contact with Viktorija just before her death. In his first interview on April  [before he was arrested], he was cautioned and provided a statement. He said I know nothing about the murder - I heard about it on the news.  Because the injured person started coming to my house at night I got annoyed so broke off with the messaging and havent seen her since. My Facebook was hacked last year. Later, he was talking very quietly and mumbling at the custody desk. On April , his home was searched. Several SMS messages and Facebook messenger calls were found but no Facebook messenger messages. These had been deleted. Records of calls made to Viktorijas phone had been deleted, as had the history of searches relating to anal sex. The court had previously heard the DNA of Mr Valantinas, Viktorijas step-father, had been found in her underwear. But yesterday, her parents angrily dismissed the defences notion they had anything to do with Viktorijas killing. Today, the court heard evidence Mr Valantinas was at home for the period when Viktorija was killed. Ms Oakley said: Saidas said that on the morning she was found, he made his way to work on a farm in the Shrewsbury, Shrops., area. His black Ford Focus was picked up by cameras on the A between Shrewsbury and Telford that morning, and after pm coming back. Detective constable Louise Dawber of West Midlands Polices homicide investigation team said cameras on Saidas road - Mostyn Street, Wolverhampton, - picked him up ing from work at .pm on April , the night before Viktorijas death. He was next seen leaving the street at .am the following morning - two hours before Viktorijas body was found in West Park. The -year-old denies charges of murder, rape and sexually penetrating her body. The trial, which is expected to last at least another week, will continue on December .

Butyoure one of the millions of us who struggle to hold back from the temptations of the festive season, you should also be applying some to your wrists. Thats the verdict of leading psychologist Jo Hemmings. Jo - who is a regular on TV shows including ITV’s Good Morning Britain and This Morning - reckons a chilly dab can be the perfect foil to our biggest festive desires. She explains: The reward centre sends out an initial positive message when we give in to these cravings and so it becomes incredibly dficult to resist.  One idea is to rub a few drops of iced water into your wrists - especiallyyou are beginning to feel jittery - as its known to reduce the temptation! Jo was giving her top tips for not giving in to temptation over the busy Christmas period - and speaking in particular about avoiding the urge for cigarettes. As the festive season approaches, it can feel increasingly dficult to go smoke-free or stay on trackyou have recently decided to give up smoking. There are many ways to give up smoking cigarettes - here are some suggestions to try and personal stories to watch for inspiration... QuitWillpower – many smokers succeed in quitting smoking by willpower alone. For inspiration on using willpower, check out Helenas story here. Cessation products include patches, gum or tablets – you can buy many over the counter but some are only available with a prescription from your doctor. For inspiration on using cessation products, check out Teris story here.Switch Switching to a smoke-free alternative is a route that millions of smokers have already used to give up smoking for good. There are more alternatives than ever before.Click here to see Kathleens story. Click here to see Vaughans story. But fear not! Below, Jo has given five key strategies you can put in place that will help you cope with the increased pressure of picking up a cigarette during the upcoming festive period...  - Make a ‘goal focused’ plan Jo says: Reward yourself with a small treatyou give up for a week, then another after a month and perhaps a big one, maybe a holiday or break away,you manage six months or a year. Holdmylight is a new and exciting approach to help smokers give up cigarettes for a month with the added help of incentives from friends. Its ideal for those looking to create a goal focused plan.  - Avoid triggers Jo says: There are definite trigger points that reduce our resistance and willpower, so often the key is to either adopt coping mechanisms that will make those situations a little easier to deal with or change your habits and create a new routine. Triggers can range from smoking shelters and too much alcohol to simply surrounding yourself with friends who smoke. When friends or family go outside for a cigarette, have an escape route planned. For example, call a friend or go to the loo to top up your make-up and break that routine of heading to the designated smoking spot. It’s also not the easiest time of year to regulate your alcohol intake, but given that booze is the number one reason people succumb to having a cigarette, it’s worth monitoring your drinking, by maybe having a soft drink between glasses of your tipple, to help keep your resolve. Your head might thank you for it in the morning too! - Quit together with a smoker friend  Its been well documented that one-to-one support is the most popular tool for quitting smoking.* Jo says positive moral support from family and friends can be invaluable and feels having someone gently encouraging in a non- judgmental manner, will be incredibly beneficial through the Christmas period. The Hold My Light campaign is centred around enrolling friends, family or colleagues to help you give up cigarettes and provides smokers with a choice of ways to go smoke-free. More information can be found on the Hold My Light website. Hold My Light has been designed to break down a big challenge into more manageable steps – maximising your chances of going smoke-free.Decide – to go smoke-free for  days Choose – your best way to give up cigarettes Start – Hold My Light and ask your friends to help Stay – on track and enjoy your successVisit Holdmylight for more information Jo says: Those words of encouragement and ongoing empathetic support, especially from former smokers, really help, as it resonates with those trying to give up cigarettes, as they know their supporter has been in the same position and succeeded. With support from those around you, you can go completely smoke-free either through sheer willpower or by using smoking cessation aids such as nicotine patches and gums.  - Get rid of all smoking paraphernalia Jo says: Throw out all of your lighters, old packets of cigarettes and ashtrays. If you’re struggling to stay smoke-free even after your attempts to quit using willpower or cessation products, look for smoke-free alternatives.  - And dont be afraid to say no to invites If you have to turn down a few party invites over Christmas to make going smoke-free a little easier, then do it. You are not being a party-pooper and can go to them next year when they will feel much more manageable.

Silverfish are ancient bugs which survive by eating pretty much everything, but they particularly like to tuck into dead skin cells and hair. They thrive in moist and damp conditions, which means homes across the UK face the risk of an invasion this winter as it gets wetter outside and we crank the heating up. The little bugs, which can jump up to two feet and live for eight years, have also been known to eat through wallpaper, books, curtains and cereal boxes. Leading property maintenance expert Ranjen Gohri, from | Home Rescue, said: Silverfish are actually the oldest known pests on earth.  Andyoure spotting tiny holes in your clothes or curtains, you might have an infestation without even realising it. Theyll eat anything. But skin cells are a delicacy to silverfish. And they like to leave their calling card - in the shape of tiny yellow stains wherever theyve been. As we dont tend to open windows and doors during the colder months, moisture from cooking, showering and drying clothes indoors cant escape. But thankfully the team at | Home Rescue have some advice on how to keep them away from your home. How to spot them There are a few easy to spot signs that you might have silverfish in your home. Ranjen says: Theyre quite secretive, but you may see them scurrying away in the middle of the night when youre making a loo visit. Keep your eyes peeled. You might also see droppings that look like smell pepper corns or pellets, or holes in your wallpaper, books or clothes. You might also find their shedded skin. Yes, throughout their long le they shed their skin - especially when going through adolescence. How to avoid getting them There are a few things you can do to keep your home free of the little bugs.  These include: Keep a clean home Ensure there are no food residues. Daily cleaning to keep on top of things and then a weekly good going over means silverfish wont have a good reason to stick around. Keep dust off books, and keep the bathroom floor mopped so theres no dead skins cells around. Chuck out your old newspapers mags so youre not leaving them things to chomp at. Make your own repellent You can make a homemade cleaner using equal parts of vinegar and water, plus a squirt of washing up liquid, then add  drops of peppermint oil and eucalyptus oil. That should have them turning away. Make a honey trap or use salt You can make a mixture using equal parts of baking soda and honey. Place the mixture on a piece of cardboard and put the cardboard in places youve seen silverfish.  The creatures also love salt but it causes dehydration so will kill them. Sprinkle it in areas where you have spotted them. Try garlic and essential oils They hate the smell of garlic, lemon, lavender, basic and oranges.Fix leaky pipes and taps Theyre not called silverfish for nothing. Leaks are magnets to them so do regular checks on taps and pipping throughout your home. Get a dehumidier If you house is damp, a dehumidier can keep the moisture down. But you should also have a damp house thoroughly checked as damp can cause a number of health issues. Have food on lockdown Keep everything in sealed containers. Silverfish have a penchant for pastas and cereals especially. Put cinnamon in your draws and cupboards too, it acts as a deterrent.

However, Ms Short believes that as more of the Central Waterfront takes shape, the public will come round.“A lot of people didn’t like the VA when the construction first started – but then took to defending it,” she said.“There will be a time with these buildings, too, that people start to take ownership of them. I think as it all takes shape people will start to feel more comfortable with it.”Last month, the Tele revealed the council plans to invest £m in the hotel directly opposite the VA. The -room development will be operated by Marriott Hotels under its AC brand, and feature a restaurant, bar, conference facilities and a gym.Martin Findlay, managing director of Living by Robertson, said: #As it’s still early in the Building Warrant process, we can only say at this stage that we hope to start construction in .#As soon as the necessary permissions are in place, we will be able to share visuals which we hope local people will find very tempting.”"},{"url":null,"title":"boss jim mcintyre hails dundees great hunger in awesome 4 0 hamilton accies rout","story":"Dundee boss Jim McIntyre hailed his side’s “great hunger” as they swept aside Hamilton Accies - to seal his first win in charge.And the Dens gaffer reserved special praise for the “fantastic” Kenny Miller, whose hat-trick propelled the Dark Blues to just their second Premiership win of the campaign.The victory saw Dundee move to within a point of th-placed St Mirren and kept Hamilton within reach, five points ahead in th.And Jim was delighted to see the improvements shown over the past few weeks in draws against the Buddies and Hibs come together to give him his first win as Dundee manager.He said: “There has definitely been progress before and it was clear to see against Hamilton.“I thought the players showed a great hunger. At times it was scrappy, Hamilton had a couple of opportunities as well which flew by the post, and shows games at this level are dficult to win but we got the breaks at the right times.“I thought in some of our play you could see a confidence appear when we got the second and third goal, we started to knock the ball about and created opportunities.“First and foremost we just wanted to win the game, it didn’t matter how but to score four goals was fantastic. We got a wee bit of luck with deflections with a couple of the goals but the most important thing for me was we were trying to do the right things, we were going into the right areas and encouraging more forward passes, more crosses into the box.“If you do that then sometimes you get the wee breaks, which we did.”Jesse Curran grabbed his first senior goal with the aid of a deflection but it was hat-trick hero Miller who grabbed the limelight.Jim added: “He was fantastic.“I think he said it was the seventh or eighth hat-trick of his career and to do it at , Kenny deserves a lot of credit.“His second and third goals were great finishes.“I’m delighted for him but more so the team because it was great to keep the clean sheet, especially with Darren O’Dea going off just at the end.“I was desperate to keep that clean sheet because I thought the boys deserved it and big Jack Hamilton came up with a big save to play his part.”O’Dea is likely to miss out against Rangers on Sunday with a possible tear in his groin muscle."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/12/5c07d657d12d4.jpg ","title":"dundee united can follow ayrs example in how to react to a rout","story":"Dundee United are licking their wounds after a mauling dished out by Ayr at the weekend – to get back on track, though, they can take a leaf out of the Honest Men’s book.The Tangerines were given a home humbling by former manager Ian McCall’s league leaders on Friday night to bring Robbie Neilson’s Tannadice revival to a shuddering halt.The United boss has described the result as a “boulder in the road” rather than just a bump and is hoping his side can put the result firmly behind them by going straight out and making it six wins from Robbie’s first eight matches in charge by beating Greenock Morton on Saturday.And for inspiration they don’t have to look too far.Just like United were going into Friday night’s clash, Ayr were riding the crest of a wave at the start of the season.Seven wins and two draws from their opening nine fixtures of the campaign saw them continue the superb form that led them to the League One title last season.That run included a - win at Dens Park against Premiership Dundee, where the Honest Men completely outplayed the top-flight side, and a - home win over a Dunfermline side that had started the campaign strongly, too.Then, however, came their own shuddering halt to the form that had seen them sweep almost all before them on September  at Palmerston.Queen of the South had enjoyed a fairly up-and-down beginning to the season and weren’t expected to be the first team to stop Ayr’s momentum.A first-half blitz, however, shocked the rest of the Championship as Queens rattled up a four-goal lead inspired by their main man Stephen Dobbie and his partner-in-crime Gary Harkins.A hat-trick inside  minutes had the Doonhamers cruising before Harkins curled in against his old side with  minutes on the clock.Dobbie added a fourth in the closing stages to seal victory and give the Honest Men their first real test of the campaign.Many expected the wheels to come off at that point, as has happened to plenty of teams before, and for the newly- promoted Honest Men to fall back down the table.That looked the case the following week, too, as Falkirk, under new boss Ray McKinnon, raced into a - lead within  minutes at Somerset Park.However, that’s where the rot stopped – something Dundee United will be keen to emulate this coming Saturday, though they’d prefer not to give hosts Morton a lead first.The second half saw Lawrence Shankland find the net before a quickfire double from Andy Geggan and a Leo Fasan own goal gave Ayr the kind of response Robbie Neilson is desperate for.From there, McCall’s side have lost just the once – to Ross County – and drawn with Queens and Morton to regain top spot in the table.And they more than cemented that on Friday night at Tannadice.The question now for Dundee United is whether they can emulate their title rivals by getting back on form as quickly as possible.Victory against Morton would be one step closer to the manager’s goal of promotion while anything  would allow both Ayr and Ross County to open up a sizeable gap above the Tannadice club.However, Ayr have shown the Tangerines how to recover from a hammering – the test for Robbie Neilson and his men is whether they can do the same to get that “boulder” out of their way, starting on Saturday at Cappielow."},{"url":null,"title":"neil mccann claims outside influences led to dundee sack","story":"Former Dundee manager Neil McCann has defended his time in charge of the club, claiming ‘outside influences’ had a part to play in his dismissal.McCann was relieved of his duties at Dens Park in October – leaving the Dark Blues marooned at the foot of the Premiership table with just three points to their name after eight games.And asked why he feels he was let go, despite talk of an experienced No  coming in to help him which never came to fruition, he said: “I don’t know.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

We have ended up with the worst of all possible outcomes, with England and Wales voting to leave and leaving, Northern Ireland voting to remain and retaining a foothold into the EU and Scotland who voted to remain being completely dragged out against its will.No one should fall for this  choice being desperately spun by this isolated Tory Prime Minister, that seeks to force us to choose between a #bad deal# or a #no deal# at all.Brendan O#Hara MP, Argyll and ButeSir,We expect over  schools to be represented at next year’s Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships, based on the number of school pupils being taught in programmes run by the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust .The trust now has projects going in  council areas supporting lessons to over , young people.We are getting a large number of enquiries from schools wanting to come along to the event on March  in Livingston.SSPDT aims to safeguard our wonderful musical traditions and to help young people develop skills for le, learning and work, with a focus on deprived and remote areas, by helping to introduce piping and drumming tuition to state schools on a par with orchestral instruments.We established the championships in  to offer a positive and friendly experience for players who are new to competition, and as a forum for bands at the very top of their game.The trust has resources to support more state schools in Scotland to introduce piping and drumming tuition, and we invite local education authorities, teachers and parents to contact us.All enquiries can be made via our website sspdt.org.ukAlexandra Duncan, chief executive, Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums TrustSir,Having campaigned extensively for the re-opening of the A after a landslide in October, I welcome Cabinet Secretary Michael Matheson’s commitment to identying a permanent solution to disruption on the road, whilst continuing to invest in shorter term mitigation measures.Closures to the A lead to untenable ersions and re-routing of traffic onto other roads, which is why is absolutely essential for permanent measures to be put in place to end these closures.The safety of the people who use this road has always been the top priority for the Scottish Government, and I am grateful to all those who have been involved in working towards a practical solution to make this road accessible for local people, visitors and businesses in my constituency.Michael Russell MSP, Argyll and ButeSir,The withdrawal agreement with the European Union has now been published.Our industry has consistently called for clarity over what that UK’s new relationship with the EU will look like in practice, particularly on the continued protection of geographical indications, customs procedures and future trade policy.The provisions set out in the withdrawal agreement provide us with a credible foundation on which to build in the next phase of the negotiations, during which a number of critical issues remain to be resolved.A no-deal Brexit would cause the Scotch whisky industry considerable dficulties and would force cost and complexity into production, distribution and exporting.  The withdrawal agreement is a compromise, but it is a positive step towards much needed business certainty.Karen Betts, chief executive, Scotch Whisky AssociationSir,I am struck by the comments of Theresa May that her Brexit plan will stop EU migrants #jumping the queue# when it comes to working in the UK.How low the UK has sunk that its Brexiteer government is now resorting to spreading resentment towards European citizens, classing them as #queue jumpers#. These iniduals took no part in this mess and work here legally and contribute to the country in so many dferent ways.They have the same general right of freedom of movement that allows British people the opportunity to work in Berlin and Paris, or retire in Spain.Even so, their reward seems to be an increasingly hostile atmosphere. Ms May makes no mention of those British #queue jumpers# in other EU countries, symptomatic no doubt of the same attitude that classes those Brits abroad as #expats#, while those from the other EU countries who come to work here are #immigrants#, an increasingly negative term.Since the referendum in  there has been an alarming increase in both veiled and more explicit verbal abuse to EU nationals, and this will no doubt increase as the negative impacts of Brexit become clearer and scapegoats will be required. Step forward those innocent EU nationals in our midst.The UK has taken a wrong turn, as exhibited by the dog-whistle politics of Theresa May and her Tory government.As the UK enters full panic mode, the victim of a bitter and corrupted Etonian gamble gone very wrong, we must do all that we can to support those EU nationals in our midst and defy this vile populist rhetoric.Alex Orr,  Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"south argyll schools reach bowl final","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowSouth Argyll Schoolstravelled to Eastwood High School in Glasgow on Tuesday November  to play in the Scottish Schools Bowl semi-final.The game was played in good conditions and the team were looking forward to building on their recent quarter final performance.The game started with an early converted try for SAS but they were pulled back to - by half time.

No wonder he looked nervous.The boys got to grips with the dferent handling characteristics of Willie Senior#s car and started to up the pace in the afternoon bringing the car home in a respectable th overall and third in class three. This result was enough to secure second position in the overall championship in class.Jamie Miller continued the learning process with the little Citroen C-RMax with Ian McCulloch pointing him in the right direction. A very neat rally from Jamie with very few mistakes saw him finish a creditable th overall and second in class two, only beaten by the Scottish Tarmac Champion for  Michael Harbour in his similar Citroen, who was only one place above him after seven stages.Innes Mochrie was once again out on the stages in the Mightyand this time he had someone whom he might listen to in the co-driver#s seat. His daughter, Kirsty, had elected to fill the silly seat for this event and they, after a few first stage detours, managed to keep speaking right to the end and brought the class one pocket rocket home in th overall and a brilliant second in class. The mind boggles as to what the result could have been , as Kirsty was heard to remark, she had #someone who would listen to her#.Jonothan MacDonald and Chris Wareham were out in the beautully prepared Mull of Kintyre Cheese sponsored Peugeot . Their pace was good enough for th overall and fourth in class three.Mull pair Malcolm MacDougall and Stuart MacLean were out in the class one Vauxhall Nova and were getting visibly quicker as the day went on, a trend that had repeated itself over the course of the year with confidence and technique increasing with every stage mile covered. They finished th overall and a commendable fourth in class one.There were three Argyll co-drivers directing their pilots around the airfield. Ian Parker, recently announced as one of seven # and the only Scot # co-drivers to be selected to join the MSA Academy for , was back in the Honda Civic of Fraser Smith. The Civic screamed its way round the stages with minimal fuss, other than perhaps a lucky trip on two wheels after clipping a tyre, to finish in nd overall and fourth in class two.The final Argyll man out was Eoghan Anderson from Cairnbaan who was shouting left and right for Greg Inglis of Montrose in his quick and agile Lotus Exige. Eoghan had been co-driver for Alan Kirkaldy in the earlier Granite Stages Rally, also held at Leuchars, and they had been first overall that day, so no pressure there, then.Greg found the Lotus was almost perfect for the stages on the day with a great balance of handling, braking and pace when needed. They were surprised, perhaps unjustly, to find out they were sitting well up the leader board after the first few stages. They got the hammer down over the last three and were to finish fth overall and first in class three.They were beaten only by the Kirkaldy brothers, both in Escort MkII#s of the highest calibre, and two WRC cars driven by Brian Watson and Reay Mackay.Last but not least, Oban#s Angus MacNeil was out with Sam MacFadyen in Brian Watson#s Mitsubishi Evo  binging it home unscathed in th overall.The event was won by Alan Kirkaldy in a freshly built Escort MkII, followed by his circuit racer brother Andrew in secondand Reay Mackay taking the last podium place in his WRC Fiesta. This was a fitting finish to the Championship at Leuchars with very fast stages and a good test of manand machine in equal measures.Photographs by West Coast Photos."},{"url":null,"title":"speedy kirsty points the way ahead for dad","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowAt the age of , Kirsty Mochrie made her first outing as navigator for Innes Mochrie at the  Kingdom Stages rally.Seasoned campaigner Innes, who happens to be Kirsty#s dad, was well guided around the course in their Kilmory Coachworks .Kirsty#s gran Libby told the Advertiser: #She just loved it.

Darren Boyd, of Thornyflat Street in Ayr, admitted to assaulting David Mackie on July  this year at McLean Street in Ayr. He also owned up to uttering threats of violence towards him. Boyd appeared before Sherf Scott Pattison at Ayr Sherf Court last week. The court heard how the -year-old ‘repeatedly punched’ Mr Mackie on the head. Depute Fiscal Andrew Lazzarin explained: “At around pm, the complainers were at their home when they heard a noise and went to see what it was. There was a household item lying in the garden. They went to speak to the neighbour about why this was there. “The accused was in the neighbour’s house and assaulted the complainer by repeatedly punching him on the head. “The complainer then went home and the accused went back into the neighbour’s house. The police were contacted and the complainer had a small cut on his lip - he was taken to AE. “Police were unable to find the accused as he had left the neighbours house at that time. “On another occasion, it seems that the complainers were driving to the locus and the accused was shouting towards them saying, “I am going to kick your c**t in”.  “Police were contacted again about these matters.” Defending Boyd, Tony Currie added that Mr Mackie was the neighbour of his partner and there had been “ongoing issues” between them. He said: “These incidents were because of his partner’s ongoing issues with the complainer. “She was receiving ongoing complaints from them. “He had been at his partner’s house at the moment the complainer came to the door, who was kicking the door and was challenging towards his partner. “She was heavily pregnant at the time.” Mr Currie added that there has been no further issues in the interim and the couple are hoping to relocate. Sherf Pattison said: “I was considering sending you to jail - you need to know that this type of violence cannot continue.” As an alternative to custody, Sherf Pattison ordered Boyd to carry out a community payback order with  hours of unpaid work to be completed in nine months.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"ayrshire swimmer 67 proves age","story":"NewsAyrshire swimmer, , proves age is no barrier after scooping medal on debutHe finished the ‘swimming marathon’ at Tollcross in Glasgow in a very impressive .:.ShareByGary Fanning:,  DEC NewsDundonald swimmer Sandy Mavor \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailSwimmer Sandy Mavor proved age is no barrier as he claimed a bronze medal on his competitive debut at the Scottish National Masters m Championships. The -year-old finished the ‘swimming marathon’ at Tollcross in Glasgow in a very impressive .:. Sandy trains with the Masters squad at North Ayrshire Swimming at the Portal in Irvine after taking up the sport again when he retired seven years ago. “I swam at school a long time ago,” he explained. “I did the Loch Lomond  mile swim, and the Cumbrae to Largs in August, so I thought I’d try a pool swim. “The coaches here were brilliant here when I arrived. They couldn’t have been more welcoming and helpful - especially for refining my e off the starter blocks! “I think Masters is not quite so competitive so you can just go along and enjoy it. It’s good exercise and you get a good community and it keeps you fit and ticking over.” His first pool race didn’t go entirely to plan, it seems. “I got this racing ‘bullet cap’ and they told me to put another one underneath to stop it coming off, but it didn’t seem to work,” he laughs.  “I don’t know at what point I lost it but apparently I was in the lead for the first eight laps so maybe that was when it happened  I managed to retrieve it from the bottom of the pool at the end of the race, though, and I was very proud to be wearing the North Ayrshire cap.” Sandy’s success shows that swimming is a sport for all ages, with the benefits increasing as we get older as an ideal form of resistance training which is also kind to the joints. “It’s never too late,” said Sandy from Dundonald. “I speak to a lot of people who’ve never done crawl and they say ‘I could never do that’ but I’ve heard of beginners starting really quite late on in le. Initially they can’t swim onebut before they know it they’re swimming a mile. Once they’ve cracked the mental barrier they’re away.” Masters swimming is increasing in popularity, according to North Ayrshire’s head coach, Jess Wilkie. “It’s good for all ages to come down and meet new people and learn new skills, which you can’t beat,” she says. “We like to keep it ied and try and do a bit of everything to suit everyone from distance swimmers to those who want to come in and do a bit of technique work. “What we always say is that there’s a lane for everyone – it doesn’t matter what speed you swim, you can still participate. “I think the oldest swimmer we have is in her s and she’s still firing up and down the pool and matching younger guys.” “There are plenty of sessions to choose from whether you’re a morning person or prefer to exercise in the evenings.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13689315.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS170228854.jpg","title":"ayr uniteds somerset park football","story":"NewsAyr Uniteds Somerset Park football ground damaged as car ploughs into turnstilesThe vehicle smashed into historic Somerset Park shortly before pm last night.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsSomerset Park damaged after car crashes into ground\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA football clubs stadium has been badly damaged after a car ploughed straight through its turnstiles.

However, when the fall of communism led to the break-up of Yugoslavia, war came to Bosnia in , driven in part by Serbiarsquos desire to create a lsquoGreater Serbiarsquo, including large parts of Bosnia, from which they planned to remove Croats and Muslims in what became known as lsquoethnic cleansingrsquo.Our delegation leader Resad Trbonja was , living in Sarajevo. On April , , he woke to find his city under siege, surrounded by Serbian artillery and snipers on the mountains overlooking the city. The siege would last four years, the longest in modern warfare, longer than Stalingrad. An average of  mortars landed in the city every day, , on the worst day.Resad, who lived through, and fought in, the siege, explained that Sarajevo regressed two centuries overnight ndash no water, no electricity, no phones. The Serbian army allowed minimal UN aid into the city sporadically but nothing .The survival of the siege is a story of human courage, spirit and defiance.Our first visit was to the remnants of a tunnel, dug under Sarajevo airport to reach Bosnian-held territory on the other side. This tiny tunnel was the only way in or out for four years.Through this tunnel extra aid came, for example from Edinburgh Direct Aid, who drove lorries of supplies from Edinburgh to help Sarajevans. My own predecessor, John Home Robertson, then MPfor East Lothian, spent several Parliamentary recesses as a volunteer lorry driver. It was dangerous work and one of his colleagues died on the notorious road known as lsquoSnipers Alleyrsquo.Perhaps the most affecting visit in Sarajevo was to the War Childhood Museum, where those who grew up in the siege display the things they kept to remind them of what it was like, and tell their story.A homemade cardboard knightrsquos breastplate made by a brother who later died a cuddly toy from a UN delivery, cuddled threadbare because it was the only toy a homemade lsquounormrsquo for a childrenrsquos choir which rehearsed and performed in defiance of bombs and bullets the remains of a playpark lsquojungle gymrsquo kept to remember the day a mortar tore it apart and killed your friend ndash no one who visits this museum will forget it.That is true too of Srebrenica. This was supposedly a lsquosafe havenrsquo protected by UN troops. Yet on July , Serbian paramilitary units overran it. Thousands of Bosnian Muslims sought refuge in the UN base at a disused factory.When we visited the museum now sited there, survivor Hasan Hasanovic explained to us how UN soldiers stood by as women and children were herded onto buses and deported, while their men were separated and removed in lorries. They were systematically murdered nearby. Thousands more who tried to escape through the forest were hunted down, shepherded into a meadow, and shot. In all, , Bosnian Muslim men and boys were slaughtered at Srebrenica.Finally, the international community acted. In a matter of days, air strikes lted the siege of Sarajevo, drove Serbian paramilitaries out of much of the territory they had occupied, and forced agreement to a peace deal signed in Dayton, Ohio.Srebrenica was not the only genocide in this war, but it is emblematic because it happened under the noses of the UN and because of the bravery of the Mothers of Srebrenica, who ed home to find out what happened to their husbands and sons, refused to be silenced, and demanded justice.This led to the International Commission on Missing Persons and the forensic anthropology unit in Tuzla, where we saw the incredible work done to identy remains using DNA. More than , victims of genocide have now been identied, allowing their families to grieve and to bury them at the final stop of our visit.We arrive at the cemetery at Potaceri, outside Srebrenica, as the sun sets. On the hillside, , stark white tombstones bring home the enormity of what was done over only a few days a mere  years or so ago.More than , died at Srebrenica , perished in Sarajevo , women suffered rape as an act of war millions fled their homes, some even finding their way to the refugee reception centre at Cheylesmore Lodge in North Berwick.All the survivors I met asked the same question: why did so much suffering have to happen before the international community acted to stop it  In telling us their story, they relived their own pain. They did so in the hope that we learn the lessons of Bosnia. We need only look at Syria or Yemen to know that we have not.That is why we must remember Srebrenica.If any local groups would like to hear more about the work of Remembering Srebrenica, please contact my office on  ."},{"url":null,"title":"the-best-fortnite-gifts-for-christmas-2018","story":"Fortnite is the most popular video game of the year and has taken over not just everyonersquos console, but Christmas lists up and down the country too.If you have family members, big or small, who are mad for Fortnite but find yourself utterly clueless as to what itrsquos all about or what to get someone who loves it for Christmas, we can help out with this guide to everything Fortnite from the game itself to presents you should buy this year.*On some occasions, we earn revenue from content.

Crucially, however, those behind the productions ndash many of whom are women ndash are keen to ensure this approach doesnrsquot come at the expense of boys, or indeed the fun, excitement and laughter that have always been the heart of Christmas shows.Gender politics was very much in the mind of director Eleanor Rhode as she worked on Wendy and Peter Pan for the Lyceum Theatre in Edinburgh. The clue to her outlook is in the name of the production ndash Wendy takes centre stage.ldquoPeter Pan is the most wonderful story but traditionally Wendy has always been a bit wet, explains Ms Rhodes, who last year wowed audiences and critics alike with her production of Boudica at Shakespearersquos Globe in London. ldquoIn this show she throws off the shackles ndash Wendy is definitely the protagonist.ldquoPeter Pan has a big part to play too, obviously, but the show asks some fundamental questions about why it always has to be the girl that is the character looking after everyone, the prim and proper one, rather than the one who gets to have adventures.ldquoBut the production isnrsquot just about the fact that women are as capable as men and need to have a stronger voice. Itrsquos also about the roles we force men and boys into.Ms Rhode was inspired to work in the theatre after seeing Shakespearersquos Twelfth Night as a child, a play renowned for its strong female roles.ldquoI remember how exciting it was to see someone who looked like me on the stage, someone I could connect with, she says. ldquoA girl was at the heart of the action ndash she was the strong one, with all the best lines, leading the story. That was really important for me.As the recent furore over the first female Doctor Who ndash played by Jodie Whittaker ndash revealed, some are still critical of what they perceive as equality being forced upon society, especially when it means ldquomessing with the classics. How would the director respond to the accusation that presenting a new, more feminist Wendy betrays JM Barriersquos original ldquoFor me,you deliver the goods with an entertaining piece of theatre that has something to say, no one will go home disappointed.

Ms Sydney is directing an all-female Christmas production at Glasgowrsquos Tron Theatre, aimed at the under-six age group.Remember December follows Flora, a forgetful little girl who has forgotten to post her letter to Santa. ldquoWhen conceiving the show it was important to reinforce the idea that girls can take the lead, be brave, physical and strong, explains the director. ldquoFlora scales a mountain, goes skiing and paddles on river rapids. The bond between grandparent and child is very important to this show, and Flora and her granny are active, physical people.ldquoBoys should have good female role models, too. I have two young sons and they are not put off by female-centred narratives or female protagonists. But gender-biased attitudes are embedded deeply into our society and when you rock the status quo people can feel a bit scared. Wersquore not taking roles models away from boys ndash wersquore just showing that it shouldnrsquot matter.Ms Sydney is keenly aware of the unique place pantos and festive shows have in our hearts ndash and the opportunities they present.ldquoChristmas shows are particularly important because for many people, especially children, itrsquos the only time of the year they come to the theatre, she says. ldquoItrsquos vital that theatre makers make the right choices.Wendy and Peter Pan is at the Lyceum in Edinburgh until anuary .

What better things did others have to do given the depth of the crisis that the UK Government is now engulfed in As for the Prime Minister, she was ensconced in her Berkshire bunker, no doubt contemplating the twists and turns that the next few days might bring and whether she will still be in Downing St by the end of it.Mrs May could also be forgiven for watching Saturday nightrsquos Sunday papers review from behind her Maidenhead sofa as they are likely to be full of screaming headlines about insurmountable parliamentary numbers, threats of ministerial resignations and impending confidence votes in her and her government.Of course, given the off-on and then off-again saga of the televised debate, the PM can now at least spend Sunday evening watching Strictly while her Labour counterpart sits glued to the final of Irsquom a Celebrity.But it will be an all-too-brief respite from Brexit and its political ramications in the coming days.Tory Remainer Justine Greening, the former Education Secretary, warned her party thatit continued to be consumed by Brexit, then it would lose the support of Middle England to another party that occupied the centre and centre-right ground. And she said thatthe Tories did not change, they would never have another landslide election victory.ldquoThe Conservative party has failed to really change, declared Ms Greening. ldquoItrsquos almost like weve got this Old Testament of how Margaret Thatcher did politics and, of course, then it was absolutely current and relevant for Britain but not enough people in our party are looking at who are we now whats Conservatism in the st century stand for now, the London MP told the BBCrsquos Nick Robinson in his Political Thinking podcast.Oh and she also said she would be prepared to consider throwing her hat in the ringMrs May left her leadership role willingly or otherwise next week.On Monday, after a weekend of what s, MPsto Westminster to debate the Brexit Bill and the Union.There will be lots of talk about Northern Ireland and the impenetrable backstop to the backstop issue as well as about Scotland and the possible knock-on effect of a second independence referendum. I can hear Brenda from Bonnyrigg now.In the past few days there has been serious talk of Mrs May pulling the vote. Advice that came not only from some of her ministers but also from Sir Graham Brady, who chairs the  backbench committee. Indeed, Tony Blair waded in to echo the advice, noting there was no point in crashing into a ldquobrick wall at speed.What has apparently irked the PMrsquos closest colleagues is that when she stonewalls in public about a Plan B, she does the same to them in private.Now it could well be in this unpredictable dimension we call Brexit that Mrs May pulls off an outstanding parliamentary escape on Tuesday that would outshine even Harry Houdini. But I very much doubt it.So what happens when MPs pull the plug on the PMrsquos Brexit Plan  There is a suggestion that those kind souls in Brussels will offer a helping hand and say the EU is willing to extend Article  for a couple of months to allow the UK more time to pull itself together. Yet the deal agreed last month is legally binding and unchangeable. So it is unlikely there will be any sympathy on the continent.Mrs May has been looking at other options, flying a parliamentary kite about giving MPs a say nearer the time in spring  when the UK and EU will have to determine whether or not a trade agreement can be agreed by the December of that year. Probably not.So MPs could at that point choose to see the dreaded backstop introduced from January  or vote to extend the transition, which would maintain the status quo for however many more months including compliance with the loathed Common Fisheries Policy. Which, of course, would send Scottish Conservatives into a blue funk, not least David Mundell, the Scottish Secretary.If the PM goes ldquodown in a blaze of glory, as one colleague suggested she was determined to do, what happens Her suggestion of a ldquoparliamentary lock has all been about damage limitation trying to peel away as many Tory rebels as she can to keep the numbers manageable. Anything below  is just about manageable anything above it becomes trickier. Anything above  and the smell of toast will be in the air at Westminster.Labourrsquos Sir Keir Starmer has already suggested that it is ldquoinevitable that Labour would next Wednesday put down a confidence vote in the Conservative Government. But the Democratic Unionists have already indicated they would support the Tories in that scenario.So the prospect of another general election would then evaporate.But Mrs May will not be out of the woods yet. If the Tory rebellion on the meaningful vote on the PMrsquos Brexit Plan is more than , then the prospect of another confidence vote, a Conservative one in Mrs Mayrsquos leadership, looms large.If this were to happen, then, once again, it would be about the scale of the rebellion.Already, there are suggestions of backbenchers are being nodded and winked at about future government rolesthey backed a certain senior colleague should Mrs May be history by next Friday.The names being bandied around the oak-led corridors include Jeremy Hunt, Sajid Javid and Amber Rudd all, of course, Remainers. Then there is Boris, waiting in the wings, and still waiting for the rugby ball to come out of the scrum.It should be remembered that the ultimate choice in any leadership contest goes to the Conservative Party membership and the grassroots appear far more pro-Leave than some of their MPs at Westminster.As the Brexit deal vote approaches on Tuesday, it is well to note that we are living in extraordinary political times. The countryrsquos future is up in the air as, indeed, is Mrs Mayrsquos and the Conservative Governmentrsquos.The moment of truth comes on Tuesday evening but, given the nature of this particular political beast, therersquoll be another one along soon after.

There is no equivalent to Scheduled Ancient Monument status, which important archaeological sites have.The Woodland Trust says that ldquothe famous Fortingall Yew highlights the disparity.Found growing in the churchyard of the Perthshire village which shares its name, it is among the oldest trees in Europe ndash modern experts estimate the tree is between , and , years old, although others believe it could be a remnant of a post-Roman Christian site dating back , years.According to folklore, Pontius Pilate ndash the Roman governor who oversaw the crucixion of Jesus ndash was born in its shade and played there as a child.But the Trust points out that it is the wall around the tree that attracts formal legal protection, rather than the tree itself.ldquoAncient trees are as much a part of our heritage as stately homes, cathedrals and works of art, but they donrsquot get the same protection, Ms Harrison Mellor adds.Vital statistics of the Murthly Castle tree were taken on Thursday afternoon by Judy Dowling from St Andrews, Joan Sneddon from Largo, Noel Fojut from Berwickshire, Clair McFarlan from Dumfries and Lorna Holl from Balmaha.It was recorded with a remarkable trunk girth of . metres. The tree itself is estimated to be more than  years old. Ms Dowling, who is lead verier for Scotland said: ldquoIt is amazing to reach this milestone, but we still have lots to do.ldquoWe hear about new trees all the time and I always have my eyes peeled wherever I go around the country. It takes you to some amazing places. I have just loved being a part of this.Welcoming the tree hunters to Castle Murthly Estate, Thomas Steuart Fothringham said: ldquoWe are delighted our sweet chestnut is the ,th tree to go on the inventory.ldquoThe designed landscape has been a feature at Murthly for half a millennium and continues to be highly valued.There are  trees which are so iconic they have their own inidual names such as Capon Oak, Mar Lodge Granny Pine, Drumlanrig Sycamore, Rizziorsquos Chestnut and Glen Lyon Ash.In October, a spruce tree on the Isle of Eriskay in the Outer Hebrides was named Scotlandrsquos Tree of the Year.Nettyrsquos Tree was nominated in the Woodland Trust competition by Eoina Wilson, who lives in Inverness but originally comes from the island. Judges chose six trees from public nominations which were then put to an online vote.The spruce was, until recent times, the only tree on the windswept island.It was planted more than  years ago by the poet, priest and land rights activist Father Allan McDonald, whose best-known poem was Eilein na hrsquoOige ndash The Island of the Young.It is named after Netty MacDonald, who lived on the nearby croft and encouraged all the islandrsquos children to play on the tree as their cries and laughter reminded her of her own family who had grown up and moved away to find work on the mainland.A map of all the recorded trees can be viewed at ati.woodlandtrust.org.uk."},{"url":null,"title":"how-secrets-of-12th-century-scots-castle-were-lost-in-the-mists-of-time","story":"The exploration of Mote of Urr in Dumfries and Galloway spanned three years and dug into  years of Scottish history. Perhaps given such a vast timescale, there was no urgent need to share the findings.Indeed, itrsquos only now,  years after the meticulous excavation took place and possibly hindered by the lead archaeologistrsquos well-known sluggish approach to putting his research into print, that the fine details of excavations have finally been published.The dig at the th-century Norman motte and bailey castle site at Mote of Urr, near Dalbeattie ndash said to be one of the most extensive sites of its kind in Scotland ndash were undertaken in  and , and led by Brian Hope-Taylor, one of the UKrsquos most revered archaeologists and a familiar face on s television history programmes.The intention was to uncover relics that could point to the daily le of the wooden castle and the identities of the occupants of the two-hectare site over hundreds of years which, despite its scale and prominence on the landscape, were largely lost in time.Buthistorians and locals were eagerly awaiting news of the secrets lurking at the curious bulging mound remains at Mote of Urr, they would be sadly disappointed.And it would take the exhaustive piecing together of Hope-Taylorrsquos notes and  years after his death before the work could finally be shared.ldquoBrian Hope-Taylor was a charismatic and perspicacious scholar, says Professor Barbara Crawford of the University of St Andrews and University of the Highlands and Islands, in the newly published report. ldquoLike some other archaeologists Hope-Taylor did not find it easy to write up the results of his excavations for final publication.Famed for his work on Anglo-Saxon and early medieval sites in Scotland and England, he undertook excavations at Bamburgh, Lindisfarne and York Minster, one of his key interests was in motte-and-bailey castles, wooden structures built on top of a raised earthwork such as at Mote of Urr.But archaeology fees paid little ndash perhaps a reason for his sluggish approach to report writing ndash and Hope-Taylor, who had also received a ldquosevere dressing down from superiors over delays in reporting findings from a major excavation of an Anglo Saxon site at Yeavering in Northumberland, is thought to have shelved certain projects either because they failed to produce obvious results or because he sought others which may have been more lucrative.His death in  led to scores of papers relating to several archaeological excavations being retrieved from his house and garage, with many relating to Scottish excavations being delivered to the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland ndash now Historic Environment Scotland.Funding from Historic Scotlandand English Heritage, meant they could be finally assessed, sorted, conserved and, at last in the case of Mote of Urr, published. The work, which has been supplemented by an exhaustive historical investigation by Professor Richard Oram of Stirling University, sheds fresh light on the ownership of the site down the centuries even though it reveals Hope-Taylor found a surprising lack of material to support existing understanding of its origins.For although records point to the castle being under the possession of Walter de Berkeley, the th-century Great Chamberlain of William , Hope-Taylorrsquos team of archaeologists could not find any pottery linked to that era.ldquoHope-Taylor dated the construction and earliest occupation at Mote of Urr to the late th century, with continued occupation into the th century, says David Perry of Alder Archaeology, who worked on the report.Catherine Smith, who worked on analysing bone fragments found by Hope-Taylorrsquos team, said he may have deliberately delayed writing his report of the excavation with the intention of ing in the future.She said: ldquoHope-Taylor was a very eminent archaeologist and itrsquos possible that he was saying to himself that hersquod just finish one project and go back to Mote of Urr, but never did.ldquoWe donrsquot know why he didnrsquot finish it. Itrsquos possible that he didnrsquot discover enough about it at the time and he knew it would require more work.While Hope-Taylorrsquos records of the excavation are said to be ldquoan important contribution to the study of mottes in Scotland, Mr Perry said they raise more questions than answers.ldquoFollowing his investigations of the motte in  and  Hope-Taylor had originally planned toto Mote of Urr in order to excavate its surrounding bailey. Had he been able to do so, some of the questions regarding the period during which the whole site was occupied and how the motte related to others in Scotland and the north of England might have been answered.ldquoOr, as is so often the case in archaeology, yet more questions might have been raised."},{"url":null,"title":"green-energy-revolution-unfolds-yards-from-celtic-park","story":"The first hole, which was drilled yesterday just across the road from Celtic Park, is part of a project with so much research potential that scientists, academics and businesses from all over the world will be looking to Glasgow to inform the energy projects of tomorrow.The  boreholes across the city will record data as part of the UK Geoenergy Observatoriesproject andsuccessful could see parts of the city being heated from old mine workings and the technology to be exported to other cities across the globe.The pound million project will record information about the rocks to an unprecedented level, with some going down almost  metres into the ground.The East End sits on the old mines which contain warm water, which have the potential to be used to heat homes and businesses in the area.This data will then be shared for free to anyone who wants to access it, meaning students, academics, scientists, and businessmen across the world can access this data and use it to inform their own research and innovations.Zoe Shipton, professor of geological engineering at the University of Strathclyde, said: ldquoBig science questions need big pieces of kit.

We need to take all that knowledge from oil and gas and take it across to geothermal so that we can run with that given itrsquos carbon free.ldquoHot water coming from the inside of the earth can be used to heat peoplersquos houses. Wersquore also interested in energy storage ndash what came up can come down, so it is possible for us to put heat from the surface into underground stores and take it back out again when we need it in winter. Hot summers can be captured, put underground and taken out again.\"As well as asking the big scientic questions, which could revolutionise the way we think about heating or homes and storing energy, the boreholes will also be exploring the possibility of heating the local area of the East End and Clyde Gateway.Although renewable energy is good at generating electricity, heat is more dficult to transport and store. Last year Scotland produced only six per cent of its heat from renewable sources, compared to % of its electricity.Ian Manson, chief executive of Clyde Gateway, said: ldquoThe East End has a history of great industry and to regenerate the area we need to look at the industries of the future. We hope this project will create a greater focus on renewables and bring engineering companies and jobs to the area.ldquoWersquove got the target of achieving , jobs for this area, wersquove already attracted , ndash some of which are in renewables.ldquoWersquore looking at the low hundreds, but therersquos no reason why we shouldnrsquot be aiming at the thousands for jobs in this area."},{"url":null,"title":"kt-tunstall-and-amy-macdonald-to-perform-at-sleep-in-the-park","story":"The singers will start the night in Aberdeen before being taken by helicopter to gigs in the other participating cities ndash Dundee, Glasgow and Edinburgh.Organisers of Sleep in the Park hope to beat the pound million raised by last yearrsquos single event in Edinburgh, which had , participants.A message from JoshA message from Josh ahead of tomorrows Sleep in the Park events.Posted by Social Bite on Friday, December , The cash goes towards tackling homelessness through housing projects and employment programmes, and supporting those on the streets with shelters and hot food and drink.KT Tunstall, who released her latest album, Wax, in October, tweeted: ldquoSo glad to be taking part in @SocialBite_ #SleepInThePark on Saturday to raise a ton of money and awareness to help Scotlandrsquos homeless.Comedian Fred MacAulay is hosting the Edinburgh event, with a performance by Lulu and a bedtime story from Trainspotting author Irvine Welsh in West Princes Street Gardens.Frightened Rabbit, whoselead singer Scott Hutchison died in May, will play at Kelvingrove Park in Glasgow.Eddi Reader will headline Aberdeenrsquos show in the Duthie Park, whileKyle Falconer will top the bill in Dundeersquos Slessor Gardens.The event ends on Sunday at am.Josh Littlejohn, co-founder of organiser Social Bite, said: ldquoWe were completely blown away by the thousands of people who joined this movement and supported Sleep in the Park last year.ldquoWe want to build on this across the whole of Scotland."},{"url":null,"title":"line-of-duty-star-compston-i-never-thought-id-star-in-primetime-show","story":"The actor, who plays Detective Sergeant Steve Arnott, said he did not think he was someone ldquoMiddle England would respond to as he was quizzed about his career alongside the showrsquos creator, Jed Mercurio, in Glasgow.The pair, currentlyfilming the fth series of the police drama in Belfast, spoke to students studying TV fiction writing at Glasgow Caledonian University.We had a great time fanastic to see the enthusiasm of students past and present, be back soon! https:t.co ODfkOeRRSmdash martin compstonDecember , Compston said he was grateful to Mercurio for his role in the hit show, and to film director Ken Loach, who put him on screen for the first time in rsquos Sweet Sixteen.The Scottish actor said:ldquoI owe my whole career to Ken Loach, who took a chance on me, and Jed, who put me in front of a wide audience.ldquoI never thought Irsquod be cast as a lead in a primetime BBC show, I just never thought Irsquod be someone Middle England would respond to.ldquoFor every great job Irsquove had, Irsquove had at least  or  rejections, so yoursquove got to be thick-skinned and yoursquove got to enjoy it.Speaking about filming Line Of Dutyrsquosinterrogation scenes, he said:ldquoThey are like mini one-act plays, you earn your money that day.ldquoWhen the scripts come out the fear is there, and Irsquom hoping Irsquom not in one, but when yoursquore not in it, you wish you were.

In the past, people in such a situation would have been struggling to make ends meet on benefits. But the survey, by the Citizens Advice Scotland, found that  per cent of people who had a job had either skipped meals or reduced the amount of food they eat because of a lack of funds.Derek Mitchell, the group’s chief executive, said: “For some people going hungry is the norm ... this study shows that many working people in Scotland are struggling to afford to buy food and in , this is simply unacceptable.”: % of Scots worry that the food cupboard may become barePeople do have a tendency to underestimate how much they eat, forgetting about snacks during the day, so polls on this subject may not be entirely accurate. The most recent Scottish Health Survey found  per cent of people in the poorest areas had gone hungry because of a lack of money.However,the picture is anything like as widespread as either survey suggests it should act as yet another a call to arms to add to others this year.In July, Holyrood’s Education Committee published a report saying they were “appalled by some of the evidence it heard, including the amount of evidence received about children in Scotland going to school hungry”. And only yesterday Action for Children said that every day its staff “see first-hand the impossible choice that families living in practically Dickensian levels of poverty have to make”.: MSPs shocked by poor and hungry Scottish pupilsSuch problems cry out for Scotland’s politicians to do something. But, as The Scotsman said yesterday, suggestions that the answer is to raise taxes should be treated with caution because of the risk of damaging the economy and making poverty even worse.However, politicians have other weapons in their armoury. For example, companies that use illegal or unethical working practices or find ways to avoid paying the minimum wage should face a further clampdown. A fair day’s pay for a fair day’s work is an idea that politicians of all parties should support.©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4840499.1544122439!/image/image.jpg","title":"scotrail scores another spectacular own goal alastair dalton","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Scotland#s Railways: The Story That Keeps On Giving was the title of a presentation I gave to a rail group this summer.Of all the types of transport I cover, it provides easily the most plentul source of news – good and bad. That’s perhaps because the rail network occupies a separate environment,not, with its many quirks, a parallel universe.I explained to the audience, who included ScotRail Alliance managing director Alex Hynes, that while there will always be negative stories about the railways, there have been some spectacular own goals by the industry in generating its own bad publicity.The examples I gave included current ScotRail operator Abellio instructing its staff in  to cut its predecessor’s logos from their unorms because new ones weren’t ready.I also highlighted the row over previous operator First shrinking its coffee cups because it could not meet the demand for hot drinks. The then managing director was livid to hear this had happened without his knowledge.I’m sorry to say ScotRail has done it again.You’d think that just after announcing a fares increase, amid dozens of daily cancellations because of staff shortages and industrial action, and while suffering the worst punctuality for years, would not be the best time to create more bad news.: Alastair Dalton: The vested interest blocking cuts to air pollutionBut no, the train operator confirmed on Monday it was scrapping its Kids Go Free promotion for five to -year-olds travelling with an adult. It will be replaced from next month by Kids for a Quid, a flat-fare £instead.ScotRail said the number of eligible children would increase from two to four per adult. It will also be extended to season ticket and flexipass holders, some of whom had apparently complained about having to buy another ticket so their children could travel free.Opposition parties and unions had a field day – Labour launched a petition while the Transport and Salaried Staffs’ Association accused ScotRail of “totally Scrooge-like behaviour”.Apart from the ill-judged timing, loss-making ScotRail’s decision appears to something of a gamble financially.It may prompt season ticket holders to take their kids by train, but introducing a charge – even £ – could equally dissuade others from going by rail. That could be particularly so on shorter trips around Glasgow, where most ScotRail journeys are made, and where even adult fares cost only a few pounds.: ‘Best railway Scotland’s ever had’ delayed by wrong type of threadHowever, the biggest issue with the change is that it flies in the face of Scottish Government policy of getting people out of their cars.Transport secretary Michael Matheson regards taking the train as “active travel”, along with walking and cycling, because it also involves at least one of those.Signicantly, he did not defend ScotRail when questioned about the change by MSPs on Tuesday – and said he understood people’s concerns.Children should become familiar with public transport as potential future users. I know of primary school teachers surprised to find few of their pupils have travelled by train, even at a school close to a busy Glasgow station. Some at a recent ten-year-old’s birthday party had never been on a bus.A decade ago, First ScotRail became the first UK train operator to offer free accompanied child travel daily.

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism.

I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"lerwick harbour traffic continues to rise ","story":"The downturn in offshore operations had an ongoing impact on overall freight handled in the first nine months, compared with the same period in .Statistics for January to September, released by Lerwick Port Authority, show that vessel arrivals jumped by . per cent to ,, with tonnage up . per cent at . million gross tonnes.

He deserves all the support possible.Tomorrow’s match, despite being outside the Six Nations, should still be hotly contested. In the absence of Hogg and Barclay, English-based Sean Maitland and David Denton, and half-backs Finn Russell and Greg Laidlaw who now ply their trade in France, it gives an opportunity for some youngsters to make their mark.Those include Blair Kinghorn and Adam Hastings who have been named in the starting line-up, while Darcy Graham, George Horne and Matt Fagerson may get their chance later in the game.He won’t be making an appearance on this occasion as he plays for Welsh side Scarlets, but I am particularly interested in seeing Kiwi import Blade Thomson in the next three tests. Hopefully he can make an eye-catching debut to match his name.: : : : : : : :Family, friends, work colleagues and a good number of former footballers gathered on Friday to say farewell to Alastair Johnston from Cunningsburgh.When I first met him in the early s he was still an excellent player. He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

However, on turning , she was required to move home and the family worked with Comhairle nan Eilean Siar#s social work department to put in place suitable arrangements.It took two years to find a solution and in May this year, Eilidh moved back to Stornoway, where she was housed in supervised accommodation with a young male who also suffers from autism.Four complaints by the family over that accommodation provision were upheld by the Care Commission and, following an incident, the male was removed from the house to another unit. However, that sudden change in circumstance sparked an escalation in Eilidh#s behaviour and the family were informed by social work management that they were seeking an order under mental health legislation.Eilidh had been housed on her own in the psychiatric ward in the Western Isles Hospital in Stornoway but was flown to the mainland on Tuesday of this week as that ward faces closure. She is also on a daily course of benzodiazepine # despite never previously requiring any medication. Catherine Ann MacLeod, Eilidh#s aunt, said there had been a #mishandling# of her situation from the moment she was required to come back to the island.#Eilidh is not psychotic,# said Ms MacLeod. #What she was displaying was traits of autism. The male was removed from the house all of a sudden and Eilidh is not able to process sudden changes without careful handling. That#s why she became more aggressive she#s not able to express herself properly. It would never have happened had a proper care plan been in place.#Whatever happens now, they#ve broken Eilidh #  she#ll not be the same now. It#s broken my sister, too.

The case has been raised with local MSP Alasdair Allan.He said: #I have met with Eilidh and her family. I am very concerned that they need to be reassured that there is accommodation for Eilidh long-term on the island, where she can be near her family.#There is no doubt that the family have had reason to be anxious about this question and I hope that we will now see dferent agencies working together in the islands to find a solution. I continue to work with the family to raise a number of complaints which they have about the way they feel they have been treated this far.#The islands currently face a major shortage of staff in the care sector, partly as a result of depopulation.The comhairle denied that decisions over Eilidh#s care were in any way motivated by budgetary constraints. A spokesman said they were #unable to comment on inidual cases#.#As a general principle,# the spokesman added, #we are committed to supporting people with complex needs in their own communities but for a small number of people there are circumstances in which outcomes will improvethey are supported in specialist centres of excellence on the mainland. This is not a matter of a lack of financial resources but rather not having the required levels of specialist care and expertise.#Whilst this is the case for many areas across Scotland it is clearly more acute in an island setting because it involves those requiring such care to live away from home for perhaps extended periods of time. It is also the case that implementing such measures and deciding when it is appropriate to repatriate service users is a matter of assessment and judgement.#The spokesman added that they were currently #in the process of developing a new strategy on learning disabilities and autism and this will consider whether we have the right balance between local support and specialist mainland provision#.By Murray MacLeod"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27494  ","story":"• th NOVEMBER  - Newly elected Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams Mícheál Mac DonnchaTHE Ard Fheis of  marked a signicant stage in the political development of Sinn Féin. The historic gathering came in the wake of the campaign in support of the H-Block and Armagh prisoners, the epic Hunger Strikes, the intervention of prisoner candidates, North and South, in  and Sinn Féin’s electoral rise in the Six Counties in  and .The party’s performance in the October  Assembly elections – when five republicans were elected to the body set up by British direct ruler Jim Prior – caused alarm to the SDLP and their supporters in the Establishment parties in the  Counties. Sinn Féin’s lead in boycotting the Assembly was followed by the SDLP for fear of losing further support to republicans. The Fine Gael Labour Government, led by Garret FitzGerald, set up the New Ireland Forum in Dublin mainly as a  for the SDLP. In June , the political establishment in Ireland and Britain was rocked by the election of Sinn Féin Vice-President Gerry Adams as MP for his native west Belfast. For long a leading republican activist, Adams advocated the deeper politicisation and popularisation of the republican struggle and the building of Sinn Féin across the  Counties.The British Tory government of Margaret Thatcher was also concerned at the rise of Sinn Féin. In the week before the Ard Fheis in November , Prior told Tory MPs that Ireland could become a “Cuba off Britain’s west coast”. He said he feared Sinn Féin could overtake the SDLP electorally and “we must do all we can to strengthen constitutional nationalism”. When the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis gathered in the Mansion House in Dublin on  and  November, it was set to elect a new leadership. Ruairí Ó Brádaigh had been president since  and he announced that he would not be seeking re-election. He said the four-province federal Ireland plan, of which he had been a strong advocate, had been rejected at the  Ard Fheis and his approach on other issues, including electoral strategy, had been rejected by the Ard Chomhairle.In his address, the new party president, Gerry Adams, dismissed media claims of a ‘Northern takeover’ and said:“We are not a Northern, nor a Southern party – we are an Irish republican party organised throughout Ireland.”The main theme of his speech was the need for republicans to break out of political isolation and “get among the people in the basic ways which the people accept”. In line with this approach, the Ard Fheis voted to contest European Parliament elections with the intention of taking seatsthey were won. This followed the expansion of party electoral strategy the previous year. The Ard Fheis coincided with a by-election campaign for the Dáil seat of Dublin Central, which was contested by Sinn Féin candidate Christy Burke, turning in a creditable performance. There was further controversy after the Ard Fheis, and discomfort for Fianna Fáil leaders in particular, when Gerry Adams was confirmed as the main speaker at the annual Kilmichael commemoration in west Cork. Gerry Adams was elected president of Sinn Féin at the Ard Fheis of November ,  years ago.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27495  ","story":" Robbie SmythOver the last  years Irishsociety has evolved and transformed in many ways.

from all communities and backgrounds - voted to reject it.They knew it would devastate the economy, strip away rights and undermine our political agreements.And that is why, in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result, Sinn Féin embarked on a diplomatic offensive across Europe warning of the dangers of Brexit and putting forward our demand for a unique solution for the north which would respect the majority remain vote.Through intense lobbying in Brussels, Strasbourg, Dublin and London, Sinn Féin led and built support for the idea that our unique position and peace agreements required a unique Brexit solution.Our case for special status for the north within the EU sought to ensure there would be no hard border, that citizens rights would be upheld and the Good Friday Agreement protected in all its parts.As the prospect of a no deal Brexit became more likely, we made it clear the north needed to remain in the customs union and single market in order to prevent our economy being driven off a clf by the Tories and their DUP allies.That was reflected in the backstop which was agreed by the EU and the British government. But as soon as it was agreed the British government, as they always do, began trying to renege on its commitments.Our position remains now as it was then. That backstop must be maintained and protected. It provides the bottom line and is our insurance policy against the worst excesses of Brexit, which we know will be a disaster for this country.The backstop is not perfect and neither is the withdrawal agreement. There is no such thing as a good Brexit after all.There are still issues of concern and clarication required, particularly relating to the issues of rights and representation.Over the course of the last number of days Sinn Féin has met with An Taoiseach and An Tanáiste and have been in contact with Theresa May about all of these concerns.The pro-remain parties represent the majority of people in the north and are fighting on their behalf.By contrast, the DUP are actively trampling the best interests of people and business in the north in their reckless cheerleading for an as yet  Tory Brexit.Sinn Féin will continue to stand with all other parties who advocate for citizens’ rights, our economic interests and our agreements in the face of Brexit.  We will continue to put pressure on the Irish government to act in the interests of citizens, north and south and hold the Taoiseach to his pledge that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish Government.Whatever twists and turns the Brexit debacle takes next, the backstop as agreed must be maintained. It cannot be sacriced in an attempt to save the ailing career of Theresa May or to serve the hard-line agendas of the Brexiteers in the Tory party or the DUP. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27499  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonGUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers# rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.- Declan Kearney MLADimitrios Papadimoulis is a Greek MEP who represents the Syriza party in the European Parliament.He has spent a le time involved in left wing political activism in his native Greece and has been a member of the Syriza central leadership which brought the party from opposition into government in , while the country was still in the midst of its financial and economic crisis and subjected to extreme political and economic pressure by the European Unionestablishment.Dimitrios is ‘laconic and philosophical in the way of Sparta’ – to borrow a phrase he used during a contribution at a recent conference which we attended together in Brussels, organised by GUE-NGL the European Parliamentary group to which both Sinn Féin and Syriza are affiliated.This meeting brought together leadership representatives and MEPs from twenty of the most signicant political parties on the progressive Left in the EU to discuss the future direction of GUE-NGL and future political strategy and co-operation among left wing and progressive parties including the  European elections, and the next term of the EU parliament.During one of our conversations at the conference Dimitrios recalled a story from - years previously, when he was travelling to deliver a speech.Dimitrios told his taxi driver what he was planning to say at the meeting.The taxi man replied:“Remember, you are a politician, not a prophet. Do not promise me things it will take  years to achieve. Make change for me tomorrow.”Dimitrios immediately decided to change his speech. He learned a lesson that day from the taxi driver which has stayed with him ever since.Theories or notions, and even visions for changeremain just that unless they can translate into concrete change in society.People want change which makes a material dference in their lives for them and their families.And thats how it should be.Fair wages high quality education and health services free at the point of delivery and a clean sustainable environment should not be dreams. They need to become realities.So political activists who are committed to transformational change need to be grounded in the real world.They have to understand what they can deliver in the here and now, and then to have a plan to achieve even more.But the progressive Left can only make change when it has the strength to do so.That means setting realistic objectives and priorities, and then devising strategies which work.I said in my opening comments to the conference that Europe is at a crossroads.The political direction, policy orientation, and increasing need for reform of the EU coupled with, and often fuelling the rise of the extreme right wing, now presents an existential threat to the principles of the progressive Left.Social democracy has effectively collapsed both politically and electorally across Europe.There is a need to build a progressive Left alternative, and to popularise a new political narrative or common sense based upon core ideas: To include:·         That economies serve the many and not the few:·         That human and democratic rights are inalienable:·         That the global environment is protected:·         That Europe should act as a force for international peace and solidarity: and·         That racism, sectarianism, misogyny, homophobia and xenophobia are opposed.These ideas should be a common  for expanding the political strength of the progressive Left.However, that potential faces many challenges.Some of these are beyond the control of the progressive Left, but others are not.All of this was under discussion at the GUE-NGL conference.There were many notable contributions.Arnaldo Otegi, the General Secretary of the EH Bildu was in attendance.He had just received the ground breaking judgement from the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled his prosecution was wrong.During Arnaldos presentation he provided a powerful critique of global capitalism and the importance of defending community and social values.Panos Skourletis has been a senior minister of the Syriza government.In a highly signicant move several months ago, he moved from that role to take up the position of Secretary of Syrizas Central Committee.Panos set out an analysis of the situation in Greece and wider Europe and argued that it is time for a common front of left parties and other progressives and democratic forces in Europe.Earlier I argued that unity and cohesion are essential between parties and democratic forces on the left in Europe: and that we must focus on what expands unity, whilst respecting our dferences and uniqueness as parties and national movements.Sinn Féin believes that GUE-NGL has successfully enabled progressive parties from the left to co-operate within the European Parliament, whilst recognising the autonomy of political delegations.This is one of GUE-NGL’s strengths as a parliamentary group and deserves to be consolidated.Unanimity is not required on all issues, all of the time but progressives cannot afford to be disunited.Political sectarianism undermines political strength, solidarity and fraternity on the progressive Left.The collective strength of the progressive Left in Europe stems from the domestic relevance and political strength of its constituent parts.The left will only be as strong in the European Parliament as progressive Left and republican parties are relevant and strong in their national contexts.The success of a real progressive Left alternative,  depends upon securing strategic beach heads of political strength and influence.This is why support for Europes only left wing government in Greece is so politically important.Whilst progressives need to be in a hurry to make change and in pursuit of a social and more democratic Europe, we also need to be realistic and pragmatic.The distinction between strategy and tactical positions need to be understood.Alliances with others are indispensable to the process of changing the overall balance of forces.Rigid or dogmatic ideological positions can prevent agreement upon shared objectives and securing unity among the widest cross section of progressive and democratic opinion.The political discussion and focus upon an emergent European Progressive Caucus embracing the Left, social democrats, and environmentalists is such an innovative and welcome initiative.I proposed to the Brussels conference that a strategic consensus among the progressive Left and others should be based upon support for national independence, social emancipation, citizens rights, and democratic control over the economy.For our part Sinn Féin will contest the European election in  on an agenda which advocates for the creation of a Social Europe.We will be emphasising the need to protect rural and fishing communities the promotion of economic democracy enhanced environmental policy, human rights and social justice as well as defence of the Irish peace process and support for a united Ireland.The onset of Brexit has changed the political and social landscape in Ireland, and also signicantly influenced political discourse within the EU itself.It has swept away all of the established constitutional, political and economic assumptions about the status quo in Ireland and refocused international attention upon the democratic case for Irish unity.During the conference I highlighted the denial of citizens rights and blocking of political democracy in the north of Ireland by the DUP and British Tory government. The point was made that this existential rights crisis, combined with the imposition of Brexit represented the most serious threat to the Good Friday Agreement, and the democratic option for managing change in the north of Ireland.The European Parliament  EU institutions have become strategically important forums within which to promote the democratic aim of a united Ireland and to encourage support for an Irish unity referendum. The level of interest in, and support for constitutional change in Ireland is now at an unprecedented high level across the EU.Sinn Féin will continue lobbying to make the case for a united Ireland a priority for the progressive Left and within other sections of democratic opinion represented in the European Parliament. Irish unity is integral to the vision of a new Europe.Going forward, the progressive Left in Europe needs to focus its collective efforts upon maximising representation and influence in the next parliament.GUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.That is what the shared ambition of a New Europe should mean. Sinn Féin has a central role in promoting that vision.The progressive Left across Europe has much to do.We need to be people in a hurry.The future cannot wait.We need to plan, organise and attract the popular support to make change for all tomorrow: To build a New Europe - a Europe of Equals. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27500  ","story":"• John James Kelly, Jimmy Joe Reynolds and Charlie #Cathal# McCafferty Staff ReporterThe three men were in a back room in the house of Patrick Kelly, brother of John James, when the explosion blew away part of the walls and roof.On  November , IRA Volunteers blew up six customs posts along the border in Counties Armagh and Fermanagh. Two other posts - at Clady and Strabane in Co Tyrone - were also to have been demolished that night but the bombs to be used exploded prematurely, killing three Volunteers at Stranamuck, near Castlefin, Co Donegal.Comdt John James Kelly and Staff Capt James Joseph Reynolds were killed instantly and Comdt Charles McCafferty died a few days later in Lford Hospital.The three men were in a back room in the house of Patrick Kelly, brother of John James, when the explosion blew away part of the walls and roof. The exact cause of the premature explosion has never been discovered, though Patrick Kelly said later that the men realised that the proposed time of the Strabane explosion coincided with the coming home of Strabane people from the cinema in Lford. The Volunteers decided to change the time on the timing device and in doing so they caused the explosion.The three men who died were experienced Volunteers. John James Kellys father had been a Fenian and he himself was raised in the Fenian tradition. He was recruited into the IRB at an early age and formed a group of Irish Volunteers in Clady. He took part in many operations during the Tan War and was arrested and imprisoned in England. On hishe took the Republican side in the Civil War and saw action against the Free Staters.John James Kelly was a man of the left - he spoke often to his son about Lenin.

In  he was arrested and sentenced to six months in Derry Prison for possession of firearms. He worked as a barge loader on the Strabane-Derry Canal and he was known as a quiet man with an abiding interest in the history and folklore of his area.Jimmy Joe Reynolds was from Leitrim. He was the OC in that county and had been for a time OC of Britain. He had been sent to Donegal as the representative of the IRAs General Headquarters Staff and it was he who transported the bombs - three in all - to Stranamuck.Jimmy Joe had been active in the IRA for many years. In  he was charged along with six other men, including his twin brother, John Joseph, with the assassination of a rack-renting landlord, More OFarrell, at Edgeworthstown, Co Longford. After two trials the case was dismissed and there were bonfires for fty miles around to celebrate their escape from the Free State hangman.All three Volunteers received huge funerals with full IRA honours.

Hundreds died and many more spent many weeks crippled in agony in their beds during the winter months.Richard Coleman was born in Dublin in , one of eleven Coleman children, most of whom were active in the Gaelic League. Brought up in Swords, County Dublin, Richard was a religious and a patriotic young man. He trained to be a Christian Brother, but left to begin a career with the Prudential Insurance Company.When Thomas MacDonagh came to Swords in April  to recruit members for the recently formed Irish Volunteers, Richard was among the first to join. When John Redmond forced a split in the Volunteers later that year, the remaining Volunteers elected Richard as their captain.On Easter Sunday , Richard mobilised his men, the Fingal Battalion, at Saucers Town, ensured that they were ready for what lay ahead and dismissed them till the following day. On Easter Monday they, along with other Volunteers from surrounding areas, came under the direction of Thomas Ashe, whose instructions were to prevent British reinforcements from reaching Dublin. They fulfilled that task heroically that week.On the Tuesday,  Volunteers were sent into the GPO in response to a request from the Commander-in-chief, James Connolly. On reaching the GPO, the group was split up. Six men became the tunnelling unit around the GPO - `the engineering corps - while the others under Richard were instructed to reinforce the garrison under Sean Heuston in the Mendicity Institute. Connollys parting words to them did not augur well for their mission: ``I dont think you will all get there, but get as far as you can.They got as far as the Mendicity Institute unscathed. A Volunteer at one of the barricades they passed through said of them: ``In the midst of the firing, men approached up Church Street towards our barricade. When they reached it, they passed briskly towards their objective - whatever it might have been. They were dressed and, I thought looked, like countrymen... I could not but admire very much they way they went into action.At the Mendicity Institute, the garrison was under severe pressure, with the British attack coming virtually from all directions. By Thursday, things were hopeless and Sean Heuston was forced to surrender to a much larger British force.They, similar to the other captured Volunteers, were corralled at the Rotunda Hospital for identication purposes. They were then court-martialled and sentenced. Richard was sentenced to death, though this was commuted to three years penal servitude.The sentenced prisoners were transported to Dartmoor Jail in England first and then ided up. Richard was sent to Lewis Jail in Kent. When they were released after a very successful campaign in Ireland and abroad for their freedom, each Volunteer was granted £ from the National Aid Fund in America to help them rebuild their lives. They all pooled their money and began the New Ireland Friendly Society, with Richard as a director and a trustee with a superintendents wage.Like many of the other released prisoners in June , Volunteer Richard Coleman of Swords travelled to Clare to help Sinn Féin and the Irish Volunteers in their efforts to get Eamonn de Valera elected in the by-election.While there he addressed the first unormed parade of Irish Volunteers to be held since . For this, he was arrested and jailed for six months. While in Mountjoy Jail, he and the other prisoners went on hunger-strike, led by Thomas Ashe. Ashes death led to such a public outcry that the remaining prisoners were first moved to Cork Jail and then Dundalk Jail before being finally released.Richard was not to remain `at large for long and he was again arrested, along with many of the other republican leaders whod been active in rebuilding the Movement, as part of the British authorities `German Plot conspiracy.The prisoners were assembled first in Dublin Castle on  May  and were then ided up and sent to Usk and Gloucester Jails in Britain. Conditions were harsh in the jail and attempts were made to criminalise them with the order to wear prison unorms. They resisted and at the direction of the Home Office the prison governor, Mr Young, capitulated. On their first night in Usk, the internees won the right to free association, the right to receive and send letters, to smoke and to wear their own clothes.Despite their victory, the prison regime and their confinement weakened the men and with the onset of a severe winter, many succumbed to the influenza virus which had reached epidemic proportions, killing hundreds outside the prison walls. Richard was among a group of POWs struck down by the virus - they were left in their damp and cold cells for three days after the flu struck them down. On  December, a new prison doctor, Dr. Morton took up his new duties in the prison and immediately he diagnosed that Richard had now suffering from pneumonia and he had him transferred to hospital. He died a few days later on  December .Remembering the result of Thomas Ashes inquest - that the prison authorities were culpable - no formal inquest was allowed and when Richards brother arrived he was prevented from getting an adjournment of the local inquest so as to instruct a solicitor. The local inquest heard Richards brother state that Richard was a strong healthy man at the time of his arrest, while three fellow POWs attested to the insanitary conditions in the jail and that improper nursing contributed to his death. These statements got good publicity in the Irish press and added to the campaign to get the POWs released.Richard Colemans remains were released to his brother and were taken to Dublin where they lay in state for a week in St Andrews Church, Westland Row. Over , people filed past the coffin to pay their last respects. Volunteers in unorm formed a guard of honour during that time. A public funeral procession in driving rain from Westland Row to Glasnevin was followed by over , people. Three volleys were fired over the grave in Glasnevin Cemetery by six Volunteers despite a huge police presence. The size of the crowd prevented the police from moving against the Volunteers.Volunteer Richard Colemans death in an English jail, aided Sinn Féin campaign against Britains occupation and their general election campaign which was in full swing at this stage, and two weeks later Sinn Féin won a landslide victory of parliamentary seats. A month later in January  Sinn Féin MPs met as Dáil Éireann for the first time. The escape from Usk Jailby four of Richards comrades on the same day saw that republican POWs were unbroken and unbowed by their comrades death.Volunteer Richard Coleman died of pneumonia in Usk Jail on  December ,  years ago this week.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27507  ","story":" Michael McMonagle“This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account. - Chris Hazzard MPThe proposal from a senior Tory MP that the threat of food shortages in Ireland should be used to put pressure on the Dublin government and the EU in the Brexit negotiation exposes the colonial attitude of Brexiteers, a Sinn Féin MP has said. South Down MP Chris Hazzard was speaking after senior Tory MP and former minister Priti Patel urged the British government to use the threat of food shortages which could arise from a no-deal Brexit as leverage in the Brexit negotiations. The Tory MP, who previously stepped down from her ministerial role after revelations of secret meetings with the Israeli government, asked why the threat of food shortages wasnt being \"pressed home\" during the Brexit negotiations. Her remarks have sparked outrage on social media, with comparisons to Charles Trevelyan, the notorious British civil servant known for his role during The Great Hunger. Chris Hazzard said the proposal from the Tory MP were \"crass and offensive.\" “This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account.“They know the history of the Irish famine and Britain’s role in it and the very fact that they would seek to inject that into the Brexit debate is crass and offensive.“The Tories couldn’t care less about the impact of their reckless Brexit agenda on the people and economy of Ireland.

This puts the whole of the United Kingdom in prime position to seize new opportunities as we leave the EU.As we establish our new relationship with Europe, the Industrial Strategy will help us to build the foundations behind our withdrawal agreement. Our prosperity and ability to build a strong economy is dependent on how we encourage innovation, develop high quality jobs and skills, and support businesses throughout the UK to thrive and grow.Northern Ireland has a world-leading reputation in key sectors, including construction and automotive, as well as future industries such as Articial Intelligence , cyber security and le sciences.The Industrial Strategy has led to specic partnerships between the government and these industries, which will help these major employers in Northern Ireland face the future outside the EU with confidence.Today I am pleased to announce, with the Business Secretary Greg Clark, £, of funding from the Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund for the County Antrim-based le sciences company Randox. This will pay for the research and development of cutting-edge technology to enable diagnostic tools to be manufactured more quickly and effectively.Eventually, this will lead to more manufacturing jobs as a result.Northern Ireland is also benefiting from UK-wide funding programmes under the Industrial Strategy, including Armagh City, Banbridge  Craigavon who have successfully bid for £.m and Belfast for £.m as some of the  areas benefiting from the £m Full Fibre Networks Challenge fund, designed to increase connectivity across the UK.The UK has a strong economy, with eight straight years of economic growth, over  million more people in jobs, and higher employment and lower unemployment in every region and nation of the UK - we should be proud of this.We are open and enterprising, founded on invention, innovation and competition.In Northern Ireland, employment levels are almost at a record high, and the UK government is determined to build on this progress.We are at the forefront of scientic invention because we embrace change and use regulation to stimulate an environment for creativity.We have globally admired universities and research institutions, such as Queens and Ulster University, because we have nurtured our intellectual powerhouses with public investment. And we have a deserved reputation for being a dependable and confident place to do business because we have high standards, clear regulation and great partnerships.The UKs businesses can take on the world because they have access to a skilled workforce and modern infrastructure, and Northern Ireland is an important and growing part of that. The Prime Minister, the rest of our Cabinet colleagues and I will continue working to secure the best Brexit deal for the whole of the UK.At the same time we are delivering our long-term plan to support businesses throughout the UK to thrive and grow.Building on the great strides the Industrial Strategy has already taken so that after we leave the EU, our businesses and institutions are in the best possible position to build on our strengths and lead the world.Karen Bradley MP is Secretary of State for Northern Ireland"},{"url":null,"title":"suzanne breen unionists united in opposition as remainers rally around backstop","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Unlike the pro-Remain parties, there was no joint press conference. But in separate statements, the DUP, the Ulster Unionists and the TUV insisted that no unionist worth their salt could sign up to the deal and called for the backstop to be binned. Sometimes, a secret document doesnt live up to the speculation. This was not such an occasion.Geoffrey Coxs advice set off alarm bells in even moderate unionist circles. No wonder the Government wanted to keep it under wraps. It said the whole of the UK would form a single customs territory with the EU, but Northern Ireland and Britain would be there on dferent legal terms.Only Northern Ireland would be legally part of the customs union, following the full EU customs code. The European Court of Justice would continue to have jurisdiction over its compliance with those rules. DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds said: \"Goods passing from Great Britain to Northern Ireland will be subject to a declaration process.\"Northern Ireland will remain in the single market for goods and the EUs customs regime, and will be required to apply and comply with the relevant rules and standards,up regulatory ergence in the future.\"Britain would be \"essentially treated as a third country by Northern Ireland for goods passing from GB into NI\".The DUP is livid that despite all Mrs Mays pledges, economic and trade barriers would be erected within the UK - something it branded \"unacceptable and economically mad\". The legal advice said the backstop could continue indefinitely and that the drafting didnt provide for a mechanism that is likely to allow the UK to exit lawfully.Despite promises to the contrary from Mrs May and Secretary of State Karen Bradley, the TUV said Northern Ireland would be \"annexed permanently into the EU\".The Attorney Generals full advice, released yesterday, was \"more emphatic and plain than that dressed up for the summary\" in the House of Commons on Monday, Mr Allister said.\"The trap is clear. All of the UK for now is held in a customs territory with the EU but only Northern Ireland is legally part of the EU Customs Union, where we would stay indefinitely evenGB was released,\" he added.\"This is utterly incompatible with the constitutional and economic integrity of the UK.\"Mrs May had previously stated the very arrangement that she ended up signing up to would be unacceptable to any UK Prime Minister.Mr Swann said while the Government tried to downplay unionist concerns as recently as last week when he met the Prime Minister and Cabinet Office officials, legal advice reinforcing those fears was actually sitting on their desks.\"What was the point in them spending the best part of a year saying that they shared our concernsall the while they were negotiating a deal that contains everything we were concerned about \" he asked.The UUP leader said Mrs May must stop \"flogging this dead deal\" and pursue alternatives. But nationalist parties and Alliance want her to do nothing of the sort. Sinn Fein MLA Conor Murphy said the backstop had been agreed by the Government and the EU, and the Attorney Generals advice changed nothing. \"It must be maintained and protected. It cant be derailed or undermined by the votes of Brexiteer MPs,\" he stressed.An SDLP spokesperson added: \"There will potentially be minor dferences between GB and NIthe backstop is required, but they will be minimal.\"This is not a secret, but any ergence is a consequence of Brexit and the extreme version of Brexit that the DUP insisted on pursuing. If the DUP cannot accept this consequence of Brexit, they should do the honourable thing and support a referendum on the deal.\"Alliance deputy leader Stephen Farry said nobody should be shocked at the legal advice on the backstop, because \"its nature and purpose should have been evident to anyone following the negotiations over the past  months\".The backstop was needed to protect the Good Friday Agreement and to avoid a hard border, he insisted. Mr Farry didnt see it undermining the Union - it \"may create comparative economic advantages for this region\", he said."},{"url":null,"title":"huge boost for city centre as primark gets ready to open its doors again","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It ensures people and businesses that rely on an open border between Northern Ireland and Ireland can continue living their lives and operating as they do now. It is not a threat to the integrity of the Union, or a threat to the rights people enjoy today.“In short, we have secured an outcome for Northern Ireland that avoids a hard border on the island of Ireland and a customs border down the Irish Sea.“The deal avoids Northern Ireland being in a separate customs territory to the rest of the UK, something that the EU had originally sought to impose. Instead, it achieves the maintenance of a single UK customs territory.“In line with the clear commitments we made in the December Joint Report, the UK would ensure unfettered access for NI businesses to the whole UK internal market.“The deal protects all the things we value.

Rather than taking back control, under the Prime Ministers Withdrawal Agreement, the United Kingdom would be trapped.https:www.belfasttelegraph news politics nigel-dodds-prime-minister-must-bin-the-backstop-and-work-for-a-better-deal-.htmlhttps:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland article.ece cd AUTOCROP h --_new__I.JPGEmailDecember is the month associated with gts, and it is clear from the Attorney Generals legal advice that the Prime Minister is prepared to gt our sovereignty to Brussels. Rather than taking back control, under the Prime Ministers Withdrawal Agreement, the United Kingdom would be trapped..pushThe Northern Ireland Protocol, set in international law, could not be exited unilaterally by the United Kingdom.It would continue indefinitely until superseded by another agreement.The Attorney Generals legal opinion is a devastating blow for the Prime Minister and those Cabinet ministers who are trying to sell the Withdrawal Agreement as a good deal.The publication of the legal opinion is a clear vindication for those of us who campaigned for it to be published.It is regrettable that we needed to use the Contempt mechanism to secure its publication. It did not need to be this way.Nonetheless, we now fully understand why the Government did not want to publish the Attorney Generals legal opinion.It flies in the face of what the Prime Minister told us on February  in the House of Commons.She said: \"The draft legal text that the Commission has published would,implemented, undermine the UK common market and threaten the constitutional integrity of the UK by creating a customs and regulatory border down the Irish sea, and no UK Prime Minister could ever agree to it.\"I will be making it crystal clear to President Juncker and others that we will never do so.\"Yet the Attorney Generals advice to the Cabinet confirms that the Northern Ireland Protocol would mean very dferent trading arrangements for Northern Ireland than the rest of the United Kingdom.A customs and regulatory border is precisely what the Government now propose.The Prime Ministers public and private commitments lie in tatters.Of course, it is important to rewind  months. It was this week last year when Arlene Foster telephoned the Prime Minister while she was in Brussels and urged her to bin the backstop.We pointed out the folly of the arrangement. We insisted on Paragraph  being added to the Joint Report to safeguard frictionless trade between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom.Twelve months later, the Withdrawal Agreement has hundreds of detailed legal clauses about the Northern Ireland situation and the backstop, but there is not a single line and not a single word in relation to paragraph  of the Joint Report.That provision was inserted specically to allow that the final say in and decision on any regulatory dferences between Great Britain and Northern Ireland should rest with the Northern Ireland Assembly and Executive.It is deeply regretful that we have received no satisfactory explanation as to why Paragraph s commitment has been deleted.Conceding a fallback position to the EU before even starting talks about our final exit arrangements was always a bad idea.Too much time has been spent on negotiating this awful backstop. Even the ministers selling the deal dont like it.The Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Rt Hon Philip Hammond MP, said on ITVs Peston on November : \"I dont think this backstop is a good arrangement for our economy. I dont think it is a good arrangement for our Union.\"So, its bad for the economy and the Union.And then the Attorney General, the Rt Hon Geoffrey Cox MP, said in the House of Commons on December : \"It has unattractive and unsatisfactory elements for us. I would have preferred to have seen a unilateral right of termination in the backstop. I would have preferred to have seen a clause that allowed us to exit.\"The words of the Prime Minister, EU commissioners and Cabinet ministers will come and go.They can be twisted and contorted to mean whatever one wants them to mean, but the legally binding text of the Withdrawal Agreement will remain.Our grandchildren will live with the outworkings of that international agreement.The Withdrawal Agreement will commit Northern Ireland to large swaths of EU single market rules for goods and agri-food.Of course, there are already regulatory dferences between GB and NI, but those were set for health reasons by our Parliament or NI Assembly, not because we were in a dferent single market regime.In such circumstances, our core industries would have their rules set by the European Commission and be subject to the European Court of Justice, yet we would have no say over them.It is utterly unacceptable, to me as a unionist, that Northern Ireland, in trade terms, would treat the rest of the United Kingdom as a third country.The Attorney General has confirmed this as being his legal opinion.We were told by the Prime Minister in her six declarations to the people of Northern Ireland last December that she would ensure that Northern Ireland left the European Union with the rest of the United Kingdom.She assured the public that no part of the United Kingdom would be left in the single market or the customs union and that no part of the UK would be left subject to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.These pledges have now been broken.We want a deal which works for the entire United Kingdom and delivers on the referendum result.We want Parliament to be sovereign for the entire United Kingdom.Rather than go through the process of debating and voting on this flawed deal, the Prime Minister should work for a better deal and bin the backstop.Nigel Dodds is the DUP MP for North Belfast"},{"url":null,"title":"kt tunstall and amy macdonald to perform at sleep in the park","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

To regain their trust, passengers need to see that lessons have been learned.”Rail timetables are changed twice a year, in May and December.The decision to scale back Sunday’s change has been controversial as it will delay the launch of some new services.South Western Railway said it was “disappointed” it is not able to go ahead with its planned “major timetable change” which would have led to extra services and more capacity.Judith Blake, leader of Leeds City Council, said: “Yet again, a major decision on rail services has been made without warning, without consultation with northern leaders and without a voice for passengers.”Among the improvements being introduced are  additional weekday services on Thameslink and Great Northern routes, and a reduced journey time between Edinburgh Waverley and Glasgow Queen Street.RDG regional director Robert Nisbet said: “We know that people in some areas might be concerned about another timetable change, but – as the Glaister Review acknowledges – the rail industry has worked together to start learning the lessons from May.“As with the introduction of any new timetable, there may be some pockets of disruption as people get used to new journeys and train times, so we advise people to check before travelling next week.”"},{"url":null,"title":"can you guess these 10 classic goals described","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The moon’s far side is also known as the dark side because it faces away from Earth and remains comparatively unknown. It has a dferent composition than sites on the near side, where previous missions have landed.If successful, the mission would propel the Chinese space programme to a leading position in one of the most important areas of lunar exploration.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  The Chang’e  lunar probe launches from the the Xichang Satellite Launch Centre China landed its Yutu, or Jade Rabbit, rover on the moon five years ago and plans to send its Chang’e  probe there next year and have itto Earth with samples – the first time that will have been done since . A crewed lunar mission is also under consideration.Chang’e  is also a lander-rover combination and will explore both above and below the lunar surface after arriving at the South Pole-Aitken basin’s Von Karman crater following a -day journey.It will also perform radio-astronomical studies that, because the far side always faces away from Earth, will be “free from interference from our planet’s ionosphere, human-made radio frequencies and auroral radiation noise”, space industry expert Leonard David wrote on the website Space.It may also carry plant seeds and silkworm eggs, according to Xinhua.Chang’e is the goddess of the moon in Chinese mythology.China conducted its first crewed space mission in , making it only the third country after Russia and the US to do so. It has put two space stations into orbit, one of which is still operating as a precursor to a more than -ton station that is due to come online in . The launch of a Mars rover is planned for the mid-s.To facilitate communication between controllers on Earth and the Chang’e  mission, China in May launched a relay satellite named Queqiao, or Magpie Bridge, after an ancient Chinese folk tale.China’s space programme has benefited from co-operation with Russia and European nations, although it was excluded from the -ton International Space Station, mainly due to US legislation barring such co-operation amid concerns over its strong military connections. Its programme also suffered a rare setback last year with the failed launch of its Long March  rocket."},{"url":null,"title":"nasa lander captures first sounds of martian wind","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The low-frequency rumblings were collected by the InSight lander during its first week of operations on Mars.These are the first sounds from Mars that are detectable by human ears, according to the researchers.“Reminds me of sitting outside on a windy summer afternoon … In some sense, this is what it would sound likeyou were sitting on the InSight lander on Mars,” Cornell University’s Don Banfield told reporters.LIVE NOW: The Mars InSight lander has been sending us good vibrations! Tune in to hear the lander’s recordings of wind vibrations on the red planet, as well as what our scientists think about the #SoundsOfMars! https:t.co kGKjoqgeV pic hYGcnvxxaC— NASADecember , Scientists involved in the project agree the sound has an otherworldly quality to it.Thomas Pike, of Imperial College London, said the rumbling is “rather dferent to anything that we’ve experienced on Earth, and I think it just gives us another way of thinking about how far away we are getting these signals”.The noise is of the wind blowing against InSight’s solar  and the resulting vibration of the entire spacecraft. The sounds were recorded by an air pressure sensor inside the lander that is part of a weather station, as well as the seismometer on the deck of the spacecraft.The low frequencies are a result of Mars’ thin air density and even more so the seismometer itself – it is meant to detect underground seismic waves, well below the threshold of human hearing. The seismometer will be moved to the Martian surface in the coming weeks until then, the team plans to record more wind noise.The  Viking landers on Mars picked up spacecraft shaking caused by wind, but it would be a stretch to consider it sound, said InSight’s lead scientist Bruce Banerdt, of JPL in Pasadena, Calornia.InSight landed on Mars on November .“We’re all still on a high from the landing last week … and here we are less than two weeks after landing, and we’ve already got some amazing new science,” said Nasa’s Lori Glaze, acting director of planetary science. “It’s cool, it’s fun.”"},{"url":null,"title":"review festive fun everglades santa sunday buffet lunch","story":"A trip to see Santa is a traditional part of the run up to Christmas, but after queuing for a five minute audience with the big man you start questioningit is really worth it.This year my family bypassed all that at the ‘Santa Sunday Buffet Lunch’ at the Everglades Hotel, which is a much of a treat for the mammies and daddies as it is for the kids.Like half of Derry, my two are dosed with the cold but I wasn’t for missing this so I got out the Calpol and the Tixylix and put them in their Sunday best.We swept into the hotel lobby in a cloud of Vicks Vaporub where we were greeted by a stunning Christmas tree, a Santa’s sleigh and a six foot polar bear.All thoughts of chesty coughs were quickly forgotten as we were handed a glass of mulled wineand an alcohol free hot cider .We were shown to our table and given the low down on the five course feast that awaited us.The children’s attention was where though because Santa was doing the rounds, stopping at every table for a photo and a chat.He reassured our daughter that she was on the nice list and her LOL Doll would be under the tree on Christmas morning.And he told our son that the elves could definitely rustle up a few carshe kept up the good behaviour.As you would expect from The Everglades the food was top notch, but for me it was the service that really stood out.Nothing was too much bother and everything was done with grace and ease.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshJust when I thought things couldn’t get any more relaxed and festive the Allegri Choir took to the stage and serenaded us with Christmas classics.Much as the kids enjoyed their meal, the dessert was definitely their highlight with a ‘pick ‘n’ mix’ trolley, popcorn machine, and shelves heaving with gateaux.After this we had a second audience with Santa who took lots of time to chat with the children and pose for photos before giving them a selection box, which I’m ‘looking after’ for them.Children’s entertainment is also laid on with Lego, arts and crafts, toys and computer games all over seen by lovely team who also do face painting and balloon modelling.The lady in charge even took time out to recommend some remedies for children’s hacking coughs that had made a reappearance.RelaxAll that was left for us to do was relax with a coffee while the children played with their new found friends.Professional photographs are also available in reception starting at a very reasonable £.‘Santa’s Sunday Buffet Lunch’ is served from . -

Politicians are also conscious that dog fouling is a problem which does nothing to enhance the districtrsquos image.The new campaign is reminding dog owners that they should never allow their pets to foul on the street and that when out in public to carry a bag with them so they can collect dog dirt and dispose of it properly.Council chairman Mark Murnin said all councillors were unanimous in their support for the new awareness campaign.ldquoWe intend to monitor and extend this initiative over the coming months, he explained. Dog fouling is a serious matter and we need to remind dog owners that not only is it unacceptable, but also can potentially cause disease.ldquoIt is important that we develop and promote a culture of responsible dog ownership and are asking all dog owners to help us keep the parks and open spaces in the Newry, Mourne and Down area clean and welcoming for all users.As part of the new campaign, notices about dog fouling will be displayed prominently across the district to ensure that the local authorityrsquos message to pet owners is clear to all..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Classy Campbell seals victory  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH secured an excellent away win on the articial surface at Old Wesley as a strong second half performance was enough to get them over the line in a match strewn with penalties.lsquoHinch lost Rory Butler, James Simpson, Stuart Morrow to injury during the extremely physical encounter with Banbridge and, coupled with the unavailability of Johnny McPhillips, their midfield had to be rejigged completely with Callum McLaughlin and Robin Harte starting in the centre, outside fly half Hilton Gibbons.Tom Martin came in at lock to replace Simpson and the pack was bolstered by Tommy OrsquoHagan, who made his debut at tight head prop.

In recognition of the le-saving work, his employers named the air ambulance as its nominated recipient at the annual charity breakfast.March  began like any other for Damien but took a dramatic turn when he started his sht. His right arm became trapped above the elbow while working with heavy machinery, with the alarm quickly raised by one of his colleagues.Helicopter Emergency Medical Servicesparamedic Mike Patton was on duty when the call came through and quickly tasked the air ambulance to the accident with the crew joined at Carryduff business by the Fire and Rescue Service and Ambulance Service paramedics.Even though the builders yard was clear of obstacles, the landing proved challenging for the air ambulance due to the signicant amount of dust which was created as the helicopter came into land.Fire and Rescue Service personnel worked to release Damienrsquos arm from the machinery and were assisted by one of his colleagues who was also a former part-time firefighter and played an important supporting role during the incident.Throughout the entire ordeal, Damien remained conscious and remembers every moment right up until he was sedated mdash he believes his ldquomind blocked out the trauma.Once anaesthetised by a doctor, Damien was transferred to the Royal Victoria Hospital by road ambulance, accompanied by the HEMS team, where he then underwent crucial surgery tometal plates into his arm.Damienrsquos road to recovery has been long, undergoing a further operation, overcoming two incidences of MRSA which required surgery, and a requirement for a Picc line to allow for regular antibiotic treatments by a team of dedicated rapid response nurses who called daily at his home over a period of  weeks.He is also likely to require further surgery. However, thanks to the initial care of the HEMS team, the work of the Belfast Trust and follow-up surgery, Damienrsquos arm has been saved.ldquoIt has been a long journey to recovery so far, but I have been making great progress and exceeding the expectations of my medical team, Damien confirmed.ldquoEvery week there is further improvement and we are now hopeful that I will gain % mobility in my arm. I owe so much to the air ambulance HEMS team, the Ambulance Service and Royal Victoria Hospital for my initial care and treatment.Damien has also thanked staff at the Ulster Hospital and in particular Mr Harry Lewis, consultant plastic surgeon and consultant orthopaedic surgeon, Miss Denise Shirley.He continued: ldquoI firmly believe that it was their hard work and skill that has meant my story has had a more positive outcome.ldquoSince my arm has been saved I have been able toto work which is great as it was driving me mad sitting at home. The goal I am working towards now is to get as much usage back in my arm as I physically can.Damien said the air ambulance costs pound, per day to run so every penny really does go a long way to making sure this vital service can continue.He added: ldquoI was delighted when Carryduff Building Supplies nominated the Air Ambulance to benefit from its annual fundraising breakfast. Being able to raise pound, on the day was a phenomenal achievement and is the highest amount that has ever been raised at this event. We were thrilled to be able to present this to the charity.Shirley Gilliland, who owns the Carryduff firm along with her husband John added: ldquoDamien has been part of the company for over four years and as a close team we were all gutted when the accident happened.ldquoThe speed of the response of the air ambulance and the critical interventions at the scene have clearly made a dference in Damienrsquos recovery. Wersquore so grateful to have him back on the team and doing well.ldquoWhilst you take every precaution accidents can happen and we are now very much aware of the role that the air ambulance has to play in the local community, including the impact for industry related accidents.ldquoI would urge other companies to do what they can to support the service whether that is by corporate donation or fundraising..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Great grandmother’s pens new children’s novel  ","story":"A CLOUGH woman has just published her third childrenrsquos book in a series cleverly written to capture the imagination of young readers.Eighty six year-old Maureen Donnellyrsquoa book, Five Famous Dogs of Ireland, which is illustrated by Ulster artist Susan Hughes, looks at the wealth of legends and rich folklore which has almost been forgotten today.Mrs Donnelly, whose late husband, the Rev James Donnelly, was rector of Saul and Inch Parish Churches, says she got her inspiration from a picture of her great grandson, one year-old Rory Donnelly, holding on to a fluffy teddy bear in one hand and patting the familyrsquos pet dog with the other.She said: ldquoIt struck me when I saw the photo how well children and animals get along.

I loved the story so much I wrote it down back then. And Irsquom really glad I did. I came to write all the ones I could recall back then too. These tales will be sure to ignite again the imaginations of every child who reads them.No book would be complete without the tale of Setanta, the young boy who grew up to be a brave warrior. He was renowned for tackling a fierce hound with his bare hands. But feeling so bad after killing the hound, he asked the dogrsquos owner for a pup and promised he would train him up to be as good as his father.Setanta became known from that day on as Cu Chulainn mdash the Hound of Cullen.Mrs Donnelly has been instrumental in setting up a number of historical societies around Co Down.She adds: ldquoThe books are aids to help parents hand down our wealth of Irish folklore and the great legends of Ulster to another generation. So much of our heritage and culture is being lost on our young generation.ldquoThis series of books is a way for me to rescue those stories.

If we donrsquot have heroes then where do we get our inspirations from  Often our heroes are close to home, and that is true of this one.Itrsquos early summer  and an eager  year-old is anxious to know. ldquoWell, was he there  The equally eager  year-old, deciding to be a wee bit cute, replied: ldquoWho  A few playful expletives from the  year-old and the  year-old burst out laughing: ldquoAye, he was there ndash there was no county training tonight.:It was the first Town senior training session the  year-old attended. Dferent times. A  year-old nowadays would be a ball-boy at training. ldquoDid he train or was he ndash like ndash just there standing about not involved as he was on the county team A few expletives from medeclared: ldquoOf course he trained ndash hersquos Arkle the county captain, midfielder for The Town. ldquoDid he pass the ball to you and by the way hersquos a Fontenoy , the nineteen year-old declared robustly.ldquoYes he did I replied excitedly. The Town man gave me great encouragement and told me to keep coming back to training. He is our hero. Hersquos everyonersquos hero. I will come back to our nineteen-year old later.Over  Gaels from Down, all over Ireland and beyond gathered in the Slieve Donard Hotel last Friday night to honour and to pay tribute to one of Downrsquos greatest ever footballers, none other than the great Colm McAlarney.His evening started with a knock on the door at his home in the Town when club chairman, Kevin Sweeney, and event organiser Kevan Owens surprised Colm in his kitchen with those immortal words ldquotonight Colm ndash this is your le.It was filmed and the first sign of his hero status became apparent ndash total shock and his humble disbelief. Then came his sudden realisation of what the meaning of the word lsquoOmertarsquo was ndash the code of silence.He didnrsquot see it coming or expect it. Colm arrived into the Shimna Suite to a tumultuous welcome ndash the sort of welcome only heroes get, the standing ovation, the shy bow of the head and of course the irreplaceable smile.He was among friends and worshippers. He spoke to his adoring audience and we lapped up every word. He spoke of his unease at the inidual honours he achieved as Gaelic football is a team game and that he achieved much on the shoulders of giants both in size and sheer ability. They gave him the  to achieve what he did.Colm said It wasnrsquot about Colm ndash itrsquos what others did for him. The unglamorous work, the blocking, the chasing ndash all the stuff we, as footballers do.The first video, mist and rolling hills ndash the early strains from the film many years ago ndash yip local hero.We all canrsquot be wrong. Wersquore all thinking the same way. In true lsquoThis is your lersquo style our compere for the evening, the classy one and only Austin OrsquoCallaghan eased Colm into his throne.He didnrsquot sit easy. Hersquos in the spotlight. Itrsquos not like the chair at home from which he was supposed to be watching the Late Late Show . As Colm said himself, before Mickey Cole got his tuppence in, saying it was about Colmrsquos level of viewing.There was laughter from the hall. Now, like all his years on the field, he is being watched once again. The evening will unfold. There will be surprises. He will forget himself, the nervous tension will go.He will relax into the throne ndash on one which he will wear a virtual crown. There was one thing missing ndash the big red book. This was duly delivered by Colmrsquos grandchildren, Eimear and Senan adorned in the Castlewellan and Liatroim Fontenoys colours.He got his biggest hug of the night from them. They probably whispered lsquowe love you grandarsquo to him. He would have known that.And so the story of his le began and it began with family. His sisterrsquos Mary, Nuala, Una and Dympna talked warmly of their brother. They spoke of the early days in Dublin, the near emigration to Australia and ultimately theirto Liatroim.In later years one newspaper headlined ldquoColm McAlarney ndash Dublinrsquos gt to Downrsquo ndash which we all know now is so fitting and thank God for that.The next sign of the hero status revealed itself though not a sporting one. Dympna told of how as a four year-old she misbehaved at Mass. As children wersquove all got the ldquowait until I get you home remark from a parent. When she got home, Colm being the big brother. gave her a big protective hug and all was forgiven by her parents.Stories of his early playing days were laid out by his friends Tommy Armstrong, Brian Malone, Gerry and Noel McCabe.Those days as young lads where they played in a field, set up goals and the youngesttold they were in goal. The humorous story of those times set the evening up well.We also heard from Willie Doyle and Colm Shields of those days in the mid-sixties when the young Colm was starting to make his mark on the Gaelic field. And so the flow of old playing colleagues from St Patrickrsquos High School, Downpatrick, with MacRory Cup memories, Down Minors and U-s of the day.In  Colm played for Down in three Ulster finals in the space of eight days mdash for the seniors, minors and U-s. A quite unique feat and a sign that perhaps greater things would come.Another unique fact was revealed. Colm played in four consecutive minor county finals, one with Loughinisland, one with Annaclone and two with Castlewellan. The great and the good continued to file passed.They told their tales of opponent, rival, colleague and what makes the GAA tick ndash friendship. We all know the headline stories, but it will always be the anecdotal tales behind the stories which give us all the biggest chuckles.Of course there was the glory years where we had Paddy Doherty, Sean OrsquoNeill, Gerry Dougherty, Kevin McIlroy, Donagh OrsquoKane, Barney McAleenan, Liam Sloan, Peter McGinnity, Sean og McGourty, Ray Carolan to name but a few.The little story from Liam Sloan, when back in , he received a call from the Ulster Council to seea trophy Colm won the previous year could be ed to be presented to the next recipient. Liam called to Colmrsquos house where Colm went looking for it. Imagine the scene, Colmrsquos backside sticking out from under the stairs, arm reaching back with each trophy saying ldquodo you think itrsquos that one.There were video messages from Kevin Moran, the great Mick OrsquoDwyer, Sean Cavanagh, Mickey Harte and then of course there was Joe Brolly, who wants to sit down and have a pint with Colm sometime.Colm could turn his hand to any sport. Basketball was always a preferred past time. What was revealed also was when he was at St Josephrsquos Training College was how he became involved in a wee bit of boxing.When members of the Immaculata Boxing Club came over from Divis to lsquoThe Ranchrsquo Colm took up the gloves. They were impressed by his skills. They wanted him to join the sport and even came to watch him play.The young Colm simply did not have the time to fit it in. The one good thing was that, as many of you will remember boxing skills came in handy in the Gaelic football arena back then. Better with the skill than without it.I cannot tell everyonersquos tale but perhaps one of the greatest footballers of all time, the great Kerryrsquos Jack OrsquoShea, paid Colm the greatest of sporting accolades by telling everyone he modelled his game on Colmrsquos.The second Gaelic football, box to box player, learning from the first and had Colm been a Kerry man ndash well you know how many All-Ireland medals hersquod have. This comment met with huge applause and nodding approval for our hero.Another milestone in Colmrsquos illustrious career, sometimes forgotten, was his foresight back then in  to introduce Saturday morning coaching sessions in Castlewellan for potential footballers between six and eleven years of age, a true testimony this practice is still thriving within the club some thirty three years down the road, all due to Colm McAlarney.The most touching tribute of the night came from his daughter Grainne. Hersquos dad and not the hero we know.He is the hero that is her dad. It was only in her early twenties she appreciated the GAA star her dad is. Sometimes, whenever she mentioned her surname, through the medium of her work with Danske Bank, there was then the silence and the pause, then the question, ldquoAnything to Colm  which she would answer with pride and a smile ldquoyes thatrsquos my dad.Hersquos first and foremost a dad. Sitting quietly and elegantly through the evening, watching the proceedings unfold and Irsquom sure bursting with pride, was Theresa, Colmrsquos we. Along with the family she kept the secret of what was months in the making.Her smile and perhaps a quiet reflection on a sporting le which she supported all through the years deserves recognition. Though, I suspect she would be like Colm in that that recognition doesnrsquot sit easy with her either.The final video of the night was delivered to the tunes of My Way and Simply the Best. This was a reflection of a career which spanned four decades. Perhaps most poignant of moments was the final montage from the  Down Senior Championship final where we saw a very proud Michael McAlarney with his son Colm and Colm Og with the Frank OrsquoHare Cup he spoke of bursting with pride of the two men beside him.Colm did it his way, but never to the detriment of others and he is simply the best. All the guests rose to their feet, once again, when the red book was handed over. The evening wasnrsquot over yet. There was another award. One from within his own club. Castlewellan chairman Kevin Sweeney, came to the podium and announced that Colm was the worthy recipient of the Castlewellan Hall of Fame award.Some of our previous proud winners were there to see Colm presented the Johnny OrsquoNeill Trophy by Johnnyrsquos son, our vice-chairman, John OrsquoNeill. Colm is now among a special group of people within our club.Well done to Kevan Owens, Kevin Sweeney, Gerry Dougherty, Liam Sloan and Barney McAleenan. This is the team who put the night together and they deserve our praise and appreciation.So, there you have it - the word hero ndash you know by now itrsquos a big one.Kitty Kelley said that a hero is someone we can admire without apology. I use the word unashamedly. By the way, that  year-old I mentioned at the beginning was the late Gerry Rushfrom the Bann Road. He was a very proud Fontenoy, my friend and a McAlarney man.JR went to his eternal rest in October , but his spirit was there on Friday night to pay tribute to a very special local hero..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"McNamara and Murray strikes send Olympic into raptures  ","story":"TWO goals in a mesmeric three-minute first half spell proved decisive as Ballynahinch Olympic secured their place in the Christmas showpiece final against Crumlin Star.Strikes from Niall Murray and Chris McNamara had Olympic purring, but they took their foot off the gas after the break and nearly threw it all away.Orangefield huffed and puffed for most of the second half, but a determined Olympic restricted them to a solitary strike from Vitalis Ogunwa in the th minute.There wasnrsquot much to write home about in the opening exchanges, but Olympic looked the more comfortable in possession with their fluid and ambitious -- formation.Orangefield had the first shot in anger when William Gracey had a shot from the edge of the box well blocked by the impressive Chris Magee. Owen Peden then had a header blocked as Orangefield had penalty appeals for hand ball waved away.Stuart Nelson had a shot comfortably saved by Ryan Walsh as Orangefield probed for an opening, but Olympic were nor for yielding.However, the east Belfast side committed a cardinal sin by ping their guard and affording the roaming Murray and Nathan Jones far too much space and time on the ball.Jones served notice of intent in the rd minute when he was picked out totally unmarked on the right side of the box, but he contrived to screw his shot badly wide.Three minutes Ryan Molloy instigated one of Olympicrsquos trademark moves when he released Murray. Without even having to look up to see his options, Murray immediately fed Jones, but Glenn Taylor denied him with a parried save.With  minutes gone and Olympic in the middle of a power play, Jones again found space down the right and played an angled pass in behind centre half Jonathan Doey that was latched on to by Murray and he beat Taylor all ends up with a sweet strike.It was - three minutes later. A sweeping pitch- move, started out on the left by the immaculate Dalton Tate, ended with Chris McNamara, who was involved in the build-up, converting a sublime pass from Jones.Jones could easily have made it - in the st minute, but his well-struck shot was tipped round the post by Taylor. Jones then played a brilliant ball into the path of Murray, but he was denied by an alert Taylor who rushed off his line to interceptTaylor saved from McNamara at the start of the second half, but Olympic strangely retreated into a defensive shell with Jones being starved of possession and Murray and McNamara being forced to live off crumbs.It was at this stage of the game that Ryan Noade really started imposing himself on proceedings and he revelled in providing protection to his back three with numerous, telling tackles and interceptions where it mattered.Orangefield were seeing much more of the ball, but they were never able to hurt Olympic.If anything, Olympic still carried a greater goal threat with Jones having a free kick blocked and Stevie Noade flashing one wide after Jones threaded the ball into his path.Orangefield managed to reduce the arrears in the th minute when Ogunwa beat the offside trap inside the box and drilled an unstoppable effort past Ryan Walsh.Despite applying intense pressure, Orangefield never looked like equalising and with the  minutes almost up, Olympic hit them on the break only for Murray to blast wildly over the bar with only Taylor to beat.Ballynahinch Olympic: Ryan Walsh, Chris Magee, Ryan Noade, Conor Reid, Jason Noade, Dalton Tate, Stevie Noade, Niall Murray, Nathan Jones, Ryan Molloy, Chris McNamara.

The scale of the crisis is quite simply breathtaking and the figures speak for themselves.Mr Savage said an estimated , applications had been made for social housing district-wide, with almost , of applicants placed in the urgent need category.He continued: ldquoThese figures highlight the terrible extent of the housing crisis in this district. Enough is enough, it is time for us to take action and time for everyone to put their shoulder to the wheel to tackle this mounting problem.ldquoThe conference is the first step in getting sustainable solutions at a time when the people we represent cannot get a place they can call home. The Department of Communities has an obligation to come and play a lead role because it oversees the Housing Executive and needs to hear first hand the level of need in the district and work with us all to provide collaborative solutions to the problem.Cllr Savage added: ldquoWe need to explore all the options. Access to a home is a fundamental human right and we need to act swtly so the current generation is not left without a place to live.Cllr Billy Walker said all elected representatives are approached about the lack of social housing on a daily basis and that not one of the part of the district is not affected by the current crisis.ldquoWe need this conference to pull all the key players together and we must be robust with them on this issue. We need solutions going forward and this conference is the perfect opportunity to do just that, he added.Cllr Davy Hyland said the council needed to do what it could to find solutions for people in desperate need of housing, while Cllr David Taylor said a lack of resources was not helping the housing crisis which had left people on the waiting list for several years in some cases.He added: ldquoWe need a new social housing strategy and need all the key players to buy into this. We also need funding to meet the demand which exists.Cllr Andy McMurray said he was ldquoacutely aware of the trauma associated with being on the waiting list for social housing, describing the waiting list figures as ldquopretty shocking, while Cllr Jarlath Tinnelly suggested the social housing crisis ldquohas gone well beyond crisis point.Cllr Willie Clarke described Newcastle as a priority area and warned that the current social housing shortage has the potential to get worse in the months and years ahead.He said there is a particular need for accommodation for small families, highlighting the problems social housing providers face when they have to compete with private developers to secure building land.Cllr John Trainor said that while work on a major social housing scheme was underway at the old Downe Hospital site in Downpatrick, it was important to plan for the townrsquos needs over the next five to  years..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Murlough runners in full flow  ","story":"ON a wet Saturday morning, some  Murlough AC members made their way across the province to Loughgall in Co Armagh to complete the third race in Born  Runrsquos Run Forest Run series.There is no other way to describe the day other than it chucked it down, our feet were well and truly soaked before the race began.

Children who are educated together create friendships which last for the rest of their lives, she continued.ldquoWe believe that there are more opportunities for children in integrated education which can provide them with a broader experience a safe, neutral environment where people can mix with each other and help us create a genuine, shared future for everyone.Mrs McAlpine explained the aim locally is to create the new steering group to take the post-primary project forward and write to existing controlled schools to testthey would be interested in transforming to integrated status.She said this would be a ldquofundamental change which may be dficult for some, confirming that existing schools preferred to maintain the collective status quo, the Mid Down steering group would adopt a greenfield approach for a new school.ldquoNICIE will be delighted to support parents in favour of new integrated post-primary provision as in all consciousness we cannot allow the current situation to continue as it is. You have around  children not being able to secure a post-primary place in the integrated sector and I think there is something we can do to redress the imbalance, she said.ldquoWe want to provide provide a much better future for post primary integrated education in the Mid Down area and hope to form a new steering group before Christmas and then contact controlled schools in the New Year to testthey wish to transform to integrated status.ldquoI have asked the Department of Educationwould it start a site search for me and I have an idea where a new school could be located but not a specic site. We currently have an integrated school at Blackwater in Downpatrick which I believe has never had the chance to reach its full potential as its site is quite restricted.Mrs McAlpine added: ldquoI am trying to get something that will enable us,the children would like to transfer, to get everybody on the same site and we would hope to have new post-primary integrated provision in the Mid Down area by , either in an existing school or via a new-build project..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"New principal at Knockevin Special School  ","story":"THE new principal at Knockevin Special School in Downpatrick is looking forward to her new role with relish.While Sara Liddell has been acting principal since the start of the new school term, her appointment as Mrs Anne Cooperrsquos successor was only confirmedrecently and she says she is delighted to be at the helm of a school which has a special place in the heart of the community.Sara always wanted to work in special education and feels privileged to head up a school where work on a much-needed new extension is expected to start next September.The former Down High School student worked at Tor Bank Special School in Dundonald before moving to Knockevin, where she was a teacher and vice-principal for four years before taking over as principal.From Downpatrick, the new principal has a close link with Knockevin as her brother Jamie was educated at the school.ldquoI always wanted to work in special education and wanted to be here in Knockevin because it really is such a special place, said Sara. ldquoWhile I was studying at Stranmillis I did my teaching practice here which was lovely for me.ldquoThere is such warmth in the community for the school which has such a lovely, family feel about it. I obviously knew the school because Jamie came here and know how special it is. I wanted to work in special education because I saw what Jamie was able to achieve.ldquoJamie came through Knockevin and while he has his challenges, he was able to leave school and secure a job a few days a week which is great. My brother learned so much because he was educated here.ldquoThere is so much warmth about this place and I am fortunate to work with a wonderful staff team. Everyone, including pupils and families were so supportive to my family when Jamie was a pupil here. That sparked my interest in special education and was why I always wanted to work in this field, Sara explained.Knockevin is split across two sites, with an Early Years centre in Dundrum catering for  children and  pupils based in Downpatrick with a - strong teaching staff across both locations.ldquoWe are the only special school for a wide geographical area and have pupils coming from as far away as Kilkeel and Newry, with others closer to home coming from the Downpatrick, Ardglass, Strangford, Crossgar and Killinchy areas, the new principal continued.ldquoI am looking forward to my new role and already knowing the staff, pupils and families has been a big help. Knowing I have their genuine support is really wonderful.Given that it is the only special school in the local area, Knockevin is oversubscribed, with Sara explaining her appointment coincides with what she described as a ldquochallenging time.She continued: ldquoWe have a good reputation which has been enhanced with the new early years centre in Dundrum which is a real centre of excellence and we have huge numbers coming through, she continued.ldquoWe are pushed for space in Downpatrick, but Knockevin is in the school enhancement programme and work on a new extension will hopefully start next September, replacing mobile classrooms with a new permanent structure and it is a really exciting time to be part of this.Tendering documents are currently being prepared ahead of the start of building work which is expected to take  months to complete to meet what the new principal described as a ldquohuge need in the area.As Sara settles into her new role, she admits the fact she was vice-principal for four years has made the transition a smooth process.ldquoThere is so much love and warmth for the school across the community and local people are fantastic. May aim moving forward is to harness that warmth to give our pupils lots of new opportunities, she explained.ldquoWe already have a fantastic work experience programme where seniors go out and so many businesses have been so supportive. This is something I really want to build on, strengthening our school links.ldquoWe have been involved in a few projects with the Assumption Grammar in Ballynahinch and St Patrickrsquos Grammar in Downpatrick which produced benefits for everyone involved. As a former Down High student I have been able to establish a link with its student council which is really beneficial.Sara believes that linking Knockevin with other schools is important as it provides young people with an insight into what a special school is ldquodemystying the issues around it. She is also pleased her students can attend other schools to use a range of specialist facilities which provide access to art and drama, science and technology in particular.ldquoIt is amazing how other schools have opened up to us.

It was to be the Christie brothers that would come to Seafordersquos rescue as they both won their games with Peterbeating Des McAuley and Graham beating Francie McGreevyto win the match by six shots.Once again St Macartans have proved that they can hold their own against the bigger teams and will hope to carry the form into the remaining cup ties.ST MACARTANS SEAFORDE YFC THE home side continued on where they left off last week with another fine performance to give themselves a chance of progressing out of this group.The first run of games ended up shared as Niall Polley won - against Stephen Boden while Jenner McClure hit back for the visitorsagainst Andy Campbell.The next two games were also close as the home side won both through a - win for Hugh Porter over Pam Trohear and Liam Sharvin claiming a shot on the last end to win - against Liam Fitzpatrick.Only two shots separated the sides at half-time, so all still to play for.

There will also be tea and refreshments and open invitation is extended to people to attend. Organisers say the service is open to all, not just those who have a relative who took their own le.Ailish Teague, who helped establish Le Change Changes Lives with her husband, Manus, said the service will be held in the charityrsquos new home for the first time.ldquoIt is a joint service organised alongside PIPS and it will be the third we have organised. PIPS initially came up with the idea and asked could they use our new premises which we were delighted to make available, she explained.ldquoThere has been a very good response over the past two years, with the service an evening where people can join together in their grief and remember loved ones collectively. Relatives are alongside others who have experienced the same pain and there is a lot of empathy and understanding.Ailish said the service is open to people from across the district and explained that there will be an opportunity for people to place the names of their loved ones on a Christmas tree.ldquoPeople are given as much time as they need and this can, for some, be a cathartic experience. We place peoplersquos names on skeleton leaves which we make. We chose leaves to reflect how fragile le is, while some people will bring a bauble to hang on the tree which has a picture of their loves ones on it, she continued.ldquoWe will also have a bigger tree this year more as more people have been attending as suicide figures continue to rise. It is always a very emotional service and there are very few people who donrsquot know some family that has been touched by it.Ailish explained that all the names placed on the tree this year will be kept and placed alongside those gathered over the past two years with the intention of placing them in a time capsule at some point in the future which will be buried locally.She continued: ldquoChristmas is a dficult time for families and that is why we do not decorate our tree located at the front of our building which looks out on to Market Street. There is no tinsel or lights.ldquoThis time of year can be troubling for many families and we choose not to decorate our tree which is much like the empty chair in many peoplersquos homes as their loved ones are no longer here.Ailish said the tree is decorated by those who have lost their lives, not through suicide, but due to mental health problems and addictions, highlighting the importance of people recognising this.She added: ldquoIt is depression that kills, not the selfish act of an irrational mind. People think suicide is a selfish act, but it is not.ldquoWe are extending an open invitation to next Thursday eveningrsquos service and people who have lost loved ones, regardless of the reason, are welcome to join us.ldquoWe would like them to join us and place a small decoration on the Christmas tree in memory of a loved one. If they do not have a decoration, we can make one for them.

For the past few years we have been unable to tell Tourism NI or Bord Faacuteilte when our festivals were likely to take place as the local authority does not even have a calendar of events looking forward.ldquoMost festivals run at the same time each year in the Down area and it would not be a dficult task to publish a calendar that would cover a five year period to include both council tourism and community-led events.Cllr Enright believes the introduction of such a calendar would have several benefits, ensuring there would be no overlapping of festivals in the same area, allowing Tourism NI to be aware of them well in advance and local festivals and events appearing in their brochures and in tourism offices at home and abroad.Gerry Casey, from the Ardglass Festival Association, described the current funding mechanism in place for community festivals as ldquoinadequate.He continued: ldquoVillages cannot plan ahead with such short-term annualised funding. The process in the new council makes funding for these festivals precarious and uncertain from year to year and inhibits festival organisers booking in advance to get best prices or being able to secure match funding from where.ldquoThe Ardglass festival has been running for  consecutive years and been funded for  of those. Over the past two years, ours was one of the community festivals that had been unsuccessful in securing council funding.Mr Casey added: ldquoAs we approach our th anniversary, it would be a boostwe knew we had funding in good time, allowing our festival to be included in tourism brochures next year..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/17217792.whats-the-serengeti-got-that-we-havent-nothing/resources/images/9142246.jpg","title":"yacht club claim proposed new boathouse site by rnli would be a waste of donations","story":"Lough Erne Yacht Clubhas accused the RNLI of changing its mind over a proposed site for the building of a new boathouse and have claimed that the project would be a ldquowaste of donations.The LEYC has hosted the RNLI temporary boathouse on its site for the past  years but says that the proposed new site would ldquohave a detrimental effect on the club and sailing in the bay.Now, however, the RNLI has made a planning application for a new leboat station at Gublusk Bay and in a letter to members, seen by the Impartial Reporter, the LEYC has said that it will be objecting.In its letter, by Commodore John Carton, the LEYC has said that it is ldquodisappointed that the RNLI have decided to go ahead with their application to build a boathouse on the shore of Gublusk Bay.The letter goes on to say that the situation is ldquoespecially disappointing since the RNLI were originally given a site one mile away which would give them more visibility.In a statement the RNLI said: ldquoThe RNLI have submitted a planning application for the building of a new leboat station for Enniskillen RNLI, comprising a boathouse and associated facilities, including the erection of slipway, installation of holding tank, landscaping and associated site and access works on a site at Gublusk Bay. It has also argued that the current application represents the ldquobest value for money.ldquoThe RNLI applies the highest standards and practices to all its applications for its facilities. The site chosen, from what was available, is the one that represents the best location and value for money for the Institution.That assertion is one that has been challenged by the LEYC who has said in its letter to members: ldquoWe also believe that the cost of the new site will be considerably more expensive overall with higher ongoing maintenance and cost and therefore a waste of donations.The LEYC also claim that the RNLI have changed their mind over the site of its proposed new station: ldquoWhen we originally discussed the proposed site with the RNLI they told us that they preferred to build as part of a bigger development as originally it was submitted as part of a bigger development plan. They later changed this to saying that the newer site would give them more visibility and potential footfall despite it being obvious that the original site was much more public facing.The LEYC also asserts that the original site it refers to would not require as much dredging as what is being proposed by the RNLI. In its letter however the LEYC stated that ldquowe are supporters of the RNLI and any objection we have is only to the proposed siting of the boathouse and should not be interpreted as any fallout with the local volunteers who we respect and support.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Pic: Brian Lawless PA Wire“As the day of the meaningful vote in Parliament approaches, I wanted to emphasise what the deal means specically for the people of Northern Ireland,” she said.“The Northern Ireland Protocol has some important guarantees for the people in Northern Ireland.“It guarantees that even in the unlikely event that the UK’s future relationship with the EU is not in place by the end of the implementation period in December , there will be no hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland.“At the same time the protocol also contains legally binding commitments that both the UK and EU will take the necessary steps to ensure the backstop is temporary.“Importantly, the agreement upholds the Belfast Agreement in all its parts, including the consent principle over Northern Ireland’s place within our Union. It ensures people and businesses that rely on an open border between Northern Ireland and Ireland can continue living their lives and operating as they do now. It is not a threat to the integrity of the Union, or a threat to the rights people enjoy today.“In short, we have secured an outcome for Northern Ireland that avoids a hard border on the island of Ireland and a customs border down the Irish Sea.“The deal avoids Northern Ireland being in a separate customs territory to the rest of the UK, something that the EU had originally sought to impose. Instead, it achieves the maintenance of a single UK customs territory.“In line with the clear commitments we made in the December Joint Report, the UK would ensure unfettered access for NI businesses to the whole UK internal market.“The deal protects all the things we value. For all the people in Northern Ireland, this means continuing the progress over the past two decades under the Belfast Agreement, supporting our business community to thrive, ensuring a good deal for our agricultural and fishing industries and providing a safe, secure and prosperous society for future generations.“Now is the time to come together to build a brighter future for Northern Ireland.”The letter comes just one day after Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington visited North Belfast to sell the Prime Minister’s Brexit deal.Dodds: PM must stop Brexit roadshow and listen to concerns Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"The parliamentary arithmetic is still against the Government ahead of Tuesday’s withdrawal treaty vote.• Read related story - PM must stop Brexit roadshow and listen to concerns, says DoddsJPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Disclaimer  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_auto,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.newsletter.co.uk/webimage/1.8733153.1544221173!/image/image.jpg","title":"business","story":".... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from Johnston Press , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast Newsletter and agreeing to Johnston Press# Standard Terms and ConditionsWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from Johnston Press , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \" addCustomTextToCreateAccountTemplateNewslettersWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from Johnston Press , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"  \". s .  \". s  \". s  \".after+text+ .+text+ .before+text+ .after+text+  Business   Jobs Cars Homes  Directory  Announcements  Advertise My Business NewsletterRegisterLoginEdit Account\"Sign Out\" --\"    --       News Business Politics Crime Farming Education Transport Environment Health Your Say Opinion Offbeat News Politics Crime Farming Education Transport Environment Health Your Say Opinion Offbeat Sport Football Rugby Union Cricket Golf Motorcycling Boxing More Sport Whats On Music Theatre  Comedy Arts TV  Film Eating Out Lestyle Nostalgia People Family Gadgets  Tech Outdoors Travel Cars Read This           Business      Sammy Wilson: businesses fell for Brexit deal after  minutes of spinFormer finance minister Sammy Wilson has urged businesses to #sit up and take notice# of the stark warnings set out by a senior economist over the EU withdrawal deal.

There are still many issues to be sorted and we will continue to ensure that those not ing tomorrow are looked after.“We wish the staff well as the doors reopen for the first time tomorrow and I’m sure the shopping public of Belfast will give them a warm welcome back.”Yesterday, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Karen Bradley MP, met with senior management of Primark in Belfast city centre ahead of the store’s official reopening.• Read related story - Charity shop forced to close after Primark fire set to reopenJPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Disclaimer  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_auto,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.newsletter.co.uk/webimage/1.8732434.1544190778!/image/image.jpg","title":"education","story":".... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from Johnston Press , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast Newsletter and agreeing to Johnston Press# Standard Terms and ConditionsWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from Johnston Press , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \" addCustomTextToCreateAccountTemplateNewslettersWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from Johnston Press , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"  \". s .  \". s  \". s  \".after+text+ .+text+ .before+text+ .after+text+  Education   Jobs Cars Homes  Directory  Announcements  Advertise My Business NewsletterRegisterLoginEdit Account\"Sign Out\" --\"    --       News Education Politics Crime Farming Business Transport Environment Health Your Say Opinion Offbeat News Politics Crime Farming Business Transport Environment Health Your Say Opinion Offbeat Sport Football Rugby Union Cricket Golf Motorcycling Boxing More Sport Whats On Music Theatre  Comedy Arts TV  Film Eating Out Lestyle Nostalgia People Family Gadgets  Tech Outdoors Travel Cars Read This           Education       Northern Irelands first fully interactive safety educational centre.General view of the facility.

that an important segment of her sworn evidence to the RHI Inquiry is #wrong#, relating to when she was told about the belief that her Spad delayed RHI cost controls.The DUP leader’s admission comes in one of  new witness statements which the inquiry published last night ahead of its final oral hearings next week.Arlene Foster had told Stephen Nolan that she had no idea why cost controls were delayedIn October, senior Stormont civil servant Andrew McCormick told the inquiry that Mrs Foster’s account of what happened on the night of Stephen Nolan’s seminal interview with the DUP leader where she responded to Jonathan Bell’s allegations simply could not be accurate.Under pressure from the BBC man’s questioning in December , the then-First Minister told the public that she had “no idea” why cost controls on the out-of-control RHI scheme had been delayed.The inquiry has heard several pieces of evidence which show that her closest advisers – who spent hours preparing her for the huge interview – had been told by Dr McCormick of the allegation that it was her special adviserAndrew Crawford who had worked in the shadows to delay cost controls.However, Mrs Foster’s version of events – which like Dr McCormick’s evidence was given under oath – was that Dr McCormick had never said that directly to her until after the interview during a conversation which she seemed to recall clearly, describing his demeanour as “sheepish”. Her account was endorsed by DUP minister Simon Hamilton, who was also in Stormont Castle that night.However, Dr McCormick said thatthat conversation did occur it could not have been after the recording – and therefore would have to have been before Mrs Foster told the public she had “no idea” why cost controls were delayed. He set out in detail how and why he had left Stormont before the interview even began and did not speak to Mrs Foster over the following days.Now Mrs Foster has rowed back from what she told the inquiry, saying in a fresh written statement that Dr McCormick may be correct – but evenhe is, she stands over her claim at the time that she had “no idea” why cost controls were delayed. She said: “Given the febrile atmosphere...it is possible that I am wrong about the sequencing of Dr McCormick telling me his view that Dr Crawford delayed the scheme. “However, regardless of when Dr McCormick’s belief was communicated to me, I was already aware of the contents of Dr Crawford’s emails and would have taken the view that there was insufficient evidence at that time to draw any conclusions about the reasons for delay in the scheme, hence my reply to Mr Nolan that ‘I had no idea’.“I would not have voiced publicly an unsubstantiated comment of that nature.

the only child of James and Mary Millar of Aldfreck townland, Ballycarry, and she attended Mullaghmossin Public Elementary School at Magheramorne, where the principal was Mr DA Hawthorne and Miss Poag

Orange Hall ladies committee at Magheramorne for many years, helping with events such as the installation dinners of the lodge, and also a keen supporter of Magheramorne LOL , RBP  \u2028and

Among those who attended her funeral were many members of the local lodges and the Larne Black District Chapter, of which her son Arthur is Worshipful District Master.The funeral service from her son’s residence at Carrickfergus was to Raloo Presbyterian Churchyard, and was conducted at both locations by Rev Ricky Montgomery. A piper led the mourners to the graveside.Mrs Beattie was predeceased by her husband Hugh and her son Thomas, who died in .

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community.

Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home.

It is these very services that are now under threat as a direct consequence of year on year under funding.As the proposed cut to the Valersquos budget is below the  per cent threshold, the authority will not receive any further support during the settlement process, Councillor Thomas says.Councillor Thomas says the reduction of pound.million ldquoignores the impact of inflation on council budgets. He said the impact of pay inflation on the council next year will be pound.million..The Vale council is also facing unfunded cost pressures in   of pound.million due to changes in the pension scheme for teachers.Providing for growing numbers of pupils with additional learning needs, and also complying with new Welsh Government legislation, would also cost the council an extra poundmillion which is also unfunded, Councillor Thomas says.Vale councillor Bob Penrose also added that school cutbacks ldquoare inevitable.Cllr Penrose said: ldquoIn July UK Government announced a . per cent rise in teachersrsquo pay which would cover England and Wales.ldquoThis was followed by the announcement of a  per cent increase in employersrsquo contribution to teachersrsquo pensions.ldquoWhat was lacking was an explanation of how this would be paid for.The council has set out its initial budget for  , which says the authority would need to find an additional pound,, in savings next year.That would be on top of pound,, cuts which have already been planned ndash which include a one per cent funding reduction for schools across the Vale.A council tax rise of . per cent for each of the next three years had been assumed in a provisional financial plan published by the council in September. The final level of council tax is not expected to be set until early in .But the council says raising council tax would only cover a small amount of the money it needs to balance the books. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

Here Emma Deighan scours some of the top NI venues to see how they are catering to the corporate Christmas Arguably the most anticipated social event in the work diary, the Christmas ‘do’ has evolved over the years.And many of Northern Ireland’s top hosts agree and have widened their offering in response.Event managers and venue owners say everything from the format of the Christmas party to its timing have changed to accommodate the demands of employees today. How, when and where we celebrate are top priorities.Take the evening do, for example. For many, that age-old three-course setup doesn’t cut the convenience factor, prompting my employers end the work day early to take advantage of lunch dates. It’s a favourable move that delivers on two fronts – it offers time-poor workers the relief of a shorter day but doesn’t infringe on family obligations.Owner of Bishop’s Gate Hotel in Derry and former president of the Northern Ireland Hotel’s Federation, Ciaran O’Neill agrees. “Christmas has changed over the last number of years for our industry with more businesses looking for lunches, as opposed to the traditional party nights of old,” he said. “We do still have ‘big nights’, but these tend to occur on Fridays and Saturdays.”Ciaran says he has also noted an increase in smaller party sizes over the years.“We are seeing less private large events and more small groups dining with us. Employees are arranging ‘get togethers’ with colleagues or teams that they work directly with.”Bishop’s Gate, which has become Derry’s hospitality jewel attracting the AA Hotel of the Year- accolade, among many other awards, pairs an historic setting with parties for Christmas.The Bullitt Hotel in Belfast is setting the scene for the experience-savvy hipster workforce – and this Christmas Bullitt’s ‘experiences’ reflect the discernment of its guests.General manager at Bullitt, Michael Sullivan has seen a spike in ‘experience’ events, upgrading the turkey feast to a cooler, more casual event.“We have had a number of enquiries for informal gatherings in our Good Room event space, with a festive lunch to follow. The Good Room is the perfect space to blur the lines between work and play for intimate company get togethers ahead of a more traditional Christmas do,” he said.“We’ve also had enquiries for private gin and whiskey tastings and can also organise a number of unique events and team-building activities for groups, from candle-making to chunky knitting workshops for a truly memorable Christmas party.”This December Bullitt has a range of packages to suit private and shared s – from sit-down meals in its restaurant Taylor and Clay to VIP packages in its Baltic Bar or secluded enclaves above in Babel – its rooftop bar. And its ‘Tipsy Tea’ is geared towards the day-time revellers. Prices range from £. to £. a head.“Bullitt has brought something new and exciting to the traditional Christmas party market, with a range of novel spaces set within cool, contemporary surroundings. We like to think that we’re helping to shake up the scene somewhat by offering something a little dferent,” Michael said.If you want to push the boat out with your corporate squad, Titanic Belfast is ready for boarding. Its play on Belfast’s shipbuilding heritage and the fateful Titanic is always a crowd pleaser. Laura Cowan, head of sales at Titanic Belfast said: “We host bespoke private Christmas party nights, which are tailored to our clients’ needs across all of the Titanic venues – Titanic Belfast , SS Nomadic and the Titanic Exhibition Centre. “These can range from private dining, iconic tailored experiences, drinks receptions and gala dinners. We also host our traditional Christmas party nights – featuring a Christmas cocktail reception on arrival followed by a delicious four course banquet and live entertainment.”For sheer luxury, the more refined office workers take to the Cathedral Quarter in Belfast to sample the Merchant’s opulent offering.And Clare Mullin, meetings and events manager there, said the hotel’s renowned afternoon teas are bucking the turkey dinner trend but are every bit as fancul. “Over the years we have seen an increased demand for Christmas parties and festive events that offer something a little dferent, memorable or exciting. People increasingly seem to be looking for something out of the ordinary.“We have seen a trend for corporate bookings where companies are looking for alternatives to a traditional evening dinner. For example, our Festive Afternoon Tea is very popular – especially the Champagne iety. Festive drinks in our famous Cocktail Bar continue to be a popular option for the corporate market too, with bespoke offerings such as our Redbreast whiskey flight extremely popular. gtClient lunches in The Cloth Ear and Berts Jazz Bar are also growing in popularity.”Casual begins in its neighbouring Cloth Ear from £. a person, retro at Berts Jazz Bar will cost you £. for lunch or £ for dinner.For private s The Roof Garden Alpine Lodge at the Merchant can cater to  and for the more luxurious three-courses will be served in the Rita Duffy Suite for £ a person.The newly revamped and extended Ten Square is another setup that combines afternoon tea with tradition.Swapping caffeine for mulled wine and pastries for mince pies, Ten Square’s Loft, located on its top floor and flaunting some pretty impressive city centre views, plays the backdrop to this year’s festive afternoon teas at £ a head, from pm to pm.It also offers more familiar packages in its Linen Hall suite where tradition mingles with s DJs to live bands.And for those who really want to go that extra mile, Belfast’s newest Hastings sibling is ready and waiting.The Grand Central Hotel on Bedford Street boasts unrivalled views from sky-high Observatory, where afternoon tea takes on a Christmas theme or tradition can be celebrated at its Seahorse Restaurant and ground floor Grand Cafe. Allyson McKimm, events director of Hastings Hotels said expectations for hospitality environments to up their game get higher every year.She said Hastings Hotels had “reached new heights this year to keep the format fresh and exciting with new entertainment and new twists on the menus and lots of exciting extras including the traditional and limited edition Christmas ducks.”Allyson said a growing trend for lunch events inspired Europa’s ‘Christmas Caberet Lunches’ with Motown entertainment. The live tribute act theme travels across its entire portfolio. “Once again, our guests have asked usthey could continue the celebrations after Christmas once the party season is over, and to meet this demand, we have launched a whole range of tribute shows between Christmas and the New Year at all venues including ever popular All American Buffet with Elvis at the Europa, Jersey Guys, ABBA and our favourite George Michael and Robbie Williams Tribute Show at the Ballygally, Stormont and Everglades Hotels.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/john1.jpg","title":"majority of ni firms expanding workforce in ","story":"Posted on Friday  November  by John Mulgrew More Northern Ireland firms say they will take on new staff next year than compared to the UK as a whole, according to a new survey. Recruitment firm Hays says among NI-based employers, % said they expect to hire additional staff in the next year, compared to a UK average of %. That’s the highest percentage in the last five years. Meanwhile, % of firms polled said they had experienced some form of skills shortage within the past year, against a UK average of %. The survey also showed that some Northern Ireland employers are finding it harder to recruit staff, due to lower levels of unemployment leading to a rise in wages. John Moore, managing director of Hays in Northern Ireland, said: “Employers in Northern Ireland told us they are pressing ahead with business plans and are generally optimistic about the wider economic climate for the next two to five years. Recruitment expectations are at their highest levels for five years, for both temporary and permanent roles. “Increased competition for talent coupled with skills shortages has helped support above UK-average salary growth in Northern Ireland. While that is positive for those seeking new employment it also has downsides, including negative impacts on productivity, staff morale and the ability to deliver projects. “Given the intense competition and, at times, unrealistic salary requirements from candidates, it’s never been more important for employers to understand the complex factors that influence employee movement. “Salary is still a top consideration, but candidates are now influenced by other benefits, such as le balance and career progression opportunities. However, only % of employers surveyed saw work le balance as a priority, compared with % of employees.” The survey is based on responses from almost , employers and professionals working in a range of industries, including almost  in Northern Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/les_1.jpg","title":"a word from the wise les mccracken","story":"Posted on Monday  November  by Ulster Business Name: Les McCracken Position: Managing director, McCue Crafted Fit How did you get to the position you are in today I’m a big believer in work ethic. When I was young,  or so, I had a summer job on a farm. I would have milked  cows, morning and night, in addition to general duties around the farm. I was probably working  hours a week at that time, plus cycling five miles back and forth. It has stood me in good stead throughout my le. If you apply yourself, you can do anything.What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  In short, people. They are the greatest assets to a company but they can also be the biggest challenge. I’ve been fortunate enough to build a fantastic team around me at McCue but that has taken time. I’ve been here over  years and we’ve organically grown over that period from  employees and a turnover of £, to  employees and £m. It is also worth noting that in our sector there is a lack of skilled people, when you train them up some leave, which is disappointing but you have to train them and hope they stay. More must be done to engender the younger generation in to these skilled jobs. Too many are still going aimlessly in to third level education not knowing what they want to do, whereas they can earn as you learn in a trade, and that is much needed across the manufacturing sector.How would you describe your management style  I like to think I have a good management style, most of the time I’m very easy going and I do believe in autonomy. I expect those with responsibility to be capable and willing to do their job to the highest of their ability. I also have an open door policy allowing anyone to come and discuss problems but please bring with you a solution too.This allows my team to complete projects around the world from Vienna to Milan to Stockholm. We’ve been very fortunate to work with great brands, both in retail and hospitality, and on some fantastic projects from Ten Trinity Square in London to Danske Bank in Belfast and around Northern Ireland.What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  Of course, who wouldn’t say things could be done dferently, and better  Nobody is perfect, there’s always room for improvement. If I was to work until I was  years old, I would still learn something new every day.Have you done it all on your own  No, of course not. Who does  After  years I’ve a fantastic team who are very competent and trustworthy. But it has taken hard work and graft to get here. Today is very dferent to  years ago and for me I chose the right path. Today, you can enter this sector via a trade, an apprenticeship or a university background it’s about the right fit and enjoying what you do.How would you like your business to be remembered  McCue Crafted Fit is bigger than I. It’s been going for  years and providing unquestionable quality work. Like Jimmy McCue, who set this company up, when I choose to go, I hope to be remembered as a good leader who left the company in the best possible shape. Thirty years is a long time to be managing director and I have seen many changes in skill base, technology from hand drawn floor plans to full colour D fully explosive plans. It certainly has been an interesting three decades or so. I’d also like to note that McCue weathered the recession very well. I took some strategic decisions in  and , which ensured we not only held our own, but grew as a company.What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you Be patient. Time will come.

And boss Brendan Mooney says it is “disappointing” that a political argument around Brexit is “over-shadowing” the business case, which is largely supportive of the withdrawal deal currently on the table. The company, which has it headquarters in Belfast, saw adjusted pre-tax profit rising % - from £.m to £.m, in the six months to the end of September. It says much of the increase is down to the expansion of its Workday business throughout Europe. It says “to support the continued expansion with our Workday-related business, in Europe we continue to grow from our recently established offices in Frankfurt and Copenhagen, alongside our existing offices in Amsterdam and Gdansk”. “In North America we continue to expand our presence in Boston and Atlanta and we will open an office in Toronto in the next few weeks.” Brendan Mooney, the firm’s chief executive, told Ulster Business “There is no single reason or new reason .” He said the firms government commercial work was still a very strong part of the business, with a move towards digitalisation. “In Workday, as it rolls out across the world, there is great demand for the service as well. “There is underlying geographical expansion and signicant revenue outside the UK – we are seeing growth across Europe.” The company has grown its workforce to , – up again on the previous year, and has continued to grow. Of that,  workers are based at its Belfast and Londonderry offices which Brendan says “are a very important part of our business, and that trend will continue”. On Brexit, from a company perspective, Brendan says the services it provides to government are “not linked to Brexit”. “For us, it doesn’t get impacted by the Brexit direction – we are pragmatic on that. “In terms of Northern Ireland, the reality is… conversations about a political impact, they are over-shadowing what businesses are talking about and that’s disappointing.” He said looking forward at the next five years, the rise in demand for areas such as machine learning could form a much bigger part of the business.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/223.jpg","title":"lunns opening m rolex store in city","story":"Posted on Thursday  November  by Ulster Business Luxury watch and jewellery business Lunn’s is opening a new £m Rolex store in Belfast city centre.

Earlier this year, it was announced that Queen’s Arcade would undergo a major £m facelt. Peter Lunn, chairman of Lunn’s Jewellers, said the decision by Rolex to open in Belfast is “a huge endorsement for the city”. “Rolex is one of the world’s true super-brands and to have their store on Donegall Place, the city’s main retail thoroughfare, is a major expression of confidence. The store will offer customers a truly immersive experience of the brand. “We are also very excited to be opening a fully accredited Rolex workshop, which will help owners to maintain the value and ensure the quality of their watches by having them serviced by skilled technicians on site at Queen’s Arcade. It represents a big investment in Rolex parts and machinery, but we believe it is an essential part of the authentic Rolex experience.” Richard de Leyser, managing director, Rolex UK, said: “I’m delighted that Lunn’s continues to invest in our partnership and excited at the prospect of expanding the Rolex offering in Queen’s Arcade. “The plans to extend the space dedicated to Rolex and provide a new and engaging customer experience will perfectly position Lunn’s to meet the challenges of a rapidly changing retail environment. “The contemporary space will complement the historic architecture of Queen’s Arcade and provide a fitting home for Rolex.  We are proud to partner Lunn’s in this new development which will further enhance the unrivalled service to our customers in Northern Ireland.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/chamber_1.jpg","title":"outline your alternative to brexit deal says ni chamber president","story":"Posted on Thursday  November  by John Mulgrew It’s now time for political leaders opposed to a draft withdrawal agreement on Brexit to “outline alternative proposals” as an overwhelming majority of Northern Ireland’s business community back the plans, an industry leader has said. Ellvena Graham, president of the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said Prime Minister Theresa Mays deal on the table is “definitely much better than a no-deal scenario”. “After a long period of negotiation we now have a draft Withdrawal Agreement which is undoubtedly a welcome step forward for the majority of businesses in Northern Ireland,” she said. “We want the outcome that’s best for businesses, for consumers, for the economy and for the future stability of Northern Ireland – and we’ll do everything we can to ensure that we get it. “We therefore encourage our political representatives who support the draft agreement to do everything in their power to influence political representatives in Britain to join them. “For those that are not in support of the draft agreement, it is now time to outline your alternative proposals. We are willing to listen.” Ms Graham was speaking at the NI Chamber’s President’s Banquet at ICC Belfast. And as Northern Ireland approaches two years without a devolved government, she said that while there is a “vibrant and innovative business community that wants to invest and grow” that it is “stymied because of the prolonged absence of a regional government and the endless Brexit bickering”.

It really is a fascinating mix of the old and the new.“With high ceilings, exposed brick feature walls, high quality wood flooring and the strikingly restored staircase from the entrance lobby, the space reflects innovative contemporary design.”The development is guiding a rental income of £, for each floor.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/nick_web_1.jpg","title":"dale farm boss a no deal would be mad and disruptive for northern ireland","story":"Posted on Monday December  by John Mulgrew Dale Farm chief executive Nick Whelan speaks to John Mulgrew about bringing pride to the business, growing profits, facing Brexit hurdles and expanding the dairy giant’s portfolio Nick Whelan took over at the helm of Northern Ireland’s largest dairy co-operative just as the UK decided it wanted to leave the world’s largest trading bloc.Now, marking two years in the role, after replacing long-time boss David Dobbin, he says he wanted to grow earnings and profit to more than £m, while ersying into product lines with bigger margins for the some , farmers which own the operation.At the time of writing, we still haven’t agreed what arrangement will be in place to safeguard the current trading freedoms Northern Ireland producers have. A deal is on the table, though.Nick says that, aside from issues around getting staff, a transition must be in place after March  for export certicates, otherwise he can’t sell product outside the UK.“I have an ambition to get it to the mid-s . We are growing our EBITA from the £m average to about £m.”Pre-tax profits have cracked the £m mark in the last year, while turnover has soared by almost £m to £m.Nick says he turned his attention to attracting back some of the farmers which it has lost to other competitors.“At one point we had a billion litres of milk, now it’s around  million. We hadn’t been paying a particularly good milk price. “What ithad done is invested in itself quite heavily, and invested in the future, and had made a really brave strategic decision in , long before I came here, to get out of producing milk powders, and getting in to cheese and whey.“Now, that cost them £m to do that. That was really brave.“The first thing we did was get out to farmers, and explain to them what their business was.“We have paid a leading milk price, and that has brought genuine pride.“We needed to get into the business. The most fundamental change – it’s a people agenda. We were a very centralised business and all decisions came from the top, and went out.“Now, we have put the business into seven strategic business units and we are getting more adept with strategy, day-to-day, and developing people within the business to take ownership.”Nick says it’s about getting the right people into the business, and helping mentor and develop strong teams to ensure Dale Farm’s success.“We have spent a lot of money on additional people in the business. It’s not about numbers, it’s not about capacity, it’s about capability. We are really trying to find world-class people. gtHe said the firm will spend another £m on its people this year. Meanwhile, data and decision making is another area it’s expanding and developing. gt“We have a little bit of latency in the business, and I’m saying how do I get live information to those people ”That includes looking at new markets and products. Nick says the business had been focusing on the macro, and perhaps missed potential opportunities.“We have massive opportunities for growth,” he said. “The EBITA growth isn’t necessarily about growing your top-line, although it will grow a bit. We process  million litres of milk. Are you making sure you are making products which will give you the most profit from that – the answer to that is no.“We can switch categories and products, and we can make a whole lot more money with the  million litres. “It’s looking at consumer trends by getting out of commoditised type products and getting in to more value-added products. That’s about understanding your consumer.”He said the business has made “serious traction” in the last two years, as a company. As for growth in the future, with March  around the corner, Nick says it will continue “as long as there isn’t something mad and disruptive from Brexit”.“That could happen. A ‘no deal’ and no transition Brexit is mad and disruptive and changes everything. I don’t think people have really looked at it, and really understand what it means. We have looked at it, and it’s very challenging.”For Dale Farm, Nick’s Brexit concerns centre around staff and people – with around % of the workforce EU nationals.Nick says the company has struggled to get lorry drivers when milk supply is at its peak.But for Dale Farm, and other food processors, there is a concern over the certication process, following Brexit. “It’s basically an export certicate for dairy products. You are not allowed to export without this certicate,” Nick says.“For example, we have signed a quite public announcement with Lidl. We are supplying Lidl all over the world. If Lidl were to ask me in the morning, can you guarantee that you can supply my countries outside the UK on April   I actually can’t.“It’s nothing to do with tarfs or costs. If I don’t have animal health export certicates approved well-ahead of Brexit – these things take about six months to negotiate.“I’m screaming at DEFRAand DAERAhere to get this done now.”“Why don’t you agree the wording, and have the work done, so when the agreement is or isn’t made… now you can start. “It’s a huge risk for this industry here,we can’t get stuff off the island.”Around % of Northern Ireland’s dairy output goes to the EU and the rest of the world. “In milk, milk keeps flowing. We can’t say to farmers ‘we can’t sell the product, can’t get the certicates, tell the cows to take a break for a few weeks’. It doesn’t happen.“I’m going to have to reassess... ‘how long can I survive not selling my % of dairy off the island ’“If there is a no-transition no-deal Brexit it will be really bad for business. Supply chains will be severely disputed and you’ll have a shortage of products everywhere.” ■View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/sk_123.jpg","title":"more than  of business group members back brexit withdrawal deal","story":"Posted on Monday December  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s business community has overwhelming thrown its weight behind a withdrawal agreement on Brexit – with almost % of one major lobby group’s members in favour, it can be revealed.The CBI, Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce, Federation of Small Businesses and IoD are among the groups which have backed the deal on the table. Meanwhile, farming unions in Northern Ireland and throughout the UK have also issued their support for the deal.It would essentially provide a backstop, and create a deeper customs union between Northern Ireland the EU, along with a closer alignment in the single market.Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI says that the agreement is “the only show in town.”He said a poll of its members showed .% of those who replied were in support.“This is the only show in town. The rules are clear – in order for the UK to move to the most productive discussion on what the future relationship will be, we need a withdrawal agreement. The options are the agreement, or no deal,” he told Ulster Business.“Business in Northern Ireland and agri-business have made it clear that no deal is not an option.”Other business groups backing the proposed agreement include the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, Retail NI, Hospitality Ulster and the Freight Transport Association.Writing in the Belfast , Prime Minister Theresa May said Northern Ireland will thrive under the proposed Brexit deal, and its position as part of the UK “is guaranteed”.She said her agreement with Brussels “puts Northern Ireland in a fantastic position for the future”, and moved to reassure unionists that “Northern Ireland’s constitutional status as part of the United Kingdom is guaranteed.“Under this deal the future is certainly bright for Northern Ireland.”On the backstop, Ms May said three things made it “an acceptable insurance policy”.She said the transition period could be extended instead of entering the backstop, regulations would be the same across all of the UK, and Northern Ireland would not be treated dferently.Meanwhile, in a joint statement, the Ulster Farmers’ Union, NFU Scotland, NFU England and NFU Cymru, said:“The draft Brexit withdrawal agreement, while not perfect, will ensure that there are no hard barriers on the day we leave the European Union, and will allow trade in agricultural goods and UK food and drink to continue throughout the transition period largely as before. This opportunity needs to be taken.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
